Bitcoiners’ Guide To Austrian Economics – Analysis	By Per Bylund Austrian economics is a scholarly tradition that consists of a body of theory that explains how an economy works. Austrian economists develop theory a priori, meaning explanations are derived logically from sound starting points (i.e., the 'action axiom' to Mises). This means the theory is true and can therefore be used to uncover the actual causalities behind observable phenomena. Economics is, therefore, to 'Austrians' a framework for understanding what we see. Other traditions in economics rely on data to formulate theory, which means their theory is a set of corroborated hypotheses. They thus make a much weaker claim because the data analyzed are always a selection (a sample, not an entire population), the measures and metrics are not the actual concepts but mere proxies, and the theory is about correlations not causal relationships. Such theories are neither true nor universal. Because it is a priori, Austrians can rely on their economic theory as a framework to interpret and understand what is going on in the economy. This is why Austrians can say without any doubt that, for example, credit expansion—an increase of the money in circulation—will cause market prices to increase if nothing else changes. However, Austrian economic theory cannot tell how quickly this happens or what exact prices will be affected to what extent. Only that this must be so. This also means that Austrian theory is much narrower in scope than mainstream economics. Whereas the latter presumes to develop 'theory' to explain anything that is related to the data at hand, such theory can and will be debunked (falsified) whenever data are collected that point in another direction. Austrians cannot and do not go beyond what can be derived logically, which means economic theory remains true, but also cannot be used to explain specific phenomena in detail or predict precise outcome magnitudes (such as 'measured price inflation next year will be 4.6 percent'). Austrians do predict, but only using established causal relationships. Austrian theory disallows predictions that are quantitative or state exact times. The Meaning of Money As Austrian economics is theory and deductive, definitions must be clear, concise, and used consistently. It also means some phenomena that we rely on in everyday interactions that are quantitative in nature do not have unambiguous definitions. 'Money' is such a concept, which is defined as that medium of exchange that is commonly accepted (i.e., universally used). Bitcoin is certainly a medium of exchange, but many things are. Bitcoin has also become much more widely used as a medium of exchange, but it is not yet money. That 'many' stores accept Bitcoin as a means of payment is not quite enough and neither is that many of your friends accept it for paying what you owe. A money is what you can use to exchange for things without having to search for those who accept it. A money also doesn’t need to be converted to some other medium of exchange (such as dollars or euros) to buy things. It is also not any 'properties' of the thing that is a medium of exchange that makes it money. Mainstream economics confusingly teaches that money typically has certain properties such as divisibility, fungibility, and a store of value. Those are indeed common (and perhaps important) functions of the money good, but are not what makes it money. What makes something money is that it is used as a medium of exchange and that it is rather universally accepted as such. It is money’s moneyness that makes it money. Carl Menger explained what money is and where it comes from in his essay 'On the Origins of Money' from 1892. He notes that barter trade (direct exchange) is difficult and costly, which means there are great gains available from using indirect trade to exchange for what you want. If I have apples to spare and would love some oranges, whereas you have oranges but don’t want apples in exchange, then we cannot trade directly. However, if you would accept bananas and someone else has bananas and will accept apples in exchange, then I can trade my apples for bananas and then bananas for oranges—even if I have no personal use for bananas. In other words, bananas here serve as a medium of exchange. Menger notes that goods have different saleability (marketability) in the economy, which means some goods are more widely accepted in exchange (demanded) than others. It may be that pears can be used instead of bananas and that pears also are useful if I wish to trade for bread and eggs. But the sellers of bread and eggs may not accept my apples or bananas (or even oranges). This means I would be better off trading my surplus apples for pears to then exchange them for what I want. Both bananas and pears in this case are media of exchange, but pears have the greater saleability. He goes on: because pears have greater saleability, more people will trade their goods for pears and, therefore, its demand as a medium of exchange greatly increases. This, in turn, makes it even more useful as a medium of exchange. At some point, most or all people in an economy will trade goods for pears. This is when pears become money. The example may be clear, but it is ambiguous when exactly a medium of exchange becomes money. Thus far (in November 2024), Bitcoin is not generally money. But it may be money in some specific circumstances or groups. The Regression Theorem Monetary theory is not complete simply because the meaning and usefulness of money have been established, however. We must also explain the value of money. Simply put, money is worth what it can purchase, which means money has many prices (as many prices as there are goods it can be used to purchase) that change over time. The question is, where does this value as a medium of exchange come from—what determines it? Ludwig von Mises wrestled with this question and answered that people’s demand for money (meaning they are willing and able to give up goods for cash) is based on their expectations of its purchasing power. We choose to hold money because we expect to use it in exchange. We base our expectations on what it will buy in the future ('tomorrow') based on what it buys in the present ('today'). The same thing happened in the past ('yesterday'): we formed expectations about money’s purchasing power today based on what it could buy yesterday, and so on. Mises showed that this does not constitute an infinite regress but that there must logically have been a starting point—a time before the money-good was money. In the example above, I place value in bananas not because I want bananas, but because I expect to be able to use them in exchange. I speculate on the use and value of bananas as a medium of exchange and I base my hunch on what I’ve heard about (or from) the person with oranges. Because pears turn out to be even more saleable, I value them higher than bananas as a medium of exchange and, therefore, sell my apples for pears instead. When 'everybody' uses pears for exchange, they are money. And they are valued because of their expected purchasing power. By logically going back in time, we can see that pears-as-money have much greater market value than pears-as-consumption good (before it was money) because it is money—its demand is much greater because people use it as a go-to medium of exchange. How much greater? This can be answered by noting the difference between the demand (and thus market price) for pears when it is money and the demand for pears as a consumption good (when it is not money). The same is true for bananas although they never became money. Because I expected to be able to use bananas to exchange for oranges, I valued (and demanded) bananas and sold apples to acquire them (even though I did not want to consume bananas). Because bananas were a medium of exchange, market demand (and therefore price) increased. Back to Bitcoin How does this apply to Bitcoin? Theory is used to uncover and understand what is actually going on. Bitcoin is certainly a medium of exchange, but it is not yet money. Some (perhaps many) expect it to become money, and therefore acquire it. This increases its demand. Many others invest in Bitcoin as an asset, speculating that it will go up or at a minimum not lose value. This also increases its demand. But there is a difference between being in high demand and being a money: the latter implies the former, but the former does not imply the latter. High demand only means higher price, not that it is therefore generally accepted and used as a medium of exchange. Many things are in high demand, but are not therefore media of exchange, but instead used as, for example, consumption goods or assets. The former because they directly satisfy our wants and the latter because they are expected to serve as stores of value (stable or increasing). Our demand for money (cash) is neither for consumption nor as a speculative asset—it is (primarily) to be used in exchange. In other words, we demand (and acquire) money to get rid of it. It’s a means to get what we really want—it is a medium of exchange. We can apply this reasoning to 'holders' of Bitcoin, who sell their fiat currency (cash) or take out loans in it in order to acquire Bitcoin, which they then hold as an asset. Perhaps the intent is to use it in exchange when it becomes money or just to ride the tide (or bubble, depending on who you ask) to earn a speculative profit. In both cases, they do not use Bitcoin as a medium of exchange—they use the cash (dollars, euros, whatever) as a medium for acquiring Bitcoin. The decision to buy-and-hold could (and does) increase demand for Bitcoin, but the same was true for toilet paper under the pandemic. That didn’t mean toilet paper became a medium of exchange. Even if demand for toilet paper had exceeded supply to such an extent that people engaged in black-market trade for it, toilet paper still would not have been a medium of exchange—only a highly sought-after good. Certainly, high demand can lead to people using a good as a medium of exchange. But it is quite roundabout to buy-and-hold a good in order to increase its demand (and therefore market price) as a means for making it money. There are better and more effective ways. Including the obvious one: to use it in and for exchange, that is, to use it as money.

Preference Falsification And Cascade – OpEd	Tech entrepreneur Marc Andreessen posted the following: 'We are living through the most dramatic preference cascade of my life. Every day I am hearing the most amazing things.' What an unusual phrase, I thought, so I looked it up. It comes from a book written 30 years ago: Private Truths, Public Lies: The Social Consequences of Preference Falsification, by Duke University economist Timur Kuran. I downloaded and read it. It’s brilliant. It seems to explain everything. Maybe it explains too much. Regardless, Kuran has given us a language to describe a remarkable feature of our times. How is it that only a few months ago, people were afraid to wear MAGA hats and then Trump, having survived multiple assassination attempts, won not only the Electoral College but also the popular vote, sweeping the House and Senate in with him? How can it be that during this transition time, people widely assume that the president and vice president is already not Biden/Harris but Trump/Vance? How can it be that foreign leaders are making pilgrimages to Mar-a-Lago while Royals praise him as a great leader? It all changed in an instant. Or seemed to. Maybe the preference for regime change was already in the air but just not revealed. It took a fair election with secret ballots to show the truth. Kuran speaks of preference falsification, which is 'the act of misrepresenting one’s genuine wants under perceived social pressures.' It is different from self-censorship because people outright lie about what they really think. When the lie persists long enough, people begin to believe the lie and essentially live fake lives, proclaiming fealty to one idea while holding another one in their heart of hearts. He starts the book with the most mundane example of wall paint. You are invited to a friend’s house the walls of which have been repainted in fashionable starkness of which the owner is very proud. Your opinion is solicited. Instead of saying what you think, you simply go along and proclaim it to be just great. You have falsified your preferences. 'Preference falsification aims specifically at manipulating the perceptions others hold about one’s motivations or dispositions,' he writes, 'as when you complimented your host to make him think that you shared his taste.' It’s a tiny case but the problem is ubiquitous. It’s all about social pressure, peer expectations, the desire not to stick out, the drive to conform. It’s the problem of the Emperor’s New Clothes. Everyone says they are beautiful even though he is naked. The story sounds rarified but in fact it is a driving feature of current society and probably all of human history. The intriguing feature of Kuran’s book is that he is writing as an economist but rejecting the usual economist toolkit, relying instead on psychology and sociology. In this way, the book is old-fashioned such as one would read in the 18th or 19th centuries, a treatise by a learned man that draws on many disciplines, sort of like Adam Smith’s Theory of Moral Sentiments. Such books rarely garner professional praise because that is not how we 'do science' today, but they can end up sticking in popular culture. The preference falsification of the economics profession says that such books are not really economics. The author of this one rejected his own tendency to write as his profession expects and instead wrote a book of huge meaning. He closely examines the case of India’s caste system, the rise and fall of communism, and the case of affirmative action in the US. In each case, the establishment was on one side and everyone knew how to fit in and falsify preferences. In either event, public opinion was solidly on the side of the regime. But in each case, something changes and the mood changes. The hidden truth becomes exposed. The esoteric becomes exoteric. People start speaking their minds and acting according to their actual views. In each case, the regime lost control and the prevailing orthodoxy collapsed. This is what Kuran calls the moment of the preference cascade. It can happen all at once. Seemingly out of nowhere, people reject the caste system, communism, and DEI hiring, behaving as if each system was always awful and had to go immediately. A good example is the collapse of the Berlin Wall. One day it was heavily enforced, essential to national security and national identity, guarded with killer weaponry, and approved of by everyone on one side. The next day, it was like no one really cared anymore and the cars raced through and the thing was torn down while the soldiers watched and then joined in. That is a great example of falsified preferences turning suddenly to a preference cascade. We can think of this thesis as Thomas Kuhn’s Structure of Scientific Revolutions as applied in the world of social change. The cascade comes when anomalies make the orthodoxy unsustainable in polite society. There is a new scramble in pre-paradigmatic times to find a new way forward, a new operations manual for the thing in question. In the Kuhnian view, science progresses only with the funerals of the old guard but in the Kuranian view, it happens all at once because people simply decide to stop lying. The lying in this model is necessarily public and shaped by social pressure. When you go to the store, you buy only what you want or decline to buy at all. But when you are at a group banquet or at someone’s house for dinner, you are more inclined to go with the crowd. This of course is reinforced by many social psychology experiments from the 1960s which repeatedly proved the power of the crowd and peer pressure. We don’t usually think of this as applying to whole societies, much less all political systems in the world at once. But that seems to be happening. There was a headline last night that the German government had collapsed but I had to do a double take. The story could have been written about Canada, France, Spain, Brazil, Israel, and innumerable others that are quaking with pressures from within. The themes are the same: people vs. the establishment. As one must, let’s speak of the preference falsifications around Covid. A mucky cloth mask at six feet is going to stop you from getting a medically insignificant respiratory virus? Did anyone really believe this? A sterilizing shot invented in no time that had never existed for this kind of infection? Really? And there were even more absurd examples: no singing, playing instruments only in sealed tents, dousing yourself with sanitizer, banning skateboarding and surfing, quarantining on either side of the state line for two weeks, and so on. It was all outrageous and people were willing to put up with the Kabuki dance for a time. But at some uncertain point, and maybe in various iterative rounds, the people grew incredulous. Nearly five years later, we know that they were lying, as we’ve argued in great detail in a thousand articles for four years. Brownstone played a crucial role in making this happen. And then we ask that telling question: what else have they been lying about and for how long? That’s the salient issue of our time. The desire to pretend to believe seems to have been shattered. Falsification has turned to a truth cascade, one that might just barely have started and certainly has an uncertain end. This is why Kuran’s book is newly in play. I highly recommend it, and further recommend other books in this genre, including Mattias Desmet’s Psychology of Totalitarianism. These books help us understand ourselves and our times, turning seemingly random and mysterious phenomena into recognizable patterns, allowing us to see world events with more clarity than before. May the preference cascade continue until all that is worth knowing is known.

Preparing For China’s Future Economic Challenges – Analysis	By Wei Hongxu China’s recent Central Economic Work Conference, when discussing the current economic situation, expressed the view that, on one hand, this year's social and economic development goals can be successfully achieved; on the other hand, it also issued a warning about the severity of the current economic situation. The conference pointed out that the adverse impacts of changes in the external environment have deepened, and the country's economic operations still face many difficulties and challenges. These include insufficient domestic demand, production and operational difficulties faced by some enterprises, pressure on employment and income growth for the public, and numerous risks. Considering the current economic performance and the conference's assessment of the situation of 2025, researchers at ANBOUND believe that even with further strengthening of macroeconomic policies, the economic outlook for next year remains far from optimistic. When compared to last year's Economic Work Conference's description of the situation, this year's meeting mentioned that the impact of external changes has deepened further, creating additional pressure on external demand and casting a shadow over economic growth, which has led to a greater emphasis on 'domestic circulation' where the focus is on the issue of insufficient demand. However, the negative consequences caused by the imbalance between the supply and demand sides have further intensified. From last year's 'local imbalances in supply-side capacity' to this year's 'production and operational difficulties faced by some enterprises', and from last year's 'unstable expectations' to this year's 'pressure on employment and income growth for the public', these developments reflect the further evolution of the three major issues of 'demand, supply, and expectations' that were discussed last year. These issues are now affecting business operations and residents' employment, and the 'unstable expectations' around income have turned into the reality of 'income growth pressure'. In the view of researchers at ANBOUND, the decline in corporate and household income, i.e., profits and wages, is the root cause of insufficient demand. It shows that the economic situation is deteriorating further, making the problem of insufficient demand even more prominent. Moreover, although supply-side issues are no longer as prominent, they have not disappeared. The conference mentioned that the 'incremental policies by the Central Politburo meeting on September 26 effectively boosted public confidence and led to a clear economic rebound'. This means that the current economic stability and the achievement of this year's economic and social development goals are also the result of strengthened policies, rather than the result of enhanced internal economic momentum. Such economic stability and sustainability face significant challenges. It appears that the Central Economic Work Conference has identified expanding domestic demand as the focus of macroeconomic policy support for the economy next year. However, as researchers at ANBOUND previously warned, although the intensity of macroeconomic policies may reach an 'unprecedented' level, the economic situation is not exactly optimistic. In the face of increased downward pressure on the economy, the strengthening of policy drive aims to support the economic downturn caused by insufficient internal economic momentum, rather than stimulate a rebound in economic growth. In the absence of internal economic momentum, economic growth can only come from the strengthening of policy-driven efforts. In fact, looking at the economic goals set for 2025 in the meeting, last year's goal of 'promoting sustained economic recovery' has now been shifted to 'maintaining stable economic growth'. Even with 'unprecedented' macroeconomic policy strength, the economic growth target has been set only as 'stable', emphasizing the stability of employment and prices. This suggests the lack of internal economic momentum will become more severe next year. It is worth noting that this year's conference specifically mentioned, in terms of policy scale, the deepening of the understanding of the regularity of economic work. This is a reminder that the current downward trend in the economy is part of the cyclical development of the economy, and counter-cyclical policies may not be sufficient to reverse the trend in economic operations. Although policy has identified 'consumption' as the primary focus for next year, from the demand side, next year's 'three pillars' of growth will be reduced to just one, i.e., consumption. The 'three pillars' here refer to the three main drivers of economic growth, namely consumption, investment, and exports. This year’s meeting set the target for external demand as 'maintaining a basic balance in international payments'. This means that, due to increasing external pressures, foreign trade and foreign investment will no longer be expected to contribute to economic growth through a 'surplus'. Instead, the focus has shifted to achieving 'balance'. This implies that economic growth will have to rely solely on domestic demand, and as long as external demand does not drag the economy down, the target will have been met. In terms of domestic demand, next year’s focus in investment will be on improving efficiency, which naturally limits the extent of investment expansion. This creates a clear distinction between next year’s macroeconomic policy and the 'easing policies' of 2008, which were primarily centered around expanding infrastructure investment. After years of active fiscal policies, the returns and efficiency of government investment have significantly decreased. Further stimulating investment in the future is likely to result in more debt and additional ineffective assets, which will not contribute much to economic growth. If under conditions where external demand not dragging down economic growth and limited contributions from investment, the only remaining space to support economic growth lies in consumer demand. This time, more resources will be directed towards stimulating consumption, primarily through increasing consumption subsidies, raising the income of the mid- and low-income groups, and improving social security with the objective of enhancing consumption capacity. The effects of these policies are unlikely to be as direct as those of expanding government investment, but they will improve the way the government participates in economic activities and push the economic demand structure further toward consumption. Therefore, stimulating consumption is more likely to lead to a change in the demand structure, and its contribution to overall demand growth is likely to be limited. Although the Central Economic Work Conference has made stimulating consumption and expanding domestic demand a key priority for next year, the expansion of domestic circulation will require time. Relying solely on stimulating consumption as the leading driver will lead to short-term boosts, but in the mid-and long-term, it will still be a gradual improvement process. Despite the significant external pressures, ANBOUND’s founder Kung Chan pointed out that policies should maintain a balance between both domestic and external circulations. Over-relying on domestic circulation is not advisable; the balance among the 'three pillars' should be preserved. In the context of unstable incomes and difficult business operations, domestic circulation cannot bear the full weight of economic growth in the short term. If external circulation is abandoned too easily, it could quickly lead China's economy into an imbalanced state. In the economic principle, when structural changes occur in the long-term factors affecting economic growth, the phase of rapid domestic economic growth has already passed. Future economic growth will face more structural challenges, requiring improvements in efficiency and the development of new productive forces to achieve high-quality growth. Therefore, fully expanding domestic demand is not solely focused on the demand side in policy, but still requires efforts on both the supply and demand sides, with the emphasis on stimulating demand. Although this year’s conference did not specifically mention supply-side structural reform, the repeated references to 'coordination' implicitly suggest that, under the policy of expanding domestic demand, supply-side reforms must continue to be advanced to achieve a balance between total supply and total demand. At the same time, the new policy has shifted in its approach, particularly in renewing old growth drivers and revitalizing existing resources, replacing capacity reduction with capacity optimization. It also continues to focus on risk prevention policies, highlighting the need for the real estate sector to halt the decline, give attention to its stabilization, and establish a new model for real estate development. These measures reflect the balance between supply-side adjustments and demand-side expansion. In this regard, the policy to expand domestic demand outlined in the Central Economic Work Conference still differs to some extent from the strengthening of counter-cyclical adjustments mentioned in the previous Politburo meeting. The issues on both the supply and demand sides also suggest that the current complexity of the economy cannot be solved merely by artificially expanding domestic demand. This further indicates that, even with unprecedented counter-cyclical efforts on the demand side, the overall economic recovery may not rebound quickly. Instead, it is more likely to slow the pace of decline and help the economy stabilize more swiftly. Achieving the goal of stable economic growth next year will require increased policy efforts, but in the long-term, this may become increasingly difficult. Final analysis conclusion: For China, while further easing of macroeconomic policies is positive news for stabilizing the economy, the weaker the internal economic momentum, the more these policy efforts serve to prevent a sharp downturn rather than stimulate growth. The complexity of economic laws and the current economic situation suggests that the long-term downward trend in the country will be difficult to reverse quickly. Therefore, decision-makers and policy implementers of the market will need to have a more rational understanding and realistic expectations of the economic challenges ahead, while maintaining a proper balance between 'stability' and 'progress', as well as between domestic and external circulations.

Telegram, Crypto And Corruption: The Ukrainian Men Fleeing The Mi...	Angry at a corrupt, coercive system of military conscription, or simply unwilling to fight, many Ukrainian men are paying their way past a ban on leaving their homeland, slipping into Moldova, Romania, Poland and Hungary. By Gabriel Bejan, Oxana Bodnar, Claudia Ciobanu, Zsófia Fülöp, Sofie Kochmar and Valentina Nicolae-Gesellmann Andriy paid the smugglers in cryptocurrency and received instructions via Telegram. But in the end it was a plain old ladder that got him over the border between his native Ukraine and the breakaway Moldovan region of Transnistria. 'I don’t know where we crossed the border because our phones were turned off,' the 22-year-old said from Germany, speaking on condition his real name not be used. Two men were waiting on the other side and passed him a ladder, marking the climax of his flight from Ukraine. A student of Kyiv’s College of Communications when Russia launched its full-scale invasion in February 2022, Andriy had always hoped to continue his studies abroad. He supported Ukraine’s resistance by working as a volunteer with refugees in the western city of Lviv and was part of the youth movement of President Volodymyr Zelensky’s party, but had grown increasingly worried at the prospect of being called up to fight. At the end of last year, Ukraine’s parliament began debating whether to cut the age of conscription from 27 to 25, a proposal that eventually became law the following April. All males between the ages of 18 and 60 were already prohibited from leaving the country and from January, all 18 to 25-year-olds will be obliged to undergo military training. By February, Andriy felt like a noose was tightening around him, a feeling reinforced by claims on social media about forced conscription and violence by local recruitment centres known as TCKs. 'I began to understand I must run from Ukraine,' he said, speaking in English. For this investigation, by BIRN in partnership with HotNews, eight Ukrainian men of or near recruitment age were interviewed over a period of several months. All of them fled their homeland with the help of smugglers to escape mobilisation. Andriy was one of them. They spoke of hours of online research, of Telegram channels and mystery middlemen, of smugglers paid in cryptocurrency. In Andriy’s case, it cost him $4,500 – $1,000 up front and the rest the moment he entered Transnistria, a mainly pro-Russian region of Moldova that broke away from the Chisinau government’s control in the early 1990s and where Russia has a military presence. When it’s all over, those who flee face being denounced back home as traitors, pawns of Russia’s war propaganda machine. Indeed, a Ukrainian information security expert and former official in the Ministry of Information Policy said Russia was behind at least some of the Telegram channels and Facebook pages offering instructions on how to leave Ukraine to avoid being sent to fight. 'When you find such an advertisement on Facebook, behind it may be a real smuggler who really wants to make money, but it may also be someone from the Russian intelligence services, from Transnistria or even from Russia,' he told BIRN on condition of anonymity. Russia’s goal, he said, is 'to tell Ukrainian men, through Telegram channels and any other social media, that the process of mobilisation amounts to death'. Interrogation by agents Ukraine says that some 43,000 of its soldiers have been killed since February 2022. The West says Russia has lost far more, with Britain estimating that an average of 1,523 Russian soldiers are being killed or wounded every day. Those determined not to be called up often turn to smugglers. Andriy, who is from Kyiv, made his first attempt in late February, two years into a war that shows no sign of abating. He and four other people were caught, however, by Ukrainian border police in the region of Odesa. They were kept overnight. 'The next morning, they gave me back my phone, handed me a summons to the military enlistment office in Kyiv and told me that there would be a court case,' he said. Andriy was fined 8,500 Ukrainian hryvnia, roughly 200 euros. But he didn’t stick around for enlistment. He called the smugglers, referred to locally as ‘organisers’. They told him to return to Odesa, a Black Sea port city in the southwestern corner of Ukraine near the border with Moldova. The next day, Andriy received a location pin on Telegram and called a taxi to take him there. When he arrived, the driver told him to walk straight ahead. He reached the border with Transnistria, where the ladder was waiting. It didn’t take long before he and his group were intercepted again, this time by Transnistrian border guards. Instructed to hand over his personal belongings and the password to his mobile phone, Andriy was placed in a cell he said was roughly 10 square metres in size. With as many as 20 other men already inside, it was standing room only. Andriy said they discussed the situation and compared the prices they had paid the smugglers. Andriy spent the night in another police station, where he had more room, and the next day he was interrogated by agents he believes were members of the Russian intelligence service, the FSB. 'Nobody said directly that it was the FSB; they were called ‘investigators’, but they didn’t belong to the border guard,' Andriy said. He also noted the ‘clean’ Russian they spoke, which suggested they were from Russia itself, and the fact they wore civilian clothes, unlike all the other officials who were in uniform. 'They asked me who I am, where I come from, where I studied, where I lived, where my parents live, my education, my opinion about the situation in Ukraine, why I wanted to flee Ukraine.' 'They placed particular emphasis on questions about the Ukrainian armed forces, on whether I know anything about air defence systems, military technology or whether I know anyone in the military.' Interrogation over, Andriy was released and picked up by the smugglers. They drove him to the central bus station in Transnistria’s main city, Tiraspol, and gave him money to buy a ticket to the Moldovan capital, Chisinau. 'The Transnistrian border officer checked my documents and gave them back,' he said. 'The Moldovan officer didn’t check them.' In Chisinau, Andriy was taken to a private, downtown apartment rented by the smugglers for those who had paid extra, 'so that we could rest a bit'. Crypto or cash Andriy had done his homework, mostly on Telegram. 'I searched for providers of these services, their prices, chances of success and reviews,' he said. 'I asked the same people with different accounts about the entire process of crossing the border, looking for inconsistencies and lies.' He only came across one route: Odesa-Transnistria-Chisinau. And he said he thinks there is only one organisation behind the smuggling. 'I think it’s a mafia,' he said. Andriy’s account fits with the findings of an official investigation by prosecutors in Moldova. 'Ukrainian citizens are contacting the organisers of illegal migration networks on specific Telegram channels,' the Office against Organised Crime and Special Cases in Chisinau told BIRN. 'Afterwards, they are paying in cryptocurrency, because it’s harder for investigators to track the money, or by cash. After paying they receive instructions, also on Telegram, about the itinerary for the crossing of the border and where they will meet the person who will take them to the border with the Republic of Moldova.' The prosecution said it is investigating 120 separate cases of illegal border crossings by Ukrainian citizens between February 2022 and August 2024, and that 45 alleged smugglers had been taken to court in that period, both Ukrainian and Moldovan citizens, for smuggling some 60 Ukrainians into Moldova. 'Most of them are men capable of fighting, in the context of the ban they have on leaving Ukraine,' the Office against Organised Crime and Special Cases said. Classified as victims of organised illegal migration, most apply for asylum and do not face prosecution, it added. Moldova’s Border Police Inspectorate said it has 41 criminal cases open involving border police officers accused of complicity in illegal migration between 2022 and 2024. Besides via Transnistria, the Inspectorate said Ukrainians also entered Moldova by swimming across the Dniester River; others, it said, try to enter hidden inside cars, buses or lorries, or using false IDs. The fact that military-age males are fleeing the country is not just bad for Ukraine’s military effort. It’s bad PR too. The authorities have sought to pin the blame on Russia, accusing Moscow of playing mind games with young Ukrainian men. The former official of the Ministry of Information Policy said Russian-orchestrated Telegram channels were exaggerating the Ukrainian casualty figures and pretending to help people avoid the mobilisation patrols that comb Ukrainian cities for military-age males. 'The channels basically teach people how to avoid these patrols,' he said. 'But it is not necessary for the Russians to know exactly where these patrols are. They even communicate fake locations. Ukrainian men can see sponsored pages on Facebook that claim to teach them how to exit the country legally. These pages also include links to specific Telegram channels'. It’s on these channels, he said, that unidentified individuals supply information on the itinerary, the price, how to pay and where to go. He said Ukrainian authorities had reported the Facebook pages to the social media site’s owner, Meta, for removal – but without success. Telegram, which was founded in Russia, never responds, the former official added. ‘The whole bus was illegal’ In Chisinau, Andriy bought a bus ticket to the city of Iasi, just over the border in eastern Romania. At the border, he said, the driver asked the passengers, 'Who’s illegal?' 'The whole bus was illegal,' Andriy said. 'So we were dropped off, our passports were taken away, we went to the building of the Moldovan Border Guard Service, and there we were called by name, in groups, for interrogation.' He said the atmosphere was tense, that the Moldovan border guard was angry and demanded he write in Russian. The guards asked how he had entered Moldova and checked his phone for the contacts of the smugglers. But Andriy’s ‘organisers’ had told him to delete their contacts and any trace of communication, and to lie about how he crossed the border. 'I told the Moldovan officers that I crossed the border in a random taxi, at a random time, between a Ukrainian village and a Moldovan one,' he said. He also told them he paid a villager $100 to drive him to Chisinau. 'It’s funny,' said Andriy. 'A bus full of Ukrainians telling the same lie about crossing the border without intermediaries, about the taxi, the $100 and so on.' 'They know we have ‘organisers’,' he added, 'but if they can’t find the contacts or messages they can’t do anything about it. They can just stamp your passport and send you on your way.' Andriy crossed the border on a bus bound for the port city of Hamburg, northern Germany. The bus went straight through Romania, but for some young Ukrainian men, Romania – not Moldova – is their first target. The choice can be fatal. Between February 2022 and October 2024, according to Romanian border police, 25 Ukrainians died trying to cross the border between Ukraine and Romania. Fifteen of them drowned in the Tisza river; the rest died in falls or of hypothermia in the mountains of Maramures. Mountain rescuers in Maramures said those who try to cross the mountains are rarely equipped for the unforgiving conditions. Since Russia’s full-scale invasion, 18,300 Ukrainian citizens have crossed illegally over Romania’s northern border; that includes 10,000 in 2024, as of October 16. On surrendering to Romanian border police, they receive temporary protection and are free to go anywhere in the European Union. Through the fields Andriy’s bus reached the Hungarian border at night, when he was woken by the driver instructing the passengers to prepare their passports. He crossed without question, entering eastern Hungary via Hajdu-Bihar. Further north, in Nyirbator, social worker Eva Adoba said she had seen many Ukrainian men arrive through the surrounding fields, muddy and wet, sometimes without shoes. Nyirbator is about 80 kilometres from the border between Ukraine and Hungary. None of them want to stay, said Adoba, who works for an NGO helping migrants and refugees. 'I’ve never met a single Ukrainian man who wanted to stay in Hungary. They are on their way to Germany, Spain, Portugal, even Canada,' she said. 'When I tell them I am from Transcarpathia [western Ukraine] and I speak Ukrainian with them, they trust me more,' said Adoba. 'Sometimes they tell me that they came from Kharkiv, Mykolaiv or Odesa, and their journey lasted a couple of weeks or even months. Sometimes they must hide for weeks in Transcarpathian villages to attempt to cross the border. But sometimes they don’t want to say a word about their route. They are highly traumatised.' 'They are told to wear waterproof clothing and shoes two sizes smaller than their feet, so they don’t get stuck in the mud. Yet, I met men who lost all their belongings in waist-deep water, except for their phones and the money they were carrying around their necks.' Ukrainians welcomed According to EU data, as of the end of September 2024, EU member states had granted temporary protection to more than 4.1 million Ukrainians, just over 37,000 of them in Hungary. The status, currently valid until March 2025 but almost certain to be extended, entitles Ukrainians to a residence permit and access to education, healthcare and employment. Of the more than 37,000 in Hungary, 5,241 were men between the ages of 18 and 65, according to data from the Hungarian Central Statistical Office. The language barrier and general anti-immigration sentiment means Hungary is not the most attractive destination for Ukrainians, but the welcome they receive contrasts strongly with the abuse and rejection that frequently awaits migrants and refugees from Asia, Africa and the Middle East who cross Hungary’s southern border with Serbia. 'When men fleeing from Ukraine to Hungary meet the police or border guards, they are picked up, taken to an immigration office where they are given papers, dry clothes, food and water if necessary, and then they are free to go,' said Adoba. Hungary even said this year it would consider Ukrainian passports that have expired during the war valid within Hungary when it comes to sorting out a person’s status and helping them find work. Hungary also offers very good road and rail links with western Europe. An EU legal expert, who declined to be named, told BIRN: 'Hungary, Poland and Romania abide by the rules and don’t distinguish between people fleeing Ukraine, even if they are men of military age.' Neither the EU expert nor Adoba said they had ever heard of Ukrainians being ‘pushed back’ over the border. Ukraine vows to ‘humanise’ conscription Andriy’s bus ride to Germany took him through the Czech Republic, where he recalled paying $150 for the petrol with his Ukrainian bank card because he had been unable to withdraw money from an ATM to pay for the ticket. In Germany, he applied for a temporary residence permit and signed up for language classes. He plans to enroll in university. He is far from alone. According to the Central Register of Foreigners, as of October 12 there were just over 1.2 million Ukrainian refugees in Germany. Around a million of them have residence permits, the right to work and apply for welfare benefits. Roughly 37 per cent of them are men, 260,000 of them of military age. Andriy remains active on Telegram and TikTok, keeping in touch with his peers, discussing alleged abuses by Ukrainian authorities, and strategies for escape. Thirty-one-year-old Sergey Khorolsky, a TikTok blogger, is one of the most vocal critics of Ukraine’s conscription strategy and the exit ban on men aged 18-60. Having escaped through the Dniester river to Moldova, Khorolsky began organising protests in Berlin this autumn. Like-minded activists have sought to do the same in Dublin. Of the latest demonstration on November 17, Khorolsky said: 'This time, we wanted to draw attention to the fate of men who died after being detained by the recruitment commissions in Ukraine.' 'We held up their photos, so they are not forgotten.' At roughly the same time, media affiliated with the Ukrainian defence ministry branded the protesters as Russian stooges, and urged Ukrainians not to take part. But Khorolsky and other protesters in Berlin denied having anything to do with Russian intelligence agencies or of serving Russian interests. They all said they had given money to the Ukrainian war effort but criticised what they claimed was violence used by army recruiters. Khorolsky said he had evidence that seven men had died while being forcibly conscripted by the Ukrainian military recruitment centres, the TCKs. Media reports in Ukraine say three of the seven cases are under investigation. Responding to widespread criticism of the TCKs’ tactics, Ukrainian Defence Minister Rustem Umerov said in November that the government was working to 'humanise the mobilisation process'. Umerov told reporters he hoped the digitalisation of the recruitment system would minimise incidents in which men are picked up in the street and, in general, 'help move away from these painful issues for the population'. The defence ministry did not respond to a request for comment on this story. Fake passes and ‘friendly’ guards Konstantin [not his real name] follows Khorolsky on social media and shares his grievances. 'It took me three minutes to exit Ukraine into Poland, no questions asked,' said the 22-year-old. He left in June this year. 'I didn’t even have to wait in line with the other people. When I was a few kilometres from the border, I received a call from the border guards, who explained which way I had to go. I drove into Poland in the lane used by diplomats.' The deluxe treatment did not come cheap. Konstantin said he paid $12,000, a figure well out of reach for most Ukrainian men trying to leave. As a professional sportsman, Konstantin said he had been making good money for years. He also knew whom to pay: the head of a local NGO, who arranged a one-month pass for him to leave the country as a volunteer for the organisation ostensibly to work ‘in the interests’ of the Ukrainian army. A part of the fee was passed to ‘friendly’ border guards, who waved Konstantin through. The one-month pass expired, but Konstantin never returned. The newspapers might be full of stories about Ukrainians perishing in the Carpathian Mountains or swimming across the Tisza, but many more slip unnoticed into Poland having bribed their way to false papers. 'It’s the Ukrainian men that have enough money to pay a bribe that usually come to Poland,' said Jakub Ber, who spoke in September when he was working at the Centre for Eastern Studies, OSW, a Warsaw-based, state-funded think-tank, and is now an independent expert. Geography plays a part, Ber said. For the most part, the border region between Poland and Ukraine is flat, making it easy for border guards to spot anyone trying to cross illegally. That makes smuggling difficult. Any military-age man trying to cross must do so ‘legally’ – with a document obtained in Ukraine granting him a temporary pass to leave. A number of other Ukrainians offered similar accounts. In Germany, a Ukrainian woman said she and her boyfriend had used their entire savings to pay $7,000 for a fake disability document that exempted him from the exit ban, allowing him to cross into Poland in late 2023. The woman, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said they were told precisely when to cross, in order to encounter ‘friendly’ border guards. All the communication went through Telegram and they never met the intermediary in person. 'My boyfriend rode to the border in an informal ‘taxi’, the system we use here: it’s basically women making an income out of driving people to the border; they have nothing to do with illegal crossings,' said the woman, a 30-year-old IT worker. 'But we had to give the licence plate number to our intermediary, so that he could pass it to the border guards.' Like others who eventually fled, the woman said they had originally volunteered for the Ukrainian war effort, but became disillusioned by the sight of young men being sent into battle unprepared, having to buy their own gear. The man increasingly confined himself to their apartment, frightened at the prospect of being made to fight. Konstantin too said that, in the beginning, he had travelled to Western Europe to buy prosthetic limbs for children wounded by Russian missiles and even a Starlink satellite for the army. He did so by paying the same NGO $3,000 for a pass to get out. 'It’s crazy,' he said. 'You have to pay in order to volunteer.' But he admitted, 'Many of us also used those volunteering trips to get a break from the stress of living in a war-torn country'. In autumn 2023, Konstantin received a health assessment from a state medical commission, believing he could avoid conscription on the grounds that he had heart problems and high blood pressure. 'Despite my medical issues, which are real and well-documented by doctors, the guy in the commission told me he will declare me fit to fight unless I pay him $20,000,' he said. Konstantin refused. 'In Ukraine, if you are rich, you can buy yourself a lifetime exemption from the army,' he said. 'Completely healthy politicians turn out to be ‘unfit’ to serve, while thousands of normal men with health issues end up on the battlefield.' Poland’s economic incentive to turn a blind eye According to data from the Polish Interior Ministry, as of September this year over 167,000 Ukrainian men aged 18 to 60 had received protection in Poland since February 2022. Earlier this year, Ukraine suspended consular services for men abroad, as a way of forcing them to sign up to the military database. Poland, a staunch ally of Ukraine in the war against Russian invaders, declared its readiness to help Ukraine get men living abroad to return and join the fight. 'I think many Poles are outraged when they see Ukrainian men in hotels and cafes, and they hear how much effort we have to make to help Ukraine,' said Polish Defence Minister Wladyslaw Kosinian-Kamysz, in remarks that would have sent a chill down the spines of many Ukrainian men in Poland. For years before the war, hundreds of thousands of Ukrainian men had moved to Poland in search of work. Despite the defence minister’s comments, Miroslaw Skorka, head of the Ukrainians’ Union in Poland, said Warsaw could ill afford to send them back. 'Those may be the statements of politicians, but employers’ associations in Poland are begging for workers,' said Skorka. 'The Polish labour market had no problem absorbing the hundreds of thousands of Ukrainians who came since the full-scale war started, and it needs more.' The benefit to the Polish economy is clear. In 2023, Bartosz Marczuk, the head of the Polish Development Fund, calculated that Ukrainian refugees would pay more into the state budget than Poland spent on aid for them by the end of that year. That’s a big reason not to make a fuss about military-age men avoiding the draft. 'Our authorities never say anything about it,' said independent Polish expert Ber. 'This topic doesn’t exist in Polish public discourse.'	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWet_9MfW6XVCWNJ3VIbb4xz	2024-12-18T17:09:56-08:00	
Why Liberals Will Give Two Cheers For Trump – OpEd	Liberals hate Trump, no question about it. He’s the definition of illiberal: authoritarian, racist, sexist, and downright nasty. Not only that, he’s a living repudiation of the liberal delusion that America runs on meritocracy. But you want to know a dirty, little secret? In back alleys, encrypted group chats, and off-the-record conversations, liberals will still support Trump on a case-by-case basis. Of course, they’d never vote for the guy, but they’ll give two cheers for some of his policies. I discovered this ugly truth during Trump’s last term while writing an article on the shift in U.S. policy toward China from lukewarm engagement to hostile decoupling. The general consensus among the foreign policy elite was that, at least in terms of relations with Beijing, Trump was a useful idiot for slowing China’s roll with harsh rhetoric and tariffs. 'Trump is a madman, but I want to give him and his administration their due,' one prominent liberal intellectual told me. 'We can’t keep playing on an unlevel playing field and take promises that are never delivered on. It’s really China’s turn to respond, and it’s long overdue.' It wasn’t just China. For years, liberals and conservatives alike were, for instance, pushing the concept of burden-sharing: getting U.S. allies to cover more of the bill for their security needs. But it was only Trump who really made it happen by blackmailing NATO members and other U.S. partners into doing so. Sure, few warmed to the idea of the United States actually pulling out of NATO, but even many of our European allies, though they publicly grumbled, were secretly happy about The Donald’s gaiatsu. That’s the Japanese word for outside pressure that enables a leader to force through unpopular changes by blaming it all on foreigners. The self-described liberal leader of NATO, Dutch politician Mark Rutte, even came out in the open after Trump’s reelection to praise the American president for making European countries more militarily self-sufficient. It wasn’t just liberals who thrilled to Trump’s unorthodox foreign policy during his first term either. Some of those further to the left also embraced Trump the engager (with North Korea’s Kim Jong-un), Trump the isolationist (and his threats to close U.S. military bases globally), and Trump the putative peacemaker (for concluding a deal with the Taliban to end the U.S. military presence in Afghanistan). Trump, in other words, was not just an unanticipated crisis; he was also an opportunity. Deep in their hearts, anyone unhappy with the status quo will support a disrupter. Quite a few Democrats disgusted with this country’s border policies, inflation, and its coastal elites even crossed over to vote for Trump in November because they wanted change, regardless of the consequences. Trump 2.0 is going to be the same but worse, like a strong cheese voted out of the refrigerator only to grow ever more pungent as it moldered in a dark corner of Florida. The latest version of Trump has promised more violence and destruction the second time around, from mass deportations to mass tariffs. And he’s planning to avoid appointing anyone to his administration who might have a contrary thought, a backbone to resist him, or the least qualification to enact sensible policy. In the face of such a vengeful and truculent force returning to the White House, surely, you might think, it will be impossible to find any liberals embracing such anarchy the second time around. Think again. This is how American politics works, if only for liberals. The modern Republican Party routinely boycotts Democratic administrations: blocking Merrick Garland’s Supreme Court nomination, working overtime to shut down the federal government, voting en masse against legislation it would have supported if introduced by a Republican administration. The MAGA crowd has, in fact, turned noncooperation into something of an art form. Liberals, on the other hand, pride themselves on bipartisanship, on getting things done no matter who’s in power. So, inevitably, there will be cooperation with the Trump team as it sets about the 'deconstruction of the administrative state' (as Trump cheerleader Steve Bannon once put it). Worse, there will even be some silver-lining liberals (and a few leftists) who pull up a seat to applaud the wrecking ball — not perhaps for its wholesale destruction of neighborhoods but at least for its demolition of a select number of buildings that they deem irreparable. Each time such destruction takes place, the self-exculpatory comment from such silver-liners will be: 'Well, somebody had to come along and do something!' If Trump is the only tool in the governing toolbox, some liberals will indeed try to use him to pound in a few nails they think need hammering. Burning Bridges with China In his 2024 State of the Union address, Joe Biden argued that he did a better job than Donald Trump of standing up to China. He certainly devoted more Pentagon dollars to containing China. And not only did he not roll back Trump’s tariffs on Chinese products, but he added some of his own, including a 100% tax on Chinese electric vehicles. Biden also made concrete moves to decouple the U.S. economy from China’s, especially when it came to the supply chains for critical raw materials that Beijing has sought to control. 'I’ve made sure that the most advanced American technologies can’t be used in China,' he insisted, adding, 'Frankly for all his tough talk on China, it never occurred to my predecessor to do any of that.' Biden’s moves on China, from export controls and subsidies for chip manufacturers to closer military relationships with Pacific partners like Australia and India, received the enthusiastic support of his party. No surprise there: It’s hard to find anyone in Washington these days who has a good word to say about engaging more with China. So, when Trump takes office in January, he won’t actually be reversing course. He’ll simply be taking the baton-like stick from Biden while leaving all the carrots in the ground. That said, Trump’s proposed further spike in tariffs against China (and Canada and Mexico and potentially the rest of the world) does give many liberals pause, since it threatens to unleash an economically devastating global trade war while boosting prices radically at home. But trade unions backed by such liberals support such measures as a way to protect jobs, while the European Union only recently imposed stiff tariffs of their own on Chinese electrical vehicles. So, yes, neoliberals who embrace free trade are going to push back against Trump’s economic policies, but more traditional liberals who backed protectionist measures in the past will secretly (or not so secretly) applaud Trump’s moves. Back to the Wall On taking office, Joe Biden rolled back his predecessor’s harsh immigration policies. The rate of border-crossings then spiked for a variety of reasons (not just the repeal of those Trump-era laws) from an average of half a million to about two millionannually. However, in 2024, those numbers plummeted, despite Trump’s campaign claims — but no matter. By then, many Democrats had already been reborn as border hawks. That new, tougher attitude was on display in executive actions President Biden took in 2024 as well as the border security billthat Democrats tried to push through Congress earlier this year. Forget about finding a path to citizenship for the millions of undocumented immigrants who keep the American economy humming, Biden’s immigration policy focused on limiting asylum petitions, increasing detention facilities, and even allocating more money to build Trump’s infamous wall. As Elora Mukherjee, director of the Immigrants’ Rights Clinic at Columbia Law School, pointed out on the eve of the November election, 'What we are seeing is that the center of the Democratic Party is now adopting the same policies, the same postures, that MAGA Republicans were fighting for about six years ago.' And yet such punitive policies still weren’t harsh enough for MAGA Republicans and their America First followers. The bottom line was that immigration-averse voters didn’t want to support Democrats pretending to be MAGA Republicans. When it came to the White House, they wanted the real thing. As politics change hands in Washington next January, it’s going to be difficult to find any Democrats who will support the mass detentions and deportations Trump is promising. Yet many liberals, like the unprecedented number of Latinos who pulled the lever for Trump in 2024, do want major changes at the border with Mexico. In Arizona, Democrat Ruben Gallego won a squeaker of a Senate election by emphasizing border security and even backing a border wall (in certain areas). Such liberal border hawks will be happy when the Republican president does the dirty work so that Democrats don’t suffer the political fallout that is sure to follow. Remapping the Middle East On the face of it, the Abrahamic Accords were a liberal nightmare. The brainchild of Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner, they promised to repair relations between Israel and the major authoritarian regimes in the region: Saudi Arabia, the Gulf States, Morocco, and Sudan. The deal was a reward for illiberal leaders, particularly Israel’s Benjamin Netanyahu. The primary losers would, of course, be the Palestinians, who would have to give up their hopes for a separate state in exchange for some Saudi handouts, and the Sahrawi people who lost their claim to the Western Sahara when the United States and Israel recognizedMoroccan sovereignty over the entire region. Instead of shelving the Accords, however, the Biden administration pushed ahead with them. After roundly criticizing Saudi autocrat Mohammed bin Salman for, among other things, ordering the murder of a U.S.-based Saudi journalist, Biden mended ties, fist-bumping that rogue leader, and continuing to discuss how and when the Kingdom would normalize relations with Israel. Nor did his administration restrict Washington’s staggering weapons deliveries to Israel after its invasion and utter devastation of Gaza. Yes, Biden and crew made some statements about Palestinian suffering and tried to push more humanitarian aid into the conflict zone, but they did next to nothing to pressure Israel to stop its killing machine (nor would they reverse the Trump administration’s decision on the Western Sahara). The liberals who support Israel (come what may) like Pennsylvania Senator John Fetterman, New York Congressman Ritchie Torres, and the New Democrat Coalition in the House of Representatives are, of course, going to be enthusiastic about Trump’s ever tighter embrace of Netanyahu next year. But there are also likely to be quiet cheers from other corners of the liberal-left about the harder line Trump is likely to take against Tehran. (Remember Kamala Harris’s assertion during her presidential run that Iran was the main adversary of the United States?) The Arab Spring is long gone and a strong man in the White House needs to both schmooze with and go toe to toe with the strong men of the Middle East — or so many liberals will believe, even as they rationalize away their relief over Trump’s handling of a thoroughly illiberal region. Looking Ahead (Or Do I Mean Behind?) Anyone to the left of Tucker Carlson will certainly think twice about showing public enthusiasm for whatever Trump does. Indeed, most liberals will be appalled by the new administration’s likely suspension of aid to Ukraine and withdrawal from the Paris climate accord, not to mention other possible hare-brained maneuvers like sending U.S. troops to battle narcotraffickersin Mexico. Trump will attract liberal support, however quietly or even secretively, not because of his bridge-building genius — in reality, he couldn’t even get a bridge-building infrastructure bill through Congress in his first term — but because all too many liberals have already moved inexorably rightward on issues ranging from China and the Middle East to immigration. The MAGA minority has seized the machinery of power by weaponizing mendacity and ruthlessly breaking rules, in the process transforming politics much the way the Bolshevik minority did in Russia more than a century ago. In the pot that those Republicans put on the stove, the water has been boiling for more than a decade and yet the left-of-center frogs barely seem to recognize just how altered our circumstances have become. In normal times, finding overlapping interests with your political adversaries makes sense. Such bedrock bipartisanship stabilizes fractious countries that swing politically from center left to center right every few years. These are, however, anything but normal times and the second-term Trump team anything but center-rightists. They are extremists bent on dismantling the federal government, unstitching the fabric of international law, and turning up the heat drastically on an already dangerously overcooking planet. In 2020, I raised the possibility of a boycott, divestment, and sanction (BDS) movement against the United States if Trump won the elections that year. 'People of the world, you’d better build your BDS box, paint ‘Break Glass in Case of Emergency’ on the front, and stand next to it on November 3,' I wrote then. 'If Trump wins on Election Day, it will be mourning in America. But let’s hope that the world doesn’t mourn: it organizes.' Four years later, Trump has won again. Do I hear the sound of breaking glass? Here, in the United States, a stance of strict non-engagement with Trump 2.0, even where interests overlap, would not only be a good moral policy but even make political sense. When things go disastrously south, laws are broken, and the government begins to truly come apart at the seams, it’s vitally important that no left-of-center fingerprints be found at the scene of the crime. Let’s be clear: the Trump administration will not be playing by the rules of normal politics. So, forget about bipartisanship. Forget about preserving access to power by visiting Mar-a-Lago, hat in hand, like Facebook’s Mark Zuckerberg or the hosts of MSNBC’s Morning Joe. 'Fascism can be defeated,' historian Timothy Snyder wrote immediately after the November elections, 'but not when we are on its side.' So, my dear liberal-left, which side are you on?

Pentagon Report Says Despite Corruption Problems, China Progressi...	The Defense Department released Wednesday the annual 'Military and Security Developments Involving the People's Republic of China' report, a congressionally mandated annual report that offers insight into the capabilities, strategies and goals of China and its military. Of note in this year's report is a rise in corruption within the People's Liberation Army, China's efforts to curtail that corruption, and how that corruption might affect the PRC's ambitions. 'I think the [intensity] of the anti-corruption hunt is reflective of a serious concern that this is having serious problems,' said Ely Ratner, assistant secretary of defense for Indo-Pacific security affairs, while speaking today at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington. 'I think there are questions about the overall effect on the PLA and the whole way in which corruption reverberates through the entire system and what that means.' The corruption touches every service in the PLA, the report notes, and Xi Jinping, China's president, has made rooting out corruption in the military a focus of his tenure since taking office. Last year, corruption-related investigations resulted in the removal of at least 15 high-ranking military officers and defense industry executives from their posts, including the PRC Defense Minister Li Shangfu. 'I think if you just look at the language that China's senior leaders use to describe the intensity of the anti-corruption campaign and why it's so vital, that gives you a good sense of how they see it,' said Michael Chase, deputy assistant secretary of defense for China, Taiwan and Mongolia. Based on who was removed and from what parts of the PLA, Chase said, the corruption could relate to such things as major military construction projects as well as research development and acquisition programs. 'Therefore, [this] may be a different kind of impact on the PLA's ability to meet the capabilities development milestones that Xi Jinping has set out for them,' he said. 'It certainly has to shake the leadership's confidence in the political reliability of the PLA, and again, in its sort of overall ability to deliver what they've been tasked to deliver.' According to the report, the PRC's public defense budget increased in inflation-adjusted prices to $220 billion for 2023 and allows the PLA to focus on modernizing its weapons and equipment, recruitment and retaining personnel, and enhancing the military's strategic capacities. '[It] reflects investments in a range of capabilities that are focused on Taiwan contingencies, on the East or South China Seas — operations relatively close to the PRC borders,' Chase said. 'It also reflects investments in power projection capabilities, the kinds of things that we note in the report about the PLA Navy trying to improve its ability to operate out beyond the first island chain. And it reflects the longer-term ambition to really become a global military with capabilities that can, from the PRC's point of view, defend their interest worldwide.' Chase said there are also investments in nuclear expansion and modernization as well as space and counter-space capabilities. The report details China's build-up of nuclear weapons. The U.S. Defense Department estimates the PRC has surpassed 600 operational nuclear warheads as of mid-2024 and estimates the PRC will have more than 1,000 by 2030. 'We also talk in the report about not just the expansion in numbers, but also the increase in quality,' Chase said. 'We talk about the growing technological sophistication [and] the increasing diversity of China's nuclear arsenal.' In earlier reports, decades ago, similar reports detailed China's small and outdated nuclear weapons capabilities. That has changed. '[What] we've seen over time is that they've expanded to a nuclear triad, with the PLA Navy having ballistic missile submarines, conducting deterrence patrols, as we cover in the report, and that the PLA Air Force has also regained a nuclear deterrence and strike mission with the addition of nuclear-capable bombers,' Chase said. There is also an increase in diversity and capabilities such as precision strike capable missiles with lower yield nuclear warheads, for instance. 'That gives the PRC a wider range of options in terms of the kinds of nuclear deterrence operations they would conduct, as well as ... kind of having more rungs on the escalation ladder in terms of how they could conduct nuclear operations,' Chase said. The report also highlights struggles with deficiencies in China's military. One area that is true involves the readiness and capabilities of commanders. A term 'the five incapables,' used by the PLA, describes areas where Chinese military officers might improve, including the ability to evaluate situations, understand the intent of higher authorities, make operational decisions, deploy forces and manage unexpected situations. 'I think from the PRC perspective, some of this derives from their lack of combat experience,' he said. 'From the PRC point of view, it means that the experience that they do have is coming from the overseas operations, from the exercises that they conduct at home — not from any sort of real-world experience with combat operations.' Other areas where the PLA might not be where it needs to be, the report concludes, include conducting urban warfare and long-distance logistics. Ties between the PRC and allies, including Russia, are also included in the report. Included there is China's support to Russia for its ongoing war in Ukraine and in military cooperation and exercises. 'We continue to see them conduct the maritime exercises ... [and] the PRC to participate in other Russian exercises, and the joint bomber patrols to take place with some regularity,' Chase said. 'They will add some new elements to these over time. But a lot of the time, I think [PRC is] also trying to kind of maximize the political signaling value, to showcase more and deeper military cooperation.' Chase said that as Russia has become more dependent on the PRC, China will want more from it. 'The PRC ... is probably going to want to exert more leverage, to kind of extract greater cooperation from Russia in areas where Russia historically has been more reluctant,' he said. 'In the Arctic, for example, would be one example where that might take place.' Ratner said the PRC's relationship with Russia is not the only one to be watching. The PRC has relations with the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, Iran and Iranian proxy groups as well. The PRC's support to Russia's war in Ukraine, Ratner said, 'is just one of the ways in which the PRC's, anti-Western, anti-American orientation has been destabilizing, not only in Europe but in other theaters throughout the world.' The PRC is active in the Middle East as well, he said, where the PRC continues to support Iran and its proxies such as Hamas, Hezbollah and the Houthis. 'The Houthis have built a supply chain into the PRC for drones and missiles that they are using to attack international shipping,' he said. 'These are not just one-off transactions. This is really systemic in terms of how the Houthis are acquiring the capabilities they need.' He also said there is a 'bargain' between the Houthis and the PRC, where if the Houthis don't attack PRC shipping, Beijing will continue to provide diplomatic and political support to the Houthis. 'That is just an extraordinarily destabilizing set of activities,' he said. 'I think that the Russia piece is important, but we ought to not leave out the Middle East piece as well.' The PRC has made public its goals for modernization of the PLA. The PLA has made uneven progress toward its 2027 capability milestone for modernization, which the report said could make the PLA a more credible military tool for the Chinese Communist Party's Taiwan unification efforts. The year 2035 has also been touted as when the PLA plans to complete its modernization efforts, while 2049 remains a target to become a 'world-class military.'	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWet_9MfW6XVCS4bcCK3KK5Z	2024-12-18T17:06:27-08:00	
France: Sarkozy Must Wear Electronic Tag After Losing Graft Case ...	(EurActiv) -- France's highest appeals court on Wednesday (18 December) confirmed a verdict against former president Nicolas Sarkozy for corruption and influence peddling, ordering him to wear an electronic tag for a year, a first for a former head of state. Sarkozy, who had earlier been found guilty of illegal attempts to secure favours from a judge, will 'evidently' respect the terms of the conviction after the Court of Cassation's verdict, his lawyer Patrice Spinosi told AFP. But he will take the case to the European Court of Human Rights (ECtHR) within weeks, Spinosi added. This move at the Strasbourg-based ECtHR will, however, not hold up Wednesday's verdict from being carried out. The sanction now comes into force, Sarkozy having exhausted all legal avenues in the case in France. Spinosi said it was a 'sad day' when 'a former president is required to take action before European judges to have condemned a state over whose destiny he once presided'. In 2021, a lower court found that Sarkozy and his former lawyer, Thierry Herzog, had formed a 'corruption pact' with judge Gilbert Azibert to obtain and share information about a legal investigation. The court sentenced him to a three-year jail term, two of which were suspended and one that was to take the form of home detention with an electronic tag allowing his movements to be monitored. That verdict had already been upheld once, by an appeals court, last year. Other cases pending Sarkozy, 69, has always claimed his innocence, with his lawyer saying he would 'not give up this fight'. The right-winger, who was president for one term between 2007 and 2012, failing to win re-election. He has been embroiled in legal troubles ever since leaving office. The latest case, dubbed 'Bismuth', comes on top of separate cases about campaign financing overspending, and the alleged financing by Libya of Sarkozy's 2007 election campaign. Despite his legal problems, Sarkozy continues to enjoy considerable influence and popularity on the right of French politics and has the ear of President Emmanuel Macron, with whom he is known to meet on occasion. Sources have told AFP that Sarkozy held talks at the Élysée earlier this month in a bid to persuade Macron not to appoint veteran centrist Francois Bayrou as prime minister. The former president is widely known to despise him. After a long hesitation, Macron however went ahead and named Bayrou.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWet_9MfW6XVCTdsBh3dql-L	2024-12-18T17:05:23-08:00	
France And Germany’s Woes Could Seriously Weaken The EU – OpEd	By Mohamed Chebaro One government in, another one out — that is becoming a feature pointing to the instability within the EU’s family of nations. One could easily dismiss this and consider it the usual liberal-democratic game of politics within each country of the bloc. But the vote of no-confidence in the center-left government of Olaf Scholz after weeks of turmoil does not bode well for Germany, Europe’s biggest economy. It now seems set to join France in a potential spiral of instability, which could leave the EU without two of its biggest players at a crucial junction of history. As 2025 dawns, the two superpowers of the EU are likely to welcome the new year without a working government, no agreed budgets and fractured politics, with the narratives of the extremes dominating the public debates, if not yet their political institutions. The two engines of the EU, France and Germany, are in crisis just as adversities gather at the gates of the bloc and multiply. Embattled Chancellor Scholz of Germany is, after three years in power as part of an unruly three-colors coalition, lagging badly in the polls behind conservative opposition leader Friedrich Merz, of the Christian Democratic Union party of ex-Chancellor Angela Merkel. And while his government has struggled to revive a stuttering economy that is suffering from high energy prices and tougher competition from China, one wonders what chance any alternative coalition would have. Germany is facing major geopolitical challenges, such as its confrontation with Russia over the Ukraine war and the looming return of Donald Trump to the US presidency, which heightens uncertainty over the future of NATO and trade ties in general. The same could be said about President Emmanuel Macron’s France. Despite his nomination last week of centrist Francois Bayrou as prime minister, the same old problems are likely to weigh Paris down. The intransigent extreme right and extreme left are bent on sinking the presidency of Macron, unconcerned about headline issues like fixing the budget, the country’s debts or even pension reforms, let alone how Europe can deal with the Ukraine war once Trump returns to the White House next month. It is not an exaggeration to suggest that the consequences of France and now Germany being in disarray will be catastrophic for the EU, but also for democracy as a whole. That is unless both Berlin and Paris miraculously manage to restore the credibility of their leaderships and systems relatively soon. Otherwise, the demise of the EU and mainstream European democracy might be next. Despair is written all over the coming weeks. Germany’s path might be simpler if the CDU could win a larger chunk of the seats in parliament in February’s snap federal election. But even then the problems will not go away, as they are rooted in an ever-increasing wealth divide and sinking living standards, which many experts have long blamed on a failure of leadership across the Western world. Too many countries have not dealt with the root causes of the financial crisis of 2007-2008, while globalization has become a bad word for voters across Europe, despite the prosperity it once afforded them. Germany might find a potential escape route by electing Merz, who has steered his party away from Merkel’s legacy and positioned it closer to its roots in a bid to blunt the impact of the far-right Alternative for Germany and its appeal among conservative voters. His dream of winning an outright ruling majority might be far-fetched in this age of rising populist forces and their anti-traditional politics narratives, but he could still work with the Social Democrats post-Scholz and with the Greens. However, this could also be problematic. In France, many blame Macron and his 'mercurial arrogance' for ushering in this crisis, which emanated from the battering his party got in June’s European Parliament elections. His decision to hold snap elections over the summer produced a three-way split in parliament between his centrists, the left and Marine Le Pen’s far-right National Rally. A fourth or even a fifth prime ministerial appointment might not aid Macron or the country, as he keeps refusing to nominate one of the many moderate figures from the leftist coalition that earned the highest number of seats in the elections. France seems to be in a tight corner, with polls indicating that between 35 percent and 38 percent of voters intend to support Le Pen in the next presidential election, which is due in 2027. This could put her far-right movement at the steps of the Elysee Palace. Commentators across Europe are right to continuously ring the alarm bells, warning that the bloc is in need of a series of ententes cordiales, both within nations and between states, and that voters and leaders ought to wake up because 'the enemy is at the gate.' Rather than external enemies — as Russia continues to present an existential challenge to European security and society and China’s pursuit of its interests, capitalizing on any holes in the European economic guard rails, continues unabated — it may be the enemy within that ultimately unravels the tenets of the EU project, as the European populists will surely feel the winds of Trump behind them come 2025. Giorgia Meloni of Italy might feel fewer constraints and pursue a more illiberal agenda. Some states in Central and Eastern Europe, formerly part of the Warsaw Pact, are already leaning toward authoritarianism. There is Hungary and Slovakia and maybe Czechia will soon join them in an orbit of politics that is not far from the Kremlin’s. The exceptions remain the Baltic and Nordic states and Poland, which are just holding on but maybe not for long. That is why it is imperative for nations like Germany and France to find their withering political balance and leadership in the new year. The alternatives in populist-led European nations could only further sink the EU, its liberal democratic anchors, its peace and security mechanisms and, above all, its prosperity and welfare state.

The Strawman Of Antisemitism: Banning Protests Against Israel Dow...	Of late, a spate of incidents has taken place in Australia giving sheer delight to the simian-resembling Opposition Leader, Peter Dutton. On a visit to South Australia, he showed himself to be merrily divisive in attacking protestors who had shown solidarity for Palestinians in Gaza in the wake of their catastrophic suffering since October last year: 'If you allow these lunatics to continue their protests at university campuses and you allow them to spew their hatred and affiliate with a listed terrorist organisation, and there [is] no consequence, of course we’ll see the sort of outcomes we have seen – which most recently has culminated in the firebombing of a synagogue in Melbourne'. The December 6 attack on the Adass Israel Synagogue in Melbourne, while horrid, was immediately elevated to a level of concern warranting an emergency – that, at least, was the view of Dutton and his charges. The attacks on mosques and their worshippers, a feature of Australian public life for some years now, hardly warranted a mention. (A 2021 joint study by three Australian universities surveying 75 mosques found that 58.2% had experienced violence between 2014 and 2019.) Dutton also had inspiration from another source. 'The burning of the Adass Israel synagogue in Melbourne is an abhorrent act of antisemitism,' stated Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on platform X. 'I expect the state authorities to use their full weight to prevent such antisemitic acts in future.' Ever the opportunist, Netanyahu saw a chance to see unsubstantiated links between the bombing in Melbourne, Australian foreign policy and antisemitism. 'Unfortunately, it is impossible to separate this reprehensible act from the extreme anti-Israeli position of the Labor government in Australia, including the scandalous decision to support the UN resolution calling on Israel ‘to bring an end to its unlawful presence in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, as rapidly as possible’, and preventing a former Israeli minister from entering the country.' The conclusion was childishly simple: 'Anti-Israel sentiment is antisemitism.' This unbridled nonsense had its effect. In the aftermath of the synagogue attack, Australia’s antisemitism envoy, Jillian Segal, got busy. On the Australian public broadcaster SBS, she took the rather authoritarian view that Australian cities were no place for protests against Israeli policies towards the Palestinians. 'There should be places designated away from where the Jewish community might venture, where people can demonstrate.' Presumably, pro-Palestinian protestors needed to be given, like smokers, caged areas to engage in their activities, leaving the pure and docile safe to go about their everyday business. In Segal’s view, the weekly protests held in solidarity for Palestinians in Gaza and the West Bank had become 'something more sinister'. Not only were they 'intimidatory', they had 'morphed into attacking the Jewish community.' Not exactly furnished with much by way of evidence, she pointed to the display of 'flags from a terrorist organisation' and 'anti-Jewish sentiments' seen and heard at rallies. Demagogy always resists context. Amnesty International Australia, in a December 13 statement, expressed its strong opposition to Segal’s call 'to ban pro-Palestinian protests from city centres. Protests advocating for a ceasefire, the protection of human rights, and an end to Israel’s genocide of Palestinians in Gaza are an essential and protected outlet for Australians to freely express their views.' It was vital to distinguish instances of 'hateful acts and calls for justice, freedom, and human dignity.' These views are correct – to a point. As Australia lacks a human rights charter protecting the right to lawful assembly and free speech, parliaments at both the federal and state level can show sneering contempt for protests when they wish to do so. Wishing to jump to the aid of Segal and the unspecified fearful in the Jewish community, Victoria’s Premier Jacinta Allan has done just that, proposing legislation that targets pro-Palestinian protests. 'Antisemitism,' she solemnly stated, 'thrives in extreme and radical environments, and we are giving police more powers to control protest and making it harder for agents of violence and hate to hide.' Allan gives the impression that the proposed laws are universal in nature. 'Doesn’t matter if you’re Christian, Jewish Muslim, Sikh, Hindu – you all deserve the right to simply be who we are'. However, things become very clear with the explicit mention 'that Jewish people increasingly feel the promise of a modern and multicultural Victoria is being denied them.' The ludicrously named Anti-Vilification and Social Cohesion Bill 2024 will not only, as the premier noted in a public announcement, ban the flags and symbols of designated terrorist organisations (Hamas and Hezbollah included), undefined 'white nationalists' (presumably those of other colours slip under the radar), 'and more': the statute will also focus on the decorative and dramatic nature of protest. Masks, 'used by agitators to shield identities and hide from personal accountability', are to be banned, along with glue, rope, chains, locks and other devices 'used to cause maximum disruption and endanger Victorians.' This shows that protestors of all stripes, including those concerned with climate change and environment, will also be targeted. Showing a conventional loathing for Victoria’s own Charter of Human Rights, which has a paper tiger protection for freedom of assembly, Allan condescendingly shreds it: 'the right to protest is balanced against the right of people to live safely – free of danger, discrimination and harassment.' These moves replicate the Commonwealth Criminal Code Act 1995, as amended by the Counter-Terrorism Legislation Amendment (Prohibited Hate Symbols and Other Measures) Bill 2023 passed last year. As if Australia’s citizenry needed to have more strangulating laws, these measures already criminalise the display and trade of prohibited symbols, along with the Nazi salute, which includes 'a prohibited terrorist organisation symbol.' Police-minded bureaucracies, whatever their level, adore duplication. The beneficiaries in all of this are the noisy, bellicose members of the pro-Israel lobby, a divisive federal opposition keen to capitalise on hatreds it claims not to have, and the State of Israel itself. However murderous, annihilating and cruel its policies might be to the Palestinians, the belief shared by many of its defenders is that the Jewish state is faultless, beyond the moral and soiling reach of any protest. To think otherwise would instance, as Netanyahu barkingly insists, antisemitism.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWet_9MfW6XVCUnurwHCmMdU	2024-12-18T17:02:55-08:00	
Ukraine Drones Kill 50 North Koreans In Battle In Kursk Region	By Park Jaewoo Around 50 North Korean soldiers were killed in a battle against Ukrainian army drones in the Kursk region this week, video of the battle shared on social media revealed. It’s the latest evidence that North Korean forces are participating in Russia’s war with Ukraine, a fact that Moscow and Pyongyang are trying to hide, including by allegedly burning the faces off of North Koreans who are killed in action. The video, shared by Ukraine’s 8th Special Operations Regiment on Facebook, showed a drone attack in the battle fought on Monday. In the video, what are believed to be North Korean soldiers are seen running away or hiding behind trees when they encounter Ukrainian first-person-view drones, also known as FPV drones. Sgt. Mykhailo Makaruk, a member of the Ukrainian unit confirmed to RFA Korean that he had fought against North Koreans in the battle captured on video. 'I think nearly 200 (North Korean soldiers) came to our position,' Makaruk said, explaining that shortly after, the drones began an aerial attack. He likened the North Koreans to zombies, a staple of horror films. 'They came and they came and the drones are bombing them,' he said. 'I don’t understand how they can come to this war. They look like, you know, real zombies.' Makaruk did not disclose the exact location where the battle was fought because his unit is still deployed in a combat situation. RFA has not verified the authenticity of the video. Makaruk said that the North Korean soldiers involved in the battle moved alongside Russian troops, and that mid-level North Korean officers were among them. He said the North Korean soldiers were equipped with Russian military supplies and used outdated tactics typical of the Soviet military in the 1950s. They were totally unprepared to fight against drones, and they appear to think they can avoid detection while on the ground or under cover of night, Makaruk said. These FPV drones are said to be able to reach speeds of up to 150 kilometers (93 miles) per hour, meaning that if they encounter each other within 100 meters, it will take less than a second for them to collide. Andrii Kovalenko, the head of Ukraine’s Center for Countering Disinformation at the National Security and Defense Council, posted on on his Telegram account that North Korean soldiers were no match for the drones, also called unmanned aerial vehicles, or UAVs. 'The dead DPRK soldiers did not have a visual understanding of the danger from UAVs before the drone strikes, which may indicate that the Russians poorly informed the Koreans about the use of drones at the front,' Kovalenko said. He also said that the Russian soldiers were seen trying to quickly recover the bodies of North Korean soldiers who died on the front lines, which was different from the way they recovered Russian casualties. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Monday in an address that preliminary data suggests that the Russians were trying to hide the deaths of North Korean soldiers. 'Unfortunately, we are forced to defend against them as well, even though there is not a single reason for North Koreans to die in this war,' Zelensky said. 'The only reason is Putin’s madness, which has consumed Russia and fuels this war.'	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWet_9MfW6XVCR2gyrfXWndR	2024-12-18T16:56:25-08:00	
Developments In Syria Can Give Opportunity To ISIS To Bounce Back...	Mr Shoresh Ismail Abdulla is the Minister of Peshmerga affairs in the Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG). The Peshmerga are the military forces of the Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG) and one of the most capable forces in the region, which pushed back ISIS from its strongholds. Currently, Peshmerga is also playing a vital role in counter-terror operations against ISIS. In an interview with Manish Rai, Geopolitical Analyst for the Middle East at the Ministry of Peshmerga Affairs in Erbil, Iraqi Kurdistan. Mr. Abdulla speaks about the reemergence of ISIS in the context of developments in Syria, planned reforms of Peshmerga, and expectations from the incoming United States administration of President-Elect Donald Trump. Question: What role are Peshmerga forces playing in countering ISIS? Is the threat of ISIS still imminent? Mr Abdulla: To understand the role played by the Peshmerga in countering terrorism, we have to dig into the past of this force. Historically, Peshmerga, to save the people and the region, fought with the brutal Baathist regime of Saddam Hussein and other terror groups. So, when ISIS emerged as a significant threat in 2014, we already had the expertise to deal with this kind of force. We confronted ISIS with all our strength, and while doing that, we also made a lot of sacrifices. For example, we had more than 10,000 injured and 2,000 martyrs in the fight against ISIS. But combined with our experience and determination, we were able to defeat ISIS and stop this terror group's expansion. Yes, the threat posed by ISIS is far from over, and this extremist group remains the most prominent threat to the stability and peace of the region. Question: Do you think they still can capture large territories? Mr Abdulla: Their fighting tactics have changed. Islamic State is still carrying out its operations through its cells very frequently, and even after losing the large territory it once controlled, we are observing very high military activities from ISIS. As the ideology of ISIS is still very much present, it has the potential to re-emerge as a significant threat. The recent developments in Syria will provide favorable conditions for ISIS to strengthen themselves. Question: Still, many units (Unit 70 forces are affiliated with the PUK, and the KDP controls Unit 80 forces) of Peshmerga are affiliated with the political parties of Kurdistan. Will all the units be unified under the Ministry of Peshmerga Affairs anytime soon? What is the biggest hindrance to unification? Mr Abdulla: There is no hindrance as such. The process of unifying all the Peshmerga units is underway. We are receiving support for this effort from the coalition forces led by the United States. There is a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) between the two biggest parties of Kurdistan, KDP and PUK, to unify the Peshmerga forces by the end of 2026. Question: How is the Peshmerga modernization progressing? It is often stated that Peshmerga forces lack heavy weaponry and air power. Is there any plan in place to address these issues? Mr Abdulla: We have taken these reforms very seriously. A separate Directorate was established under the Ministry of Peshmerga Affairs, which oversees 35 points of planned reforms. Some critical areas, such as establishing a transparent chain of command, training, and logistics, are prioritized in the modernization process. We are receiving continuous support from the US and other coalition forces. The Federal government in Baghdad is preventing us from procuring heavy and advanced weapons. Baghdad is not even providing ammunition for the armaments we already possess. This behavior of the Federal government of Iraq is strange as Peshmerga forces have also fought against any threat Iraq faces. Our forces have defended the Kurdistan region and Iraq, and we expect more cooperation from Iraqi authorities. Question: Recently, Peshmerga forces received some artillery pieces (105mm M119 howitzers) from the United States. However, Baghdad has opposed this kind of weapons transfer by the US, arguing that the Iraqi national Army should only possess heavy weapons. Mr Abdulla: We already possess some heavy weapons, and in the past, the Iraqi government didn’t oppose it. Recently, some people have objected to weapons being transferred to Peshmerga forces by the United States. Prejudices and narrow thought processes drive these objections. There is a misinformation campaign being run that possession of heavy weapons by Peshmerga forces can be a threat to the Iraqi Army. But the matter is that Peshmerga has never been a threat to anyone. Also, it should be remembered that when the Iraqi National Army was not able to fight ISIS and fled, we were the only force that defended Iraqi territory and saved the innocents from ISIS. Hence, I would say that strong Peshmerga forces are also in Iraq's interest. Question: What assistance should the international community provide you in the fight against terrorism? Mr Abdulla: We expect that each country that is part of the international coalition against terrorism should enter into bilateral agreements with the Iraqi federal government, and we should also be included in such agreements. We are playing an essential role in the fight against terrorism in this region. I am not saying that we should be included as a third party in these bilateral engagements. However, it should be considered that the Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG), as per the Iraqi constitution, is an autonomous region of Iraq. Hence, we should be part of every agreement about counter-terror efforts. Question: Do you think the policies of US President-elect Donald Trump's administration will affect the region differently, especially Kurdistan? Mr Abdulla: We can’t say with certainty whether the policies of the new US administration will change or not. But the officials chosen to serve in the new administration—almost all of them—have had positive views about the Kurdistan region and the Peshmerga in the past. We believe that policies in the United States are decided at an institutional level after considering the ground realities.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWet_9MfW6XVCWaXoVfxaADz	2024-12-18T16:55:00-08:00	
US, UK Say Medvedev’s Comment Calling NATO Officials ‘Legitimate ...	By Rikard Jozwiak and Zoriana Stepanenko (RFE/RL) -- The U.K. and U.S. governments on December 18 said the comments of Russian Security Council Deputy Chairman Dmitry Medvedev following the assassination of a high-ranking Russian general by Ukrainian security services were irresponsible and yet another sign of Moscow's desperation. Medvedev, reacting to an editorial in the London-based Times newspaper that called the December 17 killing of a high-ranking Russian officer 'a legitimate act of defense by a threatened nation,' said Moscow should apply the same logic. Medvedev accused NATO and officials from countries allied with Ukraine in its battle to repel invading Russian troops of being participants in the conflict, making them 'legitimate military targets.' The U.S. State Department told RFE/RL that Medvedev's comments amounted to more irresponsible rhetoric from the Kremlin and reiterated that the United States and NATO do not seek a military conflict with Russia. 'The Kremlin's aggression against Ukraine is the most significant and direct threat to Europe's security and to peace and stability in the Euro-Atlantic area. It is the Kremlin that started this war, and [Russian President Vladimir] Putin could end it today,' the State Department's press office said in a statement e-mailed to RFE/RL. U.S. State Department spokesman Matthew Miller told a briefing on December 17 that Washington had no connection to the killing of Lieutenant General Igor Kirillov, the head of Russia's Nuclear, Biological, and Chemical Defense Forces (RKhBZ), or any prior knowledge of it. The U.K. Foreign Office said the comments were 'just another example of Putin’s propaganda machine,' while a spokesman for British Prime Minister Keir Starmer was quoted as saying Medvedev's comments were 'simply the latest in a stream of desperate rhetoric' to come out of Putin's government. 'Unlike in Russia, a free press is a cornerstone of our democracy and we take any threats made by Russia incredibly seriously,' the spokesman added, according to The Times. 'Our newspapers represent the best of British values: freedom, democracy and independent thinking,' he said. 'I stand with The Times.' In its article, The Times said the assassination was 'a discriminate strike against an aggressor' and that it underlines the need for Western governments to give Ukraine 'all support it needs to fight a just war of self-defense.' 'All officials of NATO countries involved in decisions about military assistance to Ukraine and those participating in hybrid or conventional warfare against Russia are now considered legitimate military targets for the Russian state and all Russian patriots,' Medvedev wrote in response. EU foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas told RFE/RL on December 18 that 'Russia is always threatening. And it is meant to scare us, so what we see is the threats we have heard before.' Speaking in Brussels before a meeting of EU leaders to discuss the war, she said: 'I think the only response we can have is not to be afraid.'	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWet_9MfW6XVCcLHTWZQzrvG	2024-12-18T16:53:25-08:00	
Gwadar Port Highlights Precarity In Pakistan’s Geopolitical Balan...	By Muneeb Yousuf Eight months after the February 2024 general elections, Pakistan’s politics continue to be marred by political, economic and security challenges. The country’s most popular politician, Imran Khan, remains in jail, the coalition government lacks legitimacy and the military establishment continues to hold veto power over the government’s policies. Pakistan is also facing acute security challenges. Terrorist attacks have increased in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan since October, targeting Chinese nationals working on critical infrastructure projects. In September 2024, leaked military and diplomatic documents claiming that Pakistan has privately agreed to grant China approval for a military base at the strategic port of Gwadar in Balochistan surfaced. Both Pakistan and China have denied these claims, but the accusation sheds light on Pakistan’s internal security problems and its delicate relations with China and the United States. Pakistan’s foreign policy is under significant economic and geopolitical pressure. While Islamabad shares longstanding military and investment ties with Washington, it has also cultivated a strong relationship with Beijing predicated on mutual animosity toward New Delhi. US–Pakistan relations have deteriorated since the 2020–21 US withdrawal from Afghanistan. The Pakistani government and military’s attempts to repair ties with the United States have failed to yield meaningful dividends, such as securing a crucial International Monetary Fund (IMF) package. These diplomatic manoeuvres have visibly frustrated China, which views such overtures as a potential shift in allegiance to Washington. Pakistan’s motivation behind potentially approving a military base would stem from the country’s economic and security problems. Reliance on IMF loans to keep the economy afloat, mounting debt repayments and persistent difficulties to raise capital have pushed Pakistan to renegotiate loan terms with China. Unlike previous years when Pakistan extracted strategic rent from the United States which paid for its exports and military modernisation, the country now finds its geopolitical significance substantially diminished. If Pakistan were to grant a military base to China, it would face a dilemma. Beijing’s access to the base could alleviate Pakistan’s economic crisis and ensure that a continuous supply of advanced military hardware enters the country. But it would also lead to further deterioration of ties with the United States and affect Pakistan’s strategic autonomy. If a military base were to be approved, internal security challenges would also be exacerbated. Baloch insurgents and other militant groups could be encouraged to increase attacks targeting Chinese nationals and development infrastructure. The Balochistan Liberation Army views the China–Pakistan Economic Corridor as a mechanism which furthers the economic marginalisation of the Baloch community. Baloch insurgents could exploit the situation to strengthen regional sentiments, which have long viewed the Pakistani state as unfairly appropriating mineral and gas reserves. Rising attacks on Chinese infrastructure projects and workers have prompted Beijing to push for joint military mechanisms with Pakistan to safeguard Chinese citizens and projects in the country. Chinese Ambassador to Pakistan Jiang Zaidong has maintained that security threats are the primary constraint behind the slow progress of the China–Pakistan Economic Corridor and has exhorted the Pakistani government to strengthen the security of Chinese personnel, institutions and projects. But this push is unlikely to lead to a resolution, as there is little clarity on the role of Chinese guards in Pakistan if joint security were to be implemented and whether they would be able to participate in combat operations in case of attack. There would be a score of foreign policy and internal security implications for Pakistan if the claims made by the Drop Site portal — based on leaked military and diplomatic documents — are accepted at face value. The aim is not to assess the merits of these claims, but to speculate about what implications such developments may have upon Pakistan’s relationship with the United States, China and the China–Pakistan Economic Corridor. Given this, it would not be prudent for Pakistan to take sides in the US–China rivalry, which is set to intensify with the re-election of former US president Donald Trump. Islamabad is not a likely priority for the Trump cabinet, yet Washington would not wish for Islamabad to fall into Beijing’s lap.

Syrian Rebels Adopt Approach Similar To Taliban’s To Seek Interna...	By Roshan Noorzai and Sayed Aziz Rahman While the international community is setting conditions for the new rulers in Syria, the leading rebel group has taken a conciliatory approach, similar to one the Taliban adopted in Afghanistan, to seek international recognition, say analysts. Ahmed al-Sharaa, also known as Abu Mohammed al-Jolani, the leader of Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, or HTS, met with the U.N. special envoy for Syria on Sunday and emphasized 'rapid and effective cooperation' to rebuild Syria's economy and maintain its territorial integrity. In an interview with The Times of London, al-Jolani said that Syrian soil will not be used against any neighboring country, including Israel. Asfandyar Mir, a senior expert at the Washington-based U.S. Institute of Peace, told VOA that HTS presented 'a conciliatory message,' similar to the one the Taliban presented after seizing power in 2021, by 'positioning itself in regional politics in a way that would not provoke regional countries [and global powers] against them.' After seizing power in August 2021, the Taliban tried to assure the neighboring countries and regional powers that the group would not allow anyone to use Afghanistan as a launchpad against any country. But the U.N. said in July that while the Taliban claims there are no foreign terrorist groups in Afghanistan, member states reported more than two dozen terrorist groups were operating inside the country. He added that HTS learned from its own experience, and also from observing the Taliban, to avoid making enemies overseas 'by signaling and trying to assure them that look, we don't have any beef with you,' Mir said. Mir said the global and regional powers have relatively moderate aims when dealing with the rebels in Syria, 'but they are going to spend time watching HTS.' Syrian rebels, led by HTS, started an offensive against former President Bashar al-Assad's forces on November 27 in the northern Idlib province and, after capturing some strategic cities, seized control of the capital, Damascus, in 11 days. The U.S. welcomed the rebels' 'hopeful' statements but said that 'we're going to judge them by their actions.' 'We're going to make our decisions when it comes to sanction posture, when it comes to recognition, posture, when it comes to all the tools in our toolbox, based on what we see from HTS and other actors on the ground here,' Mathew Miller, the spokesperson for the U.S. State Department said Monday in response to a question from VOA. A top EU diplomat said Sunday the European Union would not lift sanctions on Syria before its new rulers provide guarantees to safeguard minorities and women's rights and disavow terrorism. The international community demanded similar guarantees from the Taliban after the group seized power in Afghanistan in August 2021. The international community urged that the Taliban honor their commitments to counter terrorism, form an inclusive government and respect human rights, particularly women's rights, before they were recognized as a legitimate government of Afghanistan. No country has yet formally recognized the Taliban, though many countries have established diplomatic relations with the Taliban government. Colin Clarke, the director of research at The Soufan Group, told VOA that the U.S. policy toward Syria is shaped by its experience in Afghanistan. 'I think that informs a lot of what they do in terms of foreign policy,' said Clarke. He said there are 'a lot of similarities' between how the Taliban and HTS present themselves. 'Being more pragmatic, being more moderate, distancing themselves from more hardcore Jihadist ideology,' he added. larke said the question, though, is whether HTS would remain moderate. He said concerns exist about hardcore foreign militants, particularly those from Central Asia, within the rebel groups. 'They may defect and either split off their own, or they may want to go and join other groups like IS because they may see this whole governing project as a fool's errand,' he added. The U.N., the U.S., Turkey, and many other countries have designated HTS as a terrorist organization. HTS is 'a coalition of northern Syria-based Sunni Islamist insurgent groups that evolved from Jabhat al-Nusrah, or 'Nusrah Front,' al-Qaida's former branch in Syria,' says the website of the National Counterterrorism Center, the U.S. agency with primary responsibility for analyzing and integrating information on international terrorism. In 2013, the U.S. State Department designated al-Sharaa as a global terrorist, and the U.S. offered a reward of up to $10 million for information leading to his arrest. Though the Taliban are not designated as a terrorist group by the U.S. State Department, the Haqqani Network, now part of the Taliban's government, is among the U.S.-designated terrorist groups. Clarke said he thinks the Syrian rebels will be recognized sooner than the Taliban because they represent 'a newer phenomenon, and they don't have as many skeletons in the closet at this point.' Merissa Khurma, director of the Middle East Program at the Washington-based Wilson Center think tank, said it is 'very difficult' to compare the Syrian rebels to the Taliban. 'With Syria, it was freeing the Syrian people from a brutal regime. With Afghanistan, it was essentially the return of a brutal regime to power,' said Khurma. But, she said, in both cases the governments these groups fought against suffered from 'low morale.' 'It does showcase that both systems were already eroding,' she said.

Eric Adams And Daniel Penny Make Black People The Face Of Crime –...	Daniel Penny’s acquittal was not surprising, and neither is Mayor Eric Adams' defense of Penny and law enforcement power being used against Black people. 'You have someone [Penny] on that subway who was responding, doing what we should have done as a city.' -- Eric Adams, Mayor of New York City Millions of people in the United States are de facto deputies who can be asked at a moment’s notice to carry out what is considered the most important job in the nation, keeping Black people under physical control. The most recent case brought to public attention was that of Daniel Penny, a white man who put an emotionally disturbed Black man, Jordan Neely, in a chokehold on a New York City subway. Neely died after the assault and Penny was recently acquitted of manslaughter and criminally negligent homicide. What followed was a predictable and righteous reaction of outrage at the obvious racist injustice. Black people are riveted whenever white racist killers go on trial. Those persons may be police like Derek Chauvin, who killed George Floyd on camera. They may be vigilantes like the men who killed Ahmed Aubery. In those two cases there were guilty verdicts and prison time. Black people and anyone who cared about justice applauded the outcomes but what was missing was an explanation of the white supremacist nature of the United States and the inevitability of absolution in most of these cases, as there was for Penny. Penny was called a 'hero' by the public, pundits, and politicians. His defense fund now totals more than $3.3 million , with donations being made on a daily basis, even after he was acquitted of all charges. So exalted is his celebrity status that former president and now president-elect Donald Trump and his soon to be vice president, J.D. Vance invited Penny to be their guest at the Army-Navy football game . What is missing from the discussion and media attention is honesty about the nature of law enforcement in this country. The United States is the world’s largest jailer, with two million people behind bars. No other country has as many people or as large a percentage of their population incarcerated. Some 37% of all those imprisoned are Black people, who make up only 14% of the entire population. This imbalance is quite purposeful and explains the love of violence and punishment that afflict the United States. Any effort towards justice and compassion is immediately met with scorn and political attack. The slightest, most minor changes to policing and imprisonment are vehemently opposed, and anti-Black racism is the explanation for the draconian mindset that prevails in this country. Even small efforts at reform are met with fierce opposition. In New York a very modest program to end cash bailfor minor offenses was undone by democrats who control that state. Eric Adams was among those making the case for more people to end up in jail awaiting trial just because they didn’t have money. Bail reform has succeeded by every measure, with crime rates down, and those who would have been held in jail not being rearrested. Facts don’t count when white people are whipped into a crime panic frenzy, just as Penny choking Neely’s neck was found not to be the cause of death. New York is not alone in this regard. Around the country more progressive prosecutors are defeated in election campaigns. In California a proposition that would have done away with forced labor in prisons was defeated at the polls. Those same voters approved another proposition which elevated some minor crimes from the category of misdemeanors to felonies , reversing a proposition to decriminalize which they passed ten years earlier. Eric Adams, New York City’s Black mayor routinely elevates the concerns of his white constituents. He read the room when he defended Penny as having done what the city should have done. His comment gave the appearance that he has no role in allocating funds for social services and can’t make the case for mental health care or housing. Of course he has the power to do these things, but Adams has made a career out of being the white people’s Black man and he knows when to repeat their favorite coded language in order to keep them happy. The settler mentality is ever present, and subjugated groups present a danger in the minds of the modern day pioneers who are afraid of seemingly everything. From enslavement, to the chain gang, to mass incarceration, Black people are viewed as being inherently dangerous, which in the minds of many white people means they must be policed and punished at every opportunity. There are Black people willing to help their effort. The infamous stop and frisk policies which were used so heavily by mayor Michael Bloomberg not only never ended, but have gotten worse during Eric Adams’ tenure. In 2013 a federal monitor found that NYPD stop and frisks violated the Fourth Amendment, protecting against unreasonable searches, and the Fourteenth Amendment, which guarantees equal protection under the law. After some years of decline now Adams has brought back the bad old days, with 59% of stops being carried out against Black people. 'In 2020, there were a little more than 9,544 stops, according to the monitor. That number decreased by around 600 in 2021, the year before Adams took office. In 2022, the number of reported stops rose to 15,102. The number of stops again rose in 2023, when nearly 17,000 stops were reported.' Eric Adams often gives the appearance of not being the sharpest knife in the drawer but he certainly knows how to win an election. Whipping up a crime panic is a sure path to political success. All the better if the person stoking the fear is himself a Black man who dilutes any action against racist policies. Not only did Donald Trump invite Penny for a hang out, but he has also defended Eric Adams, who is now under federal indictment on bribery charges . Trump says that Adams has been 'treated pretty unfairly ' and adds that he would consider pardoning him if he is found guilty. Now Adams is hoping to get a ticket to Trump’s inauguration . Such is the life of a Black man who plays his cards right. He wins the mayoralty by placating racist fears, uses the power of his office against Black people, and cozies up to a president-elect who honors a racist killer. If history gives us any indication, Adams may end up being mayor again.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWet_9MfW6XVCWR-gT2ZIAJz	2024-12-18T16:35:52-08:00	
Charismatic Leadership: Legal, Political And Moral Costs – Analys...	Constitutions are foundational documents that shape the political and legal structure of a nation. In democratic systems, they are intended to establish a clear separation of powers, protect individual rights, and ensure that governance is responsive to the needs of the people. However, leaders in countries like Venezuela, Russia, and Turkey have exploited constitutional amendments to centralize power, eroding democratic institutions. Indonesia faces similar risks with proposals like presidential term extensions and reintroducing state policy guidelines (PPHN), raising concerns over potential abuses of power. This article examines these issues through global comparisons and suggests reforms to safeguard democracy. Hence, the following lines are examining how the mechanism of constitutional amendments can be misused to consolidate power and undermine democratic norms, a phenomenon known as abusive constitutionalism. By analyzing cases from Turkey, Russia, Venezuela, and China, it explores how leaders manipulate legal frameworks to entrench authority and foster a cult of personality. The paper highlights preventative measures such as eternity clauses, the basic structure doctrine, and civil society engagement as safeguards to protect democracy. It also considers how Indonesia can strengthen its constitutional framework to prevent authoritarianism. Using conceptual legal research and a comparative approach, this study aims to answer three key questions: (1) What drives the proposed constitutional amendments in Indonesia? (2) How do these proposals align with principles of constitutionalism and democracy? (3) What safeguards can prevent abusive constitutional practices in Indonesia? It seeks to address the research questions by evaluating how constitutional amendments have led to abusive constitutionalism, focusing on Indonesia's current proposals. Cases from countries such as India, Colombia, and Venezuela provide insights into how term limit extensions, power shifts, and personalization undermine democratic principles. The study emphasizes the role of civil society in maintaining accountability. II. Constitution, Legal Order and Political Power 2.1 Comparative Framework: Abusive Constitutionalism in a Global Context Abusive constitutionalism, as defined by David Landau, refers to the manipulation of constitutional mechanisms to undermine democracy under the guise of legal reform. This global phenomenon has been observed in countries like Hungary, Venezuela, Turkey, China, Colombia, and Indonesia. Tactics include extending presidential terms, weakening checks and balances, co-opting judicial institutions, and consolidating power under the rhetoric of stability or national progress. In Colombia, the 1991 constitution limited the president to a single term to prevent the rise of authoritarian leaders, seeking to entrench power. However, President Álvaro Uribe Vélez sought to amend the constitution to allow re-election, raising concerns about democratic backsliding. Similarly, in Venezuela, constitutional reforms extended the presidential term from one four-year term to two six-year terms, enabling Hugo Chávez to consolidate power. Like Colombia’s example, these amendments were framed as necessary for national progress, but they ultimately allowed for the rise of authoritarian rule. In Hungary, the ruling party employed both amendments and replacements to the constitution to consolidate power. This included adding more constitutional court judges, restructuring key state commissions, and making it more difficult to amend the constitution in ways that could challenge the ruling party’s dominance. These measures illustrate how constitutional reforms can be used as tools for entrenching power, rather than reforming governance. Similar trends are observable in Indonesia, where proposed constitutional amendments, such as reintroducing the National Guidelines (PPHN), may serve to further centralize authority in the hands of the president. Rosalind Dixon and David Landau’s concept of Abusive Constitutional Borrowing highlights how democratic frameworks are repurposed for authoritarian control, often by weakening institutions like constitutional courts or anti-corruption bodies. Research shows that while leaders frequently attempt to evade term limits through constitutional changes, public resistance, rather than judicial intervention, is often the key deterrent. The global patterns suggest that Indonesia’s proposed amendments may not aim to improve governance but rather consolidate power, exemplifying Landau’s concept of abusive constitutionalism. 2.2 SEA as a Case Study: Current Constitutional Proposals This section examines the largest country of Southeastern Asia, that or RI's proposed constitutional amendments, specifically the reintroduction of the National Guidelines (PPHN) and the extension of the presidential term, highlighting their potential to reshape the country's political landscape. While these proposals are framed as governance and stability enhancements, they raise concerns about democratic principles and the risk of power consolidation. While Article 37 provides a structured framework for constitutional amendments, it centralizes power within the People’s Consultative Assembly (MPR), raising concerns about potential abuse. The MPR could prioritize the interests of the ruling party, potentially undermining democratic accountability. Key concerns include: Reintroduction of the PPHN: This could centralize policy control under the People’s Consultative Assembly (MPR), weakening the independence of other state institutions. Presidential Term Extension: Extending the presidency to three terms risks eroding safeguards against power personalization and weakening democratic consolidation. Though Article 37 legitimizes the amendment process, it also reveals vulnerabilities where mechanisms intended to enable constitutional change can be exploited for undemocratic purposes. This aligns with global trends in abusive constitutionalism, where amendment processes are used to entrench power rather than strengthen democracy. The subsequent analysis will assess whether these proposals represent genuine reforms or potential abuses. 2.3 The Role of the Cult of Personality in Consolidating Power The cult of personality is a political strategy where leaders create a heroic and idealized image to centralize authority, often undermining institutional governance. Personalization of power centralizes decision-making, undermining institutional integrity and democratic norms. While it may offer short-term stability, it often results in volatile governance. A comparative analysis of China, Russia, and Turkey illustrates how personalization of power influences governance and constitutional changes. In China,Xi Jinping has constructed a cult of personality through state propaganda, portraying himself as indispensable to China's future. The removal of presidential term limits in 2018 marked a significant step toward consolidating indefinite rule, shifting governance from a collective leadership model to a centralized and personalized system. This strengthens Xi’s authority but risks long-term instability. Similarly, Vladimir Putin has cultivated a strongman image tied to Russia's global resurgence. Constitutional changes in 2020 reset term limits, allowing him to stay in power until 2036. Unlike China, Russia maintains a façade of democratic institutions, which are systematically weakened to ensure control. In Turkey, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan has used populist rhetoric to reshape governance. The 2017 constitutional referendum transitioned Turkey from a parliamentary to a Semi-Presidential system (of the French type), granting Erdoğan extensive executive powers while eroding judicial and legislative independence. His leadership demonstrates how personalization can align institutional frameworks with individual authority. All three leaders use propaganda, legalistic and legal mechanism of constitutional amendments, and weakened institutional checks to consolidate power. However, their methods differ: China relies on institutional propaganda, Russia undermines democratic processes while maintaining a democratic façade, and Turkey invokes populist narratives. While Indonesia faces some risk of developing a cult of personality under a charismatic leader like President Prabowo Subianto, its democratic safeguards act as barriers. The multi-party system, decentralized governance, and two-term presidential limit reduce the risk of power concentration. Additionally, Indonesia's historical experience with Suharto’s authoritarian regime has fostered societal resistance to personalization of power. However, threats like media control, weakened institutions, or populist appeals remain, making vigilance and reform essential for preserving democracy. 2.4 Abusive Constitutionalism: Detection and Prevention The personalization of power, as observed in China, Russia, and Turkey, often manifests through constitutional amendments that consolidate authority. To counteract such trends, it is essential to explore mechanisms that protect constitutional integrity and democratic principles from being abused—a concern that resonates with Indonesia's ongoing constitutional debates. Abusive constitutionalism, where leaders manipulate constitutional amendments to entrench their power, poses a significant threat to democratic integrity. Lessons from India, Colombia, and Venezuela highlight strategies to prevent such practices, focusing on eternity clauses, the basic structure doctrine, and civil society involvement. These mechanisms aim to protect the constitution’s fundamental principles from being jeopardized by constitutional amendments. Eternity Clauses Certain core democratic principles, like executive power limitations, should be enshrined as unalterable. For example, Colombia used eternity clauses to block amendments extending presidential terms, with civil society and courts preserving institutional integrity. Likewise, Indonesia’s constitution already includes immutable clauses (e.g., protecting the unitary state), but clauses related to term limits and the balance of powers should also be safeguarded. Basic Structure Doctrine This doctrine, pioneered in India, ensures that fundamental constitutional principles cannot be amended. In Kesavananda Bharati v. State of Kerala (1973), India’s Supreme Court ruled that constitutional amendments cannot alter the constitution's core framework. Indonesia’s judiciary could adopt similar judicial review mechanisms to block amendments concentrating power in the presidency or weakening checks and balances. Civil Society Active civil society is crucial for resisting constitutional abuses. Public pressure and grassroots activism can expose and challenge manipulative amendments. For example, Venezuela’s failure to maintain an independent judiciary or robust civil society allowed repeated amendments that eroded democracy under Hugo Chávez. In contrast, Colombia and India demonstrate how civil society and judicial action can resist overreach. Indonesia’s vibrant civil society and constitutional safeguards have so far resisted elite-driven amendments, such as proposals for term extensions or system changes justified as necessary for stability. However, increasing media control and elite-driven reforms in Indonesia make public engagement and judicial oversight ever more crucial to prevent potential abuses of democratic principles. Summary and outlook This analysis highlights the risks posed by selected countries’ proposed constitutional amendments, which aim to strengthen the executive branch through measures like extending presidential terms and reintroducing the PPHN of largest country in SEA. These changes mirror trends in Russia, Turkey, and China, where centralizing power fosters a cult of personality, erodes institutional independence, and undermines democratic principles. The amendments could diminish democratic accountability, weaken institutional safeguards, and pave the way for authoritarian rule by concentrating power among political elites. To counteract such risks, these countries must strengthen checks and balances, adopt mechanisms like eternity clauses and the basic structure doctrine, and ensure robust civil society engagement in constitutional processes. A political culture emphasizing pluralism, transparency, and institutional independence is imperative to preserving democratic values and preventing the personalization of power. The analysis concludes that while constitutional reforms may be justified as necessary for progress, history shows their potential to consolidate power and erode democracy, emphasizing the importance of preventive measures against authoritarianism.

Trump’s Ukraine Plan – Analysis	The Russian-Ukrainian war, which began with the annexation of Crimea in 2014 and escalated into a full-scale conflict in 2022, has caused immense suffering for countless individuals and devastated entire communities. Economically, Ukraine has incurred losses exceeding $500 billion, according to the World Bank. Addressing this ongoing crisis requires more than political manoeuvring; it demands a compassionate, innovative, and multifaceted strategy that incorporates diplomacy, economic recovery, and international collaboration. Donald Trump's proposed approach, based on his well-known deal-making philosophy, aims to bridge divides and rebuild lives through direct negotiations, conditional economic sanctions, demilitarized zones, peacekeeping operations, and energy independence. While his strategy offers a pragmatic path to ending the conflict, it faces significant challenges. This essay explores the potential of Trump’s proposal, acknowledges its complexities, and argues that careful execution could foster lasting peace and hope for Ukraine’s future. At the core of Trump’s plan is the initiation of direct peace talks between Russian President Vladimir Putin and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, mediated by Trump or another neutral actor. This direct engagement highlights the urgency of ending the war and echoes Trump’s past diplomatic successes, such as the Abraham Accords, which normalized relations between Israel and several Arab nations. These accords demonstrate the power of personal diplomacy in resolving entrenched conflicts. Historical parallels, including the Camp David Accords of 1978, further illustrate how leader-to-leader negotiations can pave the way for peace. However, the personal animosity and mistrust between Putin and Zelenskyy complicate this proposal. Nevertheless, U.S.-brokered talks, framed with trust-building measures, could lead to immediate ceasefires, prisoner exchanges, and humanitarian aid agreements, offering a glimmer of hope to those caught in the crossfire. Economic sanctions are a critical pillar of Trump’s strategy. He envisions sanctions as both a carrot and a stick—easing them conditionally in exchange for Russian withdrawals and adherence to ceasefire agreements while tightening them if violations occur. Sanctions have already shown their effectiveness, as evidenced by Russia’s 2.2% GDP contraction in 2022 and the freezing of $300 billion in foreign reserves. However, sanctions alone cannot compel peace. If poorly managed, they risk entrenching hostilities or appearing to reward aggression. Still, conditional easing tied to verifiable steps toward de-escalation could incentivize compliance and open avenues for trust. The challenge lies in balancing accountability with the flexibility needed to encourage diplomatic progress. Another cornerstone of Trump’s plan is the establishment of a demilitarized zone (DMZ) in contested regions like Donbas. A DMZ could serve as a buffer, reducing the risk of accidental escalations and providing space for dialogue. The Korean DMZ, established in 1953, exemplifies how such arrangements can prevent further violence. However, defining acceptable boundaries is fraught with difficulties, especially as Ukraine insists on reclaiming sovereignty over all its territories. International monitoring, possibly through peacekeeping operations, is essential to enforce such an agreement and protect civilians, ensuring the DMZ does not become a flashpoint for renewed tensions. Peacekeeping forces are another vital element of Trump’s proposal. Neutral missions, potentially led by NATO or UN coalitions, could oversee ceasefires, monitor DMZs, and facilitate humanitarian aid. Past successes, such as NATO’s interventions in Bosnia (1995) and Kosovo (1999), highlight how coordinated peacekeeping efforts can stabilize war-torn regions. However, Russia’s strong opposition to NATO's involvement complicates this approach, necessitating creative solutions, such as involving non-NATO actors or neutral countries. Ensuring impartiality while maintaining operational strength will require nuanced diplomacy and unwavering international commitment. Territorial disputes over Crimea and Donbas remain some of the most contentious aspects of the war. Trump’s plan proposes negotiating autonomy agreements for these regions, seeking a compromise that balances Ukraine’s sovereignty with Russia’s security concerns. Yet, these proposals face resistance from both sides. Ukrainian leaders and citizens, motivated by their resilience and sacrifices, view territorial concessions as unacceptable. Conversely, Russia’s insistence on legitimizing its annexations underscores deep-rooted grievances and power dynamics. Addressing these disputes requires empathy for the pain and loss experienced on all sides while crafting fair and practical solutions. Economic reconstruction is pivotal to the strategy. Trump envisions leveraging international financial institutions like the IMF and World Bank to rebuild Ukraine’s infrastructure and revitalize its economy, thereby reducing long-term vulnerabilities. Comparisons to the Marshall Plan, which aided Europe’s recovery after World War II, emphasize the transformative potential of coordinated aid. Successful implementation hinges on transparency, accountability, and collaboration among donor nations. Ensuring that funds reach the communities most affected by the war—particularly displaced families and businesses—will be key to fostering trust and stability. Energy security is another integral aspect of Trump’s proposal. The war has revealed Europe’s dependence on Russian gas, with 40% of its imports sourced from Russia in 2021 (International Energy Agency). Trump’s strategy envisions enhancing Europe’s energy independence through increased U.S. LNG exports and investments in renewable energy infrastructure. While this shift could diminish Russia’s economic leverage, transitioning to alternative energy sources requires significant investment and time. Nonetheless, such measures could help Europe protect itself from future geopolitical crises, illustrating the intersection of energy policy and national security. Despite its potential, Trump’s plan faces profound challenges. The deep mistrust between Russia and Ukraine, exacerbated by years of propaganda and violence, complicates negotiations. Unresolved territorial disputes prevent either side from making significant concessions. The risk of failed ceasefires or provocations—whether deliberate or accidental—further undermines confidence in a lasting resolution. Geopolitical tensions, particularly between NATO and Russia, add another layer of complexity, alongside the humanitarian challenges of addressing the needs of over eight million displaced Ukrainians. Any sustainable solution must prioritize the voices and well-being of those most affected by the war’s devastation. In light of these obstacles, implementing Trump’s plan should commence with confidence-building measures such as localized ceasefires, humanitarian aid corridors, and prisoner exchanges. Neutral mediators, including countries unaffiliated with NATO or Russia, could play a crucial role in facilitating dialogue and reducing perceptions of bias. Robust verification mechanisms—overseen by trusted international organizations—would be essential to ensure accountability and transparency. Finally, the international community must remain steadfast in its support, providing not only financial aid but also moral solidarity to those enduring the conflict’s daily realities. In conclusion, Trump’s plan to end the Russian-Ukrainian war provides a framework grounded in pragmatic diplomacy, economic incentives, and international collaboration. By prioritizing human dignity and addressing the immediate needs of those most affected, this strategy aims to transform the current stalemate into a pathway for hope and healing. While significant obstacles remain, the plan’s multifaceted approach highlights the importance of empathy, resilience, and a shared commitment to peace. If implemented with care and compassion, it has the potential to not only end the war but also lay the foundation for a stable and secure future for Ukraine and its people.

Year-End Review Of India’s Neighborhood Policy And Prospects In 2...	Geopolitical challenges and opportunities for India in 2025 New Delhi will have to hone its diplomacy to foresee and meet the challenges that might arise in its geopolitical domain. Events in 2024 have given a foretaste of what might be expected. The year 2025 is expected to pose significant challenges and also offer equally significant opportunities to India in its bid for dominance over its geopolitical domain. Countries that immediately matter to India are Nepal, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, the Maldives and also Myanmar. Indo-US, Sino-Indian, and Sino-US relations will also have a bearing on India's prospects in the region. South Asia 2024, which is on its last legs, has given a foretaste of what is to come. There were significant changes in the environment. The pro-Indian Sheikh Hasina regime in Bangladesh was toppled in August by a mass movement which New Delhi neither anticipated nor handled skilfully. It took New Delhi five excruciating months to send Foreign Secretary Vikram Misri to mend fences with the Interim Government led by Nobel Laureate Dr. Muhammad Yunus. Misri's foray smoothened ruffled feathers in Bangladesh. But the communal passions whipped up in India over the alleged atrocities against Hindus in Bangladesh, are not helping the restoration of full normalcy. In Sri Lanka, a leftist and avowedly nationalistic political party, the Janatha Vimukth Peramuna (JVP), was swept to power creating apprehensions in New Delhi. But the Indian Establishment quickly moved in with offers of grant projects to wean the rulers away from China, the JVP's traditional ally. As of now, India-Sri Lanka relations are on an even keel with prospects of their remaining so looking good. The recent State Visit of Sri Lankan President Anura Kumara Dissanayake showcased a spirit of mutual understanding. Projects which were controversial were either been dropped or put on the backburner or left for further discussions. In the Maldives, a pro-China and anti-Indian regime led by President Mohamad Muizzu was tamed by judiciously using the stick and the carrot. But the Muizzu regime could become an embarrassment if its popularity, already showing signs of waning, declines further due to missteps in managing the economy and the public disenchantment that could intensify. Therefore, New Delhi will have to keep a close tab on the goings on in the Mizzu administration and also on the public sentiment. Nepal has always been a problem for India because of the dominance of its communist parties with their pro-China proclivities. The Modi regime's bid to promote Hindu nationalism in a country which is largely communistic in orientation and New Delhi's tendency to use strong arm methods to subdue belligerent Nepalese politicians had backfired in the past. Continuing with his habitual anti-Indian line, the current Nepalese Prime Minister, K.P.Sharma Oli, visited Beijing recently creating an apprehension in New Delhi about possible Chinese moves in Nepal. Myanmar, always unstable, is on the boil again with armed rebel tribal groups in the North bordering India gaining dominance over troops of the junta in power at Yangon. India has been supporting the junta consistently despite the latter's persecution of democrats, the Christian non-Bamar tribal groups, and the Muslim Rohingyas in the norther districts bordering North-East India. Since China had a hold on the junta, India had thought it fit to also cultivate the junta rather than the tribal rebels and the persecuted democratic groups. In recent times, the junta has been suffering reverses against the rebel armies in areas bordering India, triggering a minor refugee influx into India's North Eastern States, populated by kindred Christian tribes. If the situation in North Myanmar worsens, the influx could become a flood, destabilizing India's North East, in which, one of the States, Manipur, has been burning for months due to a conflict between the Hindu Meities and Christian Kukis. United States The ascent of maverick Donald Trump in US politics poses its own unpredictable challenges for India. Trump's reported moves to meet China's X Jinping and probably strike a deal with him, should worry India as India has for long been counting on US technological and intelligence inputs to counter China's threatening moves on the Sino-Indian border. There have been reports saying that the US and China have signed an agreement on scientific cooperation and that Trump had invited Xi to attend his inauguration as US President in January. Though Trump has made overtures to Modi calling him a friend, there is no knowing if he would actually give concessions to India on trade and tariffs and also on visas and immigration. 2024 saw an unprecedented Indo-US face off over the cross-boundary extra-judicial killing of a Canadian citizen of Indian origin in Canada and an alleged plot to kill an American citizen of Indian origin in the US by Indian intelligence agents. These cases remain putting India-US relations under a strain. Close on the heels of these unusual developments, came the indictment of the Indian tycoon and Modi acolyte, Gautam Adani, by a US court for alleged attempts to bribe Indian officials to get lucrative energy projects using the money of US investors. Whether the Trump Administration will help the Modi regime to pull its chestnuts out of the fire for the sake of India-US strategic cooperation is yet to be seen. China Sensing a downturn in its relations with the US, New Delhi warmed up to the long-time adversary, China. Modi and Xi broke the ice by talking on the side lines of the BRICS summit in Kazan (Russa) in October. India's Economic Advisor, said that India should welcome Chinese investment in some sectors to increase exports. More recently, the Indian and Chinese military agreed on patrolling rights on the Sino-Indian border in East Ladakh. It is now reported that China and India will revive the periodical talks between their Special Representatives. These were suspended due to military face offs on the border. Media reports said that in January, India's Special Representative and National Security Advisor, Ajit Doval, will fly to Beijing to meet his Chinese counterpart, Foreign Minister Wang Yi to take forward the talks on the border dispute and other outstanding issues. An India-China thaw appears to be on the cards, at least for now.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWet_9MfW6XVCYfjrwjYW0C_	2024-12-18T16:23:04-08:00	
Feeding Chaos: Israel Cripples Syria’s Defence – OpEd	The justifications are always the same. We are moving into territory for security reasons. We are creating a temporary buffer zone from which tactical advantage can be gained against potential dangers. Then, over time, these buffers become strategic fixtures, de facto real estate seizures and annexations. Israel now finds itself in what was a United Nations-patrolled buffer zone on the Golan Heights, and Turkey is established in parts of northern Syria, keeping a watchful eye on Kurdish militants. Since October 7 last year, Israel’s response to the attacks by Hamas has been one of sledgehammers and chisels, a conscious attempt to broaden the conflict beyond its Palestinian confines to targeting the Lebanese militia group Hezbollah and its sponsor, Iran. In doing so, Israel has played an increasingly destructive role in Syria, where Hezbollah targets and Iranian supply lines have been struck with regularity. The move is intended to cripple Teheran’s Axis of Resistance, a patchwork of Shia militias spanning Iraq, Yemen, Lebanon and Syria. With the collapse of Bashar al-Assad in Syria, Israel intends further disruption. This marks a departure from a policy it had maintained with Assad for some years, one that permitted him and the Syrian Arab Army to operate without molestation subject to one stern caveat: that Hezbollah and, by virtue of that Iran’s influence, could also be contained. This point is made in documents recently unearthed by the New Lines magazine, one that directly involved a channel of communication between an Israeli operative code-named 'Mousa' (Mosses) and the Syrian Defence Minister Lt. Gen. Ali Mahmoud Abbas. A message dated May 17, 2023 outlines Israel’s indignation at an incident involving the firing of three rockets on Israel from the Golan Heights, an action purportedly instructed by Khaled Meshaal and Saleh al-Arouri of Hamas. 'Lately, because of Quds Day and Flag March, we are observing Palestinian activities on your land […] We warn you of the prospect of any activity of these parties on your territory and we demand you to stop any [Iranian] preparations for the use of these forces on your territory – you’re responsible for what is happening in Syria.' The collapse of Assad’s rule, spearheaded by Hayat Tahrir Al-Sham (HTS), has brought Israeli intentions to the fore. The group’s leader, Mohammed al-Julani, has made previous mutterings favouring the Hamas October 7 attacks and expressing solidarity with the Palestinian cause. Since then, al-Julani has expressed no desire to do battle 'with Israel or anyone else and we will not let Syria be used as launchpad for attacks', promised to protect minority rights and disband rebel groups for incorporation into the Ministry of Defence, and dissembled on whether the new administration would be focused on Islamic law. On December 10, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu made fairly redundant remarks that his government had no intention meddling in Syria’s internal affairs, only to warn Assad’s successors that any move allowing 'Iran to re-establish itself in Syria or allows the transfer of Iranian weapons or any other weapons to Hezbollah, or attacks us – we will respond forcefully and we will exact a heavy price from it.' Defence Minister Israel Katz similarly warned Syria’s triumphant rebel forces that 'whoever follows in Assad’s footsteps will end up like Assad did. We don’t allow an extremist Islamic terror entity to act against Israel from beyond its borders… we will do anything to remove the threat.' Since Assad’s fleeing on December 7, Israel’s air force has made it a priority to destroy the military means of any successor regime in Damascus, citing concerns that material would fall into the hands of undesirable jihadists. Over December 10 and 11, 350 strikes were conducted on anti-aircraft batteries, airfields, weapons production sites including chemical weapons, combat aircraft and missiles (Scud, cruise, coast-to-sea and air-defence varieties) in Damascus, Homs, Tartus, Latakia and Palmyra. 'I authorised the air force to bomb strategic military capabilities left by the Syrian army,' reasoned Netanyahu, 'so that they would not fall into the hands of the jihadists.' A bold estimate from the IDF about the operation described as 'Bashan Arrow', was that it had destroyed approximately 70-80% of the strategic military capabilities of Assad’s Syrian Arab Army. As of December 16, the total number of strikes Israel has conducted on Syrian territory has reached 473. For any advocate of stability, which would require some measure of military capability, this could hardly augur well. Over the course of this glut of sorties, Israeli troops have militarised the demilitarised zone inside Syria created in the aftermath of the 1973 Arab-Israeli War, including Mount Hermon, a site overlooking Damascus. The menacing move on Syrian territory was sanitised by IDF military spokesperson Colonel Nadav Shoshani: 'IDF forces are not advancing towards Damascus. This is not something we are doing or pursuing in any way.' Both the Beirut-based Mayadeen TV, and the UK-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights have taken the gloss off such assessments, stating that the IDF has moved within 16 miles of the Syrian capital. Crippling the infrastructure of the state that awaits the fledgling ruling parties in Syria, who can only count themselves as a ragtag transitional entity at this point, stirs an already turbulent, precarious situation. The very scenario which Netanyahu and his planners wish to avoid, and Assad sought to prevent, may well be realised.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWet_9MfW6XVCVSImCsqq4-8	2024-12-18T16:16:39-08:00	
Malaysians Guilty Of Roles In 2002 Bali Bombings Released From Gu...	By Muzliza Mustafa Two Malaysians who pleaded guilty for their roles in the 2002 Bali bombings were in their government’s custody after the United States announced their repatriation from the military prison at Guantanamo Bay, where they were locked up for 18 years. The duo, Mohammed Farik bin Amin and Mohammed Nazir bin Lep, were turned over to Malaysian authorities, according to a statement from the home ministry in Kuala Lumpur. 'The unity government has received from the United States government the two Malaysian nationals, Mohammed Farik bin Amin and Mohammed Nazir bin Lep, who were in prison since 2006 at the Guantanamo Bay Detention Camp on the principle of human rights and support for universal justice,' the ministry said in a statement Wednesday. However, it did not mention whether the two would be sent to a Malaysian prison upon being repatriated from the U.S. naval base in Cuba. In January, a U.S. military judge at Guantanamo Bay sentenced bin Amin and bin Lep to five more years in prison after they pleaded guilty to five charges connected to their supporting roles in twin bombings that killed 202 people in October 2002 – Indonesia’s deadliest-ever terror attack. Their repatriation this week was made in secret and information was released to their lawyers at the last minute. Lawyer Brian Bouffard said his client, bin Lep, was a changed man and ready to be reunited with his family. Their repatriation this week was made in secret and information was released to their lawyers at the last minute. 'It is now more than two decades since Nazir was taken. He has grown in that time, and is today a man of peace who will live the remainder of his life in peace. We are grateful to everyone, in Malaysia and in the U.S., who understood that it was time to bring Nazir home,' Bouffard said in a text message to BenarNews. In its own statement, the U.S. Defense Department said both men had provided testimony before their departure against Indonesian Encep Nurjaman (Hambali) the alleged mastermind of 'al-Qaeda-affiliated attacks on nightclubs in Bali, Indonesia, in 2002, and the attack on the J.W. Marriott Hotel in Jakarta, Indonesia, in 2003.' Hambali is expected to stand trial before a military court at Guantanamo Bay on similar charges against him. As part of their plea agreements, bin Amin and bin Lep could not return to the United States for any reason, making it necessary for them to testify before leaving, Bouffard said. Arrested in Thailand in 2003, bin Amin and bin Lep were held at a CIA black site before being transferred to Cuba in 2006. They pleaded guilty in January to murder, conspiracy and three other charges linked to the Bali bombing that killed over 200 people. Previously, a source who requested anonymity for privacy concerns, told BenarNews that both were likely to be sent home before U.S. President-elect Donald Trump’s inauguration on Jan. 20. 'There has been concern following Trump’s victory in the U.S. election. But we leave it to the government and the authority to work on it. Our hope is for him to be released soon,' the source said. We love him Relatives of bin Lep were elated that he is back in Malaysia. Professing his love for his younger brother, Najib Lep, 60, said he had already made plans to reintegrate him back into the society. 'We love him. We will take care of him and his welfare when he returns to us,' Najib told BenarNews. 'For now, we have yet to receive any information from the Malaysian authorities. What we’ve got so far is just details from the media. Nevertheless, we cannot be more happy and grateful to Allah.' A source, who requested anonymity to ensure the safety of bin Amin’s family, said they were ready to welcome him home. 'Mohammed Farik has expressed his desire to care for his ailing parents upon return. His siblings have prepared a place for him to stay and will provide other necessary assistance for him. It will take time to readjust as he has been away from home for more than 20 years.'The family is not ready to speak to the press and is waiting for clearance to meet Mohammed Farik,' the source told BenarNews.Bin Amin’s parents, ages 82 and 88, had been made aware of his return. Lawyer Christine Funk said she and other members of bin Amin’s legal team were overjoyed by the prospect of their client being back in Malaysia. 'Mr. bin Amin said it best at his sentencing, when he told the Commission, the prosecution, the victim family members, and the observers, ‘Instead of trying to change the world, I can only change myself. And over the past 20 years, I have changed. I am not an angry young man anymore. I am a reformed man,’' Funk said in a statement to BenarNews, adding he planned to 'go forward as a good and peaceful Muslim.' Funk said the other members are confident that bin Amin will succeed. Malaysian National Police Chief Razarudin Husain said the pair were to be evaluated and rehabilitated before being reintegrated into society, adding 'everyone deserves a second chance. 'Both individuals are in good and healthy condition and feel blessed that they are able to return home and finally reunite with their family,' he said in a statement about bin Amin and bin Lep. 'Both showed a positive attitude and openness toward the evaluation process and rehabilitation and have expressed their high commitment to become progressive members of society.' Congress notified last month Leading up to their release, U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin notified Congress on Nov.14 'of his intent to repatriate' the Malaysians 'and, in consultation with our partners in Malaysia, we completed the requirements for responsible transfer,' the statement from the Pentagon said. A 30-day notice must be filed before such transfers can occur. Court documents state that beginning at the end of 2001, 'including the periods before, during, and after the October 12, 2002, Bali bombings,' bin Lep and bin Amin helped Hambali 'transfer money for operations, and obtain and store items such as fraudulent identification documents, weapons and instructions on how to make bombs.' With the transfer, the number of detainees at Guantanamo Bay has been reduced to 27, the Pentagon said.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWet_9MfW6XVCfx3o3vNCgAV	2024-12-18T16:10:02-08:00	
Europe Needs A Coordinated Approach To Industrial Policy – Analys...	Industrial policy is having a moment in Europe, as countries increasingly turn to sectoral policy interventions to address the challenges of geopolitical fragmentation and economic security, enhance productivity, and accelerate the green transition. State aid spending by European Union countries has tripled in the last decade, reaching 1.5 percent of GDP. Much of this aid flowed into green technologies and energy efficiency, with major economies like France, Germany, Italy, and Spain driving the surge. As the recent report from Mario Draghi suggests, there is a growing consensus that even more such spending is necessary to spur growth. But before rushing ahead, it is important to take stock. A new IMF working paper shows that the success of industrial policy depends not just on how much is spent, but on spending it well: targeting the right priorities and avoiding costly missteps. When poorly designed and targeted, industrial policies tend to fail. Good intentions aren’t enough Under the right circumstances, industrial policy can deliver tangible economic gains and strengthen economic resilience. By being focused on addressing market failures—such as by fostering innovation in sectors with knowledge spillovers (think of green technology) or enabling regional clustering (think of Silicon Valley)—it can boost productivity and incomes. However, even the best-intentioned policies can backfire if poorly coordinated. Powerful interventions, such as subsidies or tax breaks, that expand production and lower costs in a particular sector in one country will have the opposite effect in another, undermining comparative advantages and creating inefficiencies. Model simulations offer cautionary lessons. Unilateral industrial policies are a losing strategy for most EU countries, given their openness to trade. Without careful design, unilateral policies risk triggering powerful spillovers and spillbacks across the region that outweigh their benefits. As another IMF working paper shows, this is already a concern: European state aid benefits recipient firms but is often detrimental to others. Why coordination matters The solution is clear: Europe’s industrial policies need a unified, coordinated framework. When countries align their efforts, the benefits of industrial policy can outweigh the costs. Coordinated policies preserve the gains from trade, ensure a level playing field, and make full use of the EU’s single market. Simulations underscore this point. In a scenario where the EU acts as an integrated region and adopts a well-targeted industrial policy, better outcomes are obtained than under fragmented, country-specific approaches. Coordination prevents costly distortions of production patterns and trade prices between EU countries. As workers and firms are assumed to move freely across the single market, this can maximize the policy’s benefits. Importantly, coordination can help cushion any adverse impact on regions that might otherwise lose out, including through potential use of intra-EU fiscal transfers, fostering solidarity across the bloc. Building a better framework Existing EU state aid rules provide a starting point but fall short of what is needed to guide strategic industrial policies across Europe. Better data sharing and unified programs could enhance transparency and trust among member states. A centralized decision-making body could streamline priorities and better allocate resources to areas of mutual benefit. The creation of the Airbus venture almost half a century ago showed that coordination at scale can work: this collaborative, multi-country initiative combined resources and expertise to create a globally competitive player. Similar efforts could unlock the potential of Europe’s green and tech transitions. Deeper integration is an essential part of the equation. A stronger single market for goods, services, and capital with more labor mobility would amplify the effectiveness of industrial policies, allowing firms to scale up (see also Regional Economic Outlook for Europe, October 2024). An ambitious EU budget or centralized fiscal capacity could further support shared priorities. Europe and beyond Europe’s industrial policies have global implications. Subsidies and trade adjustments don’t stop at the EU’s borders, underscoring the need for engagement with multilateral fora such as the World Trade Organization. The right industrial policies can help where markets fall short. By embracing coordination and integration, the EU can ensure its policies foster growth, innovation, and productivity—while avoiding costly pitfalls. —This article is based on the IMF Working Paper 'Industrial Policy in Europe: A Single Market Approach', by A.

INS Nirdeshak: A Quiet Enabler Of India’s Maritime Strategy In Th...	Geopolitical competition has deepened across the Indo-Pacific. Amid this, India is quietly advancing its maritime capabilities to consolidate its role as a regional stabiliser. On December 18, 2024, the Indian Navy will commission INS Nirdeshak, the second of four Survey Vessel Large (SVL) ships, in Visakhapatnam. The commissioning of a hydrographic survey vessel might seem low on the spectrum of naval power projection. However, INS Nirdeshak marks a key shift in how India prepares for the evolving challenges of a contested Indo-Pacific theatre. Built indigenously in Kolkata by Garden Reach Shipbuilders & Engineers (GRSE), INS Nirdeshak is more than a support ship— it is a strategic enabler, a force multiplier, and an understated symbol of India’s growing technological prowess and maritime aspirations. Its induction reinforces New Delhi’s bid to assert itself as a key maritime power while aligning with its broader Security and Growth for All in the Region (SAGAR) policy. The Overlooked Strategic Utility of Hydrographic Survey Ships While aircraft carriers and frigates often dominate headlines, hydrographic survey vessels like INS Nirdeshak are vital to maritime dominance in the 21st century. These ships provide the foundation upon which naval operations rest— accurate undersea mapping, navigational safety, and resource exploration. For India, a nation deeply invested in safeguarding the strategic choke points of the Indian Ocean Region (IOR), hydrographic intelligence is indispensable. With a displacement of 3,800 tonnes and a length of 110 meters, INS Nirdeshak is equipped with cutting-edge hydrographic and oceanographic survey systems, sub-surface sensors, and satellite-based navigation tools. These technologies enable the vessel to map coastal zones, deep-sea areas, and undersea topographies with unmatched precision. This capability comes at a critical juncture. The IOR, once regarded as a largely stable waterway, is now a hotspot of power competition, driven by China’s increasing naval activity. Beijing’s research vessels— often doubling as intelligence-gathering platforms— have intensified their presence, raising concerns over undersea surveillance and resource exploitation. INS Nirdeshak, therefore, enhances India’s ability to monitor its own waters while ensuring that maritime data remains a strategic asset under its control. Indigenisation: Advancing Self-Reliance and Naval Diplomacy The commissioning of INS Nirdeshak carries another, equally significant message— India’s commitment to self-reliance under its Aatmanirbhar Bharat (Self-Reliant India) initiative. Over four-fifths (80%) of the vessel’s components have been sourced domestically, including the indigenously developed DMR 249A steel that forms its hull. Indian firms like BEL, BHEL, Avantel, and ECIL have supplied the vessel’s advanced communication and positioning systems, demonstrating a remarkable leap in India’s defence-industrial capabilities. Regarding global outreach, India positions itself as a potential exporter of cost-effective and versatile maritime solutions by showcasing its ability to produce advanced naval platforms domestically. For other nations in the Indo-Pacific— particularly smaller ones Southeast Asia and Africa— India’s shipbuilding expertise could serve as an attractive alternative to Chinese offerings. Enhancing Maritime Domain Awareness in the Indo-Pacific The deployment of INS Nirdeshak will significantly augment India’s Maritime Domain Awareness (MDA) capabilities. As the IOR becomes increasingly contested, the need for accurate seabed data, navigational routes, and undersea surveillance has never been greater. The vessel will enable India to identify strategic undersea chokepoints, resource clusters, and submarine operating areas by conducting comprehensive hydrographic surveys. This capability aligns with India’s role as a regional net security provider. Through initiatives like the Information Fusion Centre – Indian Ocean Region (IFC-IOR), India shares maritime data with partner nations to improve regional security. INS Nirdeshak will feed into this information network, allowing India to enhance its operational preparedness while supporting regional allies. India’s leadership in hydrographic capabilities also has a soft power dimension. For decades, the Indian Navy has assisted smaller coastal states with hydrographic surveys, fostering goodwill and strengthening bilateral ties. A Strategic Signal Amid Growing Competition INS Nirdeshak’s induction is also symbolic in light of China’s aggressive forays into the Indian Ocean. China’s dual-use 'research' vessels, like the Yuan Wang and Xiang Yang Hong series, have sparked concerns about espionage and seabed mapping in waters close to India. By commissioning advanced survey ships like INS Nirdeshak, India is signalling its intent to monitor and secure its maritime backyard. The vessel’s ability to stay at sea for over 25 days, combined with its advanced sensors and navigation systems, ensures that India’s undersea intelligence-gathering capabilities remain a step ahead. In the era of undersea warfare, where submarines and unmanned vehicles dominate naval strategies, survey ships are an often overlooked yet vital asset. Building Toward 2047: A Future-Ready Indian Navy INS Nirdeshak is part of a larger modernisation strategy that aims to make the Indian Navy a Fully Aatmanirbhar Force by 2047. India’s emphasis on domestic shipbuilding reflects its understanding of how defense autonomy translates into strategic strength. The SVL project, which includes the upcoming sister ships Ichhak and Sanshodhan, highlights India’s ability to design and construct complex naval platforms with minimal foreign input. As India prepares to assume a greater leadership role in the Indo-Pacific, investments in hydrographic capability, maritime domain awareness, and regional partnerships will define its strategy. INS Nirdeshak is not just a vessel— it is a quiet but powerful enabler of India’s maritime future. Charting New Waters In a region where naval power is increasingly measured by technological sophistication and information dominance, the commissioning of INS Nirdeshak marks a decisive step forward for India. Beyond its hydrographic role, the vessel symbolises India’s growing capacity to safeguard its maritime interests, responsibly project power, and stabilise the Indo-Pacific. For the broader Eurasian strategic community, INS Nirdeshak’s induction serves as a timely reminder that maritime dominance is not just about ships armed with missiles but also the vessels that quietly map, monitor, and secure the seas.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWe6dX7MBfuzb_S0WWb4ToUR	2024-12-17T17:17:18-08:00	
Political Instability In South Korea Should Lead To Questions Abo...	In South Korea, only a democracy since 1987, a 'reverse January 6' has happened. Instead of storming the legislative building to undermine democracy and interfere with the results of a free and fair election—as in the United States and Brazil—protesters helped South Korean lawmakers swarm past armed troops to end President Yoon Suk Yeol’s short-lived attempt at martial law. It is hoped the perpetrator of this power grab to exterminate the young democracy will be evicted, in one way or another, from office in short order. In any case, such political instability should raise questions about the continued stationing of 30,000 U.S. troops on South Korean soil. They may have been needed after the Korean War (1950-1953) to prevent North Korea from invading the then-poor South Korea again. However, South Korea has undergone an economic miracle in the ensuing seven decades while the communist and chronically destitute North Korea has undergone periodic famines. South Korea now has a GDP that is 60 times that of the North and should be able to defend itself. Yet, South Korea routinely underspends on its military because it has a shield of U.S. nuclear and conventional weapons protecting it. The United States, which has a staggering national debt of 36 trillion and rising, must encourage its wealthy allies to make more significant efforts for their defense, as they soon may be pressured to do when Donald Trump takes office. Trump should first announce that over five years, the United States would gradually withdraw all 30,000 troops, which now act as just a tripwire for a massive U.S. intervention if North Korea attacks the South again. During those five years, South Korea would be incentivized to spend more on defense and rapidly upgrade its already capable military forces. Because any North Korean invasion would need to proceed down mountain valleys into the South, it should lessen the difficulty of defending against such an attack. North Korean invasion forces would be very vulnerable to attack from the air in those confined areas as they move South—being caught in a shooting gallery. North Korea has a large, lumbering military, but well-to-do South Korea has, or can buy, much better military technology. Communist North Korea, which has been impoverished by a dysfunctional economy, has trouble doing either. Critics of such a change in U.S. policy argue that the United States turning over more defense responsibilities to South Korea might result in South Korea going nuclear to match North Korean nuclear weapons capabilities. Spanning authoritarian and democratic governments over the decades, South Korea has always been a responsible player internationally, as has Japan. Under Joe Biden, Japan and South Korea—two U.S. allies that have been mutually suspicious of each other because of Japan’s past treatment of South Korea before and during World War II—have now reconciled. If either one of those upstanding countries became nuclear powers to better defend themselves against China and North Korea, it would not be the worst thing that ever happened because they likely would have a deterrent from attack independent of the United States. Also, by giving wealthy South Korea (and maybe Japan) incentives to do more for their defense, U.S. security policy in East Asia could be more flexible. A lower-key U.S. approach to the static defense of South Korea—perhaps as a balancer of last resort in a dire emergency—could allow more U.S. attention to prodding Taiwan to augment its defenses against perhaps a more acute threat from China. Even after withdrawing U.S. forces from South Korea, the United States could arrange a base-access agreement that U.S. military forces could use in any dire regional emergency—for example, during any general war with China. South Korea would certainly have an incentive to agree to such arrangements. Finally, deployed U.S. forces definitely should not get involved in any internal suppression of dissent or violence in South Korea. Such disturbances could find them. In short, South Korea can remain a nation friendly to the United States without 30,000 U.S. troops being stationed there.

US Officials Take Credit For Regime Change In Syria – OpEd	Officials in the Biden administration are taking credit for creating conditions in Syria that enabled opposition forces to overthrow the Syrian government. Now that opposition forces have ousted Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, administration officials are insisting that longstanding U.S. policies, including actions taken by the Biden administration against Assad’s supporters, made the overthrow of the Syrian government possible. Administration officials deny that they aided Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), the U.S.-designated terrorist organization that led the drive to overthrow Assad, but they insist that they facilitated the opposition’s victory, citing years of U.S. efforts to empower the opposition and weaken the Syrian government. U.S. policy 'has led to the situation we’re in today,' State Department Spokesperson Matthew Miller said in a December 9 press briefing, the day after Assad fled the country. It 'was developed during the latter stages of the Obama administration' and 'has largely carried through to this day.' White House Spokesperson John Kirby agreed, giving credit to the president. 'We believe that developments in Syria very much prove the case of President Biden’s assertive foreign policy,' Kirby said in remarks to the press on December 10. U.S. Policy For over a decade, the United States has sought regime change in Syria. Officials in Washington have openly called for an end to the rule of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, the repressive and authoritarian leader who first began ruling Syria in 2000, following decades of rule by his father, Hafez al-Assad. U.S. efforts to oust Assad date back to 2011, when Syria descended into a civil war. As Assad responded to popular uprisings with violent crackdowns, the United States began supporting multiple armed groups, several of which were seeking the overthrow of the Syrian government. The Obama administration designed the initial U.S. strategy to oust Assad. Hoping to avoid 'catastrophic success,' or a situation in which extremists ousted Assad and seized power, the administration decided on a stalemate strategy. The United States provided opposition forces with enough support to keep pressure on Assad but not enough to overthrow him. The administration’s goal was 'a political settlement, a scenario that relies on an eventual stalemate among the warring factions rather than a clear victor,' U.S. officials explained at the time, as reported by The Washington Post. The Obama administration came close to achieving its objectives in 2015, when opposition forces began moving into areas around Damascus. With Assad under growing pressure, it appeared that he might lose his grip on power and be forced to negotiate or surrender. As opposition forces gained momentum, however, Assad received a lifeline from Russia, which intervened to save him. By coming to Assad’s assistance with airstrikes and military support, Russia enabled Assad to turn the tide against the rebels and remain in power. Following Russia’s intervention, the civil war largely settled into stalemate, which left Syria divided into different areas of control. Assad consolidated his control of Damascus and the surrounding areas with support from Russia, Iran, and Hezbollah. Many opposition forces regrouped in northwestern Syria, where they received support from Turkey. Kurdish-led forces, which were separate from the opposition, carved out an autonomous region in northeastern Syria, keeping another part of the country outside of Assad’s control. Keeping Pressure on Assad As the civil war cooled, U.S. officials maintained its strategy of stalemate. Although they believed that Assad had secured his position in Damascus, they remained convinced that they could still pressure him into resigning, primarily by keeping him weakened and denying him a victory. U.S. policies to keep Assad weakened spanned the administrations of Barack Obama, Donald Trump, and Joe Biden. These policies included the diplomatic isolation of Assad, severe economic sanctions on Syria, ongoing military strikes inside Syria, and additional support to opposition groups. With Syria becoming a 'cadaver state,' as an official in the Trump administration described it, U.S. policies also kept the country dismembered. By preventing Assad from regaining control of areas that he had lost in the war, U.S. officials hoped to pressure him into accepting a political transition. U.S. officials focused much of their efforts on the Kurdish-led forces in the northeast, an area that includes strategically important wheat fields and oil reserves. Although the Kurds did not seek to overthrow Assad, wanting instead official recognition for their autonomous region inside Syria, U.S. officials knew they could undermine Assad by keeping northeastern Syria outside his control. At the same time, U.S. officials worked to ensure that opposition forces remained in control of northwestern Syria. Even with the region controlled by HTS, a U.S.-designated terrorist organization, U.S. officials abetted the group’s operations, viewing HTS as 'an asset' and believing it was critical to keeping Syria dismembered. 'I just did everything I could to be able to monitor what they were doing and ensuring that those people who spoke to them knew what our policy was, which was to leave HTS alone,' former U.S. diplomat James Jeffrey acknowledged in a 2021 interview with the PBS program Frontline. Questions about the Biden Administration’s Approach Since the Biden administration entered office in 2021, however, it has been largely quiet about its intentions for Syria. Although the administration appeared to continue the strategy of stalemate, mainly by keeping Assad weakened and Syria dismembered, administration officials rarely expressed a great deal of interest in the country. As administration officials grew quiet, some lawmakers grew suspicious, wondering whether the Biden administration was abandoning the project of ousting Assad. During a 2022 congressional hearing, congressional leaders criticized the administration for creating an impression that it had accepted Assad’s rule. 'I remain concerned this administration has accepted Assad’s rule as a foregone conclusion,' U.S. Senator James Risch (R-ID) remarked. From 2022 to 2023, a number of U.S. allies in the Middle East began moving to restore relations with Assad. In May 2023, Arab leaders welcomed Syria back into the Arab League, ending its suspension from the organization. Officials in the Biden administration criticized the moves, but they did not express any interest in returning to the more volatile dynamics of the civil war. In fact, recent news reports indicate that the Biden administration was working to forge a deal in which Assad cut ties to Iran in exchange for reductions in pressure on his government. This major diplomatic push, which involved the United States and its Gulf allies, preceded the recent armed uprising that ousted Assad, leading to speculation that the Biden administration had been anticipating a future in which the Syrian leader remained in power. Revivals and Surprises After HTS began its offensive in late November 2024, the Biden administration revived a familiar playbook. Resorting to the ideas and tactics of its predecessors, the administration presented HTS’s maneuvers in a manner that fit with a policy of stalemate. In a December 1 interview with CNN, National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan pointed to the stalemate framework by making two basic points. The first was that the Biden administration had concerns about HTS, which Sullivan placed 'at the vanguard' of the uprising. 'We have real concerns about the designs and objectives of that organization,' he said, acknowledging it is a U.S.-designated terrorist organization. His second point was that the Biden administration did not see the actions taken by HTS as particularly worrisome, as they could potentially weaken the Syrian government. 'We don’t cry over the fact that the Assad government, backed by Russia, Iran and Hezbollah, [is] facing certain kinds of pressure,' Sullivan said. Even as administration officials saw advantages to be gained from the stalemate strategy, however, it remained unclear just how much pressure the Biden administration wanted HTS to put on Assad. Once HTS began making rapid gains, officials appeared to grow concerned. 'These are not good folks,' White House Spokesperson John Kirby said on December 2, referring to HTS. Still, some observers indicated that there was a strategic logic to HTS’s moves. Former U.S. official Andrew Tabler, who worked on U.S. policy toward Syria in the Trump administration, suggested at a policy forum hosted by The Washington Institute that the uprising could test Assad’s capabilities. 'They just decided to sort of poke the front lines, so to speak, in a very dramatic way,' Tabler said. Tabler acknowledged that HTS’s uprising revealed significant weaknesses in Assad’s capabilities, but he anticipated that it would take several years to pressure Assad into leaving office. Like many officials in Washington, he saw the offensive as a way to increase pressure on the Syrian government rather than the beginning of the end to Assad’s rule. 'This is a challenge to the regime, but it’s not going to lead to its immediate collapse,' Tabler said. In fact, many U.S. officials did not anticipate that the offensive would lead to a sudden collapse of the Syrian government. Given that Assad had previously survived a comparable challenge in 2015, there were strong beliefs both inside and outside of Washington that Assad and his supporters would continue to repel opposition forces. 'I think the entire international community was surprised to see that the opposition forces moved as quickly as they did,' Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin later noted. 'Everybody expected to see a much more stiff resistance from Assad’s forces.' It was only once opposition forces began to take control of Aleppo in early December, about a week before Assad fled the country, that the Biden administration began planning for the possibility of Assad’s downfall, according to U.S. officials. When 'we saw the fall of Aleppo, we started to prepare for all possible contingencies,' a senior official in the Biden administration explained. Indeed, the speed of the opposition’s movement caught many of the highest-level officials in the Biden administration by surprise, as they had been working on the assumption that Assad would remain in power for the immediate future. 'We didn’t directly see the fall of Assad,' State Department Spokesperson Matthew Miller acknowledged. Shifting Balance of Power Regardless of the ebb and flow of the Biden administration’s Syria policy, years of U.S. actions have clearly taken a toll on Syria. Just as U.S. officials have claimed, the United States played a central role in creating the conditions that led to Assad’s ouster. Since the Obama administration first devised the strategy of stalemate, which helped transform Syria into a dismembered cadaver state, Assad ruled over a devastated country, one that may never recover. The Biden administration’s resurgent American empire has also had major consequences for Syria. By spending the past two years supporting Ukraine against Russia and the past year backing Israel’s military offensives across the Middle East, the Biden administration has implemented policies that have imposed major costs on Assad’s supporters, especially Russia, Iran, and Hezbollah. Without external support, the longtime Syrian leader could no longer withstand violent challenges to his rule. Shortly after the fall of Assad, President Biden recognized the implications of his administration’s actions, claiming in a major address that U.S. policies set the stage for Assad’s downfall. Even while acknowledging that 'some of the rebel groups that took down Assad have their own grim record of terrorism and human right abuses,' he proudly insisted that his administration’s actions had made regime change possible. Indeed, President Biden has been quick to take credit for the overthrow of another government in the Middle East. Rather than being open about the implications of 'catastrophic success,' Biden has taken pride in how he and his predecessors have implemented policies that enabled a U.S.-designated terrorist organization to force Assad from the country. 'Our approach has shifted the balance of power in the Middle East,' Biden said. Through a 'combination of support for our partners, sanctions, and diplomacy and targeted military force when necessary, we now see new opportunities opening up for the people of Syria and for the entire region.'

Last Acts: Time For Biden To Pardon Assange – OpEd	Since making what was likely a life-saving plea deal to spare himself from the medieval barbarities of the US prison system, Julian Assange, and his campaign intimates, are now focusing on the next step. Having been directly targeted by the speech stomping apparatus known as the US Espionage Act, and convicted under it, the US government made the WikiLeaks publisher an example. On June 24, 2024, he pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy to obtain and disclose national defence information under the Act, or section 793(g) (Title 18, USC). In one respect, it was an improvement, reducing the original charge sheet of 18 alleged offences, 17 of them based on elements of espionage. While Assange’s conviction delighted those scribbling defenders of the national security state, the toadies, the paid-up worthies, and anyone from the CIA to CBS ('Assange: hacker, thief and exposer of confidential sources!' came the shrill voice of approval), his prosecution and ultimate conviction on a single charge of the Espionage Act served only one purpose: pouring oil on obtaining, using and discussing material about the crimes and vices of national security, notably the sort supplied by whistleblowers. One way of diminishing the sinister implications of that thuggish legacy is to persuade Freedom Land’s highest, doddering magistrate to show a skerrick of good sense – whatever is left of it. The Assange campaign has now shifted its focus to obtaining a pardon for the publisher, with a goal of persuading up to 30,000 people to write to US President Joe Biden to do just that. 'By granting a pardon to Julian Assange,' the campaign online site states, 'President Biden can not only correct a grave injustice but also send a powerful message that defending democracy and press freedom remains at the core of his presidency. He can reaffirm America’s dedication to truth and the First Amendment.' Two US lawmakers are convinced that one of Biden’s last acts in office should be just that. It would be fitting, in some ways, that he does so. In the dying days of his administration, President Barack Obama commuted the sentence of one of WikiLeaks’ most invaluable sources, Chelsea Manning. While it fell short of a pardon, its effect was to modify the crushing sentence of 35 years imposed by a military tribunal for disclosing classified government information to WikiLeaks. Last month, US Reps. James McGovern (D-Mass.) and Thomas Massie (R-Ky.) penned a letter to Biden approving the 'resolution of the criminal case against' the WikiLeaks founder, thereby ending his 'protracted detention', permitting him to return to Australia and be reunited with his family. But they expressed grave concerns 'that the agreement that ended the case required Mr Assange to plead guilty to felony charges under section 793 of the Espionage Act'. Doing so 'set off alarms' among various members of Congress and advocates of free speech and freedom of the press by setting 'a precedent that greatly deepens our concern.' It was, fundamentally, 'the first time the Act has been deployed against a publisher'. The letter went on to note that section 793 of the Espionage Act had always posed a risk that it could be used against journalists and news organisations 'particularly those who cover national security topics' as it 'criminalizes the obtaining, retaining, or disclosing of sensitive information'. It was precisely that risk that 'informed the Obama administration’s decision not to prosecute Mr Assange'. Accordingly, 'a pardon would remove the precedent set by the plea'. As for the prospects for an actual pardon from the Biden Whitehouse, one can hardly tell. Certainly, the president is in a frightful muddle after pardoning his own son Hunter for felony gun and tax convictions, an act of familial indulgence he said he would never succumb to. It was also complicated by its sheer broadness. In his justification, Biden’s words struck a familiar note, largely because they could have come out of the mouth of his opponent and successor, Donald Trump. While he believed 'in the justice system […] I also believe raw politics has infected this process and it has led to a miscarriage of justice'. CBS is now reporting that Biden is ruminating over the possibility of issuing various pre-emptive pardons for senior White House aides and members of the House Jan. 6 committee in anticipation of any retributive campaign that might be waged by the incoming Trump administration. Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders has also publicly urged the president to do the same. The president has also granted clemency to almost 1,500 individuals placed in home confinement during the COVID-19 pandemic, and pardoned 39 individuals convicted of non-violent crimes. Could all of this possibly make Biden mellow towards the man he once accused of high-tech cyberterrorism? A pardon would go some way to thinning the toxic legacy Assange’s conviction under the Espionage Act, one that, by its very nature, signals a global warning to all publishers and journalists involved in exposing the crimes and misdemeanours of state. Assange was the first non-US national foreign publisher working outside the United States to be charged and convicted under that archaically oppressive law, ostensibly for injuring the national security of the US when exposing the identities of informants and sources. Assange’s plea deal, much like his entire prosecution, is also imbued with farce and gross pantomime. Was former New York Rep. Peter King right to claim, as he did in November 2010, that the WikiLeaks publications were 'worse even than a physical attack on Americans', worse, even, 'than a military attack'? Not according to the Northern Mariana Islands Chief Judge, Ramona V. Manglona, presiding over the final proceedings facing the publisher. 'The government has indicated that there is no personal victim here. That tells me the dissemination of this information did not result in any known physical injury.' If Biden is of the belief that raw politics infected the prosecution of his son, the shoddy case against Assange is even clearer. It was political, personal and misguided. Here was a vindictive effort, steered by characters of such clouded malevolence as former CIA director Mike Pompeo and an overzealous prosecution team in the Department of Justice, to punish a figure who had muddied the sanctimonious waters of the Imperial Republic. As he has now assumed the mantle of pardoner-in-chief, Biden has a chance to bulk the folder and make history of the right sort.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWe6dX7MBfuzbxGWoFpaqyYZ	2024-12-17T17:14:21-08:00	
The Slow Motion Death Of Syria – OpEd	By José Niño On December 8, 2024, the 24-year reign of Syrian strongman Bashar al-Assad came to an end after a rebel coalition of Al-Qaeda offshoots, Turkish proxies, and other Islamist militants overwhelmed the capital of Damascus. In effect, a Sunni Islamist saturnalia brought an end to the Middle East’s last secular Arab government. The Assad family, starting with Hafez al-Assad in 1971, has held an iron grip on Syrian politics for over five decades. As committed members of the Arab Socialist Ba’ath Party, the Assads aligned with rivals to the West and Israel such as the Soviet Union, the Islamic Republic of Iran, and later on the Russian Federation. For it being a perennial thorn in the US‘s and Israel’s side, Syria was mentioned as a potential target for regime change by neoconservative policy advisors Richard Perle and Douglas Feith in their policy document A Clean Break: A New Strategy for Securing the Realm. The neoconservative plan, authored in 1996, was directed to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who was serving his first term as Israeli prime minister. The proposals outlined in the document have guided the foreign policy grand strategies of the ultranationalist Likud coalition that has dominated Israeli politics in the last three decades in addition to American Zionists across the political aisle. During the Global War on Terror, the Syrian regime and the then-administration of George W. Bush briefly became strange bedfellows on the issue of torture. Because the Bush administration could not torture suspected terrorists during interrogations on US soil, it turned to the controversial practice of extraordinary rendition to circumvent restrictions on torture. As former CIA agent Robert Baer candidly put it, 'If you want them to be tortured, you send them to Syria.' Whatever rapprochement took place between Syria and the US during the Bush year soon evaporated after the Arab Spring uprisings of 2011. After a series of protests, Syria spiraled into a state of civil war, where Sunni militants embedded themselves in the protests and soon mounted a full-fledged revolt against the Assad regime. These so-called 'moderate rebels' received patronage from Gulf Arab states such as Saudi Arabia and Qatar. Even more radical Islamist sects such as the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) attempted to carve out their own statelet in eastern Syria. Always looking for a new conflict to get its dirty paws in, the CIA under Barack Obama launched the clandestine operation Timber Sycamore with the aim of providing the 'moderate rebels' with military aid. The name of the game here was regime change as the euphoria of the Arab Spring convinced DC elites democracy was an inevitability across the Middle East. Other Middle Eastern players were not so keen on jumping on the pro-democracy bandwagon. In the early stages of the Syrian Civil war, Iran and its Lebanese proxy Hezbollah came to the Assad regime’s defense, which raised further alarms in Tel Aviv and the pro-Zionist NGO consortium in Washington, D.C. At the request of the Assad regime, Russia decisively intervened in 2015 to prop up the embattled Syrian government as the conflict began to spiral out of control. Turkey added further fuel to the fire by directly intervening in northern Syria in 2016 to back up its Islamist proxies while subsequently launching punitive campaigns against Kurdish elements in northeastern Syria it deemed as terrorist entities. What started out as a routine civil war, the Syrian Civil War became a magnet for external actors vying for influence in the Levant. Although the threat of ISIS largely subsided during the presidency of Donald Trump due to the rare instance of the US, Iran, and Russia putting their differences aside and launching operations to crush the extremist group, the US maintained a firmly anti-Assad stance. On two occasions, Trump authorized airstrikes against the Syrian government for its alleged use of chemical weapons. Further, the Trump administration implemented the crushing Caesar sanctions in 2019 in another attempt to crush the Assad regime. To Trump’s credit, he made a genuine attempt to withdraw the US’s 900 troops stationed in Syria in 2019. However, his orders were countermanded by Pentagon leaders who would re-deploy troops to the oil-laden Deir ez-Zor province in eastern Syria – another move designed to undermine the Assad regime. For some time, the Syrian conflict appeared to enter a frozen state as a result of the Astana discussions held by Iran, Russia, and Turkey starting in 2017. These multi-year discussions would be focused on determining the fate of Syria after years of domestic upheavals and foreign interventions in its affairs. In the end, these discussions created a false peace. After years of hard fighting that depleted the country’s resources, growing corruption, tightening sanctions, the US’s looting Syria of its wheat and oil, the Assad regime finally reached a breaking point in the final months of 2024. Syrian troop demoralization did not help matters, as evidenced by lackluster pay for soldiers ($7) and generals ($40). Syrian forces were exhausted and demoralized, which proved fatal for the Syrian state after Islamist militant group Hay’at al Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) and other allies launched an offensive against the city of Aleppo towards the end of November. In short order, the Syrian military crumbled and the Islamist rebels overran the country with little to no resistance in the ensuing week. Amusingly, Abu Mohammad al-Jolani, the emir of HTS and the de facto leader of Syria after Assad’s departure, has a $10 million bounty on his head for previously engaging in terroristic activity. To casual observers of international affairs, this seems like a bizarre turn of events. However, the US has a long track record of backing Sunni extremists in great power conflicts — from the Caucasus all the way to Xinjiang — as a means of creating geopolitical quagmires for its rivals. The US backing the likes of HTS and similar organizations is par for the course. In fact, there is already talk of the US and its NATO allies removing HTS’s terrorist designation because of the group’s alleged pragmatic turn, which is more likely a cynical reward for the group’s successful effort to topple the Assad government. It remains to be seen if HTS’s pivot to moderation is genuine. Though it would be wise to not get ahead of ourselves here. The Syrian Civil War is far from over, and it might be entering a new phase similar to that of the Libyan Civil War as extremist factions duke it out to determine who will be king of the hill in the Levantine state. For his part, president-elect Donald Trump has good instincts on recent events in Syria. In an X post he published on December 7, 2024, he proclaimed, 'Syria is a mess, but is not our friend, & THE UNITED STATES SHOULD HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH IT. THIS IS NOT OUR FIGHT. LET IT PLAY OUT. DO NOT GET INVOLVED!' The only quibble here is the US has been 'involved' in Syrian affairs in some capacity for over a decade. As mentioned before, the US has used tools spanning covert operations to harsh sanctions to destabilize the country. The damage is already done, and chaos awaits Syria. For now, US leaders should exercise some self-awareness and admit their interventions have cause unwarranted degrees of suffering abroad, Syria included. Sober minds should also acknowledge there is no critical national security interest at stake in Syria, nor does the country pose an existential threat to the US. With the US dealing with a wide array of domestic problems, ranging from mass inflation to a ballooning national debt, the last thing it should entertain is getting involved in another Middle Eastern geopolitical scuffle.

The US Government’s Building Fiscal Crisis – OpEd	Government spending is going through the roof as the outgoing Biden-Harris administration cements its fiscal legacy of failure. That’s not an understatement. Even U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen is apologizing for the administration’s sad fiscal performance. Here are her comments from the Wall Street Journal‘s CEO Summit on December 12, 2024: WSJ: One not-so-great aspect of the legacy you and President Biden leave behind is a very large budget deficit, roughly 6% of GDP. Are you sorry you couldn’t make any progress on that, and how much of a risk does that pose to the economy? YELLEN: I am concerned about fiscal sustainability, and I am sorry that we haven’t made more progress. I believe that the deficit needs to be brought down, especially now that we’re in an environment of higher interest rates. Over the past year, the interest cost of the debt has increased by several hundred billion. It’s one of the largest items responsible for the increase in the budget deficit, so we do need to bring it down. One day earlier, the U.S. Treasury Department she runs reported the federal government is spending money far faster than ever as its fiscal year gets underway. The chart below shows how its rate of spending of the past two months compares to the previous two fiscal years: The chart confirms revenue is not the problem. Tax collections during the first two months of FY 2025 have kept up with both FY 2023 and FY 2024 at this point of time. The amount of money the government collects in taxes is consistent across all these fiscal years. It is also worth noting that the federal government went on to collect a record amount of revenue in FY 2024. Unrestrained Spending Growth is the Real Problem The chart shows how much higher the U.S. government’s spending has been so far in FY 2025 compared to the previous two fiscal years. The Biden-Harris administration has somehow managed to cram the equivalent of three months of FY 2024’s spending into the first two months of FY 2025. Going back to Janet Yellen’s remarks, she cites the rising interest cost of the U.S. government’s total public debt outstanding as a major problem. If you’re wondering why she is apologizing, it is because she is personally responsible for that problem. Her mismanagement of the nation’s debt has been called the 'worst fiscal blunder in U.S. Treasury history.' Worse, because spending is rising so fast, the national debt has surged during the first two months of FY 2025. Even with the Federal Reserve cutting interest rates, the federal government’s cost of interest on the money it has borrowed will surge in December. The Biden-Harris administration’s legacy of unrestrained spending growth is building toward a fiscal crisis for the U.S. government.

A Decisive Moment For Argentina’s Stabilization Plan: Now It’s Th...	Argentina’s Stabilisation Plan has entered its decisive phase. The IMF must play a vital role. By Ernesto Talvi and Sofía Harguindeguy This is the decisive moment to capitalise on the successes achieved so far by the Argentine Stabilisation Plan and the sacrifices asked of the population, to set the country on the path to eradicating the scourge of inflation, macroeconomic instability and recurrent crises. The quickest, most reasonable and, indeed, most logical way to achieve this is a new agreement with the IMF to provide Argentina with fresh funds (international reserves that it currently lacks) to dispel the spectre of external debt restructuring, lift currency controls smoothly while keeping expectations anchored, and thus ensure the programme’s success. Argentina has already travelled a long way on its own, without external conditions imposed by any outside agent, which, in the past, would have led swiftly to an IMF agreement: severe fiscal adjustment; a sharp tightening of monetary policy; a cleanup of the Central Bank’s balance sheet; a capital repatriation amnesty; and an ambitious agenda of structural reforms. With these foundations, an agreement with the IMF is perfectly attainable. Achieving it would set a virtuous cycle in motion: the certainty of repaying foreign currency debt amortisations would further reduce country risk to levels compatible with Argentina’s re-entry into international capital markets; and lifting currency controls would enable the inflow of investments in strategic sectors that, under the RIGI framework, are waiting for the end of currency restrictions to be deployed.[1] All of this would likely result in a vigorous economic recovery. One could argue that history is not on Argentina’s side: that the IMF’s exposure to Argentina is already too high; that it is its largest debtor; and that too many stabilisation plans have failed in the post-war period, even the most promising and enduring, like the Convertibility Plan of the early 90s. Also, that under these conditions, reaching a new agreement with the IMF will be difficult. Perhaps so. But there are always moments in the lives of countries and institutions —and certainly of people— when, to make history, you must break with history. That is the challenge. Nothing more, nothing less. Analysis The Stabilisation Plan of President Javier Milei’s government, launched just days after he took office on 10 December 2023, has now entered its decisive phase. The fiscal adjustment, the cornerstone of the plan, was much faster and more severe than one might have expected from a government with a minority in Congress, facing predictable resistance from unions and social movements. Yet, against all odds, this is exactly what happened, and the results have been remarkable. Although achieving these results has come at a high social cost (recession, declining incomes and rising poverty), approval ratings of the government are still very high. How did we get here? Why are we now at a decisive phase? What role does the IMF play at this stage? This analysis aims to answer these questions. 1. The pillars of the Stabilisation Plan These are the essential components of the Stabilisation Plan: (1) a severe fiscal adjustment; (2) a severe monetary tightening; (3) a clean-up of the Central Bank’s (BCRA) balance sheet; (4) an end to monetary financing of the NFPS fiscal deficit and the BCRA’s quasi-fiscal deficit; (5) an initial devaluation of 100% in the official exchange rate and pre-announced 2% monthly depreciation, while retaining exchange controls; and (6) a capital amnesty. 1.1. Severe fiscal adjustment The fiscal adjustment amounted to around 5% of GDP, leading to a swift elimination of the fiscal deficit. It primarily focused on reducing primary public spending, with all spending categories experiencing significant real reductions compared with the first nine months of the previous year. The reductions included capital spending (-80%), transfers to provinces (-70%), public sector wages (-26%) and pensions (-23%) (see Figure 1 a-d). Figure 1. Fiscal policy Source: INDEC, BCRA and Ministry of Finance. Figure 2. Monetary and exchange rate policy Source: BCRA. 1.2. Severe monetary tightening The plan also began with a severe monetary tightening. Real liquidity in domestic currency dropped 20% to 30%, depending on the liquidity indicator used (see Figure 2.a). The resulting illiquidity is evident in the dramatic increase in the spread between the interest rate charged by banks on personal loans and the BCRA’s interest rate (previously on interest-bearing liabilities, now on LeFI).[2] The spread, which reflects the opportunity cost of holding liquid money, rose from an average of 2 percentage points (200 basis points) in November 2023 to an average of 25 percentage points (2500 basis points) between December 2023 and October 2024 (see Figure 2.b). 1.3. Clean-up of the Central Bank’s (BCRA) balance sheet The BCRA’s interest bearing liabilities were exchanged for Treasury Notes (LECAP and LeFI), transferring the responsibility for interest and principal payments to the National Treasury (see Figure 2.c). This measure eliminated an automatic source of monetary expansion (the interest payments on BCRA liabilities) and restored the BCRA’s independence in setting the monetary policy rate.[3] Additionally, puts held by the financial system were repurchased from banks, allowing the BCRA to extinguish almost 80% of this stock (see Figure 2.d),[4] thereby deactivating a potential source of monetary expansion outside of its control. 1.4. End of monetary financing of the NFPS fiscal deficit and the BCRA’s quasi-fiscal deficit The combination of restrictive fiscal and monetary policies meant that in the first nine months of the year the main source of growth in the BCRA’s monetary base was the purchase of dollars to strengthen the international reserves position (see Figure 2.e). This was possible because the severe contraction in local currency liquidity not only led the markets to sell dollars to the BCRA for pesos, but also enabled the BCRA to issue its interest-bearing liabilities in domestic currency (now scarce and revalued) at substantially lower rates. This facilitated a dramatic reduction in the interest rate on the BCRA’s interest-bearing liabilities (see Figure 2.f). 1.5. Initial devaluation of 100% of the official exchange rate and pre-announced 2% monthly depreciation, while retaining exchange controls The official exchange rate acts as the monetary anchor of the plan. The maintenance of exchange controls, known as the cepo in Argentina, serves partially, and for practical purposes, as a substitute for the international reserves that the BCRA currently lacks to support the exchange rate parity (see Figure 2.g). 1.6. Capital amnesty The capital repatriation amnesty introduced by the government is a scheme allowing individuals and companies to regularise undeclared assets, both in Argentina and abroad, by paying a special tax.[5] Furthermore, the government has announced its intention to eliminate the databases of those who participate in the amnesty, aiming to prevent these taxpayers from facing future taxes on the regularised assets. To join the programme, taxpayers must open a Special Asset Regularisation Account (CERA) at an authorised local financial institution. The funds deposited in these accounts must remain in the system until 31 December 2025. If the regularised funds are invested in public securities issued by the Argentine government, taxpayers may be exempted from the special tax. 2. Macroeconomic outcomes The macroeconomic results of the Plan came in fast: The parallel or blue dollar stabilised, and the gap with the official rate narrowed from 160% at the start of the plan to less than 20% (see Figures 3.a and 3.b). Expectations for the official exchange rate aligned with the government’s announced guideline of a 2% monthly depreciation (see Figure 3.c). Inflation decreased significantly, at a pace much faster than the market expected, and inflation expectations converged to the implicit guideline in the plan: an annualised devaluation of 27% plus international inflation (see Figures 3.d and 3.e). Primarily as a result of the capital repatriation amnesty, banking system deposits increased by over US$12 billion, reaching a higher level than at the end of former President Mauricio Macri’s term (see Figure 3.f). Due to peso illiquidity and, more recently, the capital repatriation amnesty, BCRA’s dollar purchases increased substantially, boosting international reserves (see Figure 3.g). Country risk dropped from 2,500 basis points at the start of the plan to less than 1,000, in recent weeks on the back of the success of the capital repatriation amnesty and its incentives to invest in government securities (see Figure 3.h). After a sharp initial economic contraction project at 4% this year, a rebound is expected in 2025, with the economy projected to grow at 3.5%, following the typical pattern of stabilisation plans that begin with severe monetary tightening (see Figure 3.i). Other real variables are also displaying common patterns observed in stabilisation plans of this nature: a sharp initial decline in real wages followed by a recovery (see Figure 3.j); initially negative real interest rates that later shift to positive levels (see Figure 3.k); and an appreciation of the real exchange rate (see Figure 3.l). Figure 3. Macroeconomic outcomes Source: INDEC, BCRA, Ámbito and JP Morgan. 3. A decisive phase and the IMF’s vital role The Stabilisation Plan has entered its decisive phase. To capitalise on the excellent results achieved so far and the significant sacrifices made by the population, the government needs to make a final push. The next phase of the Stabilisation programme presents two major challenges: (a) lifting currency controls; and (b) meeting the foreign currency debt amortisation schedule in what remains of 2024 and 2025. To address both challenges, Argentina requires a level of international reserves it currently lacks. To tackle the second challenge, the government is negotiating with a consortium of international banks to secure a short-term loan known as a ‘repo’ (repurchase agreement). Such an agreement would provide immediate funds by offering sovereign bonds or gold reserves as collateral, with a commitment to repurchase them at a later date. The primary goal of this repo is to strengthen the Central Bank’s international reserves and ensure debt payments due in January 2025. However, to achieve the first challenge —lifting exchange controls smoothly—the funds from the repo are insufficient, thus delaying the timing for doing so. Without access to the international capital markets, there is only one reasonable and logical way to simultaneously meet both objectives: a new agreement with the IMF that injects sufficient fresh funds to replenish Argentina’s international reserves. If successful, this would set in motion a virtuous cycle: the assurance of foreign currency debt repayment would further reduce country risk to levels compatible with the re-entry of Argentina to the international capital markets; and lifting currency controls would open the door for investments in strategic sectors that, under the RIGI framework, are waiting for currency restrictions to be lifted. All of this would likely result in a vigorous economic recovery. How much fresh funding are we talking about? Considering the remaining external debt amortisations for 2024 and 2025 (excluding those with the IMF, multilateral organisations and official bilateral agreements) and the reserve stock needed to lift currency controls without triggering the risk of destabilising expectations and ‘de-anchoring’ the Plan, we estimate that Argentina requires around US$45-48 billion in gross international reserves. Currently, it holds US$28 billion. Is an agreement of this magnitude possible? Let us take a closer look. 4. Towards an agreement with the IMF The key elements in negotiating an agreement with the IMF typically involve the following: A fiscal target. A reserve accumulation target. The definition of the exchange rate and monetary policy regime. The amount of new financing that would be provided by the IMF. Agreeing on a fiscal target should not be an obstacle in the negotiations. Argentina has already implemented a fiscal adjustment of 5% of GDP by its own decision, without any external conditions imposed. It currently has a primary surplus of 1.4% of GDP, and markets expect that surplus to continue into 2025. This ensures that Argentina will maintain balanced fiscal accounts this year and the next. The internation reserves target should aim to increase the stock of international reserves from US$28 billion to US$45-48 billion over the next three years, implying an annual reserve accumulation target of US$5-7 billion per year, a goal that is achievable solely through seigniorage and the inflation tax. With the ‘cleanup’ of the BCRA’s balance sheet already completed and monetary policy instruments restored, the exchange rate regime after lifting exchange controls must be defined. Two constraints limit this transition. First, Argentina will need to accumulate international reserves for the foreseeable future by purchasing dollars in the market. This means the exchange rate cannot float freely downward, as the BCRA will have to intervene by buying dollars to meet the reserve accumulation target. Secondly, the exchange rate cannot float freely upward either. In a highly dollarised economy like Argentina’s —where the dollar is both the unit of account and store of value— and with very low levels of monetisation in the domestic currency, the interest rate lacks the muscle as a monetary policy tool to stabilise expectations. This leaves two options: a managed float (with reasonably predictable intervention criteria) or an exchange rate band. In the latter case, it will be necessary to define the band’s width and the monthly depreciation rate for its upper and lower limits. This last point is primarily a technical matter, well within reach of an agreement, although it may require the usual arduous and heated discussions with IMF staff. Finally, after resolving the first three negotiation points, the amount of new financing the IMF will provide under the new programme must be agreed upon. These funds are necessary to dispel the spectre of external debt restructuring and, more importantly, to allow the exchange-rate regime to anchor expectations and meet the international reserves accumulation target, and to ensure the programme’s success. Conclusions Argentina’s Stabilisation Plan has entered its decisive phase. This is the time to capitalise on the successes achieved so far and the sacrifices asked of the population, putting Argentina on the path to eradicating the scourge of inflation, macroeconomic instability and recurring crises. The quickest, most reasonable and, indeed, most logical way to accomplish this is through a new agreement with the IMF, which would provide Argentina with fresh funds to dispel the spectre of external debt restructuring and, more importantly, to lift exchange controls smoothly, keeping expectations anchored and thereby ensuring the programme’s success. Argentina has already travelled a long way on its own, without external conditions imposed by any outside entity, a path that, in the past, would have quickly led to an agreement with the IMF: a severe fiscal adjustment; sharp monetary tightening; a clean-up of the BCRA’s balance sheet; a capital repatriation amnesty; and an ambitious agenda of deregulation and structural reforms. With these foundations, an agreement with the IMF is entirely within reach. Achieving it would set a virtuous cycle in motion: the assurance of foreign currency debt repayments would further reduce country risk to levels compatible with the re-entry of Argentina to the international capital markets; and lifting currency controls would pave the way for investments in strategic sectors which, under the RIGI framework, are waiting for currency restrictions to be lifted. All of this would likely result in a vigorous economic recovery. One could argue that history is not on Argentina’s side, that the IMF’s exposure to Argentina is already too high, that it is its largest debtor and that too many Stabilisation Plans have failed in the post-war period, even the most promising and durable, like the Convertibility Plan of the early 90s. Under these conditions, reaching a new agreement with the IMF will be challenging. Perhaps so. But there are always moments in the lives of countries and institutions —and certainly of people— when, to make history, one must break with history. That is the challenge. Nothing more, nothing less. About the authors: Ernesto Talvi is Senior Analyst at the Elcano Royal Institute.

Trade Wars Are Neither Good Nor Easy To Win – Analysis	By Sourabh Gupta ‘Trade wars are good, and easy to win’, US President-elect Donald Trump tweeted three weeks before he authorised tariffs on China under Section 301 of the Trade Act of 1974 in March 2018. Trade wars are easy to start, for sure. The US president enjoys extensive congressionally delegated authority to ratchet tariffs upwards. Courts will not second-guess this exercise of authority if its usage is based on an ‘intelligible principle’, allowing the president to enact measures bearing a ‘reasonable relationship’ to the proposed trade policy objective. The US consumer towers, too, over their international peers and tariff-regulated market access can be a useful source of leverage to instigate dealmaking on trade and non-trade concerns such as market purchase targets, shutting down illegal immigration and closing passageways for fentanyl trafficking. But are trade wars ‘easy to win’ too, as Trump claims? The Trump tariffs did lead to a sharp dip in China’s share of US imports. His campaign promise of 60 per cent tariffs could have punishing short-term effects on China’s macroeconomy and currency as it flirts with the familiar ailments of overcapacity, underconsumption, deflation and indebted local governments. On the other hand, China’s overall market share of global goods exports has increased since 2018, meaning the country has become more — not less — important to the global economy. EU–China trade ties have also intensified, particularly in medium-skill and technology-intensive production. This intensification is set to deepen over the next decade, including in electric vehicles and battery storage systems, their trade friction notwithstanding. As for the US overall goods trade deficit, it is larger — not smaller — as a percentage of GDP in 2024 than it was in 2017. The decrease in Chinese exports to the United States has been deflected elsewhere. While some producers have relocated production outside China to bypass the Trump tariffs, this diversification seems limited and shallow. Nearshoring to Mexico and friendshoring to Vietnam have dominated the trend. Final assembly in these countries is often dependent on China-sourced intermediate inputs. This ‘lengthening’ of the distance between suppliers in China and customers in the United States is counterintuitive to the logic of supply chain resilience which was the supposed reason — or excuse — to ‘derisk’ trade dependence on China. Besides, the pandemic-era dislocations were likely not fundamentally the product of a supply shock. Supply chains were resilient but businesses could not adapt quickly to the extraordinary surge in demand for durable goods. This challenges the premise of nearshoring and friendshoring. Much of the foreign direct investment (FDI) supporting supply chain diversification has arrived from non-Western sources. This suggests that East Asian — and most likely Chinese investors — provide the FDI driving trade diversification. So much for ‘decoupling’ from China. Just as Japan. Inc.’s forced relocation of domestic production due to US badgering to revalue the yen four decades ago spawned remarkable Asia-Pacific-wide production networks, so too will the Section 301 tariffs come to be seen as a blessing in disguise — one that equipped Chinese firms to internationalise their supply chain operations and obtain valuable ‘learning by doing’ experience along the way. Trump’s tariffs have turbocharged calls for protectionism within the US body politic. Like salted peanuts, the more they are dispensed to favoured industries, the more they are being demanded. The tariffs have also dislodged the Washington consensus on trade policy from its pro-liberalisation moorings, with trade policy shot through with streaks of populism and protectionism. At a time when the European Union, Japan, China and ASEAN continue to liberalise their trade policy frameworks, albeit at a slower pace since 2008, the US tariff play has accentuated the country’s relative isolation within the multilateral trading system. The United States’ defence of its unlawful tariffs under the catch-all guise of ‘national security’ has resulted in successive losses at the panel stage of the dispute settlementmechanism of the World Trade Organization (WTO). US refusal to support the Appellate Body’s restoration may not perturb Trump. But Washington’s conduct has dented the country’s reputation. The United States’ invocations of ‘essential security interests’ is propelling its retreat too from trade rulemaking, as was the case at the WTO’s plurilateral e-commerce negotiations. The United States was among the first countries to benefit from the imposition of the then-novel most-favoured-nation (MFN) principle through the ‘unequal treaty’ of 1844 with the Chinese Empire. In 1950, the United States walked away from the stillborn International Trade Organization due to broad domestic opposition to the Havana Charter. Business interests opposed the Charter’s retention of tariff preferences, weak investment protections, ample scope for discrimination against US goods based on current account adjustment grounds and other potential quantitative restrictions. Like the post-war United Kingdom, the modern United States hankers for managed trade and discrimination against foreign goods, and threatens to impose reciprocal, not MFN, tariffs. Trade wars will not extinguish the US trade deficit — driven by domestic macroeconomic factors and only secondarily by China’s industrial subsidies. Nor will broad protectionism deliver the return of well-paying manufacturing jobs to middle America — though selective deployment of industrial policy could yield a fighting chance. Trade wars may be easy to start but they are easier to lose. About the author: Sourabh Gupta is Senior Fellow at the Institute for China-America Studies in Washington, DC.

Gaza War May Soon End, But The Calamity Will Last Years – OpEd	By Osama Al-Sharif A pivotal moment could be close for the 14-month-old war on Gaza, which has claimed the lives of tens of thousands of Palestinians, destroyed almost 80 percent of the enclave and left more than 2 million Gazans internally displaced. There have been many such moments, only for all hopes of a ceasefire to be dashed. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s intransigence and vacillation have been the main impediments preventing a cessation of what the world now sees as a genocidal war against the Palestinians. What makes this pivotal moment different are several things. President-elect Donald Trump is a month away from his historic inauguration. He has indicated that he wanted the war in Gaza to end before he took office on Jan. 20, a message that was intended for both Netanyahu and the leaders of Hamas. Trump has also threatened to unleash US firepower if the Israeli captives are not released by the time he is sworn in. Also, the outgoing administration is believed to be exerting severe pressure on the Israeli premier to adopt a deal in a bid to give President Joe Biden some credit for stopping the bloodbath in Gaza. In addition, internal pressure on Netanyahu has spiked since the end of the war with Hezbollah, which was seen as delivering a victory for Israel. The north is now secure and thousands of Israelis can return home. The sudden collapse of the Assad regime in Syria last week was the icing on the cake. Israel has now neutralized all threats from Syria, having destroyed almost all of the country’s military capabilities. But perhaps the most pressing factor is former Defense Minister Yoav Gallant’s claim last month that the Israeli army had achieved all its military objectives in Gaza. Hamas’ top military and political leaders have been terminated and the group’s ability to pose a threat in the future is no more. In the eyes of the Israeli public, Hamas has been defeated and attention must now turn to bringing home the captives. There are other issues at play. The daily carnage in Gaza is now a liability, with mounting evidence of indefensible war crimes and crimes against humanity. Israel’s allies can no longer justify or excuse what it is doing, such as the targeting of schools, hospitals, designated safe areas, journalists and aid workers, as well as the gruesome images of starving children and bereaved women. Netanyahu has known for some time that the war has lost its strategic purpose. The killing spree has continued for several reasons: delaying an investigation into the Oct. 7 attacks, breaking the spirit of the Palestinians and forcing Hamas into a humiliating deal. His ploy about dictating his terms on Hamas appears to have worked. While the conditions of the latest proposed agreement remain vague, it is now believed that Hamas has accepted a partial truce, not an end to the war, while also allowing Israel to stay in control of the crucial Philadelphi Corridor and other parts of the now-partitioned enclave. There will reportedly be a gradual release of the Israeli captives in different phases in return for an easing of all restrictions on the passage of aid into Gaza. A Hamas source has confirmed that a deal that would gradually end the war could be imminent if Netanyahu does not obstruct it. Trump and Netanyahu discussed such a deal on Sunday. On Monday, Israeli Defense Minister Israel Katz reportedly told Knesset lawmakers that Israel is 'closer than ever' to closing a deal with Hamas to free the hostages held in Gaza. If approved by Netanyahu, the ceasefire — albeit a temporary one that would not stop the war — could pave the way for the release of Israeli captives and Palestinian prisoners, while providing a reprieve for the people of Gaza. The last time a similar pause was reached was back in November 2023, when 105 hostages were released in a week-long truce. Netanyahu is believed to be ready to present his coalition government with details of the deal this week. Israeli and US sources believe the agreement could be in place before the end of the year. But what would follow this truce is unknown. Netanyahu’s ability to resume the war would be degraded, even if all the hostages are released. Trump would be in the White House by then and he would not back the resumption of a war that has no benefit for the US or even Israel. The day-after scenario is also uncertain. Netanyahu has vowed to keep Gaza under permanent Israeli military control. Meanwhile, Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas has pulled out of an agreement reached in Cairo by Palestinian groups, including Hamas and Fatah, for a joint administration of Gaza. Palestinian sources said that Abbas’ Fatah party had pulled out for fear that the administration committee would become a de facto ruler of Gaza and an alternative to the Palestinian Authority. Ironically, Netanyahu has rejected the notion of allowing the PA to run Gaza, while his Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich is taking steps to consolidate the annexation of the West Bank and push the PA into financial collapse. Regardless of what Netanyahu has in mind for Gaza, the international community must be ready to act immediately once the war comes to a halt. International aid groups, UN observers and foreign journalists must have full access to the beleaguered enclave to document the horrors that have taken place in Gaza over the past 14 months. And while the daily barrage may finally come to an end, the reality is that there are 2 million Palestinians who are displaced with no access to shelter, clean water, sanitation, food, health or education. This will be a humanitarian crisis for many years to come. It is way too early to talk about reconstruction. The priority must be to help the survivors. Israel will attempt to release itself from responsibility toward the victims of its genocidal war. It must not be allowed to do so. The day the war ends must also be the day Israel begins to answer for its war crimes in Gaza. For Hamas, the end of the war must trigger open and serious discussions on its future and its purpose in Palestinian life and the liberation struggle. The Oct. 7 attacks have changed the trajectory of the Palestinian fight to end the occupation in a cataclysmic way. The outcome of that fateful day has now become a fork in the road in the decades-old Palestinian saga. While it has exacted an unimaginable cost on the Palestinians, Oct. 7 also awakened the world to their ongoing injustice and suffering. Where to go from here, no one knows. But what is clear is that the fates of Israel and the Palestinians have become more interconnected than ever before. Osama Al-Sharif is a journalist and political commentator based in Amman.

Who Is Donald Trump? From Real Estate Mogul And Reality Star To U...	Politics tells fascinating, beautiful, ugly, incredible, and sometimes strange, if not unimaginable, stories. One such story is the rise of the colorful and unconventional politician and two-time U.S. president, Donald Trump. He was the first alternative candidate to win the White House in 2016 and 2024, despite not previously holding any public office. Before entering politics in 2015, Trump was a respected businessman and a prominent figure in the American entertainment industry (a reality TV star), who was largely admired by Americans. However, after entering politics, everything changed, and Trump became someone people either loved or couldn’t stand. Love him or not, he is a once-in-a-lifetime figure. Childhood and Youth Donald John Trump was born on June 14, 1946, in the Queens borough of New York City as the fourth of five children of Frederick C. and Mary MacLeod Trump. Frederick Trump was a builder and real estate developer specializing in constructing and selling middle-class apartments in Queens, Staten Island, and Brooklyn, New York. Young Donald was a lively and bright, yet unruly child. At the age of 13, his parents sent him to the New York Military Academy, hoping the school would discipline young Donald and channel his energy in the right direction. The military academy was both a significant and challenging period in the future multi-billionaire and U.S. president’s life. It was a shocking change for a 13-year-old to be told one summer day that he wouldn’t be attending a regular school but a military academy located about 100 km from West Point. He would no longer be with his family in their luxurious home. The school was not just about academics. Students were required to wear uniforms and, from time to time, received tools to polish floors and carry out other physical tasks. Trump performed well at the academy both academically and socially, becoming a popular athlete and student leader by the time he graduated in 1964. During summer breaks, Trump worked on construction sites for his father’s company. He enrolled at Fordham University in the Bronx but later transferred to the Wharton School of Finance at the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia, graduating with a degree in economics in 1968. Trump was not drafted into the Vietnam War due to his studies and medical exemptions. Besides his father, who greatly influenced Donald’s career choice, real estate developer William Zeckendorf also had a significant impact. Young Trump’s dreams and ambitions far exceeded those of his father. Early Beginnings in the Business World After graduating, Trump joined the family company, Elizabeth Trump & Son, which he later renamed the Trump Organization. In 1971, Trump moved to Manhattan, where he met many powerful individuals. 'It was a gift for me,' he later commented. 'You know, being someone’s son could have been competitive for me. This way, I got the whole of Manhattan to myself.' Confident in the economic opportunities offered by the big city, Trump ventured into large development projects that promised significant profits. Trump seized these opportunities by using attractive architectural designs and gaining public recognition. However, it’s always worth noting that Trump had a relatively favorable and eased path to success. He came from a wealthy family with a prosperous father, so his business success was practically guaranteed. By the 1970s, Frederick Trump’s company was valued at around $200 million. Donald later admitted that he received a loan of several million dollars from his father. In addition to a financial head start, he also had social connections and a good societal status. According to some analyses, had Trump invested his inherited money into mutual funds instead of business ventures, he would be equally wealthy today. Donald’s father, Fred, was, like his son, a colorful character and a workaholic who worked from dawn to dusk, and he was an extremely ambitious man. Mary Trump was a very theatrical individual who loved being the center of attention. When their son Robert was born, Mary was often ill. Donald grew up with a lack of attention and affection from his parents, which may explain his character as someone who enjoys being at the center of media attention and has an insatiable appetite for publicity. Media Recognition and Building the Trump Organization Donald Trump sought publicity as early as the 1960s. His first business venture was producing a Broadway play. It was not a successful production and closed after ten weeks. Like his parents, Donald always possessed a theatrical personality. He realized he could pursue success in New York through his name, image, and persona—these were his assets. Even before he 'put two bricks together,' he was featured in The New York Times as a rising tycoon. Trump quickly convinced his father to entrust him with an independent project, managing an abandoned apartment complex, Swifton Village, which he renovated and then sold relatively quickly for a significant profit for the company. This was a turning point, and by 1971, Trump was appointed CEO of the Trump Organization. When the Pennsylvania Central Railroad went bankrupt, Trump had the opportunity to secure rights to purchase railroad land on Manhattan’s west side. When initial plans for housing proved unfeasible due to poor economic conditions, Trump promoted the property as a location for the Jacob Javits Convention Center, which the city eventually chose in 1978 over two competing sites. Accusations of Racism In 1973, Donald and his father found themselves in the spotlight when the federal Department of Justice filed charges against the Trump Organization for systematically discriminating against African Americans seeking to rent apartments. Trump’s defense that they rejected applicants due to low incomes was deemed unconvincing. The case was settled in 1975 without the Trumps admitting wrongdoing, though they made a concession by informing employees about the Fair Housing Act. They also agreed to educate the community about fair housing practices free of racial discrimination. Trump wrote in his book The Art of the Deal: 'In the end, the government couldn’t prove its case, and we ended up making a minor settlement without admitting any guilt.' Successful Real Estate Developer Meanwhile, Trump had a vision for significant achievements in real estate. In 1974, he secured the opportunity to purchase one of Penn Central’s hotels, the Commodore, which was unprofitable but located near New York’s Grand Central Station. The following year, he signed a partnership agreement with the Hyatt hotel corporation, which lacked a large hotel in the city center. Trump then navigated a complex deal with the city to renovate the hotel. The renovation cost $70 million. Renamed the Grand Hyatt, the 90-meter, 26-story skyscraper became popular and economically successful, making Trump the most famous and controversial real estate developer in the Big Apple. In his personal life, Trump always had an eye for beautiful women, particularly those of Eastern European descent. In 1977, he married Czech model Ivana Zelníčková. After the birth of their first of three children, Donald J. Trump Jr., Ivana Trump was appointed Vice President of the Trump Organization, responsible for design. She played an important role in renovating the Commodore. Together, they had two more children: Ivanka and Eric. Trump Tower and Casino Complexes In 1979, Trump leased a plot of land on Fifth Avenue in New York, near the famous Tiffany & Company jewelry store, as the location for a massive residential and retail complex valued at $200 million. The 58-story skyscraper was named Trump Tower and opened in 1982. The tower featured a six-story atrium adorned with pink marble and a large indoor waterfall. This luxurious complex attracted prominent retailers and celebrity tenants, earning Trump national attention. Meanwhile, Trump began exploring the profitability of the casino business. In 1980, he managed to secure ownership rights in Atlantic City, New Jersey. Donald enlisted his younger brother Robert to manage the complex project, which involved acquiring land, obtaining gambling licenses, and securing permits and financing. Holiday Inn Corporation, the parent company of Harrah's casino hotels, offered a partnership, leading to the development of a $250 million complex. It opened in 1984 as Harrah's at Trump Plaza. Trump decided to expand his operations further and purchased the historic Mar-a-Lago estate for $8 million. He later used the estate for professional training sessions and international business meetings before converting it into a resort, in compliance with regulations. During the 1980s, Trump opened a series of casinos, skyscrapers, and hotels along the Atlantic Coast. Trump bought out Holiday Inn hotels in 1986 and rebranded the property as the Trump Plaza Hotel and Casino. He also acquired a casino-hotel from Hilton Hotels in Atlantic City after the company failed to obtain a gambling license. Trump renamed the property Trump Castle, an investment valued at $320 million. Later, during its construction phase, Trump acquired ownership of the world’s largest hotel-casino complex at the time, the Taj Mahal in Atlantic City, which opened in 1990. The Trump Taj Mahal featured one of the largest gaming areas in the world, spanning 15,500 square meters, and was also the most expensive casino ever built, costing $1.1 billion. Expanding Trump’s Business Empire Expanding his empire southward, Trump launched a residential project in West Palm Beach, Florida. In 1989, he diversified by purchasing Eastern Air Lines Shuttle for $365 million, later renaming it Trump Shuttle. However, the company failed to generate a profit and merged with another firm in 1992. In January 1990, Trump traveled to Los Angeles to unveil a plan for a $1 billion commercial and residential project, including a 125-story skyscraper, but an economic downturn soon disrupted those plans. In New York City, Trump acquired a residential building and the Barbizon-Plaza Hotel, located near Central Park, with plans to build a major residential complex on the property. However, tenants protected by the city's rent control and housing programs opposed Trump's plans and won the battle. Trump instead renovated the Barbizon, renaming it Trump Parc. In 1985, Trump purchased 76 acres of land on Manhattan's west side for $88 million to build a complex called Television City, which would include a dozen skyscrapers, a shopping center, and a park along the Hudson River. Opposition from critics and delays in securing city permits stalled the project, which was designed to attract television networks. In 1988, Trump bought the Plaza Hotel for $407 million and spent $50 million on renovations under the supervision of his wife Ivana. Who is Donald Trump? During the 1980s, polls showed that Trump consistently appeared on the list of the 10 people Americans admired the most. Trump’s strategy for seeking attention was always as successful as it was perhaps transparent. 'I don’t do it for the money. I have enough, much more than I will ever need. I do it to do it. Deals are my art form. Other people paint beautifully on canvas or write magnificent poetry. I like making deals, preferably big deals. That’s how I get my kicks,' Trump wrote in 1987. He also invested in sports, organized the USFL football league, and launched Trump University, a school specializing in real estate education. New Accusations of Racism Trump again found himself in the spotlight due to racial issues in 1989. A robbery occurred in Central Park in New York when a young woman was attacked and nearly killed by five men. The case made headlines. Five young men, all members of racial minorities (Latino and African American), were arrested. It was later revealed that they gave confessions under coercion. Trump’s response to the tragic case was to purchase an $85,000 full-page ad in newspapers, calling for the return of the death penalty, signed with his name. This move was extremely inflammatory and provocative. The accused men were later exonerated, but Trump insisted they did not deserve their release because they were not 'good guys.' The same year, as a prominent American businessman, he appeared in an interview on NBC, where he claimed that Black people had an advantage and that he would much rather be a young, educated Black man than a white man in America in 1989. This was an exaggeration because the Black population in 1989 did not yet enjoy fully equal conditions in education and employment compared to the white majority. Business Problems and Changes in Private Life In 1990, a sudden decline in the real estate market occurred, reducing the value of Trump’s empire. His wealth fell from an estimated $1.7 billion to $500 million. The Trump Organization needed massive loans to stay afloat, which was a dangerous situation threatening bankruptcy. Some observers saw Trump’s decline as a symbolic embodiment of all the economic, business, and social excesses of the 1980s. However, Trump managed to recover, and by 1997, his wealth was estimated to be close to $2 billion. Trump’s image partially faded due to publicity surrounding his controversial divorce from his wife Ivana. Donald remarried, this time to rising actress Marla Maples. The couple had a daughter, Tiffany, two months before their wedding in 1993. The couple separated in 1997, and their divorce was formally finalized two years later. After his second divorce, Trump began a relationship with Slovenian model Melania Knauss. They married in 2005 at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida. Among the notable guests at the wedding were Bill and Hillary Clinton. The following year, the couple had a son, Barron. Entering the Entertainment Industry In 1996, Trump partnered with NBC to buy the American Miss Universe Organization, which runs beauty pageants – Miss Universe America, Miss USA, and Miss Teen USA. He owned part of the rights to these beauty pageants until 2015. Many real estate dealers paid significant sums for licenses to use Trump’s brand. This changed dramatically when he announced his presidential candidacy in 2015. In 2004, Trump ventured into television. He leveraged his celebrity status by launching the TV series 'The Apprentice', in which contestants competed to become managers within the Trump Organization. The show quickly became a hit and made Trump’s catchphrase, 'You’re fired,' immensely popular. The success of the series, which was nominated for an Emmy Award, led to a spin-off series, 'Celebrity Apprentice', featuring numerous celebrities as contestants, including Lennox Lewis, Dennis Rodman, and Leeza Gibbons, among others. Despite his image as a ruthless boss, in the real world (privately), Trump is a warm and pleasant person. He personally hired numerous people and gave them more responsibilities and rewards than other employers. Talented young people who joined his companies and proved themselves capable of completing tasks were given increasingly challenging responsibilities and were always richly rewarded for their success. Even in cases of failure, he would give second chances, unlike what was portrayed on the TV series. The Unshakable Billionaire At the beginning of the 21st century, Trump began implementing several large hotel and residential projects on a global scale, including Trump World Tower in New York, Trump International Hotel and Tower in Chicago, Trump Hotel in Las Vegas, and Mar-a-Lago Club in Palm Beach, Florida. Projects were also carried out outside the U.S., in Panama City, Rio de Janeiro, Vancouver, and Toronto. In 2016, the American business magazine Forbes ranked Trump as the 324th richest person in the world and the 113th in the U.S., with a net worth of $4.5 billion. Religiously, Trump is a Christian and was a member of the Protestant Presbyterian Church until 2020, when he declared himself a non-denominational Christian. On one occasion, he cited the Bible as his favorite book, followed by his own 'The Art of the Deal.' Trump has authored or co-authored several books. His latest book, 'Let’s Save America,' was published this year. In it, he outlines his achievements during his first presidential term from 2017 to 2021 and his plans for a second term, which he claims will lead America into a new era of prosperity. He has received numerous awards and recognitions. Trump, for instance, earned his star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in Los Angeles and was named Time magazine’s Person of the Year in 2016. Although his behavior may suggest that he despises journalists and the media, the opposite is true. Trump loves the media because they provide him with the attention he craves. Before launching his 2015 presidential campaign, Trump would start nearly every day by reviewing where his name appeared in the media. The media are crucial for boosting Trump’s ego. The Political Chameleon Trump’s political beliefs can be described as chameleon-like. For most of his life, he was a member or supporter of the Republican Party, but not always. Trump supported Ronald Reagan during the 1980s. He became a registered party member in 1987. In 1988, he considered running for president. However, in 1999, he joined the Reform Party. In October of that year, Trump announced the formation of an exploratory committee to determine whether he would run as the Reform Party’s candidate in the 2000 presidential campaign. Ultimately, he withdrew due to internal party issues and modest results in the California primaries. However, his political aspirations did not disappear. Between 2001 and 2008, he identified as a Democrat, but in the 2008 presidential election, he supported Republican John McCain. The following year, he returned to the Republican Party and promised in 2011 never to change parties again. Over his life, he has donated to both Republicans and Democrats. In 2012, there was speculation that he would run for president, but Trump withdrew because he believed he had no realistic chance. Entry into Politics In June 2015, Trump announced his decision to run for President of the United States. He quickly emerged as one of the frontrunners among the many Republican Party candidates. From the start, he based his campaign on issues such as illegal immigration, outsourcing of jobs, national debt, Islamic terrorism, and redefining foreign policy. He encapsulated his beliefs in the slogan: 'Make America Great Again' (MAGA). At the same time, he launched the 'America First' slogan, asserting that in foreign policy, America must primarily look after its own interests, not those of other countries. This concept also involved withdrawing from the numerous wars in which the United States had been entangled. By May 2016, all Republican candidates had dropped out of the race. In July, he was officially nominated as the presidential candidate, with Mike Pence as his running mate for Vice President. Triumph Trump based his campaign on the image of an outsider and anti-establishment candidate, adopting populist policies that resonated with conservative and right-leaning American voters, particularly white voters from suburban and rural areas. Despite relentless media and establishment attacks, Trump surprisingly won the election on November 8, 2016. The American people rallied behind a candidate who promised a new and better America. Interestingly, the American animated TV show The Simpsons had predicted Trump as president back in 2000. From 2017 to 2021, Trump’s first term unfolded with both successes and setbacks, during which he spent a significant amount of time defending himself from accusations of being a Russian agent and colluding with Moscow to win the White House. Other allegations followed, including abuse of power, leading to two impeachment attempts in Congress. Fall and the Great Comeback Trump narrowly lost the presidential election on November 3, 2020, under extraordinary circumstances amid the COVID-19 crisis. The elections were marked by many uncertainties and unanswered questions. Allegations of electoral fraud and manipulation would remain forever unresolved. Although it seemed he would never return to politics as a relevant figure—being banned from all social media—the opposite happened. Despite accusations of orchestrating the January 6, 2021, attack on Capitol Hill, mishandling classified documents, and attempting election fraud, none of this deterred him. Not even two assassination attempts stopped Trump, and he became the Republican presidential candidate in the summer of 2024. On November 5, he won the election decisively, capturing nearly all swing states and triumphing in the overall popular vote. Trump’s victory was not a surprise, but the significant margin was. While the elections were expected to be extremely close, with the winner unclear for days, Trump won overwhelmingly, and the result was clear on election night. A Permanent Place in History As the 45th and 47th President of the United States, Donald Trump has secured his place in history forever. The past, present, and future of Trump’s presidency will determine the final judgment of his character and achievements. However, his life story is unique and unparalleled, as is his political career, which leaves no one indifferent. Trump is either loved or hated—few can remain neutral. He could be succinctly described as: a top businessman, a wealthy man, a controversial figure of good character, and a politician after whom the United States will never be the same. His statement sums it up: 'Love him or hate him, Trump is a man who knows what he wants and goes for it—no limits. Women are attracted to his power as much as his money.'	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWe6dX7MBfuzb-JbjYuwjDrD	2024-12-17T16:30:45-08:00	
The Western Balkans At A Crossroads: An Old War From In New Geopo...	Hybrid warfare has made the transition from being a purely theoretical concern to a multifaceted and pervasive strategy that fundamentally affects the structure of modern societies. It has transcended the boundaries of propaganda and disinformation, by transforming these tools into powerful weapons to influence democratic processes and government decision-making. In this context, the Western Balkans represents a dynamic laboratory where hybrid strategies are clearly manifested, which not only challenge the stability of the region, but also reconfigures its political and social landscape. The phenomenon of 'Srpski Svet' (Serbian World) and 'Ruski Mir' (Russian World) constitute two of the most visible strategies operating in this space. Built on the goals of global multipolarization, these projects are an integral part of Russia's Eurasian strategy, which seeks to challenge Western dominance and expand its influence in the region. Multipolarization has evolved from a simple theoretical idea into a reality characterized by concrete and interventionist actions, as illustrated by the initiatives undertaken by the BRICS countries, which clearly aim to reshape the global balance of power. A significant example of this dynamic is the overthrow of pro-Western structures in Montenegro, a process that has been the product of direct intervention by Russia and Serbia. Following these developments, the next strategy seems to be to create a legal framework that would allow Serbian citizens of Montenegro to automatically obtain Serbian citizenship. This move follows a broader narrative of demographic and political influence, supported by recent census data. Its results show an increase in the number of citizens who identify as Serbs, thus creating a demographic base that favors the strategic ambitions of Belgrade and Moscow. This combination of covert influence, manipulated demography, and political interference poses a serious challenge not only to the countries of the region, but also to the broader Euro-Atlantic security architecture. In this context, hybrid warfare in the Western Balkans presents itself as a clear model of complex hybrid strategies, which require in-depth analysis and a coordinated response from international actors. Dual citizenship law in Montenegro: a tactic to expand the 'Serbian world' In May 2024, the Institute for Hybrid Warfare Studies 'OCTOPUS' published a scientific study that analyzes the geopolitical strategy of Russia and Serbia comparing to Montenegro, focusing on hybrid warfare as a means to influence the country’s demographics and political structure. This study sheds light on how Russia and Serbia are using ethnic engineering and political influence to strengthen Serbian identity and consolidate the concept of the 'Serbian world'. One of the main tools of this strategy is the demand of dual citizenship for Serbian citizens of Montenegro. Currently, Montenegro has a strict stance on dual citizenship. According to the current legislation, a foreign citizen seeking Montenegrin citizenship must surrender his previous citizenship. This legal provision constitutes an obstacle to the implementation of proposals by pro-Serbian and pro-Russian parties, which demand that Montenegrin citizens of Serbian origin have the right to have dual citizenship, including that of Serbia. These efforts resulted as part of a broader strategy to change the demographic and political balance in Montenegro, significantly strengthening ties between the Serbian community and Serbia. This scenario creates a favorable basis for political manipulation and increasing Belgrade's influence in Montenegro. Demographic statistics show profound changes in the ethnic composition of Montenegro over the past decades. In the last census, 41.12% of the population declared themselves Montenegrins, while 33% declared themselves Serbs—an increase of 4% compared to the 2011 census. This change is particularly significant when compared to historical data: These figures show a disproportionate growth of the Serbian community, especially after the collapse of Yugoslavia. This trend has important implications, suggesting a well-thought-out strategy to change the ethnic composition and to overthrow the political dominance of Montenegrins. The results of the latest census and the growth trends of the Serbian community constitute a clear indication of what can be described as ethnic engineering. The main goal is to create a demographic base that would enable the realization of major strategic objectives: 1. Referendum on unification with Serbia: A possible scenario where Serbia uses its demographic majority to organize a referendum on unification with Montenegro. 2. Division of a part of the territory by referendum: The other scenario is when a part of Montenegro dominated by a Serbian majority and a pro-Serbian and pro-Russian majority organizes a referendum on separation. 3. Changing geopolitical circumstances: In the case of international tensions, a Serbian invasion of Montenegro could be justified on the basis of 'protecting' the Serbian community. 4. Expansion of Serbian identity: Through culture, religion and politics, an empowered Serbian identity is promoted in Montenegro. This strategy is not simply a demographic or legal issue, it rather represents a serious threat to Montenegro's sovereignty. As Serbian influence in the country’s ethnic and political structure grows, Montenegro’s internal stability and territorial integrity are at risk. In particular, Serbia's and Russia's hybrid interventions through disinformation, diplomatic pressure, and the fomentation of ethnic divisions aim to undermine the country's democratic structures. The ethnic and social engineering efforts in Montenegro will not stop because this country constitutes a substantial component of the completion of the dream of the 'Serbian world' and constitutes Russia's current easiest route to sea access to warm waters. The Western Balkans remain a key point in international geopolitical dynamics, where historically inherited tensions combine with modern threats of hybrid warfare. Hybrid warfare, as a sophisticated and multidimensional strategy, has transcended the usual frameworks of previous conflicts, becoming a means of influencing the political and social structures of the region. Serbia and Russia use these tactics to achieve their agendas in the region, directly challenging the sovereignty and stability of countries such as Kosovo, Montenegro and Bosnia and Hercegovina. One of the most visible strategies of this phenomenon is the implementation of the 'Srpski Svet' project, which aims to create a demographic and political base that supports the interests of Belgrade and Moscow. This is achieved through demographic engineering, electoral manipulation, and historical and cultural narratives that promote Serbian identity and its ties to Russia. Similarly, the hybrid tactics used in Georgia and Ukraine provide a clear model for understanding the potential for escalating tensions in the Balkans, involving the use of demographics, ideological narratives, and hybrid tools. It is also clear that these efforts are not limited to demographic or legal aspects. On the contrary, they represent a multidimensional threat that jeopardizes the regional security architecture and the Euro-Atlantic integration of the Western Balkan countries. The manipulation of democratic processes and the creation of ethnic tensions through hybrid means underlines the necessity for a rapid and coordinated response by Western actors. The experience of hybrid conflicts in Georgia and Ukraine shows that a delayed response only reinforces the strategies of the aggressors and creates space for further destabilization. In this regard, the continued engagement of NATO and the European Union in supporting the stability of the Balkans is vital to avoid further escalation of the situation. Ultimately, hybrid warfare in the Balkans should not be treated as an isolated issue. It is part of a broader global strategy to challenge Western and create a new multipolar international order. Therefore, the response to these challenges must be equally strategic and comprehensive, including strengthening democratic and security capacities in vulnerable countries, as well as addressing the sources of hybrid influence.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWe6dX7MBfuzb46l_DJZ_OOB	2024-12-17T16:29:24-08:00	
Abusive Constitutionalism: Detection And Prevention – Analysis	By Prof. Dr. Djawed Sangdel and Damla Mesulam Constitutions are foundational documents that shape the political and legal structure of a nation. In democratic systems, they are intended to establish a clear separation of powers, protect individual rights, and ensure that governance is responsive to the needs of the people. However, leaders in countries like Venezuela, Russia, and Turkey have exploited constitutional amendments to centralize power, eroding democratic institutions. Indonesia faces similar risks with proposals like presidential term extensions and reintroducing state policy guidelines (PPHN), raising concerns over potential abuses of power. This article examines these issues through global comparisons and suggests reforms to safeguard democracy. Hence, the following lines are examining how the mechanism of constitutional amendments can be misused to consolidate power and undermine democratic norms, a phenomenon known as abusive constitutionalism. By analyzing cases from Turkey, Russia, Venezuela, and China, it explores how leaders manipulate legal frameworks to entrench authority and foster a cult of personality. The paper highlights preventative measures such as eternity clauses, the basic structure doctrine, and civil society engagement as safeguards to protect democracy. It also considers how Indonesia can strengthen its constitutional framework to prevent authoritarianism. Using conceptual legal research and a comparative approach, this study aims to answer three key questions: (1) What drives the proposed constitutional amendments in Indonesia? (2) How do these proposals align with principles of constitutionalism and democracy? (3) What safeguards can prevent abusive constitutional practices in Indonesia? It seeks to address the research questions by evaluating how constitutional amendments have led to abusive constitutionalism, focusing on Indonesia's current proposals. Cases from countries such as India, Colombia, and Venezuela provide insights into how term limit extensions, power shifts, and personalization undermine democratic principles. The study emphasizes the role of civil society in maintaining accountability. II. Constitution, Legal Order and Political Power 2.1 Comparative Framework: Abusive Constitutionalism in a Global Context Abusive constitutionalism, as defined by David Landau, refers to the manipulation of constitutional mechanisms to undermine democracy under the guise of legal reform. This global phenomenon has been observed in countries like Hungary, Venezuela, Turkey, China, Colombia, and Indonesia. Tactics include extending presidential terms, weakening checks and balances, co-opting judicial institutions, and consolidating power under the rhetoric of stability or national progress. In Colombia, the 1991 constitution limited the president to a single term to prevent the rise of authoritarian leaders, seeking to entrench power. However, President Álvaro Uribe Vélez sought to amend the constitution to allow re-election, raising concerns about democratic backsliding. Similarly, in Venezuela, constitutional reforms extended the presidential term from one four-year term to two six-year terms, enabling Hugo Chávez to consolidate power. Like Colombia’s example, these amendments were framed as necessary for national progress, but they ultimately allowed for the rise of authoritarian rule. In Hungary, the ruling party employed both amendments and replacements to the constitution to consolidate power. This included adding more constitutional court judges, restructuring key state commissions, and making it more difficult to amend the constitution in ways that could challenge the ruling party’s dominance. These measures illustrate how constitutional reforms can be used as tools for entrenching power, rather than reforming governance. Similar trends are observable in Indonesia, where proposed constitutional amendments, such as reintroducing the National Guidelines (PPHN), may serve to further centralize authority in the hands of the president. Rosalind Dixon and David Landau’s concept of Abusive Constitutional Borrowing highlights how democratic frameworks are repurposed for authoritarian control, often by weakening institutions like constitutional courts or anti-corruption bodies. Research shows that while leaders frequently attempt to evade term limits through constitutional changes, public resistance, rather than judicial intervention, is often the key deterrent.The global patterns suggest that Indonesia’s proposed amendments may not aim to improve governance but rather consolidate power, exemplifying Landau’s concept of abusive constitutionalism. 2.2 SEA as a Case Study: Current Constitutional Proposals This section examines the largest country of Southeastern Asia, that or RI's proposed constitutional amendments, specifically the reintroduction of the National Guidelines (PPHN) and the extension of the presidential term, highlighting their potential to reshape the country's political landscape. While these proposals are framed as governance and stability enhancements, they raise concerns about democratic principles and the risk of power consolidation. While Article 37 provides a structured framework for constitutional amendments, it centralizes power within the People’s Consultative Assembly (MPR), raising concerns about potential abuse. The MPR could prioritize the interests of the ruling party, potentially undermining democratic accountability. Key concerns include: Reintroduction of the PPHN: This could centralize policy control under the People’s Consultative Assembly (MPR), weakening the independence of other state institutions. Presidential Term Extension: Extending the presidency to three terms risks eroding safeguards against power personalization and weakening democratic consolidation. Though Article 37 legitimizes the amendment process, it also reveals vulnerabilities where mechanisms intended to enable constitutional change can be exploited for undemocratic purposes. This aligns with global trends in abusive constitutionalism, where amendment processes are used to entrench power rather than strengthen democracy. The subsequent analysis will assess whether these proposals represent genuine reforms or potential abuses. 2.3 The Role of the Cult of Personality in Consolidating Power The cult of personality is a political strategy where leaders create a heroic and idealized image to centralize authority, often undermining institutional governance. Personalization of power centralizes decision-making, undermining institutional integrity and democratic norms. While it may offer short-term stability, it often results in volatile governance. A comparative analysis of China, Russia, and Turkey illustrates how personalization of power influences governance and constitutional changes. In China, Xi Jinping has constructed a cult of personality through state propaganda, portraying himself as indispensable to China's future. The removal of presidential term limits in 2018 marked a significant step toward consolidating indefinite rule, shifting governance from a collective leadership model to a centralized and personalized system. This strengthens Xi’s authority but risks long-term instability. Similarly, Vladimir Putin has cultivated a strongman image tied to Russia's global resurgence. Constitutional changes in 2020 reset term limits, allowing him to stay in power until 2036. Unlike China, Russia maintains a façade of democratic institutions, which are systematically weakened to ensure control. In Turkey, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan has used populist rhetoric to reshape governance. The 2017 constitutional referendum transitioned Turkey from a parliamentary to a Semi-Presidential system (of the French type), granting Erdoğan extensive executive powers while eroding judicial and legislative independence. His leadership demonstrates how personalization can align institutional frameworks with individual authority. All three leaders use propaganda, legalistic and legal mechanism of constitutional amendments, and weakened institutional checks to consolidate power. However, their methods differ: China relies on institutional propaganda, Russia undermines democratic processes while maintaining a democratic façade, and Turkey invokes populist narratives. While Indonesia faces some risk of developing a cult of personality under a charismatic leader like President Prabowo Subianto, its democratic safeguards act as barriers. The multi-party system, decentralized governance, and two-term presidential limit reduce the risk of power concentration. Additionally, Indonesia's historical experience with Suharto’s authoritarian regime has fostered societal resistance to personalization of power. However, threats like media control, weakened institutions, or populist appeals remain, making vigilance and reform essential for preserving democracy. 2.4 Abusive Constitutionalism: Detection and Prevention The personalization of power, as observed in China, Russia, and Turkey, often manifests through constitutional amendments that consolidate authority. To counteract such trends, it is essential to explore mechanisms that protect constitutional integrity and democratic principles from being abused—a concern that resonates with Indonesia's ongoing constitutional debates. Abusive constitutionalism, where leaders manipulate constitutional amendments to entrench their power, poses a significant threat to democratic integrity. Lessons from India, Colombia, and Venezuela highlight strategies to prevent such practices, focusing on eternity clauses, the basic structure doctrine, and civil society involvement. These mechanisms aim to protect the constitution’s fundamental principles from being jeopardized by constitutional amendments. Eternity Clauses Certain core democratic principles, like executive power limitations, should be enshrined as unalterable. For example, Colombia used eternity clauses to block amendments extending presidential terms, with civil society and courts preserving institutional integrity. Likewise, Indonesia’s constitution already includes immutable clauses (e.g., protecting the unitary state), but clauses related to term limits and the balance of powers should also be safeguarded. Basic Structure Doctrine This doctrine, pioneered in India, ensures that fundamental constitutional principles cannot be amended. In Kesavananda Bharati v. State of Kerala (1973), India’s Supreme Court ruled that constitutional amendments cannot alter the constitution's core framework. Indonesia’s judiciary could adopt similar judicial review mechanisms to block amendments concentrating power in the presidency or weakening checks and balances. Civil Society Active civil society is crucial for resisting constitutional abuses. Public pressure and grassroots activism can expose and challenge manipulative amendments. For example, Venezuela’s failure to maintain an independent judiciary or robust civil society allowed repeated amendments that eroded democracy under Hugo Chávez. In contrast, Colombia and India demonstrate how civil society and judicial action can resist overreach. Indonesia’s vibrant civil society and constitutional safeguards have so far resisted elite-driven amendments, such as proposals for term extensions or system changes justified as necessary for stability. However, increasing media control and elite-driven reforms in Indonesia make public engagement and judicial oversight ever more crucial to prevent potential abuses of democratic principles. Summary and outlook This analysis highlights the risks posed by selected countries’ proposed constitutional amendments, which aim to strengthen the executive branch through measures like extending presidential terms and reintroducing the PPHN of largest country in SEA. These changes mirror trends in Russia, Turkey, and China, where centralizing power fosters a cult of personality, erodes institutional independence, and undermines democratic principles. The amendments could diminish democratic accountability, weaken institutional safeguards, and pave the way for authoritarian rule by concentrating power among political elites. To counteract such risks, these countries must strengthen checks and balances, adopt mechanisms like eternity clauses and the basic structure doctrine, and ensure robust civil society engagement in constitutional processes. A political culture emphasizing pluralism, transparency, and institutional independence is imperative to preserving democratic values and preventing the personalization of power. The analysis concludes that while constitutional reforms may be justified as necessary for progress, history shows their potential to consolidate power and erode democracy, emphasizing the importance of preventive measures against authoritarianism.

Strengthening Indonesia: Prioritizing Domestic Reforms With Diplo...	Indonesia's foreign policy doctrine of Bebas Aktif (independent and active) has been the cornerstone of its diplomacy for decades, reflecting the nation's desire to remain neutral amid power struggles while actively contributing to regional and global peace. This doctrine has enabled Indonesia to navigate evolving geopolitical challenges, particularly in the Indo-Pacific. With President Prabowo Subianto's administration now in place, the nation faces the challenge of addressing domestic issues while safeguarding its sovereignty in an increasingly competitive world. To achieve this balance, a renewed focus on resolving pressing internal problems and entrusting foreign policy to skilled diplomats at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Kemlu) is essential. First introduced under President Sukarno, the Bebas Aktif doctrine emphasizes Indonesia’s neutrality from power blocs and active participation in global and regional affairs. Indonesia's role in ASEAN, particularly in mediating tensions in the South China Sea, showcases its capability to promote regional stability. However, the nation's growing economic dependence on China presents challenges to its neutrality. Major projects, such as the Jakarta-Bandung high-speed rail and significant investments in the nickel industry, illustrate this reliance. Concurrently, cooperation with Western countries, including the United States on defense technology, underscores a strategic balancing act that requires careful management. Successfully managing these relationships without compromising sovereignty will demand experienced diplomacy and thoughtful decision-making. While cultivating international relationships is vital, Indonesia must also confront key domestic challenges that threaten long-term growth and stability. One of the most critical issues is corruption, which has eroded public trust, discouraged foreign investment, and undermined good governance. The Corruption Eradication Commission (KPK), once a symbol of Indonesia’s fight against corruption, has faced significant setbacks. Restoring the KPK’s authority and enhancing anti-corruption laws should be a top priority for Prabowo’s administration, as doing so would rebuild public confidence and lay the groundwork for sustainable economic growth. Another pressing issue is economic inequality. Despite strong economic growth, many Indonesians struggle to access quality healthcare, education, and infrastructure. Millions continue to live in poverty, particularly in rural areas. Addressing this inequality is essential for social stability. By investing in healthcare, education, and rural infrastructure, Prabowo’s government can ensure that economic development benefits all Indonesians. Inclusive growth will not only strengthen the nation internally but also enhance its international reputation. Indonesia's strategic location in the Indo-Pacific positions it as a key player amid the ongoing rivalry between China and the United States. China's increasing influence in Southeast Asia, especially in the South China Sea, raises concerns about territorial integrity, particularly regarding Indonesia’s Natuna Islands. Meanwhile, the United States is promoting its Indo-Pacific strategy to counterbalance China's rise and is seeking stronger partnerships in the region. Indonesia's challenge lies in maintaining neutrality while leveraging economic opportunities with both powers. Strengthening maritime diplomacy, enhancing naval capabilities, and securing the country’s exclusive economic zone are crucial steps to protect its sovereignty. To reduce over-reliance on China, Indonesia must diversify its economic partnerships. Building stronger trade and investment ties with Japan, South Korea, and the European Union can create a more balanced economic landscape. Moreover, modernizing the military and actively participating in regional security frameworks will enable Indonesia to play a more significant role in maintaining regional peace and stability. As ASEAN’s largest member, Indonesia has an important leadership role to fulfill within the bloc. Regional challenges—such as the political crisis in Myanmar and disputes in the South China Sea—threaten ASEAN’s unity and effectiveness. Strengthening ASEAN cooperation and promoting the ASEAN Outlook on the Indo-Pacific (AOIP) can drive Indonesia's sustainable development and economic integration across the region, thereby enhancing Southeast Asia’s resilience against global disruptions and great power rivalries. Maritime security must also remain a priority for Indonesia. As a maritime nation, protecting its waters, particularly around the Natuna Islands, and addressing issues like illegal fishing is essential. Improving naval capabilities and engaging in multilateral maritime initiatives, such as the Regional Cooperation Agreement on Combating Piracy and Armed Robbery against Ships in Asia (ReCAAP), are vital steps. Partnering with countries like Japan, India, and Australia can further enhance regional maritime stability. Additionally, ensuring that maritime development benefits Indonesia’s coastal communities will reinforce the foundation for the country’s long-term maritime goals. A combination of security and socioeconomic initiatives will help Indonesia solidify its status as a maritime power. For Prabowo’s administration to succeed, key measures include restoring the authority of the KPK to combat corruption, investing in public welfare to address economic inequality, delegating foreign policy execution to experienced diplomats at Kemlu, strengthening leadership in ASEAN to enhance regional unity, and advancing maritime diplomacy to safeguard sovereignty and foster cooperation. Indonesia stands at a critical juncture. While domestic reforms are necessary to tackle issues of corruption, inequality, and governance, an active and professional diplomatic approach remains essential for navigating external challenges. Balancing these priorities will enable Indonesia to uphold its Bebas Aktif doctrine and reaffirm its role as a key player in Southeast Asia and the broader Indo-Pacific region. With decisive leadership and a focus on both domestic and international priorities, Prabowo’s administration can ensure Indonesia’s stability, sovereignty, and growth in the years to come.

Cattle Rustling: A Lifeline For Boko Haram In The Lake Chad Basin...	Insurgents fund their activities through stealing cows – making it more difficult to address organised crime and terrorism. By Oluwole Ojewale and Raoul Sumo Tayo In Africa, transnational cattle rustling – the forceful theft of livestock for illicit commercial gain – is increasingly linked to organised criminal and terrorist groups. It is a source of illicit finance, a form of forced governance over local populations and a way to exert dominance. Stolen cattle are sold to fund the purchase of weapons and supplies and to recruit fighters. Rustling has grown in both scale and violence. And when perpetrated across national boundaries by actors such as Boko Haram, it demonstrates the terror-crime nexus in the Lake Chad Basin. A recent assessment carried out by ENACT and the Central African Police Chiefs Committee (CAPCCO) identified cattle rustling as a priority crime affecting the region. This is supported by Armed Conflict Location & Event Data (ACLED) project information, which shows that incidents of cattle rustling by Boko Haram in Cameroon and Chad’s border regions rose from two in 2015 to 131 as of August 2024 (see chart). There have been 390 incidents and 146 deaths in this time. This data relies on local groups and media reports, and many incidents may have gone unrecorded. Lake Chad, the Logone and Chari rivers and surrounding areas play a crucial role in shaping the dynamics of cattle rustling in the region due to the availability of water and grazing pastures. These areas are natural magnets for pastoralist communities, especially during dry seasons when other regions face water scarcity. Pastoralists often move their herds to these fertile valleys during transhumance (seasonal migration) to use the rich grazing lands. This predictable movement and concentration of herders and cattle in a contained area increase the opportunities for cattle rustlers to plan and execute raids and target larger numbers of animals in a single raid. The basin’s marshy terrain and hard-to-patrol areas also provide a haven for criminal groups to operate. Recent ENACT field research found that Boko Haram played a prominent role in cattle rustling activities in Chad and Cameroon’s common border areas due to the proximity of this area to the group’s base. Cattle rustling is one of its key revenue-generating activities and has become a crucial part of its overarching strategy for sustaining its operational capabilities. An expert from Cameroon’s University of Maroua said: ‘Cattle rustling is a major source of funding for armed groups. If we say, for example, that a cow is worth 200 000 CFA, over a short period of time, a group that stole 25 000 head would have amassed 5 billion CFA.’ In regions where Boko Haram has established control or considerable influence, it employs cattle rustling as a means to exert dominance over local populations through interconnected strategies. In Africa, transnational cattle rustling is increasingly linked to organised criminal and terrorist groups The first involves direct violent raids on communities, when cattle are stolen or both cattle and herders are abducted. The militants demand a ransom for the livestock’s return. This approach hits communities economically, compelling them to either submit to Boko Haram’s demands or pay protection fees to avert further attacks, said a former N’Djamena minister and provincial governor. The second includes imposing an illegal livestock tax on pastoral communities. Butchers in Bongor, Chad, told ENACT: ‘Boko Haram has established a tax [system]. They say that each herder must pay such an amount [of money]. If the herders refuse to give them, they kill them and take the cattle. They give to another person to go and sell.’ A new dimension to Boko Haram’s modus operandi is called ‘cattle round tripping’. This cattle-rustling tactic capitalises on deficiencies in legal and market systems, so rustlers profit from stolen cattle through strategic and deceptive practices. Rustlers generally steal cattle from specific communities, often executing raids in areas with weak security, where pastoralism is the predominant livelihood. To elude law enforcement, they transport the stolen cattle to distant locations, frequently crossing state borders where tracking by authorities is significantly hindered. A Cameroon military official said, ‘Sometimes they take those cattle and go into Nigeria to exchange them for other cattle so that they should not be known. And then they bring them back to the cattle market in Cameroon.’ Incidents of cattle rustling rose from 2 in 2015 to 131 in 2024, with 390 incidents and 146 deaths The stolen cattle are predominantly taken to Nigeria as it’s the biggest cattle market in the region, said the former provincial governor. The rustlers sell the stolen cattle at local and regional markets or to unsuspecting buyers. These cattle are mixed with legally acquired livestock and sold at prevailing prices, frequently through informal trading networks. ‘Selling cattle to buy weapons and supplies and recruit fighters creates a symbiotic relationship between cattle rustling and insurgencies,’ a university expert told ENACT. Several opportunities exist in this tri-border region to address this complex organised criminal activity. By improving existing security measures, the state, security forces, Multinational Joint Task Force (MNJTF) and pastoralist communities can develop a comprehensive strategy to reduce cattle rustling and promote stability and economic security in the region. Security forces and the MNJTF can work with local communities to develop early-warning systems that use traditional knowledge and modern technologies (such as cellphone alerts or community radio) to communicate cattle rustling or suspicious movements quickly. Security forces can create specialised units in the police and military focused on cattle rustling. Armed with modern tracking technology, drones and satellite surveillance, these units can monitor cattle movements across borders and apprehend perpetrators in remote areas. Early-warning systems using traditional knowledge and modern tech can counter cattle rustling Pastoralist communities can organise legal, community-based vigilante groups that are officially recognised by the state. These groups should receive proper training in using kinetic military action and non-lethal methods to recover stolen cattle and prevent livestock theft. Adequate oversight mechanisms must ensure they operate within legal frameworks. International development partners can supply advanced technology such as Global Positioning System tracking collars for cattle, drone surveillance and digital registration systems. These will aid security forces and communities in tracking cattle movements and preventing theft. While an Eastern Africa Police Chiefs Cooperation-CAPCCO agreement could provide for cooperation in combatting cross-border crime and enhancing regional security, the MifugoProtocol specifically addresses regional collaboration in addressing cattle rustling and livestock theft across borders. These frameworks offer authorities in the affected countries a strategy for effectively confronting shared challenges while advancing peace, security and development.

The Impact Of Russia Sanctions On Central Asia – Analysis	By Maximilian Hess (FPRI) -- Since Vladimir Putin launched his full-scale invasion of Ukraine and invited the largest international sanctions regime against Russia since the Second World War, Central Asia and the Caucasus have been forced into an uncomfortable position at the front of the accompanying economic war. The region finds itself in a position that its constituent states did not choose, and its countries have engaged in complex and differentiated balancing strategies. Notably, not one has brought the sanctions into its legislation and regulation, though most have quietly pushed for compliance to avoid the significant risks that come with falling afoul of those issued by the West and the United States in particular. The sanctions have undeniably had some costs for the region—particularly for businesses deeply integrated into Russia, or whose leadership is. However, forcing the Kremlin into an economically defensive position has also inadvertently opened up new opportunities for the region, some of which offer potential long-term benefits while others carry significant risks. To more fully understand the impact of sanctions on the region, one must first examine their initial impact within the wider context of the ructions from Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine. These disturbances include the brain drain and population shifts out of Russia that began shortly after and ramped up dramatically, if briefly, following the Kremlin’s introduction of conscription in September 2022. Then, the trade changes that the region has experienced in 2023 and 2024 can be more fully appreciated, and the importance of the region going forward can be understood. The economic battlefield has shifted from managing the fallout of Putin’s weaponization of hydrocarbon supplies to restricting the trade into Russia that the Kremlin depends on to feed its war machine. Finally, examining the attitude and positioning toward the region of sanctions-imposing countries forms a picture of how Central Asia’s position is likely to shift—or be shifted—going forward. Sanctions are not a perfect tool, but they have become, and are likely to remain,the key instrument in the West’s geoeconomic approach to Russia, China, and other geopolitical challenges. They will, therefore, continue to shape Central Eurasia’s economic and political relationships with all of its key markets and regional powers. It may seem counterintuitive, given one of the key aims of the sanctions imposed on Russia has been to restrict trade with Russia, but trade with Russia has boomed for Central Asia and the Caucasus since 2022. Much of this has been driven by trade rerouting as European exports to Russia declined and were instead rerouted through the region. According to a June 2024 Oxford Economics report, export increases to Russia in 2022 amounted to 5 percent in Georgia, 30 percent in Kazakhstan, and a remarkable 193 percent in Armenia, fueled by a marked increase in imports from the EU across all the countries in the region studied in the report as well. Research from the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development has underlined that goods subject to Western export controls imposed on the Kremlin as part of their sanctions regimes have formed an outsize share of such trade so rerouted. Reports of white goods, such as washing machines and refrigerators being shipped through the region so Russia could pick them apart for dual-use components, garnered international headlines within a year of the war. This trade is only part of the picture. far more important for the region was the massive influx of Russian nationals and capital, particularly to Kazakhstan, Georgia, Armenia, and to a slightly lesser extent Uzbekistan and Kyrgyzstan. The flows were so significant that Georgia’s and Armenia’s currencies boomed as demand from Russian capital and those fleeing conscription boomed. They became the world’s best performersagainst the US dollar that year alongside Tajikistan, a particularly remarkable feat given the rise of US and other key central bank interest rates to deal with global inflation largely driven by the energy crisis Putin’s war initiated. It would also be an oversimplification to say that Central Asian and Caucasus countries turned a blind eye to the risks of Russian sanctions. The region’s key banks swiftly ended key 'correspondent banking' relationships with Russian counterparties that came under Western SWIFT sanctions, cutting them off from the global intrabank messaging system. Even governments that took a position of explicitly stating they would not join the sanctions regime because of the perceived risks of Russia’s response have permitted regulatory authorities to issue strict guidance. For example, Georgia’s central bank has repeatedly issued guidance calling on the country’s financial institutions to operate 'in accordance with restrictive measures—financial sanctions imposed by the USA, the European Union, and Great Britain against the Russian Federation.' The sanctions that are most effectively enforced internationally—precisely such financial sanctions—have had the most impact in Central Asia and the Caucasus. Even countries with relatively few connections to the international financial system, such as Tajikistan, have seen broad compliance with measures introduced since 2022, including those targeting the payment systems that the Kremlin has engineered to try and mitigate the impact of such sanctions. Nevertheless, the dichotomy between regulatory actions and those taken by risk-averse compliance teams and the statements and actions of governments in the region is inescapable. In particular for Georgia—which has been the country in the region closest to the West since its 2004 Rose Revolution—this disjunction has caused substantial diplomatic and domestic political strain. That, too, is the case in countries that have less established democratic traditions such as Kazakhstan, whose leader, Kassym-Jomart Tokayev, arguably owes his continued presence in the presidency to Russia’s intervention in the country just a month before it invaded Ukraine. Tokayev has repeatedly pledged to 'follow the sanctions regime' while calling for continued 'comprehensive cooperation with Russia.' Kyrgyzstan—which has drifted closer to Russia since President Sadyr Japarov came to power in 2020—has also sought to avoid accusations that it is turning a blind eye to trade sanctions imposed on Russia. Countries imposing sanctions on Russia have not been blind to the region’s complications and interconnectedness with the Russian economy, however. When the Russian-Uzbek billionaire oligarch Alisher Usmanov was sanctioned in March 2022, the US Office of Foreign Asset Controls (OFAC) simultaneously issued General License 15 as one of its broadest-ever licenses carving out his Uzbek business interests from being automatically subject to the restrictions placed on him. This appears to have been an attempt to convince Tashkent to restrain his influence in the Uzbek economy, which has grownsubstantially under President Shavkat Mirziyoyev—to whom he is related by marriage—though it was relatively unheeded as Uzbekistan lobbied to have sanctions on Usmanov reversed. The license was withdrawn in April 2023 and Usmanov’s facilitators, including some Uzbek nationals, were additionally sanctioned. The US has similarly used its sanctions to warn other regional leaders of moving too close to Moscow. The September 2023 designation of former Georgian General Prosecutor Otar Partskhaladze, a close ally of Bidzina Ivanishvili, the country’s dominant political figure and honorary chair of the ruling Georgian Dream Party, for working together with Russia’s Federal Security Service 'for the benefit of Russia.' Although neither Partskhaladze’s nor Usmanov’s designations have resulted in about-faces from Tashkent or Tbilisi, there are potential other areas of success. One Russian oligarch who was sanctioned by the UK in September 2022—Igor Makarov—was long known to be close to Turkmenistan’s Berdymukhamedov regime. In fact, it is in that country that he was predominantly active since selling his Itera energy trading and hydrocarbons business to Rosneft in 2013. London lifted the sanctions on him this March after he gave up his Russian citizenship. Given Makarov’s purported involvement in the Russian-Ukrainian gas trade of the early 2000s, which was long at the heart of the Kremlin’s strategy of keeping economic influence over Ukraine, and his role as one of the few businessmen to regularly visit the Berdymukhamedovs, the wider as-of-yet-unpublicized details of the deal that was struck for his delisting may prove helpful to Western policymakers seeking to counter regional Russian economic influence in the future. This nuanced approach to the region—and to differentiating between how to apply sanctions to different governments within it—is also clearly evident in two other areas of sanctions. First, there are sanctions on companies that have been set up to avoid and evade sanctions on imports into Russia. Thus far, Western designations of companies in the region have been concentrated on those explicitly established to do so. The Kazakh, Uzbek, and Armenian companies that have been sanctioned thus far are largely such trade facilitators. No financing partners or regional authorities have been designated for overlooking or failing to catch these. The threat of fines and designations for the doing so, however, is increasing as a result of the December 2023 US Executive Order 14114 expanding secondary sanctions and the June 2024 OFAC guidance emphasizing that this encompassed all financial institutions, even those who 'unknowingly' facilitate them. Europe is also taking steps to introduce its own version of secondary sanctions through its 'anti-circumvention measures.' Once again, regional regulators have been taking steps to enhance compliance, for example in Kazakhstan where the Central Securities Depository ordered brokers and managers to divest from Russian securities in July. While financial services sanctions are somewhat easier for regional governments to push compliance with, it will be up to the companies that produce the dual-use and critical technology items or license the underlying intellectual property to take the lead in overseeing compliance for the trade sanctions to be truly effective. Those are predominantly Western firms. Almost none are firms based in Central Asia and the Caucasus. The risk-reward mechanics thus far have failed to achieve this, as Elina Ribakova has eloquently argued in Financial Times. Second, the West’s differentiated approach concerning sanctions on Russia in the region is particularly clear in natural gas markets. While it was Russia that turned off the gas taps to Europe in 2022, as the continent adjusted by turning to alternatives from Algeria, Azerbaijan, and in particular liquefied natural gas (LNG) tanker shipments, Brussels has recently begun to sanction Russia’s gas market. The US has also sharpened its sanctions on Russian LNG in particular, with the designation of the Arctic-2 project in September 2023. However, both Europe and the West have turned a blind eye to the region itself increasing natural gas imports from Russia. This has been the case even in Azerbaijan, which in 2022 agreed to import Russian gas to try and meet commitments to increase deliveries of its own piped gas to Europe. There has been no Western opposition to this, nor has there been public opposition from sanctions-imposing countries to more voluminous deliveries sought by Uzbekistan, which in 2023 agreed to begin importing 2.8 billion cubic meters of natural gas annually from Russia and aims to increase that nearly fourfold by 2030. There is precedent for such regional pragmatism in oil markets as well, particularly in the case of Kazakhstan, which is still dependent on Russian export routes for more than 90 percent of its oil sales. After European sanctions barred most pipeline deliveries of crude from Russia, the EU and other sanctions-imposing countries did not stand in the way of Kazakh oil being shipped through the route instead. This is a remarkable turnaround in Astana’s own position, given that it was itself subject to threats from Russia in 2022 to toggle off its oil exports if it did not take a sufficiently pro-Russian position, a tactic that clearly failed. So, while trade sanctions may still bring more costs to the region, in both oil and gas markets, the impact of the international sanctions regime on Putin’s regime has actually been to tip the balance of interests in regional energy markets away from Russia and toward the Central Asian states. Sanctions will remain a delicate dance for the region. Although the countries themselves have not explicitly joined the regime, they have proven more successful at challenging Russian influence in key markets and potentially through regional elites. The region’s inherent geography means that Russia will continue to seek to use it to evade import sanctions in particular. The West must build on the successes that the regime has had thus far—particularly as sanctions-imposing countries look to navigate divisions among themselves about the approach to Russia following the election of Donald Trump in the US while also seeking to sharpen their own controls and regulations for the accompanying likely increase in trade controls and limitations applied to the region’s other major neighboring power, China.

How Germany Destroyed Its Economy, And How To Fix It – Analysis	By Daniel Lacalle The German economy was once a global industrial powerhouse, showing a strong resilience in times of crisis as well as significant productive growth in periods of expansion. Germany displayed robust industrial activity, solid productivity, and enviably low unemployment levels, which added to real high wages. However, in the past five years the economy has stagnated, and its GDP is 5% smaller than the pre-pandemic growth trend suggested, according to Bloomberg Economics. Even more worryingly, they estimate that four percentage points of that loss may be permanent. Most analyses blame the weakness of the German economy on higher energy costs and the Chinese slowdown affecting its exports. However, the reality is more complex. Germany’s stagnation is self-inflicted. Germany made its first big mistake in 2012, when its leaders accepted the left-wing diagnosis of the European debt crisis, which blamed all problems on nonexistent austerity. Germany embraced inflationism and, in 2014, agreed to the same monetary and interventionist policies that have always destroyed Europe. The German government and the Bundesbank reluctantly agreed to massive ECB monetary expansion and negative nominal rates while allowing the European Commission to abandon its oversight of excessive indebtedness and signing off on back-to-back 'stimulus' packages like the Juncker Plan or the Next Generation EU disasters, all of which have left the euro area in stagnation, with more debt and now, inflation. Germans suffer a cumulative inflation of more than 20% in the past five years. Politicians blame it on Ukraine and Putin, but we all know it is a ludicrous excuse. Money supply growth and constant increases in government spending have obliterated the purchasing power of the euro and fueled inflation. 'An upsurge in money growth preceded the inflation flare-up, and countries with stronger money growth saw markedly higher inflation' (Borio et al., 2023). Keynesians believed that a weaker euro would boost Germany’s exports, but this is a myth. Export leaders rise thanks to high added value, not low cost. In any case, all the interventionist policies adopted by the European Union would leave a weak currency and an even weaker economy. The second lethal mistake was its energy policy. High energy costs are not inevitable. They come from the misguided energy policy that drove German politicians to shut down their nuclear fleet and spend more than 200 billion euros subsidizing volatile and intermittent technologies only to perpetuate the use of coal and lignite, which accounts for 25% of its power production, according to AGEB 2024. In fact, 77% of its energy consumption and 40% of its power production come from fossil fuels. German politicians also embraced the EU agenda that banned the development of domestic natural gas but multiplied the imports of US liquefied natural gas produced from fracking. Fascinating. Furthermore, the enormous subsidies and regulated costs added to consumer bills have made it so that more than 60% of the electricity price paid by consumers comes from regulated costs and taxes, including the CO2 cost, which is a hidden tax. Germans pay more for energy and still depend on fossil fuels because the government destroyed its access to cheap Russian natural gas and replaced it with expensive and unreliable options. Only a group of politicians can decide to enter an energy war and ban the alternatives. The third fatal mistake was to swallow the increasingly damaging policies coming from the EU Commission and the EU Parliament. A slowdown of the Chinese economy does not take a global export leader to stagnation, especially when the Asian giant is growing at 5% per year. A global export leader like Germany was rightly proud of a productive network that allowed its industry to grow thanks to high added-value products, technology, and a global reach that made German companies sell all over the world and navigate any macroeconomic environment. What made the once-mighty German industry stagnate and decline despite robust global growth was the combination of excessive regulation, disincentives to innovation, elevated taxes, and embracing the disastrous 2030 agenda that bans combustion engine vehicles. Politicians demolished the sales potential of the entire industrial complex with a misguided environmental and regulatory policy. Activists used the seemingly innocent 2030 agenda to impose an interventionist and unproductive model, obliterating all of Germany’s industries and farming and agriculture sectors. The wrongly named Nature Restoration Law, which makes it nearly impossible to conduct primary sector activities, further compounded this damage. The European Union’s gradual imposition of excessive regulation and disincentives has also resulted in Germany losing a significant portion of its technological leadership. Germany’s engineering and technology dominance was based on an open, highly competitive, and rewarding system that has been destroyed by bureaucracy and regulation. Germany is a global leader in patent applications but lags the United States, and the translation of patents to businesses is exceedingly poor. German politicians say that all the above challenges will become strengths in the future. I doubt it, because their track record of prediction failures is spectacular. What Germany needs is to abandon inflationism, interventionism, and comic-book activism. If Germany adopts these changes, its economy will experience significant growth. Germany does not have a competitiveness or human capital problem; it has a political problem. Abandon socialist interventionism, and Germany will be back to its trend of growth and leadership.

Ron Paul: What Are We Doing In Syria? – OpEd	My first reaction to news earlier this month that the Syrian government had been overthrown was, how much did we have to do with it; how involved was the CIA; and how much is it going to cost. As with Saddam and Gaddafi before him, we know that Assad was no libertarian hero. But unleashing an army dedicated to establishing an Islamic state in once-secular Syria hardly seems like a good idea to me. As with President George W. Bush’s 'Mission Accomplished' moment after Saddam’s overthrow, getting rid of Assad will prove to be the easy part. Rebuilding Syrian society after the destruction of the country will cost billions and will likely be about as successful as our 'liberation' of Libya, which is still a failed, terrorist-dominated state more than a decade later. In 2017 the Los Angeles Times published an article that, sadly, speaks volumes about the insanity of our interventionist foreign policy. 'In Syria, militants armed by the Pentagon fight those armed by the CIA,' read the headline. How does it make any sense that the Pentagon is fighting a proxy war with the CIA on Syrian soil? What’s worse is that the American people are forced to pay for this Pentagon versus CIA war and then forced to pay again to rebuild the country after all the destruction. The Syrian people will feel the cost in more than just dollars. How involved is the US government in the overthrow of the Syrian government? For the past ten years the US has controlled the areas of Syria oil and wheat production, stealing resources that we have no legal claim on. The combination of resource theft and extreme sanctions hollowed out Syrian society over the past ten years, so when the terrorists sprang forth from Idlib a few weeks ago there was little resistance. Now instead of the relatively benign yet authoritarian rule of Assad, we have rule by the direct inheritors of the people who attacked us on 9/11. I am shocked that the mainstream media and many if not most politicians are cheering this. Ironically, some of the biggest cheerleaders for the al-Qaeda takeover of Syria are the same Members of Congress who finished their daily speeches on the House Floor with 'we will never forget 9/11.' I guess they finally forgot? The implosion of Syria, like the US-engineered implosion of Libya and Iraq, has not led to democracy, peace, and the protection of civil liberties. In each case it has produced the exact opposite. Millions dead, millions more living in misery with many seeking revenge against those who destroyed their families, their lifestyle, and their countries. Are we safer having created millions of new enemies? President-elect Donald Trump made a statement last week about Syria, saying that this is not our fight and we should have nothing to do with it. His sentiment is the correct one, though we have unfortunately to this point had far too much to do with it. Let us hope that as president, Donald Trump will follow through with this sentiment and extract the US – the overt and covert presence – from not only Syria but the entire Middle East. This is not our fight and every single thing we have done there for the past 75 or so years has only made things worse. Time for an America first foreign policy!

The Police State Is America’s New Crime Boss – OpEd	The American police state has become America’s new crime boss. Thirty years after then-President Bill Clinton signed the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act into law, its legacy of mass incarceration, police militarization, and over-criminalization continues to haunt us. It has become the gift that America can’t seem to return. We are now suffering the blowback from the triple threats of the Crime Bill: police militarization, a warrior mindset that has police viewing the rest of the citizenry as enemy combatants, and law enforcement training that teaches cops to shoot first and ask questions later. Too often, that 'triple threat' also manifests itself in deadly traffic stops, the use of excessive force against unarmed individuals, and welfare checks turned fatal. The Crime Bill fueled the rise of the police state by pouring funding into law enforcement agencies, particularly for military-grade weaponry and the expansion of police forces. It also laid the groundwork for mass incarceration by incentivizing the construction of more prisons and enacting harsh 'three strikes' laws that mandated lengthy sentences for repeat offenders. Most critically, the Crime Bill led to the explosive growth of SWAT teams across the country. It’s estimated that more than 80,000 SWAT raids are carried out every year. That translates to over 200 every single day in the U.S. Among the tens of thousands of raids that leave in their wake the wreckage of lives, homes and trust in the nation’s so-called peacekeepers, some are so egregious as to cut through the apathy and desensitization that has settled over the nation regarding police violence. Breonna Taylor was killed when plainclothes police executed a no-knock warrant of her home late at night. Officers used a battering ram to enter the home. Taylor’s boyfriend, believing it was a home invasion, fired a warning shot. Officers responded with a barrage of gunfire, killing Taylor. Such tragedies are not isolated incidents. They are the direct result of a system built on policies like the 1994 Crime Bill. The unfortunate reality we must come to terms with is that America is overrun with militarized cops—vigilantes with a badge—who have almost absolute discretion to decide who is a threat, what constitutes resistance, and how harshly they can deal with the citizens they were appointed to 'serve and protect.' It doesn’t matter where you live—big city or small town—it’s the same scenario being played out over and over again in which government agents, hyped up on their own authority and the power of their uniform, ride roughshod over the rights of the citizenry. These warrior cops, who have been trained to act as judge, jury and executioner in their interactions with the public and believe the lives (and rights) of police should be valued more than citizens, are increasingly outnumbering the good cops, who take seriously their oath of office to serve and protect their fellow citizens, uphold the Constitution, and maintain the peace. Indeed, if you ask police and their enablers what Americans should do to stay alive during encounters with law enforcement, they will tell you to comply, no matter what. In other words, it doesn’t matter if you’re in the right, it doesn’t matter if a cop is in the wrong. If you want to emerge from a police encounter with your life and body intact, then you’d better do whatever a cop tells you to do. In this way, the old police motto to 'protect and serve' has become 'comply or die.' This is the unfortunate, misguided, perverse message that has been beaten, shot, tasered and slammed into our collective consciousness over the past few decades, and it has taken root. This is how we have gone from a nation of laws—where the least among us had just as much right to be treated with dignity and respect as the next person (in principle, at least)—to a nation of law enforcers (revenue collectors with weapons) who treat 'we the people' like suspects and criminals. As a result, Americans as young as 4 years old are being leg shackled, handcuffed, tasered and held at gun point for not being quiet, not being orderly and just being childlike—i.e., not being compliant enough. Americans as old as 95 are being beaten, shot and killed for questioning an order, hesitating in the face of a directive, and mistaking a policeman crashing through their door for a criminal breaking into their home—i.e., not being submissive enough. And Americans of every age and skin color are continuing to die at the hands of a government that sees itself as judge, jury and executioner over a populace that have been pre-judged and found guilty, stripped of their rights, and left to suffer at the hands of government agents trained to respond with the utmost degree of violence. At a time when growing numbers of unarmed people have been shot and killed for just standing a certain way, or moving a certain way, or holding something—anything—that police could misinterpret to be a gun, or igniting some trigger-centric fear in a police officer’s mind that has nothing to do with an actual threat to their safety, even the most benign encounters with police can have fatal consequences. The problem, as one reporter rightly concluded, is 'not that life has gotten that much more dangerous, it’s that authorities have chosen to respond to even innocent situations as if they were in a warzone.' Warrior cops—trained in the worst-case scenario and thus ready to shoot first and ask questions later—are definitely not making us or themselves any safer. Worse, militarized police increasingly pose a risk to anyone undergoing a mental health crisis or with special needs whose disabilities may not be immediately apparent or require more finesse than the typical freeze-or-I’ll-shoot tactics employed by America’s police forces. Indeed, disabled individuals make up a third to half of all people killed by law enforcement officers. (People of color are three times more likely to be killed by police than their white counterparts.) If you’re black and disabled, you’re even more vulnerable. Specifically, what we’re dealing with today is a skewed shoot-to-kill mindset in which police, trained to view themselves as warriors or soldiers in a war, whether against drugs, or terror, or crime, must 'get' the bad guys—i.e., anyone who is a potential target—before the bad guys get them. This nationwide epidemic of court-sanctioned police violence carried out with impunity against individuals posing little or no real threat has all but guaranteed that unarmed Americans will keep dying at the hands of militarized police. Making matters worse, when these officers, who have long since ceased to be peace officers, violate their oaths by bullying, beating, tasering, shooting and killing their employers—the taxpayers to whom they owe their allegiance—they are rarely given more than a slap on the hands before resuming their patrols. This lawlessness on the part of law enforcement, an unmistakable characteristic of a police state, is made possible in large part by police unions which routinely oppose civilian review boards and resist the placement of names and badge numbers on officer uniforms; police agencies that abide by the Blue Code of Silence, the quiet understanding among police that they should not implicate their colleagues for their crimes and misconduct; prosecutors who treat police offenses with greater leniency than civilian offenses; courts that sanction police wrongdoing in the name of security; and legislatures that enhance the power, reach and arsenal of the police, and a citizenry that fails to hold its government accountable to the rule of law. Indeed, not only are cops protected from most charges of wrongdoing—whether it’s shooting unarmed citizens (including children and old people), raping and abusing young women, falsifying police reports, trafficking drugs, or soliciting sex with minors—but even on the rare occasions when they are fired for misconduct, it’s only a matter of time before they get re-hired again. Much of the 'credit' for shielding these rogue cops goes to influential police unions and laws providing for qualified immunity, police contracts that 'provide a shield of protection to officers accused of misdeeds and erect barriers to residents complaining of abuse,' state and federal laws that allow police to walk away without paying a dime for their wrongdoing, and rampant cronyism among government bureaucrats. It’s happening all across the country. This is no longer a debate over good cops and bad cops. It’s a power struggle between police officers who rank their personal safety above everyone else’s and police officers who understand that their jobs are to serve and protect; between police trained to shoot to kill and police trained to resolve situations peacefully; most of all, it’s between police who believe the law is on their side and police who know that they will be held to account for their actions under the same law as everyone else. Unfortunately, more and more police are being trained to view themselves as distinct from the citizenry, to view their authority as superior to the citizenry, and to view their lives as more precious than those of their citizen counterparts. Instead of being taught to see themselves as mediators and peacemakers whose lethal weapons are to be used as a last resort, they are being drilled into acting like gunmen with killer instincts who shoot to kill rather than merely incapacitate. In Barnes v. Felix, a case before the U.S. Supreme Court, the justices have been asked to do away with the 'moment-of-threat doctrine,' which encourages police to act recklessly with impunity, unnecessarily escalating the level of danger in situations involving relatively minor crimes and then responding to the perceived danger with deadly force. Like the Ghost of Christmas Past, the 1994 Crime Bill haunts us with its legacy of injustice. Its Ghost of Christmas Present shows us the ongoing struggles with police brutality and mass incarceration. And its Ghost of Christmas Future warns us of a society where over-policing and surveillance become the norm. So how do we counter the triple threats posed by the Crime Bill? Despite the outcry from those on the left, the answer is not to de-fund the police, although it wouldn’t hurt to loosen the military industrial complex’s chokehold on America. What we really need to do is de-fang the police: de-militarize (reduce the reliance on military-grade equipment and tactics), de-weaponize, and focus on de-escalation tactics (prioritizing communication and conflict resolution skills over the use of force), a shift in mindset (moving away from the 'warrior' mentality towards a guardian or community policing model), and better accountability. As with all things, change must start locally, in your hometown. Remember, a police state does not come about overnight. It starts small, perhaps with a revenue-generating red light camera at an intersection. When that is implemented without opposition, perhaps next will be surveillance cameras on public streets. License plate readers on police cruisers. More police officers on the beat. Free military equipment from the federal government. Free speech zones and zero tolerance policies and curfews. SWAT team raids. Drones flying overhead. No matter how it starts, however, as I make clear in my book Battlefield America: The War on the American People and in its fictional counterpart The Erik Blair Diaries, it always ends the same.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWdGQ6ALRIc3FaiyDL3osMgn	2024-12-16T16:21:29-08:00	
China Baits Indonesia To Soften South China Sea Stance – Analysis	By Jefferson Ng Indonesian President Prabowo Subianto’s state visit to China in November 2024 appears to have implicitly acknowledged the legitimacy of Chinese territorial claims in maritime areas — where its nine-dash line overlaps with Indonesia’s Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) surrounding the Natuna Islands. Though not legally binding, a joint statement produced from the visit mentioned ‘joint development in areas of overlapping claims’. This seemed to depart from Indonesia’s longstanding stance that Chinese claims contradict the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea and have no basis under international law. Indonesia’s apparent shift in position stems from China’s playbook for asserting its South China Sea claims. Chinese maritime ambition combined with Indonesia’s domestic economic imperatives and teething problems within the president’s advisory system to produce this outcome. The joint statement highlighted key features of China’s aim to advance its maritime claims in the South China Sea vis-a-vis other Southeast Asian countries. In particular, the joint development proposal follows similar overtures China has made to other countries like the Philippines and Vietnam. These efforts reflect Beijing’s use of ostensibly neutral joint development proposals to gradually expand its presence in the disputed maritime areas, particularly under new administrations eager to secure investment and growth opportunities. China successfully appealed to Indonesian domestic economic priorities in this instance. Besides fisheries cooperation around the Natunas, China pledged substantial economic support for President Prabowo’s signature initiatives, including the free lunch programme for schoolchildren and an ambitious project to build affordable public housing for low-income families. China also made US$10 billion in additional investments across various sectors. China’s joint development proposal also found a receptive audience among Indonesia’s political leadership, eager for foreign investments to help deliver on political promises. The country faces significant economic challenges as it aims to transition from middle to high-income in line with its 2045 vision. A shrinking middle class, stagnant economic growth and low labour productivity are exacerbated by limited access to higher education which has restricted economic opportunities for Indonesians. To address these challenges, Prabowo pledged to boost the country’s economic growth to 8 per cent a year as part of his election campaign. But Indonesia’s fiscal constraints — stemming from a low tax-to-GDP ratio — complicate this task. Prabowo’s only real option is to boost trade and attract substantial foreign investment. Under the former Jokowi administration, Indonesia benefitted greatly from major foreign investments from cash-rich countries such as China and the United Arab Emirates. Emulating his predecessor, Prabowo visited both China and the United Arab Emirates within a month of his inauguration, securing significant commitments from both countries. Unfortunately, while former president Joko ‘Jokowi’ Widodo largely left the foreign ministry to the stewardship of career diplomats, Prabowo has opted to politicise the ministry by appointing a trusted protege, Sugiono, as foreign minister. This has produced a dual-track approach to foreign policy — career diplomats manage routine foreign affairs issues, while decisions that have a direct bearing on political interests are handled by the president’s inner circle. While this means that the foreign minister is more responsive to the president’s interests, it effectively sidelines traditional institutional safeguards. The resulting China–Indonesia joint statement indicated that career diplomats at the Foreign Ministry had either been sidelined or not consulted. It also highlighted the absence of foreign policy experts in the president’s inner circle. Overall, the joint statement puts Indonesia in an awkward position. It is keen to secure Chinese economic assistance for its developmental objectives and better exploit the resources in its EEZ. As Indonesia’s Foreign Minister put it, ‘50 per cent of zero is still zero’, highlighting Indonesia’s desire for pragmatic economic cooperation with China. But any future cooperation initiative with China in its Natuna EEZ is likely to take reference from this joint statement, which will be interpreted in a manner beneficial to Chinese interests. To avoid giving further credence to Chinese claims, Indonesia will need to exercise a great deal of diplomatic finesse in subsequent negotiations and be prepared to pull the plug on any form of economic cooperation that compromises its sovereign rights in its EEZ. There are broader takeaways from this incident that have implications for Southeast Asian states and their relationships with China. All Southeast Asian states can and should exercise agency in dealings with China. Though economic cooperation with China is attractive, China’s economic carrots are designed to advance its own national interests — as it should. Thus, due diligence and wariness of hidden strings are key when seeking economic cooperation with China. The United States is also conspicuous for its absence. Though Prabowo did visit the United States, few concrete economic commitments were secured, fuelling the perception that the United States is increasingly disengaged from Southeast Asia. According to the latest State of Southeast Asia survey, 59.5 per cent of respondents view China as the region’s most influential economic power, compared to just 14.3 per cent for the United States, which even lags behind Japan. The United States must recognise that offering a robust economic counterweight to China would empower Southeast Asian nations to maintain strategic flexibility without being forced to align definitively. Efforts to support Indonesia’s energy transition, infrastructure needs and other development goals could serve as starting points for deeper engagement. It remains uncertain if the incoming Trump administration will continue Biden-era policies or adopt more mercantilist approach — potentially forcing Southeast Asian countries to pick sides. Without decisive action, the United States risks leaving a critical gap in its Indo-Pacific strategy, relying solely on individual Southeast Asian nations to hedge effectively between superpowers. Indonesia’s joint statement with China is a cautionary tale for Southeast Asian nations navigating the complexities of economic cooperation with China in an era of growing Chinese assertiveness. For Indonesia, the intersection of Chinese overtures, domestic economic imperatives and weaknesses in the president’s advisory system produced an outcome at odds with its longstanding position on the South China Sea and may cause spillover effects for the other Southeast Asian claimant states.

A New Geo-Political Map Is Unfolding: The End Of Syria (And Of ‘P...	Syria has entered the abyss – the demons of al-Qa’eda, ISIS, and the most intransigent elements of the Muslim Brotherhood are circling the skies. There is chaos, looting, fear, and a terrible passion for revenge scalds the blood. Street executions are rife. Maybe Hayat Tahrir Al-Sham (HTS) and its leader, Al-Joulani, (following Turkish instruction), thought to control things. But HTS is an umbrella label like Al-Qa’eda, ISIS and An-Nusra, and its factions have already descended into factional fighting. The Syrian ‘state’ dissolved in the middle of the night; the police and army went home, leaving weapons depots open for the Shebab to loot. The prison doors were flung (or prised) open. Some, no doubt, were political prisoners; but many were not. Some of the most vicious inmates now roam the streets. The Israelis – within days – totally eviscerated the defence infrastructure of the state in more than 450 air strikes: missile air defences, Syrian air force helicopters and aircraft, the navy and the armouries – all destroyed in the 'largest air operation in Israel’s history'. Syria no longer exists as a geo-political entity. In the east, Kurdish forces (with U.S. military support) are seizing the oil and agricultural resources of the former state. Erdogan’s forces and proxies are engaged in an attempt to crush the Kurdish enclave completely (although the U.S. has now mediated a ceasefire of sorts). And in the south-west, Israeli tanks have seized the Golan and land beyond to within 20 kms of Damascus. In 2015 the Economist magazine wrote: 'Black gold under the Golan: Geologists in Israel think they have found oil – in very tricky territory'. Israeli and American oilmen believe they have discovered a bonanza in this most inconvenient of sites. And a big impediment – Syria – to the West’s energy ambitions has just dissipated. The strategic political balancer to Israel that was Syria since 1948, has vanished. And the earlier ‘easing of tensions’ between the Sunni sphere and Iran has been disrupted by the rude intervention of ISIS rebrands and by Ottoman revanchism working with Israel, via American (and British) intermediaries. The Turks have never really reconciled themselves to the 1923 Treaty that concluded World War I, by which they ceded what is now northern Syria to the new state of Syria. Within days, Syria has been dismembered, partitioned and balkanised. So why do Israel and Türkiye still bomb? The bombing started the moment Bashar Al-Assad departed – because Türkiye and Israel worry that today’s conquerors may prove ephemeral, and may soon themselves be displaced. You don’t need to own a thing in order to control it. As powerful states in the region, Israel and Turkey will wish to exercise control not just over resources, but over the vital regional crossroads and passageway that was Syria. Inevitably however, ‘Greater Israel’ is likely, at some point, to butt heads with Erdogan’s Ottomanesque revanchism. Equally the Saudi-Egyptian-UAE front will not welcome the resurgence of either ISIS re-brands, nor the Turkish-inspired and Ottomanised Muslim Brotherhood. The latter poses an immediate threat to Jordan, now bordering the new revolutionary entity. Such concerns may push these Gulf States closer to Iran. Qatar, as purveyor of arms and funding to the HTS cartel, may again be ostracised by other Gulf leaders. The new geo-political map poses many direct questions about Iran, Russia, China and the BRICS. Russia has played a complex hand in the Middle East – on the one hand, prosecuting an escalating defensive war versus NATO powers and managing key energy interests; while, at the same time, trying to moderate Resistance operations toward Israel in order to keep relations with the U.S. from deteriorating utterly. Moscow hopes – without great conviction – that a dialogue with the incoming U.S. President might emerge, at some point in the future. Moscow likely will draw the conclusion that ceasefire ‘deals’ such as the Astana Agreement on jihadist containment within the boundaries of the Idlib autonomous zone in Syria are not worth the paper on which they were written. Türkiye – an Astana guarantor – stabbed Moscow in the back. Likely, it will make the Russian leadership more hard-nosed over Ukraine, and of any western talk of ceasefires. Iran’s Supreme Leader spoke on 11 December: 'There should be no doubt that what happened in Syria was plotted in the command rooms of the United States and Israel. We have evidence for this. One of the neighbouring countries of Syria also played a role, but the primary planners are the U.S. and the Zionist regime'. In this context, Ayatollah Khamenei quashed speculations about any weakening of the will to resist. Türkiye’s proxy victory in Syria nonetheless may prove Pyrrhic. Erdogan’s Foreign Minister, Hakan Fidan, lied to Russia, the Gulf States and Iran about the nature of what was being cooked-up in Syria. But the mess now is Erdogan’s. Those that he doubled-crossed will at some point extract pay-back. Iran seemingly, will revert to its earlier stance of gathering together the disparate threads of regional resistance to fight the Al-Qa’eda reincarnation. It will not turn its back on China, nor the BRICS project. Iraq – recalling the ISIS atrocities of its civil war – will join with Iran, as will Yemen. Iran will be aware that the remaining nodes of the former Syrian Army might well, at some point, enter into the fight against the HTS cartel. Maher Al-Assad took his entire armoured division with him into exile in Iraq on the night of Bashar Al-Assad’s departure. China will not be pleased at events in Syria. The Uyghurs played a prominent part in the Syria uprising (there were an estimated 30,000 Uyghurs in Idlib, under training by Türkiye (which sees Uyghurs as the original component of the Turkic nation). China too, will likely see the overthrow of Syria as underlining putative western threats to their own energy security lines that run through Iran, Saudi Arabia and Iraq. Finally, western interests have been fighting over Middle Eastern resources for centuries – and ultimately that is what lies behind the war today. Is he, or isn’t he, pro-war, people ask about Trump, since he has already signalled that energy dominance will be a key strategy for his Administration. Well, western countries are deep in debt; their fiscal room for manoeuvre is shrinking fast, and bond-holders are beginning to mutiny. There is a race to find a new collateral for fiat currencies. It used to be gold; since the 1970s it was oil, but the petrodollar has faltered. The Anglo-Americans would love to have Iran’s oil again – as they did until the 1970s – to collateralise and build a new money system tied to the real value inherent in commodities. But Trump says he wants to ‘end wars’ and not start them. Does the re-drawing of the geo-political map make some global entente between east and west more, or less, likely? For all the talk of possible Trump ‘deals’ with Iran and Russia, it is likely too early to say whether they will – or can – materialise. Seemingly, Trump has to secure the domestic ‘deal’ first, before he will know whether he has the scope for foreign policy deals. It seems that the Ruling Structures (notably the ‘Never-Trump’ element in the Senate) will allow Trump considerable latitude on key nominations for domesticDepartments and Agencies that manage U.S. political and economic affairs (which is Trump’s key concern) – and will also permit a certain discretion on, shall we say, the ‘warfare’ Departments that targeted Trump over the last years, such as the FBI and the Department of Justice. The putative ‘deal’ seems to be that his nominations will still need to undergo Senate confirmation and must broadly be ‘on-side’ with Inter-Agency foreign policy (notably on Israel). The Inter-Agency grandees, however, reportedly insist on their veto over nominations affecting the deepest structures of foreign policy. And therein lies the crux of matters. Israelis generally are celebrating their ‘victories’. Will this euphoria weigh with U.S. business élites? Hizbullah is contained, Syria is demilitarised, and Iran is not on Israel’s border. The threat to Israel today is of a qualitatively lower order. Is this, in itself, sufficient to allow tensions to ease, or to see some wider understandings to emerge? Much will hang on Netanyahu’s own political circumstances. Should the PM emerge from his criminal Court process relatively unscathed, would he need to take the big ‘bet’ of military action against Iran, with the geo-political map so suddenly transformed?	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWdGQ6ALRIc3FRCIcmNn89c7	2024-12-16T16:19:03-08:00	
Ramifications Of 7/10 Attacks May Be Worse Than 9/11 – Analysis	By Adil Rasheed While some experts claim that the October 7 attacks were worse for Israel than 9/11 was for the US,1 few aver that the Hamas strikes could have more devastating long-term impact for global peace and security than 9/11. There is no denying that 9/11 attacks severely impacted global geopolitics, but the 7/10 Hamas strikes might have serious long-term implications for the world’s security architecture, the Western rules-based order and may engender a Cold War redux leading to a wider conflagration. Tilt in the Geostrategic Keel Undoubtedly, the horrific terrorist attacks of 11 September 2001 shocked millions of people around the world, who viewed the devastation unfold on their television screens in real time. In response, the US achieved initial victories in its global war on terror (GWOT), which marked the acme of its global hegemonic might and influence. However, its protracted wars in Afghanistan and Iraq led to greater instability across West Asia with the onset of Arab Spring in 2011 and the rise of ISIS in 2013. Taking advantage of the US entanglement in West Asia, China and Russia started to rebuild their economic and military might after the virtual collapse of communism and gradually re-emerged as challengers to the Western liberal order, particularly after the 2008 economic meltdown. As the US reluctantly began to withdraw its forces from wars across the ‘larger Middle East’, it ended up ceding power to violent Islamists—Iran-backed Shia parties and militias in Iraq and a resurgent Taliban in Afghanistan. Thus, the chain of events in the decades following 9/11 showed the gradual erosion of US status and influence as the sole superpower of the world, both in economic and political terms, which is now evident in its ambivalent response to the 7 October attacks.2 Cold War Redux: The Shift from Non-State Actors to State Proxies In fact, the 7/10 attacks have shaken global geopolitics in more fundamental ways than 9/11. Terrorist forces seem to have shed off their tag of being violent and irrational non-state actors and have risen to the level of proto-state regimes that insidiously work as proxies for emerging powers out to build an anti-West axis. Unlike the divisive Salafi jihadists, pan-Islamist Shia Iran has started forging alliances not only with Sunni states (the anti-Shia Wahhabis in Saudi Arabia and Qatar) and so-called resistance groups (the Hanafi Hamas and the Zaidi Houthis),3 but also with non-Muslim powers, Russia and China. This has allowed the ‘West vs. Islam’ extremist narrative of the post-9/11 world into becoming a ‘West versus the Rest’ rhetoric, which has the potential of upending the entire global security applecart. Under the banner of a united ‘Global South’, Russia and China are steadily constructing an anti-West geopolitical bloc, thus setting up former colonised states in Asia and Africa against their erstwhile imperialist masters. By keeping the West mired in West Asia and Africa, the emerging challengers are also staving off global attention from their own wars and conflicts in Ukraine and the South China Sea. The Thucydides Trap and West Asia Thus, West Asia has turned into an arena for emerging powers to displace the existing superpower as the regional or international hegemon. In fact, China chose the region for the formal launch of its Global Security Initiative (GSI) last year,4 and has since sought to create a wedge in the US-brokered Abraham Accords of 2020. First, it became the mediator for restoring diplomatic relations between its long-time ally Iran and the new BRICS aspirant, Saudi Arabia. Then, Russia reportedly played its part in bringing the much-reviled Bashar Al-Assad regime back into the fold of the Arab League.5 Finally, China brokered this year a unity deal between all Palestinian factions, including Hamas and Fatah in Beijing, in which the factions agreed to form ‘an interim national unity government’.6 Thus unlike 9/11, which was conducted by largely independent non-state actors like Al-Qaeda, Iran and its proxies (held responsible for the 7/10 attacks) have received both overt and covert support from left-wing groups in the West and new global powers. These strategic alignments might engender more flashpoints for conflict in the rapidly changing Cold War-like global scenario, as exemplified in the recent toppling of Bashar Al-Assad’s regime in Syria.7 Chinks in the Western Armour Add to this the tactics of lawfare, which has divided the Western bloc and riddled it with several internal contradictions. When the US had launched its Global War on Terrorism in 2001 by toppling the then Taliban regime (that had provided a safe haven to Al-Qaeda), much of the world stood united in its condemnation of the terror attacks and a large majority formally supported US-led invasions of both Afghanistan and Iraq. But this time, international organisations have appeared to ignore the terrorist atrocities of 7 October attacks, and seem more focused on Israel’s response in Gaza and Lebanon. In fact, the International Criminal Court has issued arrest warrants against Israeli prime minister and former defence minister and surprisingly, many European countries like Belgium, The Netherlands, Ireland, Lithuania, Slovenia and Spain appear ready to comply with this ruling, while France, Germany and Italy have not rejected it outright. As chinks in the Western bloc continue to widen, the emphasis has shifted from a West-centred ‘rules-based order’ to a supposedly ‘international law-based order’,8which is merely a ruse as few states comply when the ruling goes against them or their allies. Lawfare: Rules-Based Versus Law-Based Order Thus, in February 2024, China told the International Court of Justice, that the Palestinians’ use of armed struggle to gain independence from foreign and colonial rule was 'legitimate' and 'well founded' in international law, thus implicitly legitimising Hamas’ terrorism. In his address to the International Court of Justice in The Hague, Chinese representative Ma Xinmin stated: In pursuit of the right to self-determination, Palestinian people’s use of force to resist foreign oppression and complete the establishment of an independent state is (an) inalienable right well founded in international law.9 Citing resolutions by the UN General Assembly, Beijing’s envoy even asserted that people struggling for self-determination could use 'all available means, including armed struggle'.10 Perhaps, the Chinese diplomat failed to recall at that time the plight of the tortured people in Xinjiang (the mainly Muslim Uyghurs) or the harassed Buddhist Tibetans in his own country, who are also struggling against state oppression. China also apparently used South Africa to file a case of genocide against Israel in the International Criminal Court, banking on that country’s credentials as a former victim of apartheid, as opposed to any Muslim state with a dubious human rights record. It is indeed strange, however, that ANC-led South Africa has denied visit visa to the Dalai Lama thrice in recent years, once stopping him from attending a summit of Nobel laureates in 2014.11 Curiously, the ruling ANC government in South Africa not only has healthy economic ties with China, but even sends its politicians to Beijing for learning non-democratic one party rule.12 This raises questions about South Africa’s own avowed commitment to combat genocide and ethnic cleansing as well as towards its liberal political values. The Narrowing Technological Asymmetry When the US launched its campaign against Afghanistan and Iraq in the aftermath of the 9/11 attacks, the technological asymmetry between the opposing sides was enormous. However, conflicts following 7/10 attacks show a growing parity even on this front, with Houthi militias shooting down advanced US Reaper drones, and Iran launching Russia-developed hypersonic missiles to penetrate Israel’s air defence systems. In the uncertain times ahead, India would have to keep a close watch on the unravelling geopolitical order, particularly the dangerous quartet of growing Chinese cooperation with a theocratic Iran (whose top leadership frequently spews out statements against Kashmir),13 jihadist Taliban in Afghanistan and an increasingly radicalised and restive Pakistan. On India’s eastern front, events unfolding in Bangladesh and lingering extremism in some Southeast Asian states constitute a cause for concern. In these circumstances, the support from India’s minority communities and the empowerment of liberal parties and governments in the neighbourhood could help secure our national goals and larger geopolitical interests.

The Middle Class In The Philippines: Growing But Vulnerable – Ana...	By Jose Ramon G. Albert The middle class plays a crucial role in driving economic growth and development in many countries. In the Philippines, the expansion of the middle class is seen as an important indicator of economic progress, improved living standards, and social stability. As the primary driver of consumer spending and a key source of human capital, understanding and supporting this segment of society is essential for sustainable economic development. Recent data from the 2021 Family Income and Expenditure Survey (FIES), conducted by the Philippine Statistics Authority (PSA), provides valuable insights into the composition, growth, and challenges facing the Filipino middle class. There is no single agreed-upon definition of the middle class. Sociologists often define it in terms of education, occupation, and social values, while economists tend to use income-based measures.[1] In the Philippines, market researchers also cluster households into five socioeconomic classifications based on the quality of consumers (i.e., employment and educational characteristics of family members), as well as household assets, amenities, and facilities.[2] Much of the economic literature, on the other hand, uses monetary measures (e.g., income or consumption) to define the middle class.[3] An approach in the Philippines that is gaining popularity is to define the middle class as those households with per capita incomes between 2 and 12 times the official poverty rate.[4] Using this definition, about 40% of the Philippine population belonged to the middle-income class in 2023. Figure 1 shows that for a family of five in 2021, the monthly family income thresholds for the middle class translate to a monthly income range of approximately PHP 25,000 to PHP 145,000. This definition groups households with incomes substantially above subsistence levels but below those of the upper echelons of society. By this definition, as much as 4 in 10 Filipinos (39.8%) and nearly half (47.4%) of families can be considered middle-income class Figure 1. Who are the Filipino Middle Class? Source: The middle class can be further broken down into three sub-groups: Lower-middle income: those with per capita incomes between 2-4 times the poverty line Middle-middle income: those with per capita incomes between 4-7 times the poverty line Upper-middle income: those with per capita incomes between 7-12 times the poverty line This income-based definition allows for tracking the size and characteristics of the middle class over time using household survey data. However, it is worth noting that income alone does not fully capture all aspects of middle-class status and values.[5] A RISING TIDE: CHARTING MIDDLE CLASS GROWTH The growth trajectory of the Filipino middle class has been remarkable over the past three decades, expanding from 28.5% of the population in 1991 to 39.8% in 2021 (Figure 1). The share of the middle class peaked at 43.5% in 2018 before declining to 39.8% in 2021, likely due to the economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. This recent setback underscores the vulnerability of the middle class to economic shocks. It also highlights the need for robust social protection systems and other strategies.[6] The growth of the Philippine middle class has been relatively slow compared to that in some other countries, especially in the region (i.e., if we adopt cross-country comparable data and thresholds). From 1990 to 2008, the middle class in Vietnam grew by 33 percentage points and in Indonesia by 12 points. The slower expansion of the middle class in the Philippines may be attributed to several factors: Periods of economic and political instability in the 1980s and early 1990s;[7] High levels of inequality that persisted despite economic growth and which led to slower poverty reduction; and Lack of structural transformation in the economy, with limited growth in the high-productivity sectors.[8] The PSA reported that poverty went down from 2021 to 2023,[9] so it is expected that the share of the middle class rose in this period. However actual figures will only be available once the PSA releases the microdata of the 2023 FIES. CHARACTERISTICS OF THE MIDDLE CLASS Several studies have identified several key characteristics that distinguish middle-income households in the Philippines: Urban concentration: As of 2021, three-fifths (60.6%) of urban residents belonged to the middle class, compared to only a third (33.8%) among rural communities. Urban centres often offer more diverse employment opportunities and higher wages, contributing to the expansion of the middle class. However, quality jobs are dependent on high educational attainment and skills. Education: Middle-class Filipinos tend to have higher levels of education compared to low-income groups (Figure 2). In 2021, 40.6% of middle-class Filipinos aged 15 and above had completed a college education, compared to only 14.5% of their low-income counterparts. Figure 2. How Educated are Low-, Middle- and Upper- Income Classes of Filipinos aged 15 and over. Note: Author’s computations from the 2021 FIES, PSA Employment: Middle-class workers are more likely to have stable formal-sector jobs. About 80% of employed middle-income individuals have permanent jobs, compared to 65% among low-income workers. They are also less likely to work in agriculture and are more concentrated in services and manufacturing. Family size: Middle-income households tend to have smaller family sizes, with an average of 4.2 members compared to 5.3 for low-income families. They also have lower dependency ratios. Asset ownership: Middle-class households have higher rates of ownership for consumer durables like refrigerators, televisions, and cars. They are also more likely to own their homes. Access to services: The middle class has better access to electricity, safe water, and sanitation compared to low-income groups. These characteristics reflect the causes and consequences of achieving middle-income status. Higher education and stable employment help households attain middle-class incomes, while smaller family sizes and asset accumulation are often the results of improved economic status. Importantly, many of these middle-class characteristics — especially higher education levels and formal sector employment — are associated with greater economic resilience and upward mobility. ECONOMIC ROLE OF THE MIDDLE CLASS The middle class is often seen as an engine of economic growth and development. Economic theory and empirical research have identified several ways that a robust middle class can drive prosperity: Consumer demand: With higher disposable incomes, the middle class provides a key source of consumer demand for goods and services, helping to drive economic growth.[10] In the Philippines, middle-income households spend more on education, healthcare, and durable goods than low-income families. Human capital investment: Middle-class families tend to invest more in education and skills development for their children, building human capital that fuels long-term economic growth. The high value placed on education is evident in the Philippines, where middle-income families spend much more on education than low-income households. Entrepreneurship: In many countries, the middle class has been an important source of entrepreneurship and small business formation. However, in the Philippines, this effect appears more limited – lower-income groups actually have higher rates of self-employment and entrepreneurship, often out of necessity rather than opportunity. Tax base: A larger middle class provides a broader tax base to fund public goods and services. In the Philippines, the expansion of the middle class has coincided with growth in tax revenues. Demand for institutional quality: Middle-class citizens often push for better governance, institutions, and public services. However, this effect may be limited in the Philippines, where the middle class has shown a tendency to opt for private services rather than pressuring for improved public options.[11] While the Philippine middle class plays some of these positive economic roles, its impact appears more muted compared with other countries. This may be due to the country’s limited size and economic vulnerability. Political Influence of the Middle Class The Philippine middle class has become increasingly influential in shaping political outcomes, but not always in ways that benefit broader development goals: Middle-class voters appear to have strongly supported populist candidates and policies in recent elections (this is in line with observations in other countries).[12] Government policies like free tuition at state universities and recent tax reforms have disproportionately benefited middle-income groups rather than the poor. There are indications that public spending is becoming more aligned with middle-class priorities (e.g., crime reduction) at the expense of pro-poor programmes.[13] These trends suggest that the growing middle class is flexing its political muscle – but not necessarily in ways that promote inclusive development or strengthen democratic institutions. Some analysts argue this reflects the economic insecurity of the Philippine middle class, making them susceptible to populist appeals. Others point to a growing disconnect between middle-class Filipinos and the poor, with the former prioritising their narrower interests. VULNERABILITIES OF THE MIDDLE CLASS Despite its growth, the Philippine middle class remains economically vulnerable in several ways: Economic shocks: Many middle-income households, especially those in the lower-middle segment, remain at risk of falling into poverty due to job loss, health emergencies, or other shocks. The COVID-19 pandemic highlighted this vulnerability. Reliance on remittances: About 13% of middle-income households have a member working overseas, and many rely heavily on remittances. This leaves them exposed to external economic conditions and changes in migration policies. Job insecurity: While middle-class workers are more likely to have formal-sector jobs, many still face concerns about job security and limited opportunities for advancement. Education quality concerns: Although middle-class families invest heavily in education, there are growing concerns about the quality and relevance of education in preparing young people for a vastly changing job market, especially given increased automation. These vulnerabilities help explain why many in the middle class feel economically insecure; this vulnerability appears to be shaping their political behaviour and policy preferences. CONCENTRATIONS OF THE MIDDLE CLASS Regional disparities in middle-class concentration are evident, with areas like the National Capital Region (NCR), Region IV-A (CALABARZON), and Central Luzon having a larger middle-class presence than in others (Figure 3). The recent decline in middle-class share from 2018 to 2021 demonstrates the vulnerability of this group to economic disruptions, with many families, particularly those in the lower-middle segment, at risk of falling into poverty during crises. Figure 3. Distribution of Filipinos by Regions and by Income classes: 2021 Addressing regional disparities through targeted investments in infrastructure, education, and economic opportunities can foster middle-class growth in lagging regions. Expanding access to financial services tailored to middle-class needs can help families build and protect their assets. Improving the quality and accessibility of healthcare services can prevent middle-class families from falling into poverty due to catastrophic health expenses. CONCLUSION: THE MIDDLE CLASS AND NATIONAL PROGRESS The Philippines aspires to become a predominantly middle-class society by 2040[14] Thus, nurturing and expanding this vital segment of the population is key to achieving sustainable and equitable development. The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted both the resilience and the vulnerabilities of the Philippine middle class. Several key challenges and opportunities will shape the future of the middle class in the Philippines: Digital transformation: The rapid pace of technological change and digitalisation presents both opportunities and risks for the middle class. While digital technologies can create new economic opportunities and improve access to services, there is also a risk of job displacement and a growing digital divide. Climate change: The Philippines is highly vulnerable to the impacts of c.limate change,[15] including rising sea levels, more frequent and intense natural disasters, and changing weather patterns. These impacts can disproportionately affect the middle class through damage to property, disruption of livelihoods, and increased costs for adaptation and resilience. Investing in climate-resilient infrastructure, promoting sustainable urban development, and supporting the transition to a low-carbon economy will be essential for protecting middle-class assets and livelihoods. Demographic shifts: The Philippines is experiencing demographic changes, including an ageing population and continued urbanisation. These shifts have implications for healthcare, social services, and urban infrastructure needs. Policies that support healthy aging, lifelong learning, and sustainable urban development will be crucial for maintaining and expanding the middle class as the population ages and becomes increasingly urban. Global economic integration: As a middle-income country with a large overseas workforce, the Philippines is deeply integrated into the global economy. While this integration brings opportunities for trade, investment, and remittances, it also exposes the country to external economic shocks. Strengthening domestic industries, diversifying the economy, and enhancing the skills and competitiveness of the workforce will be important. Inequality and social mobility: Despite the growth of the middle class, inequality remains a significant challenge in the Philippines. Addressing barriers to social mobility, such as unequal access to quality education and healthcare, will be crucial. To address these challenges and harness opportunities for middle-class expansion, policymakers should consider the following priorities: Invest in human capital development: Strengthen the education system at all levels, with a focus on improving quality and relevance to labor market needs. This includes investing in early childhood education, enhancing STEM education, promoting vocational and technical training, and supporting lifelong learning initiatives. Promote inclusive innovation and entrepreneurship: Support the development of a vibrant startup ecosystem and encourage innovation across all sectors of the economy. This can include measures such as improving access to finance for MSMEs, streamlining business regulations, and providing targeted support for high-potential industries. Enhance social protection systems: Develop more comprehensive and adaptive social protection programmes that can support the middle class during economic shocks and transitions. This may include unemployment insurance, portable benefits for gig workers, and expanded healthcare coverage. Improve urban planning and infrastructure: Invest in sustainable urban development and infrastructure that can support a growing middle class, including affordable housing, efficient public transportation, and green spaces. Promote environmental sustainability: Integrate climate change adaptation and mitigation measures into all aspects of economic planning and development to build a more resilient middle class and protect natural resources for future generations. Foster digital inclusion: Expand access to digital infrastructure, devices, and skills training to ensure that all segments of society can participate in and benefit from the digital economy. Strengthen governance and institutions: Improve the efficiency, transparency, and accountability of government institutions in order to build public trust and create a more enabling environment for middle-class growth. By implementing these policies, the Philippines can work towards realising its vision of becoming a predominantly middle-class society by 2040. By fostering a more inclusive, resilient, and dynamic middle class, the Philippines can build a stronger foundation for long-term prosperity and social progress.

Kim Jong Un’s Military First Policy: Militarism As A Symbol Of He...	North Korea’s Military First Policy, or Songun, stands as a fundamental pillar of its governance, intricately interwoven into the nation’s ideological and political fabric. Under Kim Jong Un's leadership, this policy has solidified, merging militaristic ideologies with a strategic emphasis on showcasing nuclear capabilities. Analyzing Kim Jong Un's leadership reveals a clear embodiment of hegemonic masculinity, characterized by a focus on militarism, nuclear capabilities, and an overarching sense of invulnerability. The Foundations of Military First Policy and Hegemonic Masculinity The Military First Policy emerged following the passing of Kim Il Sung in 1994, marked a pivotal moment in the leadership transition to his son, Kim Jong Il. In the wake of international isolation and the disintegration of the Soviet Union, North Korea emerged in a precarious state, grappling with significant vulnerabilities. The policy strategically positions the military at the forefront of state power, elevating it above all other institutions. This framing casts the military not only as the vanguard of the revolution but also as the essential protector of national sovereignty. This strategic pivot underscored the critical importance of military power, not merely as a means of survival, but as a vital assertion of North Korea’s sovereignty in the face of external challenges, especially from the United States and South Korea. Kim Jong Un has prioritized the military-first doctrine by intertwining it with a robust projection of hegemonic masculinity, marking a significant evolution in his leadership strategy. Hegemonic masculinity encapsulates the prevailing social constructs that link male power to characteristics like authority, strength, aggressiveness, and the capacity to exert dominance. Kim Jong Un’s leadership exemplifies a commitment to national defense, positioning himself as the quintessential guardian of the state, while embodying the archetypes of strength and determination. His public appearances—frequently at military parades, missile tests, and weapon exhibitions—strategically underscores his grip on the nation and reinforce his claim to military supremacy. By taking this approach, he establishes himself as a formidable male leader, reinforcing his authority at home while simultaneously crafting a narrative of defiance on the global stage. Militarism and the Nuclearization: A Manifestation of Hegemonic Masculinity Under Kim Jong Un's leadership, the military based on militarism has assumed a progressively pivotal position within North Korean society. The rise of the military serves as both a calculated political manoeuvre and a significant cultural framework. The Songun policy permeates daily life in North Korea, where the military is exalted as the pinnacle of loyalty and patriotism. Within this framework, military service emerges as the pinnacle of masculine obligation, solidifying a gendered hierarchy that positions men as the focal point of national defense and state preservation. The militarization of North Korean society also reinforces the focus on men as the core of North Korea’s strength, where masculinity is equated with power and military service is the highest form of national service. This gendered framing constructs a society where masculine ideals are intertwined with military prowess, placing men in dominant positions while relegating women to secondary roles. Kim Jong Un has adeptly positioned North Korea’s nuclear program as a formidable symbol of national sovereignty and a testament to his own authority. Under his leadership, North Korea has strategically advanced its nuclear capabilities, encompassing tactical nuclear weapons and intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs). The weapons in question transcend their role as instruments of national defense; they represent a clear embodiment of Kim Jong Un’s assertion of hegemonic masculinity. Nuclear weapons in North Korea represent a calculated assertion of power, showcasing resilience and a bold defiance in the face of perceived external threats. The successful tests of North Korea’s nuclear devices under Kim Jong Un, including the miniaturized nuclear device tested in 2013 and the hydrogen bomb test of 2016, underscore the regime’s strategic focus on reinforcing its power through militarization and nuclearization. Nuclear weapons transcend their role as not merely instruments of war; rather functioned as pivotal tools for projecting power and asserting dominance within the global arena. Kim Jong Un has consistently articulated his view that nuclear weapons are crucial to the regime's survival and its broader deterrence strategy. This reflects the principles of hegemonic masculinity, illustrating that dominance and strength are manifested not only through military might but also through the control of weapons of mass destruction. The regime's blatant disregard for international sanctions, exemplified by its nuclear tests and missile launches, underscores a steadfast refusal to retreat from its confrontational stance, thereby bolstering the narrative of invulnerability and dominance. Moreover, the narrative surrounding North Korea’s nuclearization under Kim Jong Un frequently emphasizes themes of self-defense and national sovereignty. Kim Jong Un has unequivocally asserted that North Korea's nuclear status is non-negotiable, firmly indicating that any prospects for denuclearization are categorically dismissed. This position not only bolsters the masculine imagery of strength and dominance but also acts as a strategy for consolidating power within the regime. In asserting his role as the leader of a nuclear-armed state, Kim Jong Un strategically solidifies his image as the paramount guardian of the nation, enhancing his influence on both domestic and international fronts. Nuclear Law In 2022, the North Korean Supreme People’s Assembly enacted a new nuclear law, which solidified the country’s status as a nuclear weapons state. This law outlines the conditions under which North Korea would use nuclear weapons, emphasizing the principle of self-defense and the readiness to retaliate against any perceived external aggression. The law’s provisions underscore North Korea’s commitment to its nuclear arsenal, reaffirming the idea that the military and nuclear weapons are integral to the state’s survival and Kim Jong Un’s personal power. This legal framework also reinforces the hegemonic masculinity at the heart of Kim Jong Un’s rule. The law centralizes nuclear control under the President of the State Affairs, effectively consolidating Kim’s authority over the country’s most powerful weapons. By placing nuclear weapons under his direct command, Kim Jong Un positions himself as the ultimate authority, capable of making life-and-death decisions for the nation. The law’s emphasis on nuclear readiness and self-defense reflects a belief in masculine strength as the defining characteristic of national power. In this sense, nuclear weapons are not only tools of defense but also symbols of the regime’s unyielding power and Kim Jong Un’s personal dominance. Nuclear Diplomacy and Kim Jong Un’s Masculine Leadership Kim Jong Un’s interactions with international leaders further exemplify his reliance on hegemonic masculinity. His engagements with world leaders, particularly with the United States, South Korea, and China, are often framed through the lens of power dynamics. Kim Jong Un has used his country’s nuclear capabilities as leverage in negotiations, emphasizing that North Korea’s strength lies in its nuclear arsenal. This strategic use of military power is a direct reflection of hegemonic masculinity, where strength, defiance, and control are central to the leadership narrative. For instance, Kim Jong Un’s Summit with U.S. President Donald Trump in 2018 was a pivotal moment in international diplomacy, marked by the symbolism of nuclear weapons and military strength. The summit, while largely seen as a diplomatic gesture, was also a way for Kim Jong Un to project his image as a powerful leader, willing to negotiate from a position of strength. Even as diplomatic talks faltered in subsequent years, the possession of nuclear weapons allowed Kim Jong Un to maintain his standing as a leader who could not be easily coerced or intimidated by external powers. In this context, nuclear weapons are more than just instruments of defense; they are tools for asserting masculinity on the global stage. By leveraging his country’s nuclear capabilities, Kim Jong Un projects an image of a leader who is unyielding and unafraid to confront powerful nations, further solidifying his image as a masculine, authoritarian figure. Gun vs Butter The prioritization of military strength and nuclear capabilities over human development has led to widespread economic deprivation. The resources allocated to the military and the nuclear program often come at the expense of social welfare, health, and education. The economic strain caused by this militaristic focus disproportionately affects the civilian population, particularly women and children, who are often the most vulnerable to economic hardship. As North Korea continues to prioritize military power, the potential for a more inclusive, human-centered approach to governance remains limited. The policy of Songun and its emphasis on nuclear strength highlight the limitations of a governance model rooted in hegemonic masculinity, where the needs of marginalized groups, particularly women and civilians, are consistently overlooked. Conclusion Kim Jong Un’s leadership in North Korea is deeply intertwined with the concept of hegemonic masculinity, which plays a critical role in shaping both domestic policies and international relations. Through the Songun policy, the emphasis on militarism, and the development of nuclear weapons, Kim Jong Un has positioned himself as a powerful, masculine leader, willing to assert dominance over both his people and the international community. However, this approach, rooted in militarism and nuclearization, has significant gendered and social consequences, reinforcing patriarchal structures and exacerbating economic hardship for many North Koreans. While Kim Jong Un’s nuclear strategy has reinforced his regime’s survival and enhanced North Korea’s international stature, it has also perpetuated systemic inequalities, deepened the country’s isolation and limited opportunities for broader social and economic development. The intersection of militarism and hegemonic masculinity in North Korea’s governance highlights the limitations and contradictions inherent in a leadership style that prioritizes power, aggression, and control over the well-being of the people.

An ICC Arrest Warrant For Myanmar Junta Chief Is Too Little, Too ...	By David Hutt There’s occasionally something to be said for symbolic gestures, but I struggle to get too worked up over the news that an International Criminal Court (ICC) prosecutor has finally applied for an arrest warrant for Min Aung Hlaing, Myanmar’s junta chief. The Nov. 27 request is specifically over his military’s ethnic cleansing of the Muslim-minority group, the Rohingya, between 2017 and 2018. Human Rights Watch called it a 'major step towards justice for the country’s Rohingya population.' Amnesty International regarded it as a 'decisive step and an important signal.' My disappointment is for two reasons: the local and the global. The ICC hasn’t yet issued an arrest warrant; a prosecutor has applied for one. But even if a warrant is forthcoming, it won’t be acted upon. Min Aung Hlaing won’t be hauled to The Hague while his junta holds power over much of the country and has the backing of Beijing. If his junta defeats the revolutionary forces and ends the civil war, Min Aung Hlaing won’t voluntarily make a sojourn to the Netherlands. If his junta falls and is replaced by a new, federal democratic Myanmar, we should vehemently oppose an international tribunal in favor of a local trial. In that eventuality, Min Aung Hlaing would have much more barbarism to answer to than only the Rohingya genocide. China won’t act Nor will an arrest warrant, if produced, alter the civil war itself. Min Aung Hlaing won’t give a fig; he claims lineage from the generals who for decades happily impoverished the nation and regarded citizens as property of the state. Nor does Min Aung Hlaing have a real desire or need to leave Myanmar for anywhere other than China, which offered him his first invitation since the coup last month. Yet China isn’t a member of the ICC, so won’t act upon an arrest warrant. From Southeast Asia, only Cambodia and Timor-Leste are signatories to the Rome Statute, so Min Aung Hlaing could visit any of the other nine states and probably wouldn’t be touched. One might retort that the importance of the request for an arrest warrant lies in the 'optics.' Certainly it’s a bad look for Southeast Asia. Yet, what optics is this request supposed to change regarding Myanmar? Granted, if the truth isn’t repeatedly stated, it risks being drowned by lies. Yet the military’s crimes against the Rohingya have already been abundantly documented. The UN has called it 'textbook ethnic cleansing.' The United States government called it a 'genocide' in 2022. If anyone needs convincing almost a decade on from the genocide and three years on from the military coup that Min Aung Hlaing isn’t a nice chap they’ve intentionally overlooked the evidence already to hand. It isn’t as though most foreign governments have been sitting on the fence since 2021 waiting for something like an ICC arrest warrant before making up their mind whether they’re pro- or anti-junta. The ICC prosecutor’s decision won’t isolate Min Aung Hlaing and his junta amongst friendly countries, nor motivate any more solidarity for the anti-junta revolutionaries from unfriendly states. Waning global interest Did China – not a signatory of the Rome Statute – even muster a shrug when this news of the warrant request broke? Is the United States – also not a signatory – now going to start supplying the anti-junta militias with proper weaponry because an international court might charge Min Aung Hlaing? The ICC prosecutor failed to request an arrest warrant for Aung San Suu Kyi, who, though now deposed and detained, was head of the civilian government while the military was butchering the Rohingyas — a crime that Suu Kyi herself travelled to The Hague in 2017 to defend. The global aspect of the problem is equally discouraging. In June, Rohingya community members expressed disappointment at an ICC Pre-Trial Chamber that 'enthusiasm for the ICC’s investigation appears to be at an all-time low.' Prosecutors should have started requesting arrest warrants in 2017, but the ICC only started investigations in 2019. It was too late by the time of the February 2021 coup. Bad timing But now the ICC prosecutor’s request for a warrant couldn’t have come at a worse moment. Just weeks earlier, the international court also issued arrest warrants for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and several members of his cabinet. The ICC is now a spent force – a pariah not only in Moscow and other despotic nations but also in some Western capitals. The United States has already rejected the court’s warrant for Netanyahu, and some Republicans want to sanction any country that assists the ICC in its pursuit of him. The French government says it won’t comply with the Netanyahu warrant either because Israel isn’t a member of the ICC. But neither is Myanmar a party to the Rome Statute, so hasn’t Paris just given Min Aung Hlaing a kind of Western-backed immunity? For years the ICC has tried to rid itself of the criticism that it only goes after rulers of poor, internationally-weak nations while ignoring the crimes of first world leaders. Unfortunately, by seeking to prosecute the leaders of Israel and Myanmar in the space of a few weeks, the court may have succeeded in removing that stigma – but at the cost of its credibility and authority.

The Three Aspects Of Understanding The Current World – OpEd	By White Mountain After the fragmentation of global space, there is the emergence of 'regional hegemonic states'. I have previously discussed this topic extensively, noting that countries such as Iran, Turkey, Israel, India, Russia, South Africa, and others being defined as regional hegemonic states. When we first defined 'regional hegemonic states', the world was still embroiled in debates over whether globalization would really lead to de-globalization. Interestingly, regarding Russia, can one consider it a global power today? It would be hard to find many who would deny that now. However, in the past, there were countless mistakes and misjudgments on this matter, especially among Europeans. Of course, Vladimir Putin himself does not wish for Russia to be a regional hegemon; he has always aspired for Russia to be a global power. However, objectively speaking, Russia has become a regional hegemon, and I believe that in the future, this situation could become a geopolitical bargaining chip for the United States. I would like to point out that, in reality, de-globalization is not merely a matter of conceptual definition. It is no longer the case that only regional hegemonic states are emerging. Countries worldwide will increasingly have to engage with numerous 'regional armed organizations', even if they must do so reluctantly. This will be an unavoidable reality, as seen with entities such as Syria's Hayat Tahrir al-Sham. In fact, the greater the number of such groups, the more profound their influence. This brings the theory of de-globalization into three aspects. At the top level are polarized states, such as the United States. The next tier consists of the 'regional hegemonic states' mentioned earlier, such as Turkey, India, Israel, and others. The third level encompasses 'regional armed organizations', which, despite lacking defined borders, governance, or state structures, they possess real existence, organizational systems, and regional influence. Viewed through these three aspects, the world has become more chaotic. Conventional geopolitical scholarship is effectively in disarray, devolving into idle speculation. Universities across the world must now reassess and reorganize their academic content, publishing a new generation of works. I leave this task to the professors, confident that they will perform admirably. Otherwise, a new wave of young professors will rise to replace them. Social science, after all, is a 'science of the battlefield'.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWemupebX1drw-WORjVcR0c0	2024-12-15T16:27:33-08:00	
Approaching National Bankruptcy And The Wisdom Of The Anti-Federa...	The 2024 election is in the rearview mirror. Republicans, for the most part, rejoice at the change of leadership. Democrats, on the other hand, mourn as their functionaries pack bags and leave Washington, D.C. The former celebrate as if they have destroyed the ring of Sauron and returned peace to Middle Earth. The latter fear a big orange Orc plundering Gondor and the end of civilization. Republicans and Democrats should pause from their celebration/lamentation to recognize a fundamental truth: Without structural changes to the Constitution of 1787, no change of personnel in the federal government can pull the American ox cart out of the ditch. Where should we for look for solutions? The Anti-Federalist opponents of the Constitution—written off by modern historians—predicted how sundry constitutional provisions would be abused. The Anti-Federalists were not mere complainers but suggested many amendments and alterations to address the problems they observed. Unfortunately, the First Congress ignored their suggestions when crafting the batch of amendments we call the Bill of Rights. Americans serious about governmental reform should dust off the Anti-Federalist writings and study the thought of these forgotten Americans. The U.S. national debt is $36 trillion. That’s almost $107,000 per citizen. In 2023, the federal government took in $4.4 trillion and spent $6.1 trillion. Such a trend is not sustainable. Interest payments on the national debt will soon be the largest federal expenditure—more than defense, Social Security or Medicare. Anti-Federalists expressed concern about Congress’ power to borrow. A writer using the penname 'Brutus' observed that 'Congress may mortgage any or all revenues of the union, as a fund to loan money upon, and it is probable in this way, they may borrow of foreign nations, a principal sum, the interest of which will be equal to the annual revenues of the country.' Brutus envisioned a substantial national debt unlikely ever to be retired. Hence, he believed it was 'unwise and improvident to vest in the general government, a power to borrow at discretion, without any limitation or restriction.' He suggested that the Constitution require a two-thirds congressional majority to permit borrowing. Although Brutus made this suggestion 237 years ago, it is still not too late to listen to him. Such a constitutional amendment would give fiscally responsible senators and representatives a club to beat back our profligate spending. With our fiscal house in disarray, one might expect that representatives and senators are facing an angry public at the polls. Not so. In 2024, 98.5% of House incumbents won reelection and 90.9% of Senate incumbents prevailed. Incumbency is a tremendous advantage for a candidate. Rotation in office was critical to our first federal constitution’s (the Articles of Confederation) efforts to limit congressional power. According to historian Gordon Wood, motivating factors for term limits under the Articles were fears of establishing an American ruling aristocracy and the belief that public service should be open to men equally talented (or perhaps more so) as the old guard. The Constitution of 1787 is silent on term limits, and this raised the ire of Anti-Federalists. 'ROTATION, that noble prerogative of liberty, is entirely excluded from the new system of government, and great men may and probably will be continued in office during their lives,' predicted 'An Officer of the Late Continental Army.' Similarly, Mercy Otis Warren, writing as a 'Columbian Patriot,' abjured, 'There is no provision for a rotation, nor any thing to prevent the perpetuity of office in the same hands for life; which by a little well-timed bribery, will probably be done, to the exclusion of men of the best abilities from their share in the offices of the government.' Term limits might not be a panacea for the political ailments of the country, but the states should be allowed to impose them on members of their congressional delegations. If the experiment does not produce results, the states can return to the present system of possible perpetual reelection. We should at least give federal rotation in office a chance via a constitutional amendment. Amateurs can do no worse than our professional ruling class has done. A significant impediment to reform is that amendments to the Constitution are controlled by Congress. The Anti-Federalists objected to congressional control over the amendment procedure. 'An Old Whig' observed, 'People once possessed of power are always loth to part with it; and we shall never find two-thirds of a Congress voting or proposing any thing which shall derogate from their own authority and importance, or agreeing to give back to the people any part of those privileges which they have once parted with.' 'The Federal Farmer' also expected Congress would 'be exceedingly artful and adroit in preventing any measures' limiting national power. If such alterations could be obtained, he predicted they would come from 'great exertions and severe struggles on the part of the common people.' The Anti-Federalists would appreciate the following: 'An amendment proposed by one or more of the several states shall be valid to all intents and purposes, as part of this Constitution, when ratified by the Legislatures of three fourths of the several States, or by Conventions in three fourths thereof.' Such an amendment procedure would give the states and the people a fighting chance to defend themselves against a consolidated national government that continuously operates in an extra-constitutional manner. Republicans can cheer the election of Donald Trump and Democrats can plan for 2028. But absent from addressing structural problems in our system, we face national bankruptcy gifted to us by a perpetual ruling class. It is time to give the Anti-Federalists a fair hearing.

Trump’s Economic Policies: The Good, The Bad, And The Uncertain –...	By Jon Wolfenbarger The US economy is ultimately driven by millions of people working hard to create and trade goods and services, but the US federal government can impact the economy in three main ways: 1) fiscal and regulatory policy: impacts production and who benefits and loses; 2) foreign policy and war: impacts production, life, and quality of life; and, 3) monetary policy: impacts inflation/deflation and boom-bust cycles. The key lesson of economic science was articulated well by Adam Smith in 1776 and has been repeated by all knowledgeable economists since then, including Ludwig von Mises and Murray N. Rothbard: free the economy! That means to avoid any counterproductive government interventions in voluntary trade and private property rights. Economic science teaches us that good fiscal and regulatory policy is to minimize government taxes, spending, and bureaucratic red tape. Good foreign policy is to pursue diplomacy, peace, and free trade with all countries whenever possible. Good monetary policy is to prevent artificial expansion of the money supply, which causes price inflation and the boom-bust cycle. Trump’s Economic Policies—The Good Trump has proposed a wide variety of economic policies for his second term, most of which are similar to his first term. Here are the positive ones based on economic science: Tax Cuts: Tax cuts are always good from a free-market perspective. Tax cuts allow hard-working Americans to keep more of their money for spending, saving, and investing. Investing in new equipment and technology raises labor productivity, wages, and living standards. Trump is proposing to extend the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act provisions, which are set to expire after 2025. This includes maintaining lower individual tax rates and a higher standard deduction. He favors reducing the corporate tax rate to 15 percent. He is also talking about eliminating income taxes on Social Security benefits and exempting tipped income and overtime pay from taxation. Deregulation: Deregulation is also always good free-market policy, since it eliminates bureaucratic red tape and frees entrepreneurs to create new businesses and jobs. It also lessens production costs. Trump wants to reduce regulations in the energy sector, in particular, to promote domestic production, which would help lower energy prices and reduce US reliance on Middle Eastern theocracies for energy. Trump’s Economic Policies—The Bad Higher Spending: Spending cuts are also always good from a free-market perspective, since they leave more resources in the private economy and lessen distortions brought about by spending. A good example of how beneficial cutting spending can be is post-World War II, when federal spending was slashed by 45 percent and there was a postwar boom. This is proof that Keynesian economics has everything backward. Trump has proposed spending more on infrastructure. This usually leads to wasteful spending and corruption with lots of money going to favored government contractors. It also distorts the price and capital structure by diverting money and resources to areas of the market where they would not otherwise go. Of course, it would be better to privatize as much infrastructure as possible. Trump has suggested Elon Musk could be 'Secretary of Cost-Cutting,' with a goal of cutting $2 trillion or more from the federal government’s $6.7 trillion budget. However, this will be very difficult to implement, as Trump has promised to not cut Social Security, Medicare, national defense, veterans programs and Federal pensions, which comprise over 80% of spending. Tariffs & Protectionism: Tariffs and protectionism are always bad for living standards, as proven by economists like David Ricardo in the 1800s. Tariffs are a tax on US consumers for buying foreign goods. Tariffs also distort the structure of production, tend to lead to higher prices, and can even make domestic producers less competitive overall. Trump is proposing a 10 to 20 percent tariff on all imported goods and a 60 to 100 percent tariff on Chinese imports. He has also proposed a 200 tariff on automobiles imported from Mexico, as well as a 25 percent tariff on all Mexican imports if Mexico fails to prevent illegal migrants from crossing into the US. Trump’s Economic Policies—The Uncertain Reduce Fed Independence: Trump and Vice President Vance have talked about limiting the Federal Reserve’s independence by allowing presidential influence over interest rates and potentially removing Chair Jay Powell from office. If this means that Trump wants to encourage lower interest rates and more artificial money creation, that would be bad, as it would lead to higher inflation and a more intense boom-bust cycle. If, on the other hand, they could really limit or eliminate Fed 'independence' and put monetary policy in the hands of elected officials rather than unelected bureaucrats like Powell, that could be very positive, though it would still imply that interest rates ought to be politically-determined rather than determined on the free market. Foreign Policy & War: Trump was the only US president in recent memory who didn’t start any major new wars. He says he wants to end the war with Russia, which has cost over one million lives, $175 billion so far in US taxpayer money, could lead to World War III, and even risks nuclear war. However, it is less clear what he wants to do with the conflicts in the Middle East and he is generally antagonistic towards China. Immigration: The US economy needs peaceful hard-working people to grow the economy, but it does not need people who commit crimes and go on welfare paid for by hard-working, taxpaying Americans. It remains to be seen what, if anything, Trump can do to improve the immigration system in the US. The Boom-Bust Business Cycle under Trump? The Fed created 40 percent more dollars in 2020 in response to covid. This caused the highest price inflation rates in over 40 years, not to mention the bubbles and market distortions as a result. That forced the Fed to hike interest rates at the most aggressive pace since the early 1980s. That caused the biggest decline in the money supply and the longest yield curve inversion since the Great Depression of the 1930s. If this does not lead to a recession, it will be the first time in history. The unemployment rate has risen 0.7 percent and every time it has risen at least 0.5 percent, there has been a recession. Housing starts have fallen significantly and leading economic indexes are pointing to recession. Thus, a recession is highly likely over the coming year or two regardless of what Trump does. The big question is inflation and interest rates. If the Fed cuts rates aggressively, as they have been doing in recent months, that could lead to a resurgence of price inflation during a recession. That would be 'stagflation,' which is the worst situation for American living standards. Conclusion One hopes that Trump will implement more free market-oriented policies, rather than interventions that harm the free market. The main near-term problem for the economy is that the Fed has already hiked rates at a pace that will likely lead to a recession and is now cutting rates despite stubbornly high inflation. Thus, we should hope for the best, but prepare for the worst. About the author: Jon Wolfenbarger is Founder and CEO of Bull And Bear Profits, an investment website. Send him email.

The Illusion Of Instant Motivation: How Social Media Short Clips ...	In today's digital age, platforms like Instagram, Facebook, and YouTube are flooded with motivational content, ranging from short video clips to random images adorned with inspirational quotes. With a swipe or a tap, users can consume a quick dose of motivation, promising to transform their mindset, boost their energy, or help them tackle life's challenges. These brief, often superficial pieces of content are designed to offer quick emotional gratification and encourage immediate action. Yet, a closer look at the psychological, philosophical, and neurobiological implications of this phenomenon reveals a darker side: this type of motivation may be impeding the very progress it claims to promote. While these social media motivational tools can create a temporary sense of empowerment, they fail to offer the deep, sustained drive that real motivation requires. To understand why, we need to explore the interplay between psychoanalysis, philosophy, and motivation. The key question is whether the instantaneous gratification provided by these platforms can lead to lasting change or if it ultimately fosters a cycle of dependency on external validation and quick fixes. The Allure of Instant Gratification and the Fragility of Motivational Boosts The human desire for immediate gratification is a well-established psychological phenomenon. According to Sigmund Freud, individuals often seek quick pleasures as a way to reduce anxiety and discomfort, which is part of the human tendency toward the pleasure principle. In modern terms, social media plays directly into this psychological need by providing instant access to motivational content that promises a shift in mindset without requiring the viewer to engage in any real effort. A quick scroll through Instagram or Facebook offers a 'feel-good' moment: a motivational quote, a clip of a speaker's impassioned rhetoric, or an image that invokes a sense of possibility and inspiration. This pattern of behavior fits into what B.F. Skinner would describe as operant conditioning—the idea that people are more likely to repeat behaviors that are immediately rewarded. In the case of motivational quotes and short clips, users experience a brief rush of dopamine, the 'feel-good' neurotransmitter, reinforcing the behavior of seeking out more such content. However, this creates a fleeting sense of fulfillment, one that quickly fades once the effect wears off. Rather than facilitating genuine, long-term motivation, these snippets become a form of pseudo-motivation, offering transient emotional boosts rather than sustainable change. In essence, these short, digestible bursts of content can leave users feeling temporarily inspired but do little to help them build the intrinsic motivation necessary to pursue long-term goals. The Myth of Effortless Change: The Philosophical Critique of Instantaneous Motivation From a philosophical standpoint, the emphasis on short, bite-sized motivation in the digital age challenges the fundamental principles of authentic personal growth. The philosopher Aristotle argued that virtue and excellence are achieved through habitual practice and conscious effort, an idea he elaborated in his concept of eudaimonia or flourishing. According to Aristotle, motivation is not something that can be handed to us in the form of a quote or a viral video; rather, it arises from continuous self-discipline, engagement, and the cultivation of meaningful habits. This view stands in stark contrast to the logic behind social media's motivational content. Instead of promoting the long, arduous process of self-improvement, platforms encourage users to believe that motivation can be delivered in a single moment, neatly packaged in a video or an image. This creates an illusion that change is immediate and effortless, sidestepping the hard work and patience that true motivation requires. As a result, users may experience frustration or even a sense of inadequacy when their efforts fall short of the quick fix they were promised. Furthermore, the existentialist philosophers, such as Jean-Paul Sartre and Friedrich Nietzsche, critiqued the tendency to look for external sources of validation or motivation. Sartre, in particular, emphasized the importance of authenticity in one's actions and choices. True motivation, from an existentialist perspective, must be self-generated, driven by personal commitment and a confrontation with one's own freedom and responsibility. The shallow, externalized motivation offered by social media stands in stark opposition to this notion of authentic self-motivation. It encourages users to externalize their power, relying on quick fixes rather than confronting their own existential freedom to choose and act. Psychoanalysis and the Risk of Narcissistic Validation The social media landscape, particularly through motivational posts and quotes, often becomes a platform for narcissistic self-validation. Donald Winnicott, a prominent psychoanalyst, introduced the concept of the false self—a persona adopted to gain approval from others and to avoid feelings of inadequacy. In the realm of social media, motivational posts contribute to this construction of a false self, where individuals curate a version of themselves that aligns with societal ideals of success, happiness, and motivation. When users post or engage with motivational content, they often receive positive reinforcement in the form of likes, comments, and shares, which temporarily bolsters their self-esteem. However, this external validation does little to foster true, internal motivation. Instead, it reinforces the idea that motivation is something to be sourced externally rather than cultivated from within. This is dangerous because it can lead to addictive behavior, where the individual continuously seeks more motivational content to satisfy an insatiable need for external affirmation. Rather than engaging in the hard work required to develop internal drive and purpose, users become dependent on a steady stream of digital affirmation, further diminishing their ability to motivate themselves in meaningful ways. The Dangers of Dismissing Struggle and Failure Another significant issue with motivational content on social media is its tendency to sanitize the reality of personal struggle and failure. Motivational quotes often present an idealized version of success, where hard work and perseverance automatically lead to achievement. However, this oversimplification ignores the inherent difficulties of personal growth, including the setbacks, frustrations, and moments of doubt that are an essential part of the process. According to Viktor Frankl, the psychiatrist and Holocaust survivor, meaning in life is often forged through suffering and overcoming obstacles. Frankl's concept of logotherapy posits that the search for meaning, rather than the avoidance of pain, is what truly motivates individuals. By focusing solely on positivity and success, motivational content can create an unrealistic view of personal development, one that erases the complexity of human experience. This can lead to feelings of inadequacy or disillusionment when users inevitably encounter the challenges that come with pursuing long-term goals. The pervasive narrative of effortless success found in motivational quotes may thus cause users to overlook the importance of resilience, perseverance, and self-compassion—key elements in building true, lasting motivation. Motivation and the Illusion of Control: A Psychoanalytic Perspective From a psychoanalytic perspective, the influx of motivational content on social media may contribute to a sense of illusionary control over one's life. Jacques Lacan famously argued that the ego is an illusion, shaped by external forces and desires. In the same vein, the constant exposure to curated motivational content can feed into a person's desire for control over their circumstances, promising that they can transcend their limitations by merely subscribing to a particular mindset or set of behaviors. However, Lacan also emphasized the concept of the mirror stage, where individuals come to realize that their identity is never fully their own but is influenced by the external world. In the context of social media, this mirrors the user's relationship with motivational content: they come to see motivation not as a personal, internal drive but as something to be sought externally. This reinforces a cycle of dependency where individuals rely on the approval of others and external sources of motivation, further distancing them from the deeper, internalized motivation that Lacan would argue is essential for true self-realization. Conclusion: Moving Beyond the Illusion of Instant Motivation The proliferation of motivational quotes and short, emotionally charged clips on social media offers a fleeting sense of empowerment that is often mistaken for real, lasting motivation. While these quick hits of inspiration can be enjoyable in the moment, they fail to offer the sustained, deep motivation that comes from hard work, struggle, and the gradual cultivation of one's inner drive. Philosophically and psychoanalytically, true motivation must come from within, nurtured through consistent effort, resilience, and a confrontation with the self. In the age of social media, it is crucial to recognize that motivation is not something that can be packaged in a short video or an inspirational quote. Instead, it is a process—one that requires self-reflection, authentic engagement with challenges, and a commitment to personal growth. While motivational content may serve as a quick distraction or an occasional boost, it cannot replace the genuine, sustained effort that leads to true self-improvement and success.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWemupebX1drw4HRyY6yUCqE	2024-12-15T16:21:03-08:00	
Californians Could Seriously Benefit From DOGE In ‘Trump-Proofed’...	California Gov. Gavin Newsom has set out to 'Trump-proof' California, but in one sense he’s too late. According to NBC News, 38.3 percent of Californians voted for Trump, by some accounts 40 percent, so as people across the country should know, Newsom’s crusade must involve something else. President-elect Trump has placed entrepreneurs Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy in charge of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), tasked to slim down the bloated government. Californians can easily find state agencies that should be eliminated, such as the Coastal Commission. The unelected commissioners recently made news by opposing an increase in Musk’s SpaceX launches from Vandenberg Space Force Base in Santa Barbara County. This was due not to environmental concerns but Musk’s participation in the election. Newsom said 'I’m with Elon,' but the commissioners, some appointed by the governor, are 'friends of mine.' In 2022, the governor’s friends rejected a desalination plant that would have provided arid Orange County with 50 million gallons of fresh water a day. Commissioner Dayna Bochco, president of Steven Bochco Productions explained that 'the ocean is under attack from climate change already.' A CCC commissioner since 2011, Bochco was reappointed last year. The Commission overrides scores of elected city and government officials, all fully capable of handling their own affairs, and runs roughshod over property rights. No governor, including Republicans George Deukmejian, Pete Wilson, and Arnold Schwarzenegger, has attempted to eliminate the CCC, hardly the state’s only wasteful body. Before they reach students in the classroom, Californians’ tax dollars must trickle down through multiple layers of bureaucratic sediment. These include the 58 county offices of education, which serve as 'support systems for their local school districts and as liaisons for the state.' Like the local districts, the county offices employ superintendents, who absorb huge amounts of taxpayer dollars. According to Transparent California, Los Angeles County Office of Education Superintendent Debra Duardo bags an annual pay package of $508,402, more than the president of the United States and more than double Newsom’s $201,553. Deputy County Superintendent Maria Martinez Poulin pulls down $343,887, and 'education officer' Maricela Ramirez is not far behind at $340,458. In the Sacramento County office, Superintendent David Gordon draws a total pay of $447,287 and Deputy Superintendent Masami Herota gets $324,921. This is for services that could easily be performed by the local school districts, whose non-teaching officials are also overpaid. For example, the Ontario-Montclair school district pays Superintendent Phillip Hammond a stunning $743,596, empowered by a 'series of opaque perks' that make Hammond the state’s highest-paid administrator. Chief business official Phillip Hillman bags a not-too-shabby $350,619. Bureaucratic bloat is also evident in the state’s tax system. The Franchise Tax Board (FTB), the California Department of Tax and Fee Administration (CDTFA), and the State Board of Equalization (SBE) are all responsible for the collection of taxes in some form. So is California’s Employment Development Department (EDD) 'one of the largest tax collection agencies in the nation,' collecting more than $81 billion in payroll taxes in 2018-19 alone. How this revenue is spent is another matter. Under the supervision of Julie Su, California’s Labor and Workforce Development Agency (LWDA) boss, the EDD was responsible for $30 billion in unemployment fraud, with convicts and out-of-state fraudsters alike cashing in. Despite that record, Su was the Biden–Harris administration’s choice for Labor secretary, never confirmed by the Senate but still in power at this writing. If Californians believed that four tax agencies are too many it would be hard to blame them. In a similar style, eliminating the costly county offices of education could help more tax dollars to reach students in the classroom. Over in Washington, the federal Department of Education was a payoff to the teacher unions that supported Jimmy Carter for president in 1976. As the 1983 A Nation at Risk report confirmed, the new department did nothing to improve student achievement. Musk and Ramaswamy have a strong case to eliminate the department, one of many expensive and counterproductive bureaucracies. Nothing of the sort is going on in California, and people across the nation should not be fooled. Newsom’s push to 'Trump-proof' California is an effort to reform-proof the state that needs reform the most.

Trump Already Making Waves With His Foreign Policy – OpEd	By Dr. Amal Mudallali President-elect Donald Trump has not been sworn in yet but he is already announcing steps that are reverberating around the globe. He has already threatened a trade war with two allies, one adversary and a powerful Global South group.Trump last month threatened Mexico and Canada with a 25 percent tariff on imports from the two countries unless they take measures to stem the flow of drugs and migrants across their borders with America. The president-elect also threatened China with an additional 10 percent tariff on its imports to the US. These two threats illustrate how Trump is planning to implement his economic agenda through flexing his muscles at friends and foes alike.Less than a week after these two announcements — which rattled both Mexico and Canada, prompting two different reactions — Mexico made a reciprocal threat but also reached out to Trump, while Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau visited Mar-a-Lago in a bid to convince him that such tariffs would hurt both sides.Before the week was over, Trump took to Truth Social again to threaten a 100 percent tariff on the BRICS grouping of nine nations — Brazil, Russia, India, China, South Africa, Egypt, Ethiopia, Iran and the UAE — if they tried to move away from the dollar. He warned that the time when America used to 'stand by and watch is over.' He wrote: 'We require a commitment from these countries that they will neither create a new BRICS currency nor back any other currency to replace the mighty US dollar, or they will face 100 percent tariffs and should expect to say goodbye to selling into the wonderful US economy.'The president-elect knows that the BRICS nations are a long way from having an alternative currency to the dollar. He said there was 'no chance' BRICS would replace the US dollar in global trade and any country that tried to make that happen 'should wave goodbye to America.' The dollar is still the world’s leading reserve currency and is used in 80 percent of global trade. Also, assessments of the dollar as the main global reserve currency indicate that it is 'secure in the near and medium term,' according to the Atlantic Council.The Council on Foreign Relations has doubted, citing experts, that a new BRICS reserve currency 'would be stable or reliable enough to be widely trusted for global transactions.' But this is not the issue for Trump. His goal is to draw a line in the sand and dare the world to cross it. He is telling the world, in no uncertain terms, that you are either with us or against us, and that it is time to choose. But he is also putting out his opening bid ahead of negotiations. Trump’s tactics are straight from his book, 'The Art of the Deal.' He used these negotiating tactics effectively in his first term. And his new threats against his neighbors and adversaries are also meant as a message to America’s European allies, telling them that he means business and they had better shape up. Someone once described Trump’s negotiating style as being like someone who enters a room, throws a bomb and leaves, before coming back to negotiate while the subject of his wrath is stunned and off balance. Tariffs, experts say, are only a negotiating tool for him and are part of his style, which depends on having leverage. This works in both politics and foreign policy.Trump’s newly chosen national security adviser, Rep. Michael Waltz, calls it 'the Trump effect.' He tweeted that 'dictators' in Venezuela, Nicaragua and Cuba were panicking at the prospect of Trump’s return, while adding 'this is what leadership looks like.' Even the ceasefire that was reached between Hezbollah and Israel was, for Waltz, an outcome of this Trump effect. He said: 'Everyone is coming to the table because of President Trump.' He added: 'His resounding victory sent a clear message to the rest of the world that chaos won’t be tolerated. I’m glad to see concrete steps toward de-escalation in the Middle East.'Although his Jan. 20 inauguration is still more than a month away, Trump is making waves internationally. World leaders began reaching out to him even before he was elected and he is casting a long shadow over events from the Indo-Pacific to Ukraine and the Middle East. The Biden administration is not comfortable with President-elect Trump’s moves, with some accusing him of running his own foreign policy and already changing the calculus of many actors on the world stage while President Joe Biden is still trying to solidify his legacy.The Biden administration is also taking actions that could lock Trump and his administration into policies that could derail his agenda. For example, Biden has allowed Ukraine to strike Russia with long-range US missiles, leading to an escalation and threatening Trump’s announced plan to end the conflict even before he is inaugurated.But the transition teams on both sides are painting a rosy picture of cooperation and unity, dismissing any suggestion to the contrary. Waltz said in an interview last month: 'Jake Sullivan (the outgoing national security adviser) and I have had discussions. For our adversaries out there that think this is a time of opportunity, that they can play one administration off the other, they’re wrong, and we are hand in glove. We are one team with the United States in this transition.'Plenty has been written about Trump’s proposed foreign policy team and the possible impact of their hawkish views on policy. But when it comes to foreign policy, there will be only one decider and one policy — the one that President Trump himself will dictate. He does not need to bring out President Harry Truman’s sign, 'The buck stops here,' and display this on his desk to send a message about who will be in charge, as the world already knows. • Dr. Amal Mudallali is a consultant on international affairs and former Lebanese ambassador to the UN.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWemupebX1drw3BLrZUSNRzZ	2024-12-15T16:16:50-08:00	
Trump’s Second Edition Puts Indo-US Relations At The Crossroads –...	For India, Trump is a mixed bag. Some of his policies will help the Modi regime while others will prove to be challenging. With the brash and unpredictable Donald Trump about to be President of the United States, there is anxiety in India about his domestic, foreign and trade policies. Trump's penchant for transactional relationships could mean that India cannot take America for granted or expect help from it without any thought of returning the favour. American scholar Ashely Tellis and Ambassador Eric Garcetti have complained that India has been taking from America but giving virtually nothing that America expects. There is anxiety about Trump's 'Make America Great Again' (MAGA) thrust. Questions that arise are: Does MAGA mean a pushy and aggressive pursuit of American interests at the cost of allies and strategic partners? Would Trump accept India's claim to be a power in its own right, entitled to be treated on par with America's traditional Western allies? Would he allow India to pursue strategic autonomy in its national interest often times running counter to American policies and interests? While these are of vital concern for India, the Indian Establishment is smug. Reflecting the current buoyant mood in India after having become the world's fifth largest economy by nominal GDP, External Affairs Minister S.Jaishankar declared that while other countries may have problems with Trump's re-emergence, India has none. But the reality is that there are multiple issues bedevilling India-US relations. Some of these may get mitigated while others could get exacerbated by Trump's coming back. Downside There is the sticky question of work visas for Indian students. Indian and US tariff issues may crop up. In the past Trump has used tariff has a weapon against China. Illegal immigration from India is an embarrassment. Then there is India's quest for leeway in foreign policy matters, especially in relation to Russia, China and the South Asian neighbourhood. India expects the US to accept its primacy in its neighbourhood (barring Pakistan). In the 1980s, India took exception to America's cultivating the right wing government in Sri Lanka headed by President J.R.Jayewardene. It encouraged the minority Tamils to put up their demands militantly which led to a 30-year war from which the island nation is yet to recover. More recently, India suspected that the US was behind the overthrow of the India-friendly Sheikh Hasina regime in Bangladesh. Indians described the August 5 Bangladesh revolution as a 'colour revolution' engineered by the US to nullify India's influence over Bangladesh. India unofficially dubbed the head of the Interim Administration Dr. Muhammad Yunus as a US plant. India also expects the US, no matter who is President, to avoid interfering in its internal affairs and eschew commenting on issues which it deems internal. It is particularly sensitive about comments on human rights violations, curbs on democratic rights and the treatment of Muslims and other minorities. But being the oldest and the most powerful democracy, the US has institutionalised its watchdog role in the world. Since the end of World War II, it has been describing itself as the leader of the Free World. This irks resurgent India under Modi. Therefore, every time the US State Department or any of the specialised commissions criticises India in its reports, a raw nerve is touched in the Indian Establishment. In angry retort , the US is promptly asked to mind its business. Friction between America's global democratic mission and India's sensitivity and its new found pride will continue to be a feature of Indo-US relations. However, there is an equally popular view that Trump is not committed to human rights like the wokes in the Democratic Party, and that he will turn a blind eye to human rights violations in India. However, this cannot be taken for granted. There are certain enduring features of the American Establishment such as the yearly human rights reports which cannot be stopped. It is these reports which validate America's time-honoured claim to be a torch bearer of democracy. Trump may not act on these reports or order sanctions, but he could use them to embarrass a recalcitrant foreign government. He did this in October when he used the plight of the Hindus in Bangladesh to indicate his support of the Hindus and India. Since winning the Presidential election, charges against Trump about attempting to overturn a previous Presidential election and illegally retaining classified documents at his estate have been dismissed, though two other cases remain. This gives hope to the Indian Establishment that the US$ 265 million bribery charge against Indian billionaire Gautam Adani deemed to be close to Modi, and the case against Indian intelligence agents in a plot to murder American citizen Gurpatwant Singh Pannun in New York, will also be dropped because of Trump's bonhomie with Modi. Trump had described Modi as 'great' and a 'friend'. Indians expect Trump's transactional approach to give India and other countries a chance to negotiate their way out of sticky situations such as the Adani and Pannun cases. Adani has already offered to invest US$ 10 billion in the US to create local jobs, a cause dear to Trump. It is sad that the case relating to Pannun could be dropped if India conducts a credible inquiry and 'punishes the guilty'. India is counting on Trump to counter George Soros, the American billionaire and gladiator for democracy the world over. Trump too hates Soros. The Modi government accuses Soros of funding the opposition Congress party to whip up mass opposition against it and topple it. Trump had also accused Soros of trying to fix him by supporting the Democrats who were investigating his conduct after he was defeated by Joe Biden. India would be hoping that Trump curbs the activities of Soros through investigations into the America's Deep State. Russia, China policies Indians welcome Trump's policy on Russia and his resolve to solve the Ukraine issue, because India can then continue to buy Russian oil at a concessional rate. Trump's China policy is going to be shaped by economic considerations arising from his election pledge to bring back factories to the US to give Americans jobs. For Trump, China's geopolitical expansion is less of a concern than favourable terms of trade. Trump wants a strong economic relationship with China to balance bilateral trade. US goods and services trade with China totalled US $758.4 billion in 2022. Exports were U$ 195.5 billion and imports were US$ 562.9 billion. India's approach to China is not very different from Trump's. India's relations with China may appear to be geopolitical and warlike on the surface but there is an underlying economic content which is preventing an outbreak of war. Both India and China are keen on continuing the booming bilateral trade. India expects China to opens its market to Indian goods more than it does now and narrow the yawning trade gap. In 2023, India's trade deficit with China was U$ 83.36 billion. India has ruled out war with China, though it is strengthening its military with American help. Foreign Minister Jaishankar has said that India cannot go to war with China simply because China's economy is five times India's. However, the downside in Trump's China policy is that a softer US policy on China could reduce India's importance for the US and might enable China to be more belligerent on the Sino-Indian border and in the South Asian neighbourhood. It is reported that Trump intends to invite President Xi Jinping for his inauguration in January. This is certainly not good news for Indian strategic planners. Trump's meeting with Xi in 2017 had resulted in the US-Chinese Phase One trade deal in 2020. Trump acolyte Elon Musk is a strong advocate of rapprochement with China. Tougher immigration policies under Trump could affect India if there is a move to restrict or change the terms of high-skilled or student visas—or to go for large-scale deportation of unauthorized Indian migrants. There were an estimated 725,000 illegal Indian immigrants in the US in 2022. Should Trump attend the Quad summit that is scheduled to take place in India in 2025, Modi will roll out the red carpet for him as it did in 2020. And along with deepening ties with Trump officials or allies, the Indian government will also continue to invest in relationships with other US stakeholders including members of Congress, state and local officials, and companies, an Indian commentator wrote. Therefore, for India, Trump is a mixed bag of the good and the bad, with the good outweighing the bad for the moment.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWemupebX1drwzDFtH9RotFd	2024-12-15T16:14:51-08:00	
Assad’s Fall: The Legacy Of Repression And Foreign Influence Amon...	By Mohammed Sinan Siyech and Celsabil Hadj-Cherif The fall of Assad’s regime, while ostensibly surprising for many, was quite predictable. Syria’s economy had been devastated by more than a decade of war, compounded by sanctions that crippled state infrastructure and left 90 percent of Syrians below the poverty line. Moreover, state subsidies on essentials such as food and fuel were slashed over the last few years, worsening the humanitarian crisis and fuelling renewed public dissent. In addition, the regime’s military backbone had also been hollowed out by years of attrition. The Syrian army, depleted by the loss of over 100,000 soldiers since 2011 due to sustained combat losses, desertions, and defections, severe morale issues and resource shortages, exacerbated by constant Israeli strikes targeting its bases. This contrasted with the rebel groups that were effectively training, mobilising, and recruiting troops over the last few years before they launched their offensive. Hezbollah, a key pillar of support for Assad during the civil war, had also been severely weakened. Even as it maintained its reputation as a capable resistance force, Hezbollah found itself overstretched, diverting resources to assist Hamas in Gaza and countering Israel’s aggressive actions. This decline underscored Iran’s diminishing ability to shield its regional allies as it contended with its own challenges amid escalating tensions with Israel and resource limitations. Meanwhile, Assad’s other primary ally, Russia, found itself embroiled in a prolonged conflict in Ukraine, which drained its military and financial resources. Yet, questions remain on the challenges of putting together a credible post-Assad government with the experience required to reconstruct and repair the war-torn nation. A legacy of repression: The roots of today’s challenges The violence of the Assad dynasty not only obliterated Syria's political life for decades but also laid the groundwork for the challenges faced today. Hafez al-Assad's legacy of systematic repression, epitomised by the 1982 Hama massacre in which 40,000 people were killed, organised dissent by groups like the Muslim Brotherhood—the only existing political opposition to the regime was eradicated, and authoritarian control was established. His policies extended beyond violence, banning the Kurdish language and cultural expressions to enforce Ba'athist unity under the guise of Arab secular socialism. The Mukhabarat, Assad’s feared intelligence apparatus, added another layer of repression, conducting mass arrests, torture, and executions without oversight. Dissent was crushed before it could take root, as emergency laws allowed arbitrary detentions and a climate of fear to prevail. This suppression ensured a smooth transfer of power to his son Bashar in 2000, but left Syria with no infrastructure for meaningful political opposition. Today’s fractured and externally-backed Opposition is a direct consequence of nearly half a century of calculated repression by the Assad regime. By systematically dismantling all forms of political organising and expression, the regime left the Syrian people metaphorically orphaned when it comes to political movements and leadership. Consequently, the Opposition that has emerged is dominated by two key groups: Hay’at Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), an Islamist faction that evolved from the Al-Nusra Front, and the Syrian National Army (SNA), formerly the Free Syrian Army, backed by Türkiye. HTS operated in northwest Syria, where it sought to consolidate its influence, while the SNA focused on combating Kurdish forces along the northern border. Despite tensions and divergent objectives, these groups have temporarily united against the regime. However, due to a lack of domestic infrastructure such as political know-how, finance and experience, any political opposition be it a political party or a rebel group is beholden to affiliating either with extremist groups or will remain vulnerable to being co-opted by international backers to survive. International powers and their engagements in Syria Against the backdrop, it is pertinent to examine several nations' roles regarding how Syria may be governed in the future. Firstly, Türkiye, being Syria’s immediate neighbour and the primary backer of the anti-Assad opposition since the start of the civil war, has announced its intention to play a role in ensuring Syria’s stability. Not only will the rebuilding of Syria give Türkiye new economic opportunities, but it will also allow Syrians displaced in Türkiye to return to their nation—an important win for Erdogan since their presence has led to domestic tensions. Moreover, peace in Syria solves a major security problem for Türkiye, particularly its longstanding Kurdish issue. Türkiye’s motivation to address the Kurdish threat has been so strong that it even sought reconciliation with the Assad regime over the past few years, only to be rebuffed by Bashar and his government. In shaping Syria’s future, Türkiye may also align with Qatar, another key supporter of Arab uprisings, to back the new Syrian regime. Qatar’s history of supporting transitions away from authoritarian rule, coupled with its financial and regional influence, could bolster Türkiye’s efforts in stabilising Syria. Secondly, while Iran has been a close ally of Assad-led Syria, it has suggested that Syria's future should now be determined by Syrians themselves. This stance came in the wake of the rebel group HTS announcing it would not target Shia shrines valued by Iran in Syria. Nevertheless, with US sanctions on Syria unlikely to be lifted, Iran, alongside Russia, may likely continue to back the new government, too. Despite Assad’s fall, Israel has already begun attacking the newly freed Syria, signalling dissatisfaction with the regime change and the regional disruption it creates. This dynamic could lead to a natural alignment between Russia and the rebels. Russia's military bases in Syria could entice it to engage with the new Syrian government to safeguard its interests in the region while offering protection to the rebels from Israel. Iran, meanwhile, could continue arming groups resisting Israeli occupation as it did when Assad was in power. The rebels themselves, especially given their alignment with groups like Hamas, may find ideological common ground with these actors. Khaled Mishal, the leader of Hamas, was notably supportive of the Syrian revolution in its early days, further strengthening this potential connection. This would be dependent on them deciding to engage with Iran and Russia, their former enemies. Examples of the rebels forgiving compulsorily conscripted military personnel suggest that it may take a forgiving/realpolitik approach to its former enemies, including Russia and Iran, to ensure that it continues to have international military backing. Thirdly, for the US and Israel, the fall of Assad presents both opportunities and risks. Israel, which celebrated the fall, may see this as an opening to target Hezbollah and Hamas supply lines, as well as to consolidate its hold over the occupied Golan Heights. However, the rebel factions now in power could pose a renewed challenge to Israel if they strengthen over the medium term. US allies, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) are also closely watching developments. Both nations have used Syria as a cautionary tale against revolutionary change and are likely to take steps to ensure that the situation in Syria does not embolden opposition within their own borders. The US’ interests in Syria itself are twofold; first, it will want to prevent ISIS from resurging, as seen in its bombing of several ISIS bases after the fall of Assad. Second, it will want to ensure that the new government will not attack Israel, possibly preparing for retaliation if they do. On a third, additional possibility, if Russia and Iran were to re-establish their presence in Syria, then the US could potentially look at Syria as a continued challenge. Clearly, historic processes beginning with Hafez al Assad in the 1970s have played a significant role in current-day rebel groups engaging in transnational alliances to survive. As the euphoria of the Syrian people winds down, they now face the dual challenges of rebuilding their nation amidst a fractured political infrastructure and ensuring that external powers do not have disproportionate influence over their future.

Russian Troops Remaining In Syria Lack Food, Water, Says Ukrainia...	(RFE/RL) -- Russian military personnel still in Syria are experiencing a lack of food and drinking water as an evacuation of troops and equipment continues, according to the Main Intelligence Directorate of the Ukrainian Defense Ministry (GUR). The Russian personnel are experiencing the problems at military bases in Tartus and Hmeimim and on ships anchored offshore in the Mediterranean Sea, the press service of the GUR said in a statement on Telegram on December 15. The GUR also said that the remaining Russian service members were waiting for military transport planes involved in the evacuation that were supposed to deliver food. The statement said Russia continues to withdraw its contingent from remote areas of Syria. 'At the same time, on some routes, the Russians are accompanied by armed groups opposing the Assad regime,' the GUR said. The statement added there are rumors circulating among Russian soldiers that Moscow has agreed to maintain its presence at the two bases, where the number of military personnel is up to 3,000. RFE/RL was unable to verify the information from open sources. Russian authorities have not commented on this information. The Russian Foreign Ministry said on Telegram that it had evacuated part of its diplomatic staff from Syria on December 15. It said the withdrawal was carried out by a special flight of the Russian Air Force from the Hmeimim air base. Russian transport planes have departed the Hmeimim air base in recent days as part of the evacuation following the fall of Syrian leader Bashar al-Assad. The longtime ruler was overthrown last week following a lightning offensive led by the Islamist group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS). Assad fled to Russia, which was his regime's main backer. Satellite images taken on December 13 by the space technology company Maxar appeared to show Russia preparing for the withdrawal of military equipment from the Hmeimim air base. The images showed what appear to be at least two Antonov An-124 cargo planes on the tarmac with their nose cones open. Russia also has sent several landing ships and civilian vessels to Syria, according to open-source information. In Damascus, HTS has appointed an interim government, and its leader, Riad al-Asaad, told AFP on December 15 that he is confident the factions that helped topple Assad will unite as one force. HTS and the transitional government have insisted the rights of all Syrians will be protected. U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken spoke with spoke with British Foreign Secretary David Lammy about the situation in Syria, State Department spokesman Matthew Miller said on December 15. Blinken and Lammy discussed the situation 'and the principles endorsed by the United States and countries in the region that should be upheld during the transition process and formation of a new government,' Miller said in a statement. Blinken on December 14 attended an emergency meeting in Jordan of foreign ministers from the Arab League, Turkey, and top officials from the European Union and United Nations. He said afterward the United States had made 'direct contact' with the HTS and other parties. He declined to discuss details of the contacts but said it was important for the United States to convey messages to the group about its conduct and how it intends to govern in a transition period. Blinken said a joint statement had been agreed at the meeting in Jordan that sets out the principles that other countries want to see in Syria's political transition, including inclusivity and respect for minorities and women and ensuring that terrorist groups do not take hold in the country.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWemupebX1drwzwEB3BCQvc6	2024-12-15T16:08:17-08:00	
Incoming National Security Adviser Calls For Explanation Of US Dr...	By Ken Bredemeier U.S. President-elect Donald Trump’s incoming national security adviser says it’s time to figure out where dozens of unexplained drones flying over eastern U.S. states are coming from and whether any ill intent is involved. Republican Representative Michael Waltz, from Florida and set to join Trump’s White House team when the president-elect takes office January 20, told CBS’s 'Face the Nation' on Sunday, 'We need to get to the bottom of it.' For weeks now, residents in the state of New Jersey, which borders New York City, and other states to the north and south along the Atlantic Ocean coastline have reported seeing more than 5,000 supposed drones, a figure U.S. officials have concluded is wildly inflated. All manner of conspiracy theories has been offered for the unexplained sightings, including U.S. government spying and the deployment of Iran-launched drones from a mothership off U.S. eastern coastal waters. Waltz called them 'long-loitering, could-be dangerous' drones. He credited the outgoing administration of President Joe Biden for trying to allay fears and resolve any mystery about the drones but offered no explanation himself. 'We need more transparency,' Minnesota Senator Amy Klobuchar, a Democrat, told the CBS show. 'This can’t be the future.' On Saturday, officials from the White House, the Department of Homeland Security and the Federal Bureau of Investigation stressed that most of the recent purported drone sightings in New Jersey — the state with the most reports — and elsewhere have been manned aircraft and posed no national security threat. An FBI official told reporters that the agency was working with 50 local, state and federal partners and had determined that fewer than 100 of the more than 5,000 reported sightings had turned out to merit further investigation. 'The combination of efforts so far ... to include technical equipment, tip line information and noted consults has ... not found any evidence to support large-scale [unmanned aerial system] activities,' the official said, adding that many of the sightings occurred along regular flight paths. The official said more investigations are under way to look at the remaining cases, including analysis of radar and intelligence. 'We can't ignore the sightings that have been there,' the official said. 'We're doing our best to find the origin of those drone activities, but I think there has been a slight over-reaction' in the number of claimed drone sightings. U.S. officials say they have confirmed drone sightings over military bases in New Jersey, including Picatinny Arsenal, but found no evidence that a foreign government had launched the drones. National security officials, however, have not been able to figure out who has been operating the unexplained drones. State and local officials in eastern seaboard states have expressed concern. Larry Hogan, a former Maryland governor, posted on social media Friday that he had seen 'what appeared to be dozens of large drones in the sky' above his residence in the state. 'The public is growing increasingly concerned and frustrated with the complete lack of transparency and the dismissive attitude of the federal government.' President-elect Trump suggested Saturday that the Biden administration was withholding information about the drone sightings and that the devices should be shot down. Republican Representative Christopher Smith of New Jersey said Friday in a statement that the White House’s attitude toward the sightings had been 'dismissive.' U.S. officials said Saturday the administration had sent New Jersey officials radar technology with an 'electro-optical infrared camera system' to track the devices. Last week, White House National Security spokesperson John Kirby said an investigation of the drone sightings had not turned up any illegal activity. 'To the contrary, upon review of available imagery, it appears that many of the reported sightings are actually manned aircraft that are being operated lawfully,' Kirby said.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWemupebX1drw34RBoSl11hh	2024-12-15T16:05:52-08:00	
Bangladeshi Experts, Officials Call For Support For ‘Mentally Sha...	By Zia Chowdhury Bangladeshi police official 'Amin' (not his real name) had barely slept for months. Even if he popped sleeping pills, 'Amin' said he could only snatch a few hours of sleep and that nightmares always jolted him awake. 'I keep hearing the sounds of gunfire in my dreams. It feels inescapable,' said 'Amin,' who requested that BenarNews not identify him by his real name for fear of reprisals. Police constable 'Mohammad' (also not his real name) faces a similar struggle. 'When I head out for work, the haunting images of our colleagues’ dead bodies pop up in my mind,' said 'Mohammad,' who asked not to be identified out of fear for his safety. 'Even something as simple as going out for tea fills me with anxiety,' he told BenarNews. 'I don’t know how to return to normalcy.' The stories of 'Amin' and 'Mohammad' highlight the psychological struggles faced by members of the Bangladeshi police force following mass protests in July and August that led to the ouster of Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina. More than 1,400 people were killed, including 44 police officers, and thousands of others were injured during violence around the protests. Protesters blamed the police, as well as security agencies and associates of the former ruling party, for the killings. Since Hasina fell from power on Aug. 5, many members of the police force – which has more than 214,000 personnel nationwide – have stayed away from duty, fearing retribution and feeling demoralized. 'The deaths of [their] colleagues and civilians during the [uprising] have left many officers mentally shattered,' said Muhammad Omar Faruq, chairman of the criminology and police science department at Mawlana Bhashani Science and Technology University. One police official said that many members of the police force had yet to recover from trauma following those weeks of unrest in the country. 'But there has been some improvement. Now, more attention is needed to boost the morale of the police,' Habib Palash, deputy inspector-general of the Chittagong Range, said at a public briefing. Dealing with trauma According to one mental health expert, there is an urgent need to help members of the police dealing with trauma. 'If a policeman is afraid to interact with people or hesitates to approach them, how can [he] effectively serve the public?' Dr. Helal Uddin Ahmed told BenarNews. To help restore normalcy in Bangladesh, the government should provide services to police officers to ensure their mental health, police officials and experts said. 'Efforts are needed to rebuild their confidence and help them return to normalcy,' Omar Faruq said, adding that police personnel should also undertake behavioral training. Baharul Alam, the newly appointed Inspector-General of Police (IGP), said he was ready to sit down with members of the force and discuss their various issues, including the state of their mental health. 'We will listen [to] them minute-by-minute: What is their problem [that prevents them from getting] back to normalcy? Is it trauma haunting them or other issues?' Baharul told BenarNews. 'We will arrange mental health or psychological counseling if needed,' he added. 'I would go to the remote areas across the country to hear from the grassroots-level policemen.' Various reforms must also be implemented to rebuild the public’s trust in the police following the political crisis that hit Bangladesh, officials and experts said. Insulating police from political influences These reforms include insulating the police from a political agenda. The police, along with government agencies and the courts, were deeply politicized during Hasina’s 15-year tenure. 'If the politicization of police ends, their morale will improve, and the [trust] gap between the police and public will be decreased,' former police chief Muhammad Nurul Huda told BenarNews. He cited a recent survey conducted by the Ministry of Home Affairs and released this month showing that almost nine out of 10 Bangladeshis (89.5%) wanted the police to be free from political influence and impartial when it came to enforcing the law. Omar Faruq, with the Mawlana Bhashani Science and Technology University, shared a similar view. 'The police must adhere to proper legal procedures and should be kept free from political dominance,' he told BenarNews. In October, the interim government appointed former Home Affairs Secretary Safar Raj Hossain as head of a commission to reform the police force. BenarNews sought comment from the commission, but officials did not immediately respond. Call to abolish Rapid Action Battalion Meanwhile, the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) – the top opposition party during Hasina’s rule – this week called on the police reform commission to abolish the Rapid Action Battalion (RAB), an elite security unit, over its alleged involvement over the years in numerous human rights violations, including extrajudicial killings and enforced disappearances. RAB, a unit of the Bangladesh police that includes members of the military, was a notorious security force during Hasina’s 15-year rule. 'Most of the killings, enforced disappearances, and extrajudicial executions [under Hasina’s term] have been committed by RAB. The force has become notorious by international standards and has turned into a ‘monster’ within the country,' BNP Standing Committee member Hafiz Uddin Ahmed told BenarNews. Ironically, RAB was formed in March 2004, when Bangladesh was under BNP’s rule. It was charged with internal security, intelligence gathering related to criminal activities, and government-directed investigations. The United States had accused RAB of more than 600 enforced disappearances over 12 years, a similar number of extrajudicial killings, and the use of torture. Washington imposed sanctions on the group in December 2021 over its alleged human rights abuses. RAB Director-General A.K.M. Shahidur Rahman acknowledged the allegations against the force and praised accountability for any violations committed by its personnel. 'There are allegations against RAB – disappearances, killings, and abductions. At the same time, I would like to stress that the only way to be free of these ‘wrongdoings’ is thorough investigation and justice,' he told BenarNews.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWemupebX1drw2mqW57PoU7Q	2024-12-15T16:04:19-08:00	
The Horn Of Africa States: An Ethio-Somali Rapprochement – OpEd	December 11th, 2024, was another historic day for the Horn of Africa States region. It was the day the Ankara Declaration was announced by the Turkish Government of President Recep Tayyip Erdogan with respect to an agreement between the Federal Republic of Somalia and the Federal Republic of Ethiopia, wherein the two countries turned away from the brink of war in the region, under the facilitation of Türkiye. The Somali side was represented by President Hassan Sheikh Mahmoud, while the Ethiopian side was represented by Prime Minister Abiye Ahmed Ali, the top leaders of the two countries. On face value the document announced by the Türkiye Government reflects a way forward for both countries to live in peace together, but many pundits on both sides believe that their side have erred in signing to the agreement. On the Somali side, many see that Ethiopia was an aggressor which has moved on to grab part of its territorial lands and sea while retaining a large part of Somali territory, Western Somalia, some 500, 000 square kilometers under the name of Somali State of Ethiopia in general and in the Oromia State of Ethiopia. To them it is like a person coming to claim the sleeve of the shirt one is wearing or a room in one’s own house. There was no need for such an agreement and Türkiye, as a strategic partner of Somalia, should simply have told Ethiopia to abide by international law. The opposition to Prime Minister Abiye Ahmed of Ethiopia are all crywolfing that he has abandoned the dream of Ethiopia to have its own access to a sea, which was within reach through the illegal MoU with a region of Somalia. It would appear, however, that both leaders of Somalia and Ethiopia were put under tremendous pressure by Türkiye’s President Erdogan to reach an accord that would satisfy both. It was, in the main, it appears, an accord to satisfy the needs of Türkiye, Somalia as a strategic partner and Ethiopia as a commercial partner. Prime Minister Abiye Ahmed Ali, in his previous discourses, always mentioned that he would respect Somalia’s sovereignty, but never Somalia’s territorial integrity and unity, which this declaration announces that he has agreed to the territorial integrity of Somalia, while being assured of a commercial access to Somalia’s seas. In essence, Somalia seems to have abandoned its previous rejection of the border between south Somalia and Ethiopia which is so far provisional, or it looks as such by agreeing to the territorial integrity of Ethiopia. This needs to be revisited in the eyes of Somalis, while perhaps, this does not even blink on the Ethiopian side. They take the current border for granted and ignore there is a dispute in this regard. Many Somalis argue that Prime Minister Ahmed Ali is not sincere while President Hassan Sheikh Mahmoud is desperate with a view to the shifting Somali political landscape which does not favor him. Both leaders had to succumb to the pressures of Türkiye, though, to sign on to the Ankara Declaration. A great matter that will come to the forefront in the future will be the negotiations that are planned to start in February 2025 and to be completed within a short period of time, perhaps within months. This seems to be too ambitious as both sides will need more time to prepare themselves, at least, to assemble negotiating teams that have expertise in commercial accessibility of landlocked countries and corridor management, which Somalia does not apparently have at present. The negotiations should not be designed for the current two leaders’ personal agendas. The contracts to be signed and negotiated should be designed to create long-term workable relationships between the two countries and peoples, which have had rough relations involving wars and skirmishes between the two countries over the years. The negotiations should be designed to be completed over a number of years as all agreements put forth in short periods often cause more problems for the issues they were designed originally to solve. The Ankara Declaration involves commercial access to the sea for Ethiopia through the Somali coastline. This should be a good arrangement for both countries after the negotiation processes are completed. The negotiations will have to involve not only the management of the corridor(s) but also the financing of the construction phase of the necessary ports, roads and rail, if necessary and other infrastructures. Ethiopia despite being a landlocked country has been working on establishing a naval force , which makes the Ankara Declaration suspicious as far as Somalis are concerned. They do not want to have a foreign naval force which they do not approve of in their waters and Ethiopia is not yet a country, which Somalia can truly trust. It will take years to earn such trust, and Ethiopia should abandon such naval force. Somalia can offer to purchase the fleet it acquired through the years, and this will be good for Ethiopia instead of wasting them docked in international ports and paying unnecessary demurrage fees. The security, safety and reliability of Somalia’s ports, roads and rail services within the Somali sovereign territory should be the responsibility of Somalia while the safety, security and reliability of the roads and rail service within the territory of Ethiopia should be the responsibility of Ethiopia. The contracts that are to be signed between the two parties should be drafted in that context and no less. The overall context of the Ankara Declaration represents a welcome relief from the difficult environment that was developing in the region, which could have put it back into years of chaos and other disasters, both known and unknown and unexpected. It is also a way forward for the region’s possible economic integration and one must applaud it. It is an opener for a dialogue and engagement between the two neighboring countries, which share a large population, some 164 million, between the two for a prosperous and stable future. The two in peace can also attract the other two countries of the region to a new arrangement, that assures the population of the region a better life ahead.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWemupebX1drw0x3cU0zDwjT	2024-12-15T16:02:18-08:00	
Indonesia’s Path To Peace: Bridging Divides On The Korean Peninsu...	Indonesia, as a prominent member of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) and an influential middle power in the Asia-Pacific region, emerges as a potential bridge-builder in fostering peace between South and North Korea. With its historical significance as a founding member of the Non-Aligned Movement (NAM), a steadfast commitment to dialogue through multilateralism, and a 'free and active' foreign policy, Indonesia possesses both the credibility and the strategic framework necessary to mediate one of the world’s most complex conflicts. This essay posits that Indonesia can leverage ASEAN’s principles of neutrality and consensus-building to facilitate dialogue between the two Koreas, thereby contributing to regional peace and stability. By engaging with the Koreas through ASEAN, Indonesia not only pursues a pragmatic pathway but also enhances its global diplomatic stature and advances its broader regional interests. Indonesia has established a proven track record as a constructive diplomatic actor in conflict resolution. A notable instance is its mediation in the Aceh peace process in 2005, during which Indonesia played a pivotal role between the Free Aceh Movement (GAM) and the Indonesian government, culminating in a historic peace agreement. This accomplishment significantly bolstered Indonesia’s reputation as an effective mediator. As a central player in ASEAN, Indonesia has consistently promoted the bloc’s principles of non-interference, peaceful dispute resolution, and multilateralism, principles that apply to the context of the Korean Peninsula. The ASEAN Regional Forum (ARF), which encompasses both South and North Korea, offers a valuable platform for dialogue. Indonesia could proactively take the initiative within ASEAN to prioritize peacebuilding efforts on the Peninsula, creating opportunities for informal discussions and confidence-building measures between the two Koreas. The geopolitical landscape of 2024 amplifies the urgency for renewed peace efforts on the Korean Peninsula. North Korea's ongoing missile tests and nuclear development, in conjunction with increased military exercises conducted by South Korea and the United States, have exacerbated regional tensions. Recent reports indicate that North Korea conducted over 40 ballistic missile tests in 2023, including intercontinental ballistic missiles capable of reaching the United States. This provocative posture has elicited enhanced military drills between the United States and South Korea, which North Korea perceives as rehearsals for invasion. Amid this cycle of provocation and retaliation, a neutral intermediary like Indonesia could revitalize dialogue by providing a platform independent of the strategic interests of major powers. Indonesia's position within the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) presents distinctive advantages. The foundational principles of ASEAN, as articulated in the ASEAN Charter, underscore the importance of regional peace and stability through non-aggression and dialogue. These principles align with Indonesia's 'free and active' foreign policy, which aims to avoid alignment with any major power bloc while actively contributing to global peace efforts. In addressing the Korean conflict, Indonesia could leverage ASEAN's existing mechanisms, such as the ASEAN Regional Forum (ARF) and the Treaty of Amity and Cooperation (TAC), to promote dialogue. Established in 1994, the ARF is the only regional security forum that includes both Koreas, alongside key stakeholders such as the United States, China, Russia, and Japan. By advocating for the ARF to prioritize issues related to the Korean Peninsula, Indonesia could facilitate gradual confidence-building measures, including military exchanges or agreements designed to prevent accidental clashes. One of ASEAN's strengths lies in its capacity to unite countries with diverse political systems and interests through consensus-based decision-making. Indonesia could capitalize on this strength by spearheading an ASEAN-led initiative to engage both Koreas in dialogue. For instance, it could propose a 'Korean Peninsula Peace Initiative' within the ARF framework, focusing on non-political cooperation in sectors such as disaster management, public health, and environmental protection—areas that are less politically sensitive yet capable of fostering goodwill. ASEAN's experience in managing regional tensions, such as facilitating negotiations concerning the South China Sea, exemplifies its ability to address complex disputes without exacerbating conflicts. As ASEAN's largest and most influential member, Indonesia is ideally positioned to lead such initiatives. Furthermore, Indonesia's soft power and cultural diplomacy can enhance its formal diplomatic endeavours. For example, Indonesia could organize cultural exchanges involving artists, athletes, and students from both Koreas. The 2018 Asian Games in Jakarta and Palembang, during which North and South Korea marched under a unified flag, exemplified Indonesia's capacity to employ sports diplomacy as a means of reconciliation. Expanding these initiatives could foster people-to-people connections and reduce mistrust at the grassroots level. Nevertheless, Indonesia's endeavours face significant challenges. North Korea's entrenched mistrust of external actors, coupled with its reliance on China as its primary ally, may impede its willingness to engage in initiatives led by Indonesia. Furthermore, South Korea’s strategic alignment with the United States could render it reluctant to fully endorse an ASEAN-led framework that lacks substantial U.S. involvement. To navigate these obstacles, Indonesia must ensure that its initiatives are perceived as genuinely neutral and not designed to undermine the interests of either Korea or their allies. This will necessitate careful coordination with other key stakeholders, including the United States and Japan, to foster broad-based support for its efforts. In 2024, Indonesia's active role in ASEAN's diplomatic processes presents a timely opportunity to advance peace-building initiatives on the Korean Peninsula. By incorporating issues related to the Peninsula into ASEAN’s broader agenda, Indonesia can enhance the bloc’s role as a regional peace mediator while addressing one of Asia's most pressing security challenges. Collaboration with the United Nations and other international organizations to align its initiatives with global peace efforts could further strengthen Indonesia’s position. Indonesia’s active participation in United Nations peacekeeping missions reflects its commitment to international peace and security—an assurance that could be extended to the Korean Peninsula. The potential benefits of Indonesia’s involvement are considerable. A stable Korean Peninsula would bolster regional security and economic integration in Northeast Asia, which is crucial for ASEAN’s economic interests. Moreover, successfully mediating the Korean conflict would elevate Indonesia’s diplomatic standing on the global stage, reinforcing its role as a middle power adept at addressing complex international challenges. To achieve this, Indonesia should emphasize building trust through incremental confidence-building measures, rather than attempting to resolve all contentious issues in one fell swoop. This approach aligns with ASEAN’s effective method of gradualism in managing regional disputes. In conclusion, Indonesia’s proactive engagement in the peace process on the Korean Peninsula—leveraging the principles and frameworks of ASEAN—provides a promising avenue for facilitating dialogue and mitigating tensions between North and South Korea. By prioritizing trust-building initiatives and collaborating with key stakeholders, Indonesia can establish itself as a credible and effective mediator. Given the escalating tensions anticipated in 2024, the necessity for neutral actors like Indonesia to assume a more prominent role is increasingly critical. Through its leadership within ASEAN and a steadfast commitment to multilateralism, Indonesia possesses both the resources and the opportunity to make a significant contribution to peace on the Korean Peninsula. Indonesia should propose a formal 'Korean Peninsula Peace Initiative' under the auspices of the ASEAN Regional Forum, focusing on non-political cooperation and cultural diplomacy to cultivate trust and create conditions conducive to sustained dialogue. Such an initiative would not only further the cause of peace but also reaffirm Indonesia's status as a global leader in conflict resolution.

South Korea’s Acting President Moves To Reassure Allies After Imp...	(EurActiv) -- South Korea's acting president, Han Duck-soo, moved on Sunday (15 December) to reassure the country's allies and calm financial markets a day after President Yoon Suk Yeol was impeached and suspended from his duties over a martial law attempt. Han spoke with US President Joe Biden by phone, the White House and Han's office said. 'South Korea will carry out its foreign and security policies without disruption and strive to ensure the South Korea-US alliance is maintained and developed steadfastly,' Han said, according to a statement from his office. In a further attempt to stabilise the country's leadership, the main opposition party announced it would not seek to impeach Han for his involvement in Yoon's 3 December martial law decision. 'Given that the prime minister has already been confirmed as acting president and considering that excessive impeachments could lead to confusion in national governance, we have decided not to proceed with impeachment procedures,' Democratic Party leader Lee Jae-myung told reporters. Han, a longtime technocrat picked by Yoon as prime minister, was elevated to acting president in accordance with the constitution while Yoon's case moves to the Constitutional Court. North Korean threat Yoon's surprise martial law declaration and the ensuing political crisis spooked markets and South Korea's diplomatic partners worried over the country's ability to deter nuclear-armed North Korea. Biden told Han the ironclad US-South Korea alliance remained unchanged and Washington would work with Seoul to further develop and strengthen the alliance as well as trilateral cooperation including neighbour Japan, Han's office said. The White House said in a statement that the US president 'expressed his appreciation for the resiliency of democracy and the rule of law in the ROK and reaffirmed the ironclad commitment of the United States to the people of the ROK,' using the abbreviation for the country's formal name, the Republic of Korea. 'President Biden expressed his confidence that the Alliance will remain the linchpin for peace and prosperity in the Indo-Pacific region during Acting President Han’s tenure.' Han convened his cabinet and National Security Council shortly after Saturday's impeachment vote and vowed to maintain military readiness to prevent any breach of national security. South Korea’s partners wanted to see a credible and constitutional temporary leadership put in place as soon as possible, said Philip Turner, a former New Zealand ambassador to South Korea. 'They will be pleased to see Prime Minister Han take over as acting president,' he said. 'He is capable, experienced and well respected in foreign capitals.' But even with an acting president in place, international partners face months of uncertainty before a new president can be elected and a new government established, Turner added. The Constitutional Court has up to six months to decide whether to remove or reinstate Yoon. If he is removed or resigns, a new elections will be held within 60 days. 'During that time Korea’s highly competent professional bureaucracy can be relied on to keep the country’s foreign policy running, but they will find it hard to provide clear direction,' Turner said. Economic fallout South Korean shares rose for a fourth straight session on Friday on hopes that the political uncertainty would ease after the impeachment vote in parliament, which followed a failed vote a week earlier. Democratic Party leader Lee said the most pressing issue is a slump in consumption caused by insufficient domestic demand and the government's reduction of its fiscal role. He called for a National Stability Council for Governance comprising the government and parliament to discuss finance, economy and public livelihoods. 'To address this, I believe it is necessary to promptly discuss a supplementary budget,' Lee said, adding that a supplementary budget could include funding to support small businesses and investments related to artificial intelligence and infrastructure to try to head off energy shortages. Parliament, controlled by Lee's party, passed a 673.3 trillion won ($470.6 billion) 2025 budget bill on Tuesday that cut the government's 677.4 trillion won proposal, without reaching agreement with Yoon's People Power Party and the government. By law parliament cannot increase government budgets, and at the time the Democratic Party said a supplementary budget could be needed to address spending for people's livelihoods. The party said its cuts were mostly in reserve funds for the government, interest costs and funds allocated to the presidential office, prosecutors and auditors for classified operations. The government accused parliament of delaying projects for small businesses with the cuts. Deadlock over budget issues was one of the justifications Yoon cited for imposing martial law.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWemupebX1drw2R71TIEldhh	2024-12-15T15:54:41-08:00	
Indonesia: Joining BRICS And OECD As A Member – OpEd	As Southeast Asia's largest economy, Indonesia has made significant advancements in both economic and geopolitical stature, prompting discussions about its potential membership in influential international organizations such as BRICS and the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). The BRIC grouping, which includes Brazil, Russia, India, and China, and has been expanded to BRICS with the addition of South Africa, comprises emerging economies that challenge traditional global powers. In contrast, the OECD is a forum for high-income economies to coordinate policies and promote sustainable growth. Membership in these organizations could solidify Indonesia’s status as a global economic powerhouse; however, the journey is not without its challenges, including domestic governance issues, economic inequality, and environmental sustainability. This essay analyzes Indonesia's candidacy by assessing its economic potential, social progress, and the obstacles it must overcome while offering recommendations to enhance its global integration. Indonesia’s Economic Potential and Case for BRICS Membership Indonesia's economic trajectory makes it a prime candidate for BRICS membership. As of 2024, the country's gross domestic product (GDP) is projected to reach $1.43 trillion, ranking it as the world’s 16th largest economy and the largest in Southeast Asia. The nation has consistently experienced GDP growth of 5-6% annually, fueled by domestic consumption, a burgeoning digital economy valued at $77 billion, and abundant natural resources such as coal, palm oil, and nickel—crucial elements in the global supply chain for renewable energy technologies like electric vehicles. Geopolitically, Indonesia's strategic location at the crossroads of the Indian and Pacific Oceans allows it to control vital maritime trade routes. As a founding member of ASEAN and an active participant in the G20, Indonesia has demonstrated its capability to navigate complex multilateral frameworks. Including Indonesia in BRICS would enhance the group's legitimacy as a representative of the Global South, fostering cooperation among emerging economies. Nevertheless, challenges persist. Indonesia’s economy, while robust, is significantly smaller than those of BRICS heavyweights like China and India, whose GDPs exceed $14 trillion and $3.7 trillion, respectively. Additionally, BRIC's occasionally anti-Western rhetoric may conflict with Indonesia’s non-aligned foreign policy, which seeks to maintain balanced relations with both Western powers and the Global South. Indonesia’s Social Progress and OECD Membership Aspiration Indonesia's aspirations for OECD membership demonstrate its commitment to aligning with global standards for economic and social development. Under President Joko Widodo (Jokowi), recent reforms have focused on enhancing the business environment, notably through the landmark Omnibus Law on Job Creation (2020), which streamlined regulations and increased foreign investment. The ongoing construction of the new capital city, Nusantara, further exemplifies Indonesia’s modernization efforts. Social indicators reflect this progress as well—literacy rates have risen to 96%, and the proportion of the population living below the poverty line has dropped to 8.5% in 2024. Indonesia is also committed to sustainability, pledging to achieve net-zero emissions by 2060, backed by a growing renewable energy sector. However, significant challenges remain on the path to OECD membership. Governance issues persist, as evidenced by Transparency International ranking Indonesia 96th in its 2024 Corruption Perception Index. Income inequality is another concern, with a Gini index of 38.2 indicating a considerable wealth gap. Furthermore, while Indonesia has made progress in renewable energy, issues such as deforestation and reliance on coal-fired power plants undermine its environmental credentials. These challenges highlight the necessity for structural reforms to meet the OECD’s rigorous policy standards. Problems and Challenges in Global Integration Indonesia's integration into BRICS and OECD is fraught with obstacles. Domestically, infrastructure gaps continue to exist despite significant investment. Rapid development in urban centers like Jakarta contrasts with the underdevelopment of rural areas, limiting equitable growth. Disparities in education further impede human capital development, with access to quality education skewed in favor of urban populations. Politically, it is essential for Indonesia to ensure the continuity of economic reforms, such as infrastructure development and investment-friendly regulations, alongside a stable foreign policy framework to advance its global integration aspiration. On the international stage, Indonesia faces a delicate balancing act. While BRICS membership could bolster its influence in the Global South, aligning with the bloc's anti-Western stance may strain relations with Western partners. Conversely, joining the OECD may necessitate Indonesia adopting policies that challenge its current economic model, including stricter labor standards and a reduced reliance on resource-based industries. Environmental challenges are significant. Indonesia's deforestation rate, largely driven by palm oil production, is among the highest in the world, leading to biodiversity loss and increased carbon emissions. Meeting the environmental expectations of the OECD and BRICS will necessitate a shift towards sustainable agricultural practices and considerable investment in clean energy. Benefits of Membership in BRICS and OECD Joining BRICS and OECD presents Indonesia with substantial advantages. Economically, BRICS membership would grant access to development funding and technological cooperation, particularly in infrastructure and renewable energy. It would also strengthen Indonesia’s bargaining power in global trade negotiations, providing a more influential voice in shaping international commerce. OECD membership would enhance Indonesia’s reputation as a reform-oriented economy, attracting increased foreign direct investment. The OECD’s policy frameworks could serve as a model for improving governance, education, and environmental sustainability, aligning Indonesia with best practices in these areas. Geopolitically, membership in both organizations would reinforce Indonesia’s role as a bridge between developed and developing nations. As a member of BRICS, Indonesia could advocate for the interests of the Global South, while OECD membership would affirm its status among leading economies, enhancing its diplomatic influence. Recommendations To optimize its chances of successful integration, Indonesia should prioritize the following actions: Strengthen Governance: Enhance transparency and reduce corruption through the digitalization of public services and stricter enforcement of anti-corruption laws. Address Inequality : Expand social welfare programs and invest in rural development to mitigate wealth disparities and improve access to education. Accelerate Environmental Reforms: Implement stricter controls on deforestation, promote reforestation efforts, and expedite the transition from coal to renewable energy sources. Maintain Policy Continuity: Ensure that ongoing economic reforms and infrastructure projects remain stable and consistent. Engage in Multilateral Diplomacy: Balance relationships with both Western and non-Western blocs to uphold Indonesia’s non-aligned foreign policy stance. Conclusion Indonesia’s pursuit of BRICS and OECD membership reflects its ambition to evolve from a regional leader into a global powerhouse. With a robust economy, a strategic geopolitical position, and ongoing reforms, Indonesia has the potential to make significant contributions to both organizations. However, challenges such as governance issues, inequality, and environmental sustainability must be addressed to ensure successful integration. By prioritizing structural reforms, equitable development, and sustainable policies, Indonesia can meet the expectations of BRICS and OECD while setting a precedent for other emerging economies seeking global recognition.

Who Lost The Great Chess Match? – OpEd	Vladimir Putin's strategic gambit in Ukraine produced results far different from what he anticipated. Ukraine, intended as bait in Russia's geopolitical play, became a trap that backfired when NATO provided coordinated support, overturning Putin's plans. Expecting to crush Ukrainian resistance swiftly and return to business as usual, Putin instead found his assumptions thwarted. NATO's extensive assistance to Ukraine—training, weaponry, intelligence, and ammunition—inflicted significant costs on Russia. This backing not only stymied Russia militarily but also imposed severe economic burdens through Western sanctions. The fallout disrupted key Russian projects, including delays in the construction of the Akkuyu Nuclear Power Plant in Turkey. While initially focused on the Syrian conflict, Russia redirected its attention to Ukraine under growing Western pressure. Although it managed to occupy areas in Eastern Ukraine with significant Russian-speaking populations and restricted Ukraine's Black Sea access, the war has come at an enormous cost. To date, an estimated one million soldiers and civilians from both sides have lost their lives in the conflict. Putin's influence in the Middle East has also sharply declined. Russian naval and air bases in Syria have been rendered largely ineffective, and allies like Iran are preoccupied with domestic challenges. Furthermore, Russia's relationship with Turkey has grown increasingly precarious. Once a strategic partner, Turkey now poses potential risks for Putin, with unresolved issues like the fate of the S-400 missile systems further straining ties. These developments have significantly undermined Russia's strategic dominance, leaving its hegemonic ambitions in question. At the same time, Turkey faces new risks, finding itself squeezed between competing global powers. As a result, Ankara must navigate its moves with precision to secure its strategic interests. Putin's loss in this geopolitical chess match extends beyond Ukraine and Syria. It has weakened Russia's position in the global power balance, leaving the future role of countries like Turkey pivotal in shaping the emerging world order.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWemupebX1drw6IpL6WnoxJF	2024-12-15T15:50:26-08:00	
Navigating Geopolitical Threats In The Insurance Sector – Analysi...	By Prithvi Gupta Since the turn of this decade, heightened known risks (geopolitically-motivated conflicts and geoeconomically-motivated sanctions) and emerging unknown risks (generative artificial intelligence and cybersecurity threats, among others) have exacerbated insurance premiums across the board for all industries in the international economy. The unpredictable nature of these known and unknown risks has made it difficult for insurers to evaluate risk levels and their scope, especially geopolitical and geoeconomic threats such as the ripple effects of the Middle East conflict, Russia’s special military operation in Ukraine and reciprocal economic sanctions by the West against Russia and China. In these geopolitically turbulent times, wherein economic engagement and supply chains are being weaponised as instruments to exert geopolitical influence, a case can be made for the national government to step in and act as an ultimate insurer for the international trade of domestic private companies operating abroad. An initial step in this regard can be government-backed public-private insurance across government-coordinated economic connectivity corridors—a feature of the emerging role of geopolitics in global trade and supply chains. Intergovernmental economic corridors such as the India-Middle East-Europe Economic Corridor (IMEC), the International North-South Transport Corridor (INSTC), the Middle Corridor, and the Partnership for Global Infrastructure and Investment (PGI) Lobito Corridor are government-backed corridors that traverse through high-risk conflict zones such as the Red Sea, politically unstable and conflict-ridden Central Africa, and the South Caucasus. Corridor partners need to securitise these geoeconomic trade routes, both militarily and financially. This article provides suggestions for how governments can coordinate action in economic connectivity corridors to ensure these routes against geopolitical threats and geoeconomic aggression for efficiency in trade. It also analyses the role of geopolitically motivated conflicts in the rising insurance premium rates in the political risk, freight and maritime trade domains. Geopolitics and insurance The turn of this decade witnessed the demise of a long-held consensus around low inflation and low-cost labour and capital—products of the post-1945 globalisation era—due to a series of shocks to the global economy (Russia’s aggression in Ukraine, the Red Sea supply chain crisis and the pandemic) which culminated in widespread inflation and interest rate hikes across the developed economies and most of the emerging markets in developing countries. Elections across 64 nations (and the European Union) in 2024 add to the geopolitical and economic uncertainties because of the associated risks of policy upheavals in these countries, especially the United States (US). These developments gave way to a reset in the global geopolitical and economic matrix. Economic policy uncertainties and geopolitically motivated supply chain disruptions also built pressure on the insurance industry, which is designed to only occasionally provide relief to commercial activity through monetary measures, rather than deal with structural problems such as geopolitical conflicts and economic sanctions. Insurers and reinsurers determine insurance premiums and their profitability based on accessibility (quantifiability of profits, losses and payouts), randomness (unpredictability of the insured event whose occurrence should not be in the insurer/customer’s control) and mutuality (involvement of multiple stakeholders to diversify risks outcomes). Often, direct and indirect damage from geopolitical shocks cannot be assessed, predicted or shared with other stakeholders, as geopolitically motivated damage is precisely targeted. As a result of the global insurance industry’s incapacity to effectively assuage these new problems, most insurers and reinsurers have resorted to ballooning insurance premiums across various industries and economic sectors. Besides, premiums rise with higher risk perception. The Houthi rebels’ militancy in the Red Sea increasedthe insurance premiums on freights, beginning October 2023. The alternative route—the Cape of Good Hope—adds 30 days of transit and US$ 1 million in excess transportation charges. This poses a problem for Asian exporters. In fact, Indian exports to the US and EU declined in the second and third quarters of 2023-24 as exporters were holding back their exportables due to this risk premium posing extra costs. The IMEC, INSTC, Middle Corridor, and PGI are essentially responses to this, that avoid the extra risk premium and transportation costs of the extra mile movements, which are also associated with higher insurance premiums. In the past four years, global insurance premiums have risen by 10 percent annually. Political and geopolitical risk premiums have risen by 13 percent between 2022 and 2024. Industrially, the shipping industry saw insurance premiums rise by 20 percent between 2022 and 2024. War risk insurance premiums, which were previously around 0.05 percent of the insured value of the vessel, have now increased to between 0.75 percent and 1 percent. Marine and shipping insurance statistics are essential as close to 90 percent of global trade is seaborne. Exacerbated insurance premiums in other industries such as automobiles and cyberspace are also a byproduct of geopolitical conflicts and grey-zone aggression. Embedding governmental insurance in connectivity corridors As risks become more complex and unpredictable, insurers can no longer evaluate them through the rear-view mirror. This especially stands true in the case of the Middle East, Europe and Africa, where economic corridors like the IMEC, the INSTC, the Middle Corridor and the European Global Gateway are emerging as critical pathways for economic cooperation among like-minded partners. However, these regions/continents are also plagued by war, political instability, militancy and armed interventions by non-state actors in key trade routes. To persuade their domestic private actors to invest in and instrumentalise these corridors for international trade, the government will first have to ensure transit security across these corridors and develop intergovernmental insurance frameworks for political/geopolitical risk across these corridors. The volatility of geopolitical conflict and the randomness of the collateral damage that may be incurred therein necessitates governmental intervention. There is precedent for this in both public sector and public-private partnerships. The US International Development Finance Corporation guarantees coverage up to US$ 1 billion in 49 countries for the US private sector. Additionally, when businesses lost infrastructure and inventory in the late 1990s after a series of Irish Republican Army attacks in the United Kingdom, the UK government and the country’s private insurance sector formed the Pool Re, a private-public vehicle, wherein financial security is covered by the government. Pool Re provides wide-ranging domestic and international political risk insurance to British businesses. Similar models of governmental intervention or public-private partnerships exist in the United Arab Emirates, China, Saudi Arabia, France and Germany, among others. A major reason for the Chinese private sector’s deep involvement in the Chinese Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) is that there is massive governmental support through government insurance, tax subsidies and easy regulations and permits for investments under the BRI framework. This has led to a concentration of Chinese private outward investment in middle and low-income countries with high indices of political risk. If partner countries of the IMEC, INSTC, and other corridors wish to optimally operationalise the corridors, an intergovernmental multipurpose vehicle that insures against geopolitical risks is necessary. A corridor-specific vehicle along the lines of the World Bank Group’s Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency, which offers insurance for non-commercial risks in the developing world, is an idea to begin with. That being said, transit security is still the bedrock of any government-backed political risk insurance, emphasising the role of national militaries in securing trade routes. Conclusion The idea of governmental or public-private insurance for political risks is still a radical one, despite it being the need of the hour. In connectivity corridors which run through high-risk conflict areas, this need is even more tenable. Public-private or government insurance can not only alleviate some pressure from the private insurance sector, which is struggling to insure against geopolitical risks but also optimise the operationalisation of the economic corridors which are emerging as national economic priorities for many countries. Another collateral benefit of government or public-private insurance is that this allows domestic private players to go out and trade internationally, which is essential for any country with an ambition for economic growth and development.

Exploring Cyber-Darkness: How Moscow Undermines The West Via The ...	By Manucharian Grigoriy Russian hybrid warfare is an intricate field where elements of cyber and physical operations intertwine seamlessly. According to the 2024 report by Cyber Diia Team, there is a consistent, nearly month-long time gap between Russian cyberattacks and subsequent missile strikes, observed between 2022 and 2024. This calculated sequential approach highlights a strategy aimed at undermining infrastructure resilience prior to physical strikes, which, over the last two years of hot war, has evolved into a hallmark of Russian cyberwarfare. This article builds upon Cyber Diia’s research and expands its Russian cyberwarfare ecosystem tree as shown below, namely the red-framed branch. More specifically, we examine how peripheral and core cyber-operations merge under the Kremlin’s hybrid military doctrine, exploring the Kremlin-backed entities, as well as the independent key groups like Qilin and Killnet. © Cyber Diia Team (Evil Corp and LockBit were Kremlin-independant hacker groups, now disseminated and replaced by Qilin, Killnet and the others) Core Kremlin Entities The 2022 report on the Russian use of offensive cyber-capabilities by the Regional Cyber Defence Centre, a subsidiary of the National Cyber Security Centre under the Ministry of National Defence of the Republic of Lithuania, identified six key entities within Russia’s cyber-intelligence apparatus: Dragonfly: A cyber-espionage group operating under FSB Centre 16, also known as Military Unit 713305. Dragonfly targets critical infrastructure sectors worldwide, including energy, water systems, and defense. Gamaredon: Linked to FSB Centre 18, Gamaredon specializes in intelligence collection against Ukrainian state institutions, focusing on defense, law enforcement, and security agencies. APT29 (Cozy Bear): Associated with the Russian Foreign Intelligence Service (SVR), APT29 conducts global cyber-espionage operations, targeting governments, technology firms, and private sector organizations. APT28 (Fancy Bear): Tied to the GRU Unit 26165, APT28 is infamous for its involvement in election interference, including the hacking of the Democratic National Committee in 2016. Its targets include governments, militaries, and political organizations. Sandworm: Operated by GRU Unit 74455, Sandworm is responsible for high-profile cyberattacks such as the 2018 Olympic Destroyer malware and the NotPetya ransomware attack of 2017, which caused over $10 billion in global damages. TEMP.Veles (TsNIIKhM): Linked to the Russian Ministry of Defense’s Central Scientific Institute of Chemistry and Mechanics, TEMP.Veles developed Triton malware, designed to manipulate and compromise safety systems in industrial control environments. These entities form the backbone of Russia’s state-backed cyber operations, employing advanced tools and techniques to disrupt critical infrastructure, compromise sensitive data, and destabilize adversaries globally. Their operations demonstrate the Kremlin’s reliance on cyber-intelligence as a critical component of hybrid warfare. Peripheral Cyberwarfare Operations We are idealists who love our country. […] Our activities influence the governments of th[e] countries who promise freedom and democracy, help and support to other countries, but do not fulfill their promises. […] Before the terrible events around us began, we worked in the IT field and simply earned money. Now many of us are employed in various professions that involve protecting our home. There are people who are in many European countries, but nevertheless all their activities are aimed at supporting those who [are] suffering today. We have united for a common cause. We want peace. […] We hack only those business structures that are directly or indirectly related to politicians, who make important decisions in the international arena. […] Some of our comrades have already died on the battlefield. We will definitely take revenge for them. We will also take revenge on our pseudo-allies who do not keep their word. This statement comes from Qilin’s sole interview, published on June 19, 2024 via WikiLeaksV2, an encrypted dark web portal. Seventeen days earlier, Qilin had gained notoriety across Europe for a ransomware attack on London’s NHS medical services provider, Synnovis. This assault disrupted critical healthcare operations: halting blood transfusions and test results, canceling surgeries, and redirecting emergency patients. The Guardian’s Alex Hern identified Qilin as a Russian-speaking ransomware group whose activity began in October 2022, seven months after Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine. Their rhetoric, evident in the interview, combines themes of national pride, desire for peace, and grievances against untrustworthy politicians. This language aligns closely with Russian peace propaganda, as analyzed by the Polish Institute of International Affairs. On a micro-level, it also mirrors the linguistic patterns of Vladimir Putin’s messaging, such as in his February 2024 interview with Tucker Carlson. Putin’s word cloud with synonyms of ‘peace’ scattered in red (data computed from the transcript) Our investigation of Qilin’s onion-encrypted portal reveals databases dating back to November 6, 2022, containing breached information from Dialog Information Technology, an Australian cyber-services company operating across Brisbane, Sydney, Canberra, Melbourne, Adelaide, Perth and Darwin. As of December 2024, this database has been accessed 257,568 times. The portal also hosts stolen data from Qilin’s London hospital attack—613 gigabytes of personal information—which has been publicly accessible since July 2, 2024, and viewed 8,469 times as of December 2024. From January to November 2024 alone, Qilin breached and published 135 databases, amassing over 32 terabytes of maliciously usable personal data. Targets have ranged from local governments, such as Upper Merion Township in Pennsylvania, USA, to multinational corporations. Yet Qilin represents just the tip of the iceberg. Killnet, another prominent dark web actor, primarily offers DDoS-for-hire services. The group operates under a hierarchical structure with subdivisions such as Legion-Cyber Intelligence, Anonymous Russia, Phoenix, Mirai, Sakurajima, and Zarya. Legion-Cyber Intelligence specializes in intelligence gathering and country-specific targeting, other branches execute DDoS assaults, and the whole group is coordinated under Killnet’s leader, known as Killmilk. In an interview with Lenta, Killmilk claimed his collective comprises approximately 4,500 individuals organized into subgroups that operate semi-independently but occasionally coordinate their activities. Notably, Killmilk attributed an attack on Boeing to collaboration with 280 US-based 'colleagues.' This level of international coordination—where loosely connected groups organize into a functional cluster under one leader and one philosophy—lays the groundwork for eventual collaboration with state entities. Such symbiosis is becoming increasingly common within Russia’s hybrid warfare doctrine. Core Cyberwarfare Operations The People’s Cyber Army (Народная Кибер-Армия) is a hacktivist group specializing in DDoS attacks, similar to Killnet. Researchers from Google-owned cyber-defense firm Mandiant have traced this group back to Sandworm (GRU Unit 74455). Mandiant’s investigation also linked XAKNET, a self-proclaimed hacktivist group of Russian patriotic volunteers, to Russian security services. Evidence suggests that XAKNET may have shared illegally obtained data, similar to Qilin’s dark web leaks, with state-backed entities. Such collaborations have the potential to evolve into cyber-mercenary collectives, serving as proxies to test and breach the digital defenses of Western organizations. This mirrors the model of Prigozhin’s Wagner Group, but on the digital battlefield. People’s Cyber Army and XAKNET represent two facets of a 'gray zone' within Russian cyber operations, where patriotic hackers and cyber specialists either remain loosely affiliated or fully integrated into Kremlin-backed entities. This blending of independent activism and state control exemplifies the hybrid nature of post-2022 Russian cyberwarfare, which maps more and more to Prigozhin’s model. Moving from the Periphery Malware development often serves as an entry point for amateur hackers seeking to join established groups, eventually leading to integration into state-backed entities. Killnet, for instance, employs off-the-shelf open-source tools in distributed ways to achieve massive-scale 2.4 Tbps DDoS attacks. One tool commonly used by Killnet is 'CC-Attack,' a script authored by an unrelated student in 2020 and made available on Killnet’s Telegram channel. This script requires minimal technical expertise, utilizing open proxy servers and other features to amplify attacks. Over time, Killnet has also employed other open-source DDoS scripts, including 'Aura-DDoS,' 'Blood,' 'DDoS Ripper,' 'Golden Eye,' 'Hasoki,' and 'MHDDoS.' On the other hand, Qilin showcases more advanced tactics by developing proprietary tools. Their ransomware, 'Agenda,' was rewritten from Golang to Rust in 2022 for enhanced efficiency. Unlike Killnet’s reliance on external scripts, Qilin actively develops and updates its malware, enabling features like safe mode reboots and server-specific process termination. These distinctions illustrate the progression from peripheral groups utilizing basic tools to advanced actors developing sophisticated, custom malware. This evolution represents the first step in bridging the gap between independent hackers and state-supported cyber entities. The second step requires innovative techniques that go beyond toolkits and demand a level of creativity often absent in amateur operations. One such technique, known as the nearest neighbor attack, was employed by APT28 (GRU Unit 26165) in November 2024. This method consists in first identifying a Wi-Fi network close to the target, in a neighboring building for example, then gaining access into it and identifying a device connected to both the compromised Wi-Fi and the target network at the same time. Through this bridge, the target network is infiltrated and its sensitive data exfiltrated from the servers. In November’s incident, attackers exploited the Wi-Fi of a US company collaborating with Ukraine, using three wireless access points in a neighboring building near the target’s conference room windows. Such techniques highlight the divide between peripheral collaborators and the sophisticated methods employed by official Russian cyber intelligence. The ability to innovate and execute these complex strategies underscores the advanced skills of state-backed entities like APT28. Constellations of Cyberwarfare The Russian cyberwarfare ecosystem is a dynamic and ever-evolving network of actors, ranging from ideologically driven hackers like Qilin to organized syndicates such as Killnet. While some groups operate independently, others maintain direct or indirect links to state entities like the FSB or GRU. One of the Russian bots whose ChatGPT response got disrupted due to expired credits Peripheral groups often act as experimental platforms, employing off-the-shelf tools to conduct ransomware attacks or DDoS campaigns. Their success and innovation can eventually lead to collaboration with Kremlin, blurring the distinction between independent operations and government-coordinated initiatives, like it was with People’s Cyber Army and XAKNET. This fluidity allows the ecosystem to adapt and evolve rapidly, with peripheral groups serving as entry points for novice talent while core entities like Sandworm and APT28 provide advanced operational sophistication and creativity. A critical component of this ecosystem is Russia’s propaganda machine. Evidence suggests that after Prigozhin’s death, his bot networks evolved, becoming AI-powered. Which made them even more pervasive and persistent, with automated responses amplifying their impact. And when AI-powered disinformation is left unregulated and uninterrupted, it not only amplifies propaganda messaging but also reinforces the effectiveness of the entire cyberwarfare ecosystem. Endless Loop As Russia’s cyber operations increasingly integrate peripheral and core actors, they form a functional symbiosis that enhances both scale and technical expertise. This convergence erodes the distinctions between independent hacktivism, criminal syndicates, and state-sponsored entities, creating a seamless and adaptable cyberwarfare ecosystem. It also raises a critical question: Is Russian propaganda as powerful as it appears, or has it evolved into an ideological force that transcends state control? 'They do not know it, but they are doing it.' Philosopher Slavoj Žižek borrowed this quote from Karl Marx’s theory of ideology to transmit a key idea: ideology is not just what we consciously believe, but also what we unknowingly enact or embody through our behavior. One might outwardly reject capitalism but still engage in behaviors that sustain and reproduce it, like consumerism or competition. Similarly, Qilin might proclaim that their activities are aimed at supporting those who is suffering today, yet their actions—such as halting critical surgeries across a European capital of nearly 10 million people—contradict the stated ideals. In the endlessly adaptive ecosystem of Russian cyberwarfare, the fusion of ideology, propaganda, and technology forms a potent force that transcends individual actors. The interplay between peripheral and core entities, amplified by AI-driven disinformation, challenges traditional defense paradigms, demanding a response as dynamic and multifaceted as the threat itself.

Fuera! How Javier Milei Made Argentina Great Again – OpEd	By Andrew Moran Fuera! It has been one year since President Javier Milei arrived, raised hell, and made Argentina great again. It took a single word – the Spanish translation is 'out' – to transform the dying South American nation that had been crippled by the shackles of socialism and enslaved by the gluttony of political greed. Milei shocked the system with his victory but also proved to the world that freedom and free markets can cure the destitution and despair of socialism. But while the libertarian chainsaw massacre in Buenos Aires is proving to be a success domestically, the United States could import Milei’s ideas and apply them to the federal budget. Javier Milei: One Year Later Argentina’s primary ailment for years had been hyperinflation (211% in 2023) resulting from government largesse, bureaucratic waste, astronomical money printing, and political abuse. While the elites dined in decadence and danced at the ball of Marxism, the country suffered under the boot of the Fernandez-Kirchner regime. The Argentine peso lost most of its value, food prices and rent costs spiraled out of control, shortages were prevalent, and the private sector had been forsaken to prop up the government sector. Equipped with a chainsaw, proficient knowledge of Austrian and Chicago economics, and a personality and hairdo matched by only President-elect Donald Trump, Javier Milei took Argentina – and the rest of the world – by storm. Milei and his La Libertad Avanza government took the nation from catastrophe to renaissance in just one year. After immediately taking office, his team starved the beast by employing austerity measures: firing thousands of government workers, eradicating price controls, freezing wages and pensions, cutting government subsidies, and suspending public infrastructure endeavors. As months passed, he halted money-supply expansion and shut down various departments and agencies, including Argentina’s version of the IRS, which was unsurprising as he stood before a list of ministries and yelled, 'Fuera!' Here is a list of results so far: Inflation plummeted from 25.5% in December 2023 to a three-year low of 2.7% in October. Argentina exchange-traded funds (ETFs) have garnered record inflows. Government bonds are up 151% over the last 12 months. Housing supply has increased, and rents have plummeted. The first budget surplus in 123 years. Milei is far from finished. In the year ahead, at least on the economics front, Milei has proposed cutting federal taxes by 90%, introducing a US dollar de facto standard, allowing free competition of currencies, deregulating the marketplace, slashing tariffs, and embracing nuclear power and artificial intelligence. Even if he struggles to fulfill the zenith of his 2023 campaign – shutting down the central bank – the rest of Milei’s actions will have been enough to resuscitate the old adage of 'rich as an Argentine.' Earlier this month, the Conservative Political Action Conference, also known as CPAC, hosted a program in Buenos Aires, with Milei delivering the keynote address. Unsurprisingly, he celebrated Trump, slammed socialism, and pledged to continue his fight against the woke globalists. 'Everyone assumed that we were going to fail politically,' Milei said. 'Today, they admit, through gritted teeth, that they are surprised.' A DOGE Blueprint Is Javier Milei’s form of governing a blueprint for the incoming administration and the Department of Government Efficiency, better known as DOGE? This is the word on Main Street and Wall Street. Indeed, fiscal conservatives and libertarians hope that the Elon Musk-Vivek Ramaswamy tag team can achieve the objective of slashing $2 trillion from the federal budget. While this is a lofty aim, it might be easier said than done, especially for an economy and a dollar hegemony that survives and thrives on the trillions in annual taxpayer dollars wasted. Because of the political implications, reforming the entitlement system, from Social Security to Medicare, is almost impossible. Believe it or not, federal spending is a key contributor to economic growth. The annual budget, exceeding $7 trillion this fiscal year, represents about a quarter of the national economy. Outlays contribute as much as one-third to the GDP. Wasting taxpayer resources on shoes for Ethiopians and drag queen shows in Latin America allows the government to ship dollars to foreign markets and export inflation. Let’s face it: The United States has a stranglehold on the planet. If it sneezes, everyone else catches influenza. Argentina can institute successful and necessary reforms because it is not the world’s largest and most powerful economy with a current backed by military might. The status quo is critical for the US – and the bureaucratic industrial complex – to persist. America desperately needs to implement the prescriptions and panaceas of fuera, but the public must be prepared for an avalanche of temporary discomfort if they are ever enacted.

Czech Republic Faces An Uncertain Political Future – Analysis	By Robert Beck (FPRI) -- Following underwhelming provincial and senatorial elections in the fall of 2024, the Czech Republic prepares to enter the critical year of 2025 with a divided electorate, an unpopular and shrinking coalition government, and a resurgent populist opposition. Facing an unsettled European geopolitical landscape on the horizon as a result of Donald Trump’s reelection in America, the current center-right, pro-western Czech coalition will be severely tested in parliamentary elections, scheduled for no later than October 2025. Regional and Senatorial Polls: Did Anybody Win? In the September polls in the Czech Republic, leadership positions in all thirteen of the country’s regions (Kraj), as well as twenty-seven of the upper house of parliament’s senate seats, were up for grabs. While by sheer numbers the main Czech opposition party, ANO, (Czech: Akce nespokojených občanů: action of dissatisfied citizens) appears to have won the recent elections, the actual results merit a more nuanced interpretation. At the regional level, the party of former Prime Minister Andrej Babiš won, according to Radio Prague International, by a landslide victory, securing control of ten of the nation’s thirteen regions. Only regions in South Moravia, Liberec, and South Bohemia resisted the apparent ANO wave. For his part, opposition leader Babiš considered the results of the regional polls a great victory for the party and a function of ANO’s extremely active efforts in opposition to the ruling SPOLU (Czech: together) coalition. What was not highlighted as the dust settled from the regional vote was the fact that participation was abysmally low with only 32.91% of registered voters participating. That represents the worst showing in a Czech regional election since 2004. As a comparison, the most recent general parliamentary polls in 2021 saw nearly 66% voter participation. Moreover, during the previous regional elections in 2020, ANO also won a plurality of votes in ten of the country’s regions. That result did not translate to victory for the group the following year in parliamentary elections. Consequently, though Babiš and ANO clearly were victorious, their victory fell far short of a full-throated mandate for change. Meanwhile, the Senate results were equally muddled for Babiš and his populist opposition. Although ANO’s haul of eight seats out of twenty-seven contested represents the best ever showing in the upper house for the party, the ruling SPOLU coalition took fifteen of the seats. The final tally in the eighty-one-seat body shows the governing coalition with sixty-five seats and Babiš’s party controlling a paltry twelve seats. Furthermore, like the aforementioned regional elections, woefully low turnout for the senatorial polls highlighted the depths of Czech apathy toward this ballot. Consequently, though ANO could claim progress in increasing the party’s share of senatorial seats, it would be naive to consider the results a populist political wave. Shrinking Coalition Nevertheless, the news was not particularly reassuring either for the governing coalition as the recent elections caused the withdrawal of the Pirates party (Czech: Pirátská strana), one of its five founding members. The lamentable showing by the Pirates in both the European Parliament elections in June 2024 and the Czech regional elections precipitated a showdown between Prime Minister Fiala and the leader of the Pirates, Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Regional Development Ivan Bartoš. The main trigger for the internal SPOLU acrimony was the failure of Bartoš and his ministry to implement a promised digitized system for issuing building permits. The dispute came to a head shortly after the election as the prime minister dismissed Bartoš from his post on September 24, 2024, triggering the Pirates’ withdrawal from the governing coalition. The party had two other ministers in the cabinet, one of whom, Foreign Minister Jan Lipavský, resigned from the Pirates and stayed on with the coalition. The result of the political falling out reduced the coalition’s majority in parliament to 104 seats out of 200. Moreover, the remnants of the Pirates are now firmly ensconced in the country’s opposition, leaving only four parties—the Civic Democrats (ODS), the Christian Democrats (KDU-ČSL), TOP-09, and the centrist STAN movement—to fend off the ANO-led populist movement. Changing Security Landscape The setting for this Czech political drama leading into the critical election year of 2025 is a dangerous European security situation highlighted by the potential reverberations of the reelection of Donald Trump as president of the United States. The Czechs, under the heretofore strong foreign policy focus of the SPOLU coalition, have been at the forefront of EU and North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) efforts to supply arms to Ukraine. While these efforts have burnished the Czechs’ image in Brussels and Mons, they have contributed to deep disputes between Prague and Visegrad Four (V4) member states Hungary and Slovakia over the war in Ukraine, in the process rendering that previously proud grouping of states obsolete. Given the growing clamor across the continent, with Hungary and Slovakia in the lead, for a negotiated settlement to end the conflagration on the EU’s eastern flank, so-called peace parties across the region will be emboldened to capitalize on the swelling war fatigue. This will undoubtedly present a significant electoral challenge to the SPOLU coalition in the 2025 elections as Andrej Babiš and his ANO colleagues have consistently pined for peace in Ukraine. In fact, during the 2023 Czech plebiscite for president, Babiš continually painted his main rival, eventual winner Petr Pavel, as a warmonger. The strategy backfired badly on the ANO leader at that time. A similar tact may prove more efficacious in the upcoming polls. At the time of this writing (December 1, 2024), it is still unclear exactly how Donald Trump’s return to the White House will influence the war in Ukraine. However, should the new president succeed in pushing for a swift negotiated settlement to end the fighting, the SPOLU coalition will lose one of its primary foreign policy successes—staunch support to Ukraine—with which to campaign. Under this scenario, ANO and its potential future ruling partners, the right-wing SPD party (Czech: Svoboda a přímá demokracie: freedom and direct democracy) would likely fare well with an electorate frustrated with painful financial and social reforms pursued by the SPOLU coalition during its rule. Bleak Prospects for Governing Coalition As the election year of 2025 approaches, the Czech Republic faces an uncertain future with a possible return to power by Andrej Babiš and his ANO movement. In fact, according to polling in October of 2024, an ANO/SPD coalition is projected to control 111 of the 200 seats in the Czech parliament, a considerably stronger majority than the current SPOLU government currently enjoys. Indicative of a growing and troubling fondness among the Czech populace in an erstwhile, romanticized past, a public opinion poll conducted during the summer of 2024 by the Public Opinion Research Center of the Czech Academy of Sciences revealed some disturbing numbers. Less than half of the respondents felt that current conditions in the country are better than before the revolution in November of 1989. Furthermore, more than half of those polled opined that, in the realm of social security and public safety, life was better before the revolution. Against this backdrop of withering Czech public confidence in the country’s liberal-democratic future, populists on the left (ANO) and right (SPD) smell blood in the political waters. Highlighting this point, opposition leader Babiš publicly and loudly questioned the mental health of Prime Minister Fiala in parliament on November 22, 2024 in response to Fiala’s earlier remarks about the Czech Republic’s goal of achieving the same average wage as Germany within five years. Coming on the heels of a cantankerous debate in the legislature on a potential that SPOLU supports and the opposition vehemently rejects, the seeds are being sown for a likely change of government in Prague in late 2025. The Visegrád One? With Hungary and Slovakia firmly in the 'illiberal democracy' camp, the return of populist rule in Prague would represent a trifecta in Central Europe for the anti-EU, soft-on-Russia crowd. It would also reduce the formerly pro-Western, Russophobic Visegrád Four to a minority of one, Poland. The consequences of that eventuality for those inhabiting the geopolitical interstices between Germany and Russia are hard to predict but would likely be welcomed more in Moscow than in Brussels. It is not lost on many observers of the region that a mere thirty-five years after the Iron Curtain fell in a paroxysmal eruption of democratic demonstrations, the Czechs are poised to join their Slovak and Hungarian counterparts in hedging their bets on the West and gazing sentimentally to the East.

Myanmar’s Min Aung Hlaing Struggles For Political Longevity – Ana...	By Naing Min Khant After four years of postponing general elections, Myanmar’s junta chief Min Aung Hlaing now appears to have picked up a new sense of urgency to move forward with them in 2025 — likely as a personal survival measure. While much of the international community focuses on diplomatic pressure and external legitimacy, the real game-changer lies within Myanmar’s military itself. Min Aung Hlaing cannot rely solely on the military to secure his political survival. Its recent battlefield humiliations, ideological failures and breakdown of hierarchical discipline indicate that the junta chief faces significant risk of challenges from particular factions from within the armed forces whose loyalty to him is waning — even though top generals affect unity. To reduce his dependence on the military, Min Aung Hlaing is seeking to build outside political support, especially with the Union Solidarity and Development Party (USDP), its alliance partners and other parties that accept his transition agenda. He has put his two trusted retired generals, Lieutenant General Myo Zaw Thein and Lieutenant General Aung Soe, into important positions in the USDP. Hierarchical discipline, ideological success and formidable strength are crucial for the stability of authoritarian regimes. A highly institutionalised military has a disciplined hierarchy, merit-based promotions and autonomy from the leader, ensuring it operates cohesively and efficiently to support the regime. This unity makes the military less prone to internal challenges or coups. In contrast, a non-institutionalised military is fragmented, lacks cohesion and depends on the commander-in-chief, making it vulnerable to infighting and division. Such instability increases the risk of challenges to the leader’s authority, forcing the leader to seek alternative sources of power to secure their survival, as the military alone cannot guarantee regime stability. Successive junta chiefs of Myanmar’s military have urged soldiers to unite around the belief that the military is the sole guardian and protector of the state, race and Buddhism. They claim that without the military, the country would fall into chaos. But the widespread atrocities, oppression and killings of innocent civilians after the military coup have led to shame and disillusionment within the ranks, contradicting the military’s narrative as the nation’s protector. These actions have exposed a deep ideological failure, shaking the conviction that the military acts in the country’s best interest and should remain unified. Trust in Buddhist institutions and famous monks — close allies of the junta’s chief — has also declined within the military and among the public. Many soldiers who once believed in the military’s mission now see it as morally indefensible, leading to defections and desertions. This trend highlights the military’s crumbling ideological foundation and inability to maintain internal loyalty. The notion of the military as a formidable force has also been undermined by a series of humiliating events, notably Operation 1027. This coordinated offensive by the Three Brotherhood Alliance, comprising three ethnic armed groups, led to the loss of control over several towns — a severe blow to the military’s reputation. The operation captured more than 160 strategic military positions, including combat battalions, the Lukkaing Regional Operation Command, two Military Operation Commands and even the North Eastern Military Command. These unprecedented defeats have damaged the image of the military as a cohesive and formidable force and shaken soldiers’ confidence in their leadership. The ultimate destabilising factor contributing to the sense of urgency is the commander-in-chief’s seemingly random promotions, dismissals, transfers and even arrests. The Myanmar military now lacks a clear path to merit-based promotions. As leader, Min Aung Hlaing has complete control over making and breaking military careers. The junta chief has sidelined traditional military protocols to favour personal loyalty, leading to erratic promotions and demotions. For example, Min Aung Hlaing granted significant power to the Chief of Military Security Affairs, General Ye Win Oo, despite his limited combat experience. In contrast, General Mya Tun Oo, a senior and experienced officer, was stripped of his position as the Joint Chief of Staff (Army, Navy, Air Force), the military’s third-highest rank. Mya Tun Oo had served in various command roles and had rare experience overseeing both combat forces and intelligence units. Yet he was demoted and reassigned as Minister of Transportation — a civilian role without command over military forces. These unpredictable promotions and demotions underscore the erosion of a disciplined chain of command within the military. Even high-ranking figures like Vice Senior General Soe Win, the Deputy Commander-in-Chief, lack true autonomy as all major decisions remain under Min Aung Hlaing. The military’s growing weaknesses have shattered its cohesion and effectiveness, undermining Min Aung Hlaing’s ability to rely solely on it for political survival. With growing desperation to diversify his power base and secure survival, Min Aung Hlaing has been forced to seek political support outside the military.

The US Is Now On Track For A $3.5 Trillion Deficit In 2025 – OpEd	By Ryan McMaken According to the latest monthly statement from the Treasury Department, the US government spent $668 billion in November, the second month of the 2025 fiscal year. That’s in addition to October’s spending total of $584 billion, for a total of $1.25 trillion in spending so far this year. All that spending is a drain on the real economy. But it gets worse: the federal government has only collected $628 billion in revenue for the same period, meaning the two-month total deficit is now as $624 billion. That’s the largest total ever for the first two months of the fiscal year, higher even than the $429 billion spent during the first two months of the 2021 fiscal year—October and November 2020. It should not surprise us, then, that the federal government is now on track to have the largest peacetime deficit of all time during the 2025 fiscal year. With the two-month total at over $620 billion, the year-end total is likely to be over $3.5 trillion by the end of the year. That would make the next annual deficit even larger than 2020’s budget busting deficit of 2020 when the covid panic fueled months of runaway spending. Unfortunately, there is no reason to expect any change to the current trend. In spite of much talk about the so-called 'Department of Government Efficiency' (DOGE) leading to big budget cuts, there is virtually no chance of any sizable cuts to spending in the current political climate. The budget process is dominated by the Congress—as is constitutionally required—and recommendations from the executive branch are generally DOA when they reach Congress. Moreover, the first Trump administration was notable for very large increases in spending, not for 'efficiency.' The first Trump administration, for example, rung up a 2019 deficit of nearly one trillion, making it the largest deficit ever seen during a period that was neither recessionary nor wartime. Trump than signed off on the mega-deficit of 3.1 trillion during the 2020 fiscal year. Clearly, fiscal austerity and Donald Trump have not been spotted together very often. Indeed, if the new Trump administration is going to make any sizable cuts, it will have to push Congress hard to send him a budget with big cuts. Where will Congress make these cuts? The overwhelming majority of federal spending is in three areas. The first is non-discretionary social benefits like Social Security and Medicaid. The second is defense spending. The third is interest on the national debt. It’s clear that Congress won’t be formally repudiating the debt, so those interest payments aren’t going anywhere. So, is there any public support for cutting federal pensions or military spending? Certainly not. Even as federal deficits have rapidly risen to new heights in recent years, poll after poll has shown the public wants more federal spending, not less. In a 2023 poll by the AP, a majority of those polled said they wanted less spending in a generic question about spending overall. But when it came down to specifics, majorities called for more government spending in education, healthcare, Social Security, Medicare, and border security. Only 29 percent of those polled said they wanted cuts to military spending. So, where would a sitting member of Congress think it is safe to vote to cut hundreds of billions—if not trillions—of dollars from the federal budget? It’s hard to imagine. If we’re going to be realistic, we just have to admit that big budget cuts will remain politically unfeasible until the public starts to see the light on the reality of runaway federal debt and federal deficits. That will only come when austerity is forced on us by an ever-growing debt burden in the form of interest on the debt. That will both force up interest rates and eat up ever larger portions of the federal budget forcing cuts to popular programs. Meanwhile, the central bank will try to force interest rates back down, but that will require 'printing' money and that will mean more price inflation. In short, our current debt trajectory will require the federal government to funnel more and more taxpayer wealth to paying interest or managing interest rates as the Treasury tries to sell ever larger piles of government bonds. Only after the public begins to understand how this process of impoverishment works will the public begin to actually tolerate sizable budget cuts. Not before. So, until then, we can expect a lot of talk, but no action, when it comes to budget cuts. In the meantime, we’ll hear a lot from politicians about how they’re trying really hard to be fiscally responsible. They don’t actually care, but pretending to care about deficits has long been a performative ritual that politicians participate in. This was on display this week when Treasury secretary Janet Yellen said she’s 'sorry' that 'more progress' wasn’t made in bringing deficits under control during the Biden administration. 'Well, I am concerned about fiscal sustainability, and I am sorry that we haven’t made more progress. I believe that the deficit needs to be brought down, especially now that we’re in an environment of higher interest rates,' Yellen said. Yellen, of course, was directly responsible for helping facilitate enormous deficits and the rising national debt during her time as chairman of the Federal Reserve. As deficits rose, Yellen enthusiastically cooperated with the Treasury to keep interest rates low to make it seem that borrowing a half-trillion dollars (or more) each year was virtually free. Yellen, unlike Jerome Powell, was lucky enough to be the Fed chairman during a period when that actually worked. It appears, however, that the era of ultra-low interest rates has come to an end, and we are now in, as Yellen notes, 'an environment of higher interest rates.' This is, in part, itself a result of rising debt and deficits because the Treasury can only dump so much new debt on the market without investors demanding rising interest rates. Normally, the Fed would intervene to force interest rates back down to rock-bottom levels by buying up more federal bonds. But, stubborn price inflation is now tying the Fed’s hands. Thus, we’ve seen longer-term yields rise even as the Fed has been reducing its target interest rate. Thursday, in fact, the 10-year yield was ripping most of the day, and rose to a three-week high following news that price inflation still isn’t going away. We have good reason to expect this trend to continue, and the consumers and taxpayers will feel it. Huge deficits will mean higher interest rates, and that will drive more bankruptcies as consumer and business debt becomes less and less manageable. Meanwhile, the Fed won’t be able to really rein in price inflation because that would require allowing interest rates to rise to a level that would be unsustainable in terms of federal debt service. It remains to be seen how long it will take for the public to see how it’s being ripped off by this endless cycle of debt and price inflation. Until then, don’t expect any public chorus in favor of fiscal sanity.

Bangladesh’s Perilous Gamble: Risking Stability In The Bay Of Ben...	The Bay of Bengal, a critical maritime hub at the intersection of South and Southeast Asia, is emerging as a theatre of strategic competition. Facilitating nearly a quarter of global trade, its waters serve as the lifeline for regional economies and a gateway for energy security. This maritime domain necessitates collaboration over conflict for India and Bangladesh, whose histories and geographies are deeply intertwined. However, Dhaka's recent political posturing and growing anti-India sentiment threaten this delicate balance, risking bilateral ties and the region's stability at its own peril. The Strategic Heart of the Bay of Bengal The Bay of Bengal is not merely a body of water but the linchpin of South Asia's connectivity and prosperity. It connects the Indian Ocean to the Pacific through the Malacca Strait, making it a critical maritime choke point. The region's fisheries, hydrocarbons, and mineral wealth further enhance its strategic and economic significance. India has long recognised the importance of the Bay of Bengal, spearheading initiatives such as BIMSTEC (Bay of Bengal Initiative for Multi-Sectoral Technical and Economic Cooperation) to promote regional stability. For Bangladesh, a growing economy with ambitious development goals, maintaining peace and security in these waters is equally vital. Yet, the widening political rift compromises Dhaka's ability to address its maritime challenges, ranging from piracy to illegal fishing and environmental degradation, among other security threats. India's Naval Transformation India's maritime evolution since 1971, when it played a pivotal role in Bangladesh's independence, is a testament to its rise as a resident power. The Indian Navy, once in its infancy, now stands as one of the world's most advanced maritime forces. It operates a fleet of approximately 150 ships and submarines, including two aircraft carriers, INS Vikramaditya and the indigenously designed INS Vikrant, each displacing around 45,000 tonnes. Its submarine fleet features nuclear-powered ballistic missile submarines (SSBNs) like the Arihant class and advanced diesel-electric attack submarines like the Kalvari class. Modern destroyers and frigates, equipped with cutting-edge weaponry, further bolster its capabilities. This growth reflects India's commitment to self-reliance, with most current shipbuilding projects undertaken domestically. The Indian Navy's doctrine emphasises its role as a net security provider in the Indian Ocean Region (IOR), evidenced by its anti-piracy missions, humanitarian assistance, and disaster relief (HADR) operations. With ambitions to expand its fleet to around 200 ships by 2035, India's maritime power projection ensures stability in the Bay of Bengal and beyond. Bangladesh's Naval Constraints In stark contrast, Bangladesh's navy remains a modest coastal force. While recent acquisitions, including two submarines from China, signal an attempt to enhance capabilities, these assets need more sophistication and operational independence for blue-water operations. The reliance on Chinese equipment raises concerns about Dhaka's strategic autonomy, given Beijing's vested interests in the region through its Belt and Road Initiative (BRI). Bangladesh's naval limitations impede its ability to tackle pressing maritime challenges such as piracy, illegal fishing, and boundary disputes. This shortfall undermines its economic interests, leaving it vulnerable to external pressures in a contested maritime space. Political Strains and Strategic Fallout Anti-India sentiment in Bangladesh's political discourse has exacerbated bilateral tensions. Once grounded in mutual respect and cooperation, the relationship now faces strain, jeopardising critical regional initiatives like BIMSTEC and BBIN (Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Nepal Initiative). For India, Dhaka's drift can be seen as a breach of its strategic interests in the Bay of Bengal. New Delhi's maritime posturing is expected to be more terse should the situation persist. Risks to Regional Stability The Bay of Bengal's strategic importance has not gone unnoticed by global powers. The United States and China are increasingly active in the region, their competition adding complexity to an already volatile security environment. Bangladesh's strategic promiscuity could unnecessarily amplify these tensions, destabilising a region already grappling with a host of maritime security challenges. For Bangladesh, the risks of isolation are particularly severe. Without India's support, Dhaka will struggle to address transnational challenges, from maritime security to climate resilience. This scenario would hinder Bangladesh's aspirations and erode the cooperative frameworks vital for regional stability. The Path to Collaboration To avert these risks, Bangladesh must recalibrate its approach to India. Alienating a neighbour with such overwhelming maritime and economic influence is a perilous gamble. Joint naval exercises, coordinated responses to maritime threats, and collaborative economic initiatives offer a pathway to rebuilding trust. For India, extending an olive branch through constructive engagement rather than punitive measures would secure its long-term strategic interests. A stable and cooperative Bay of Bengal is crucial for India's regional economic integration and security vision. A Need to Course Correct As the Bay of Bengal assumes greater prominence in South and Southeast Asia's geopolitical landscape, India and Bangladesh cannot afford to let political discord undermine their shared maritime interests. For Dhaka, aligning more closely with India offers security and the economic and strategic benefits essential for its development. For India, fostering a stable neighbourhood reinforces its role as a net security provider and a regional leader. The stakes for the Bengali nation are too high for confrontation. By embracing collaboration, India and Bangladesh can transform the Bay of Bengal into a beacon of regional prosperity and stability rather than a battleground for competing interests.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWemAQr5P7Qc6RTLGxm2h2nz	2024-12-14T16:06:11-08:00	
The New ‘Nonprofit Killer’ Bill And The Problem Of Government Cer...	By Peter Jacobsen The US House of Representatives just passed H.R. 9495, the Stop Terror-Financing and Tax Penalties on American Hostages Act. As with most federal bills, the name is pretty sympathetic. Who doesn’t want to stop the funding of terrorism? It also contains two related, but very different, proposals. According to Congress’s official website: This bill postpones certain tax filing deadlines for U.S. nationals who are unlawfully or wrongfully detained abroad or held hostage abroad and their spouses. It also allows for a refund and abatement of tax penalties and fines paid by hostages, detained individuals, and their spouses or dependents. The bill terminates the tax-exempt status of terrorist supporting organizations. Interesting what a pivot we take in the last sentence there. The first part of the bill seems like a great idea. It’s shocking that our system doesn’t already have a mechanism for waiving late tax payments for people held hostage by terrorists. But then, we tack on one more thing—no more tax-exempt status of terrorist-supporting organizations. This part of the bill has earned it a nickname: the 'nonprofit killer.' This seems like two totally different things attached by a staple. This is likely intentional and is a classic strategy in modern American politics. By lumping these two things together, representatives can use the hostage income tax abatement part of the bill to explain why they voted for it. One way to think about this is that supporters of the second part of the bill are getting politicians who are on the bubble to vote for the bill by giving them something they like in return (the hostage tax abatement). Economists call this logrolling. But what about the second part of the bill? What’s controversial about removing tax-exempt status from organizations that support terrorism? Taxing Terror? The problem with this bill is that it is a perfect example of giving undue discretion to bureaucrats. That’s an issue, because government agents are often far less angelic than we’d like them to be. David Hume once summarized the state of political philosophy by saying that from the perspective of political analysis, 'every man ought to be supposed a knave, and to have no other end, in all his actions, than private interest.' In other words, we should assume that people are narrowly selfish and not beneficent, and we should build a political system based on those assumptions. Why be so pessimistic? Well, if we make a system that assumes everyone will be a knave, we can withstand it when knaves rise to power. If we make a system that assumes that our leaders are omnibenevolent geniuses, the system is likely to fall apart. So, what would knaves do if we passed a bill removing tax-exempt status from organizations that support terrorists? I think they would use this legislation as a way to target their ideological enemies. Specifically, they would accuse organizations they don’t like of supporting terrorism in an attempt to get the tax-exempt status of those organizations removed. It wasn’t long ago that candidate Trump faced an onslaught of accusations that he had enabled or even promoted domestic terrorism in the 2020 transition. Had HR 9495 been the law of the land during the campaign, it’s not hard to imagine his opposition targeting the nonprofit status of Trump-supporting organizations, including PACs, using this law. If this sounds far-fetched, it shouldn’t. Recent history vindicates this fear. FEMA recently got in hot water when it was uncovered that some of their agents intentionally avoided providing relief to the residents of homes displaying pro-Trump campaign signs. Some might argue that this was just a rogue employee, but there are two issues with this. First, what’s to stop a rogue employee of another government agency from targeting Trump organizations with this bill? Second, it’s still unclear to what extent this problem was systemic. We even have precedent that the IRS abuses its power in a politically partisan way. During the Obama administration, Tea Party-linked organizations were excessively scrutinized, and the IRS has since apologized for these decisions. This issue is particularly salient with respect to foreign policy. Foreign policy hawks often slander supporters of peace with claims that they sympathize with the other side. How can we trust politicians to apply these standards fairly when major party representatives like Hillary Clinton suggest that US veteran and politician Tulsi Gabbard is a Russian agent? Gatekeepers of Legitimacy This leaves us with a tough question: Does this mean we can’t do anything to combat bad organizations? No. Individuals can still exercise moral responsibility and withhold their funds from unethical organizations, regardless of what the rules are for 501(c)3. However, a problem arises when the government gets into the sphere of determining which organizations are worthy of being tax-free. When we allow that to happen, we implicitly accept that they are the rightful gatekeepers of legitimacy. But this point raises an even more fundamental conversation: Why do we need to grant organizations special tax-exempt status from the top down at all? Why tax organizations? In reality, it’s impossible for a tax burden to fall on an abstract entity like a business or organization. At the end of the day, every tax is paid for by people. When the government taxes businesses and organizations, they are essentially engaging in what’s called double taxation. The income for the organization is taxed, but, then, the remaining money is distributed among the workers, owners, and suppliers, and this income is also taxed. In theory, tax rates on individuals could be adjusted such that no organization is taxed but individuals end up with the same amount of money as they would have had under the current double taxation setup. Why do things this way then? Why tax people through something called an organization? The cynical answer is that it’s easier politically for politicians to tax organizations, because people are less likely to sympathize with organizations than with people. Have you ever met a rich corporation? Is the rich corporation in the room with us right now? It would be less popular for politicians to say, 'We’re going to tax your 401k if you hold stock in big corporations,' or, 'We’re going to increase the taxes of workers in this big corporation.' You can make an argument that certain organizational efficiencies may make the organization itself technically more efficient at handling these tax burdens, for example, so there are some good arguments for this mechanism. However, it’s important to recognize the downside of our current system. When organizations are taxed and the government gets to decide which ones get tax-exempt status, politicians have an incentive to modify rules to damage organizations which harm their interests. H.R. 9495, if it passes the Senate, stands to make this problem a lot worse. About the author: Peter Jacobsen is a Writing Fellow at the Foundation for Economic Education.

In Desperation Over Syria, Khamenei Revisits The Bombing Of Samar...	Iranian regime supreme leader Ali Khamenei, in his speech following the fall of the despised Assad dictatorship and the loss of four decades of investment in Syria, attempted to justify this defeat by repeating his claim about 'protecting the sanctity of holy shrines.' He said: 'Our forces were present in both Iraq and Syria for two reasons: one was to protect the sanctity of the holy shrines. In Samarra, you witnessed that with the help of the Americans, they destroyed and demolished the sacred dome of Samarra.' It is no secret that the bombing of the Shia Imams’ shrines in Samarra, which led to a horrific sectarian war across Iraq, was carried out under the direct orders of Khamenei. Today, even regime supporters acknowledge that the purpose of this bombing was to create religious divisions in Iraq and advance terrorist and war-mongering objectives. They also react to the claim of protecting holy sites. At the annual rally of the Iranian Resistance in Paris in June 2013, General George Casey, former commander of the coalition forces in Iraq, said 'We didn’t really begin to see the full impact of Iran’s influence until after the bombing of the al-Askari Mosque in Samarra in February of 2006… By mid-2006, there was no doubt that Iran was providing weapons and equipment to terrorist organizations inside Iraq.' The statements of the highest-ranking coalition forces official regarding the Iranian regime’s involvement in the Samarra shrine bombing sparked a massive wave of anger and hatred among the Iraqi people and nationalist forces. Many people, along with religious and political leaders, tribal sheikhs, and Friday prayer leaders, staged sit-ins in city squares, citing General Casey’s remarks and demanding that the case of this crime and its perpetrators be submitted to international courts. The spokesperson for the protesters in Samarra’s Al-Haq Square said: 'Regarding the bombing of the sacred shrines of the Askari Imams by agents of the Iranian regime, we will file complaints with international courts against the Quds Force. Today, the truth has become clear, the game has been exposed, and the hand of the Iranian regime has been revealed. By God, Bashar [al-Assad] will fall by the grace of God, and there will be an end to the Iranian regime, its cronies, and its influence.' Talal Al-Zobaie, a member of the Iraqi parliament, said, 'Casey’s statements refuted all the false accusations Maliki had made against the Iraqi people, and it is clear evidence that the Iranian regime, specifically the Quds Force and the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), are involved in shedding Iraqi blood' (Al-Taghier TV, June 28, 2013). According to Al-Zaman newspaper on June 27, 2013, Wahda Al-Jumaili, a member of the Iraqi parliament, stated that General George Casey’s remarks, the former commander of U.S. forces in Iraq, indicating that the Iranian regime was responsible for the bombing of the shrines in Samarra in 2006, serve as evidence of the regime’s involvement in Iraq. These statements are an important document that will be recorded as a historical testimony and will hold the Iranian regime accountable in international courts. The scandal of such terrorist interventions by the Iranian regime was so evident that, according to a report by Al-Taghier TV in June 2013, a year before the 2006 bombing of the shrines in Samarra, Hazem Al-Shaalan, the then Minister of Defense, had informed a delegation from Samarra that the Iranian regime had spent over $30 million to carry out the shrine bombings, aiming to reap the benefits of a sectarian war from this act. The fact that Khamenei resorts to reopening another case about the bombing of the shrines in Samarra to conceal the disgrace and defeat in Syria reflects his desperation in the current situation.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWemAQr5P7Qc6RdQg8neiB2t	2024-12-14T16:01:51-08:00	
What A Ukraine Peace Plan Could Look Like – Analysis	By Mike Eckel (RFE/RL) -- Behind closed doors in Moscow, Kyiv, Brussels, Washington, and other capitals, diplomats, elected leaders, and military officers are gearing up for what will likely be a full-court press to find a resolution to Europe's largest land war since World War II. On the battlefield, momentum has shifted decisively toward Russia, its forces grinding down Ukrainian troops across the 1,100-kilometer front line. It's pummeling Ukraine's energy infrastructure, trying to black out and freeze an exhausted population. In Western negotiating rooms, sentiment has shifted decisively toward a push to resolve a conflict that has killed or wounded more than 1 million men on both sides over 34 months and counting. Nowhere else is the shift more apparent than in the election of Donald Trump who, even before his inauguration in January as the next U.S. president, has insisted he will find a way to end the fighting 'within 24 hours.' 'There's a lot of talk, a lot of noise that some peace talks are imminent,' Rosa Balfour, director of Carnegie Europe, a Brussels-based think tank, said on December 12. 'We don't really have a plan. Nobody seems to have a plan yet. And of course, the situation on the ground is not in favor of Ukraine at the moment, so it's a very difficult moment.' Here's what we know about the ideas under discussion, for a cease-fire or otherwise. Blood And Treasure European and U.S. officials this week took up active discussion about whether Western troops could be sent to Ukraine as peacekeepers, once the shooting stops and a cease-fire or armistice is in place. French President Emmanuel Macron reportedly floated the idea of 40,000 troops being deployed to Ukraine, and he traveled to Warsaw to discuss the idea with Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk on December 12. At a news conference after the meeting, Tusk told reporters that Poland did not intend to send troops to Ukraine, and he said Warsaw would not be forced into doing so. The proposal for Western peacekeepers also came up five days earlier in Paris, when Macron hosted a meeting that included Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy. According to The Wall Street Journal, Trump, who has repeatedly said Europeans should take a more active role in supporting and defending Ukraine, said that he wanted European soldiers on the ground to monitor any cease-fire. Trump does not want U.S. troops involved, the Journal reported, though he backs some sort of U.S. support for the effort. Ukraine's leadership, which released a five-point Victory Plan in October, supports Western peacekeepers. But there's little incentive for Moscow to agree, says Oleksandr Khara, a former Ukrainian diplomat. 'Of course, it's good that they're talking about this, but…there's no basis for the beginning of peace talks to begin,' Khara, now an expert at the Kyiv-based Center for Defense Strategies, told Current Time. 'Since Russia believes that it can still break Ukraine, and the West has wavered, and Trump is going to put pressure on Ukraine and stop supplying weapons and other aid, why then sit down at the negotiating table when it's possible to seize more Ukrainian territory, kill more Ukrainians, and, in fact...show that there's no point in [arguing] with Russia?' he said. North Atlantic Allies One of the Kremlin's original grievances in justifying its February 2022 invasion continues to be one of Kyiv's central demands: NATO membership. As recently as December 9, Zelenskiy repeated his insistence that membership was paramount.But many NATO members are cool to the idea of Ukraine's membership. At a summit in 2008, U.S. and European leaders hashed out a weak compromise that pledged eventual membership but didn't actually set up a road map. Some officials and experts have argued that was a mistake that led to Russia's 2022 invasion. Since the invasion, NATO has expanded, admitting Sweden and Finland. But admitting Ukraine at present would mean admitting a battered, exhausted country partially occupied by a foreign power, problematic to many alliance members.The United States is also cool to the idea. In Paris this week, Trump reportedly told Macron and Zelenskiy he didn't support Kyiv's membership bid, according to the Journal. Deferring membership is 'capitulation to Russian demands, and this will be a massive win for Putin,' Mick Ryan, a retired Australian major general, wrote in a blog post. 'This will justify in the minds of Putin, and authoritarians like him, that the Russian aggression against Ukraine has worked because keeping Ukraine out of NATO was a core demand of Putin before the war.' Buffer Zones Barring some unforeseen event, Ukraine is all but certain to lose territory to Russia, which currently occupies around 20 percent of Ukrainian land. That includes nearly all of the eastern Donbas region, plus the Black Sea peninsula of Crimea. For most observers, setting up some sort of no-man's-land. The demilitarized zone that has separated North and South Korea for decades is a model for many. Putin floated the idea in March after winning reelection. 'I do not exclude that...we will be forced at some point, when we deem it appropriate, to create a certain 'sanitary zone' in the territories today under the Kyiv regime,' he said. For Ukraine, the tricky part is where that line will be drawn -- and how much of its economic base it will lose. Much of Ukraine's mining and heavy industry is in the Donbas occupied by Russia; and about 8 million hectares of Ukrainian farmland is occupied, according to one estimate. In an audacious move, Ukraine invaded Russian territory in August, seizing part of the Kursk region. Zelenskiy later said the aim was to create a buffer zone and to push Russian missiles further away from Ukraine's second-largest city, Kharkiv. Since that time, however, Russia has ground down Ukrainian troops, taking back nearly half of the Kursk territory initially seized by Ukraine. Also tricky with such a zone -- buffer, sanitary, demilitarized -- is surveillance and verification: what each side, or the peacekeepers, would be allowed to do to keep an eye on the other. The explosive evolution of drone warfare could potentially complicate this. The Elephant In The Room The biggest question mark for future talks may be Ukraine's largest weapons supplier: the United States, and the incoming Trump administration. Trump has for years complained about the amount of U.S. weaponry sent by the outgoing administration of President Joe Biden and has suggested Zelenskiy was a con man. He has also said that his skills as a businessman and real estate developer make him a negotiator capable of reaching a deal with Putin. Trump's point man is Keith Kellogg, a retired U.S. Army lieutenant colonel who advised Trump's vice president during his first term. In a widely cited paper he co-authored before Trump's November election, Kellogg laid out a plan including freezing the front lines and using both sticks and carrots to get Kyiv and Moscow to negotiate. For Kyiv, for example, the sticks mean cutting off U.S. weapons. For Moscow, that means things like flooding global markets with oil to drive down prices for the commodity, which Moscow relies heavily on for revenues. Carrots for Moscow would be lifting Western sanctions or delaying Ukraine's NATO ambitions. For Kyiv, it would be continued military aid, funding for reconstruction, or even nonrecognition of Russian-occupied territories -- similar to what Washington did over four decades regarding the Soviet annexation of the three Baltic states. 'We tell the Ukrainians, 'You've got to come to the table, and if you don't come to the table, support from the United States will dry up,' Kellogg told Reuters in June. 'And you tell Putin, 'He's got to come to the table, and if you don't come to the table, then we'll give Ukrainians everything they need to kill you in the field.'' The Kremlin itself -- impatient with an invasion that was supposed to be over in just days and that has thrown its economy out of whack -- has signaled openness to a new, Trump approach. But there are doubters. 'We don't think [Putin] is serious about negotiations,' a senior NATO official, speaking on condition that he not be identified publicly, told RFE/RL last week. 'He may be willing to talk, but as long as he believes that he is winning, there is no incentive for negotiations. And he continues to believe that time is in his favor.'

Sri Lankan Parliament Speaker Resigns After Accusations Of Flaunt...	Faking university degrees is common in South Asia and is rooted in the emerging socio-economic conditions The Anura Kumara Dissanayake government in Sri Lanka, which was sailing smoothly despite unsolved economic issues, suffered the first jolt since coming to power, when parliament Speaker Asoka Ranwala resigned on Friday amidst accusations that his 'Ph.D' was fake. Urban Development and Housing Minister Anura Karunatilake and Justice Minister Harshana Nanayakkara were also assailed for falsely claiming that they had doctoral degrees. Ranwala maintained that he had acquired a Ph.D, and said that he had no documentary proof of the doctorate. He said he would produce it on getting it from the Waseda University-affiliated institution in Japan he was registered with. In the case of Nanayakkara, it came to be known that it was the parliament's fault. It had appended 'Dr' to his name deviating from the text he had given them. In the case of Karunatilake, he was not a doctorate and yet was using the prefix 'Dr'. He said that he was a Ph.D student but had not completed the programme. Because of the public exposure, all three dropped 'Dr' from their on-line platforms. However, the squeaking clean image which the ruling National Peoples' Power (NPP) government had, was sullied. The Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) MP Namal Rajapaksa urged government MPs to resign if they failed to provide evidence of their educational qualifications. Taking to X, he criticised the NPP for misleading the people saying that they would give an honest and transparent government with people having good educational qualifications. People voted for the NPP in the Presidential and parliamentary elections this year impressed with the 'high' qualifications of the NPP candidates in contrast to their challengers, many of whom could have been mere high school graduates. Root of the Problem Fake degrees are not confined to Members of the Sri Lankan Parliament and pushy politicians trying to impress the public. It is widespread in society in Sri Lanka, South Asia and even in the UK and USA. In all these countries there are those who falsely claim they have a university degree, and there are others who have a fake degree, and there are yet others who provide fake degrees for a hefty fee. Literature on the subject tells us that fake degrees are a product of certain socio-economic conditions. The fake degrees industry arose when South Asian countries liberalized their economies creating new needs but without generating enough jobs. In a population of uneducated people, flaunting a university degree, whether real or fake, helps gain recognition. It opens the doors to jobs when jobs are scarce. In colonial times, when university education was very much restricted, people with a university degree would routinely add 'BA' or 'MA' to their names even when writing to friends or on their name plates. For them it was a mark of some achievement. After the British gave independence to countries in the Indian subcontinent, politics became popular and intensely competitive. Politicians began to add educational qualifications, real or false, to their CVs as additional feathers in their cap. Politicians began to use their clout in local universities to get 'honorary' doctorates which they unethically flaunted as doctorates got after pursuing a rigorous doctoral programme. The number of politicians getting such doctorates increased exponentially after universities, to curry favour with governments and politicians, starting giving doctorates to Chief Ministers, Ministers and other political bigwigs. The number of political doctorates in India ballooned with the politicization of the universities. Both state and private universities were in this racket as both needed State funds ad political patronage to conduct their 'educational business.' All countries in South Asia developed economically, especially after they liberalized, but job opportunities did not grow commensurately. The new needs arising from a liberalized economy and the intense competition that the needs generated resulted in a craze for getting 'higher qualifications' no matter how dubious these qualifications might be. Degree Shops To meet the needs of these 'wannabes', shops came up selling degrees from nice sounding but dubious universities, both local and foreign. In 2022, the Colombo-based Roar Media carried a story on the degree racket in Sri Lanka. It cited the case of the director of a sanitary ware company, who while scrolling through his Facebook page, saw a message from a 'local representative of a university based in the US.' The gent offered honorary doctorates for LKR 390,000 each. Manav Bharti University scandal was a private university in Himachal Pradesh state which had sold 36,000 degrees for US$1,362 each. Such offers came from agents based in the US, Nigeria and India. The prices for a doctorate varied from USD 62 to USD 1400. Even 'convocations' were held in expensive places to impress the recipients and others, but at an extra cost of USD 626 per client. Some of the known fake universities are: Indian Virtual University; Universal Tamil University, Chennai; Kings University, U.S.A.; International Peace University, Germany; International Tamil University; and University Asia, Kathmandu, Nepal. The fake degree agents claim high conectons. According to India Today, a Chennai man ran an International Coaching Centre under the auspices of the 'International Labour Organisation/United Nations Development Programme for getting Ph.Ds. MBAs and MBBS degrees from New York University and Stanton University American fake degrees are, of course, the most sought after. The United States Education Foundation in India (USEFI), Chennai, run by the US Education Department, had said that most of the US 'universities' giving 'degrees' were fake. The list includes International University, California, Stanton University and City University of New York. Ghost Writers Some shops touting fake degrees really seek research work. One India-based entity gave a PhD certificate in 45 days for USD 1065 after a 250-page thesis was submitted. To help write Ph.D. dissertations there arose ghost writers. Sometimes, these fly-by-night operators just pocketed the money and disappeared. In 2019, 11 professors at government arts and science colleges in India's Tamil Nadu state were suspended after their PhD certificates were found to be fake. The same year, the Education Ministry launched an investigation into six universities – including three public ones – that had been accused of selling fake degrees. Rajib Ray, president of the Federation of Central Universities' Teachers' Associations, told South China Morning Post that most fake degree scams in India involved private universities – a sector that has been booming since the 1990s following a surge in demand for IT and management courses.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWemAQr5P7Qc6ZhtEeCvgevt	2024-12-14T15:55:46-08:00	
Somaliland And Its Case For Statehood – OpEd	By Hafed Al-Ghwell Recently, whispers of Somaliland’s impending recognition as an independent state have grown louder. Credible assertions are rife that the incoming administration in the US is not opposed to extending acknowledgment of this self-declared republic. Such a move, if realized, stands to reshape the dynamics in the Horn of Africa, a region long defined by its turbulent history and proxies bound in complex alliances in service of narrow geopolitical interests. But what does this mean for Somaliland, and how is it positioned to transform a distant aspiration into reality?Somaliland, nestled in the northwest corner of Somalia, unilaterally declared its independence in 1991. However, despite its stable governance and booming economy, it remains largely absent from international recognition. With roots tracing back to a colonial history distinct from the rest of Somalia, Somaliland has consistently demonstrated a more democratic and stable profile than its neighbor — a sharp contrast to the turmoil that has beleaguered Somalia for decades. This compelling narrative of stability juxtaposed against regional chaos forms the bedrock on which Somaliland stakes its claim to statehood.Recent presidential elections in Somaliland, despite periods of tension and violence leading up to the vote, have sharply elevated the argument for an independent and sovereign country. Abdirahman Mohamed Abdullahi, also known as Cirro, of the Waddani party, secured the presidency with a strong mandate, securing nearly two-thirds of the vote in a poll that highlighted the resilience of Somaliland’s democratic institutions even amid regional instability. However, international recognition, particularly from a global power such as the US, would carry significant geostrategic weight.The incoming administration in the US might view Somaliland’s stability as a strategic asset against the backdrop of a volatile neighbor and an opportunity to counter the expansion of influence in the region from Washington’s geopolitical rivals. Yet, such recognition risks igniting further unrest by exacerbating clan divisions within Somaliland and antagonizing Somalia, which has vehemently opposed Somaliland’s independence for more than three decades. These implications extend beyond the region, potentially affecting global trade routes at the vital Bab Al-Mandab Strait chokepoint, which divides the busy Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden maritime routes. Here, Somali piracy, Houthi escalations, and a semipermanent international naval presence complicate the dynamics at play where a new country is struggling to be born.Nevertheless, acknowledging Somaliland’s de facto statehood is a step that would validate its aspirations and contributions toward a more stable region. This recognition would affirm the global community’s commitment to stability and self-determination over archaic border adherence, setting a new standard for addressing similar geopolitical realities.Somaliland’s quest for recognition carries a range of potential benefits and pitfalls. On the plus side, international recognition would solidify its sovereignty, allowing for increased foreign investment and development assistance which would catalyze economic growth and improve infrastructure. Recognizing statehood would also offer Somaliland the opportunity to join international organizations, further embedding it into the global diplomatic and economic system. However, pitfalls include the risk of heightened regional instability, as recognition might prompt a severe backlash from Somalia, which considers Somaliland an integral part of its territory. Recognition could also set a precedent for other separatist movements around Africa and beyond, potentially reigniting dormant territorial disputes, which might deter some countries from supporting Somaliland’s bid. A newly independent Somaliland would realign political dynamics within the Horn of Africa. It could alter alliances and worsen existing tensions, particularly among actors who may have vested interests in either supporting or opposing Somaliland’s independence. Ethiopia, for instance, with its historical ties and strategic interests in Somaliland, might endorse such recognition, seeking to counterbalance Eritrean and Somali influences in the region. Nonetheless, the geopolitics of the Horn are precarious, and the global community must quickly determine whether recognizing Somaliland would bring more stability or further complicate a delicate balance of power.Given the potential for regional upheaval, there is an argument for establishing an international coalition to safeguard post-recognition Somaliland. Such a coalition should include key global and regional actors committed to ensuring that Somaliland’s transition to recognized statehood occurs peacefully. This coalition would provide not only diplomatic backing but also tangible support in the form of security assistance and economic aid to help buffer against any immediate retaliatory measures from neighboring states or non-state actors. Establishing such a coalition would signal to Somaliland’s opponents that the international community is serious about maintaining stability and supporting the country’s sovereignty, potentially deterring hostile actions against it.Opposition to Somaliland’s recognition is likely to be driven primarily by Somalia, which views the move as a direct challenge to its territorial integrity. Other actors who fear the precedent this sets, especially those in restive regions, may also oppose the move indirectly seeking to impose diplomatic costs for any endorsement.Ultimately, navigating this turbulence will require astute diplomacy and a clear-eyed assessment of both the risks and the long-term benefits of embracing Somaliland as the world’s newest country. However, it is unclear in current contemplations, whether the incoming US administration’s backing would be as pivotal in overcoming diplomatic inertia for Somaliland’s recognition as experts estimate.The coming months promise a flurry of maneuvering in a bid to clarify where the US stands regarding Somaliland’s independence. And, once again, the Horn of Africa will be at the center of renewed attention as a new White House administration takes the helm. • Hafed Al-Ghwell is a senior fellow and executive director of the North Africa Initiative at the Foreign Policy Institute of the Johns Hopkins University School of Advanced International Studies in Washington, DC.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWemAQr5P7Qc6e6NLuv7Kb5m	2024-12-14T15:49:57-08:00	
Georgia Ruling Party Installs Loyalist President Amid Constitutio...	(EurActiv) -- The ruling Georgian Dream party installed on Saturday (14 December) far-right former footballer Mikheil Kavelashvili as president in a controversial election process amid a deepening constitutional crisis and weeks of mass pro-EU protests. Georgia has been in turmoil since the governing party claimed victory in the contested 26 October parliamentary elections. Its decision last month to delay EU membership talks ignited a fresh wave of mass rallies. An electoral college, controlled by the ruling Georgian Dream party and boycotted by the opposition, elected Kavelashvili with a comfortable majority of 224 votes as the country's next figurehead leader for a five-year term, the central election commission said. Kavelashvili, a former forward for English Premier League champions Manchester City and MP since 2016, is known for airing far-right views and has been outspoken against LGBTQ rights and Western influence. He was the sole presidential candidate. The opposition has denounced Saturday's election as 'illegitimate' and said the sitting President, Salome Zurabishvili, remains the country's sole legitimate leader. She has refused to step down and is demanding new parliamentary elections, paving the way for a constitutional showdown. 'Georgia never loses its sense of humour, celebrating the election of a footballer as president,' Zurabishvili wrote on social media, saying the vote made 'a mockery of democracy.' A former diplomat, Zurabishvili is a hugely popular figure among protesters, who view her as a beacon of Georgia's European aspirations. On Saturday, protesters began gathering outside the parliament building – which was cordoned off by police – ahead of a planned opposition rally in the evening. 'Our (parliamentary) election was rigged. We need new elections,' a protestor named Natia Apkhazava said. 'We will keep fighting for our European future.' Thousands of pro-EU demonstrators gathered outside parliament on Friday for the 16th consecutive night of protests. Unprecedented constitutional crisis Opposition groups accuse Georgian Dream of rigging the October parliamentary vote, backsliding on democracy and moving Tbilisi closer to Russia – despite the Caucasus nation's constitutionally mandated bid to join the EU. Georgian Dream scrapped direct presidential elections in 2017. With Zurabishvili refusing to leave office, opposition lawmakers boycotting parliament, and protests showing no signs of abating, the legitimacy of Kavelashvili's election has been undermined from the outset. Georgia's leading election watchdog, the International Society for Fair Elections and Democracy, said: 'Any decisions made by this illegitimate parliament, including the scheduling and holding of the presidential election, are unconstitutional and unlawful.' One author of Georgia's constitution, Vakhtang Khmaladze, has argued that all decisions by the new parliament are void. 'Georgia is facing an unprecedented constitutional crisis,' Khmaladze told AFP. It remains unclear how the government will react if Zurabishvili refuses to step down after her successor is inaugurated on 29 December. Western hesitation Police have fired tear gas and water cannons during more than two weeks of demonstrations and arrested over 400 protesters, according to the Social Justice Centre, an NGO. On Friday, Amnesty International said protesters had faced 'brutal dispersal tactics, arbitrary detention and torture.' There have also been raids on the offices of opposition parties and arrests of their leaders. As international condemnation of the police crackdown mounted, French President Emmanuel Macron told Georgians their 'European dream must not be extinguished.' Earlier this week, Macron made a phone call to Georgian Dream founder Bidzina Ivanishvili – the tycoon widely considered to be Georgia's real power broker. His decision to call Ivanishvili, rather than Prime Minister Irakli Kobakhidze -- was indicative of the West's hesitancy to recognise the legitimacy of Georgia's new government.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWemAQr5P7Qc6ZBoB-mSaVzK	2024-12-14T15:48:24-08:00	
India And Indonesia Deepen Maritime Ties As Naval Chief Visits Ja...	As the Indo-Pacific emerges as the geopolitical epicentre of the 21st century, India and Indonesia are advancing their strategic maritime partnership, reaffirming their commitment to regional security. Admiral Dinesh K Tripathi, Chief of the Naval Staff (CNS), is on a four-day official visit to Indonesia from December 15 to 18, highlighting the growing depth of bilateral defence cooperation. This visit aligns with the evolving Comprehensive Strategic Partnership between the two nations, emphasising enhanced naval collaboration as a cornerstone of their shared vision for an open and inclusive Indo-Pacific. Strengthening a Strategic Maritime Partnership Admiral Tripathi's agenda includes high-level engagements with Indonesia's top defence and government officials, including Defence Minister Lt Gen Sjafrie Sjamsoeddin (Retd), Armed Forces Commander General Agus Subiyanto, and Navy Chief Admiral Muhammad Ali. These discussions are expected to address various issues, from maritime security and joint training to operational collaboration, reflecting the broad scope of their bilateral defence relationship. The timing of the visit coincides with the 43rd edition of the India-Indonesia Coordinated Patrol (CORPAT), currently underway along the International Maritime Boundary Line (IMBL). This long-standing operational exercise symbolises the robust maritime ties between the two navies, aimed at combating illegal activities, safeguarding sea lanes, and ensuring regional stability. A Comprehensive Maritime Vision India and Indonesia, both strategically positioned in the Indian Ocean and the South China Sea, share critical interests in securing some of the world's busiest shipping routes. Their maritime cooperation is guided by the 2018 Shared Vision for Maritime Cooperation in the Indo-Pacific, a framework that emphasises the importance of upholding international maritime law and maintaining regional stability. The partnership has grown to encompass joint exercises, port visits, and training initiatives. Exercises like Samudra Shakti and the CORPAT series reflect the maturing interoperability of the two navies, focusing on addressing challenges such as piracy, smuggling, and trafficking. Expanding the Scope of Naval Collaboration Admiral Tripathi's visit is expected to consolidate existing operational ties while exploring new avenues for collaboration. Key focus areas include joint training programmes, knowledge sharing, and the development of Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) for coordinated disaster response under the Indian Ocean Naval Symposium (IONS). Such initiatives enhance regional humanitarian assistance and disaster relief (HADR) capabilities, particularly in regions prone to natural calamities. Beyond operational synergy, defence-industrial cooperation is also on the agenda. Indonesia's interest in India's BrahMos missile system and indigenous defence platforms highlights the potential for deeper technological collaboration. As both nations seek to reduce dependence on external suppliers amidst global supply chain disruptions, this partnership could pave the way for co-development and technology transfer initiatives. A Broader Regional Context The visit also carries broader implications for the Indo-Pacific. As resident powers, India and Indonesia are key stakeholders in addressing the challenges of an increasingly assertive China in the region. Their alignment reinforces a rules-based maritime order, ensuring the free trade flow and adherence to international norms. Moreover, the bilateral partnership complements broader frameworks such as the Quad's Indo-Pacific strategy, which advocates for inclusive and open maritime spaces. India and Indonesia's efforts to secure critical sea lanes contribute to their national security and the region's stability. Challenges and Opportunities While the trajectory of the India-Indonesia naval partnership is promising, challenges persist. Differing procurement policies and budgetary constraints could slow the pace of defence-industrial collaboration. Additionally, navigating the complexities of great-power competition requires careful diplomacy to maintain strategic autonomy. Nonetheless, the complementarities in their strategic objectives and mutual interests provide a strong foundation for growth. By leveraging their shared concerns over maritime security and regional stability, both nations can elevate their partnership to new heights. Charting a Path Forward Admiral Tripathi's engagements in Jakarta highlight the strategic importance both nations place on their maritime partnership. His discussions with Indonesian leaders will likely focus on institutionalising recent gains, enhancing real-time information sharing, and expanding the scope of joint exercises. As the two nations deepen their cooperation, their partnership is a model for resilience and collaboration in an increasingly uncertain geopolitical environment. By advancing their shared vision for the Indo-Pacific, India and Indonesia are securing their interests and contributing to the broader goal of regional stability and prosperity.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWemAQr5P7Qc6SVDYOUiYon8	2024-12-14T15:45:40-08:00	
South Korea Votes To Impeach President Yoon Over Failed Martial L...	By Taejun Kang South Korea’s National Assembly voted on Saturday to impeach President Yoon Suk Yeol over his failed bid to impose martial law, to the delight of a huge crowd of anti-Yoon protesters outside the legislature. The impeachment motion will now be sent to the Constitutional Court, which will determine whether to uphold the parliamentary vote and remove Yoon from office or to reinstate him. Yoon declared martial law on the night of Dec. 3 to counter 'threats from North Korea' and 'anti-state activities' by the domestic political opposition. However, the National Assembly rejected the decree nearly three hours later as protesters gathered outside, prompting Yoon to lift the order. The impeachment motion against Yoon passed with a vote of 204 in favor and 85 against, with three abstentions and eight invalid ballots, as all 300 lawmakers cast their votes. Once the impeachment resolution is delivered to Yoon’s office, he will be suspended from his duties, and Prime Minister Han Duck-soo will assume the role of acting president. 'I will do my utmost to ensure the stable operation of the government operation,' said Han after the impeachment motion was passed. A crowd of anti-Yoon protesters that media estimated at 200,000-strong welcomed the vote in favor of impeachment. Yoon’s conservative supporters held a smaller protest in another part of Seoul. An initial bid to vote to impeach Yoon failed last week when most ruling party lawmakers boycotted the vote. The second impeachment motion was introduced on Thursday by the main opposition Democratic Party and five other minor opposition parties, accusing Yoon of violating the Constitution and other laws by declaring martial law. If the impeachment is upheld, Yoon will become the second president in South Korea’s history to be removed from office, following former President Park Geun-hye’s ouster in 2017 over corruption. If the court rules to oust him, an election will be held for a new president. ‘Protect the nation’ On Thursday, Yoon defended his botched martial law declaration as an act of governance. In a televised address, Yoon said he used his presidential power to declare martial law 'to protect the nation and normalize state affairs' against the opposition that paralyzed the government, calling it a 'highly calibrated political judgment.' 'The National Assembly, dominated by the large opposition party, has become a monster that destroys the Constitutional order of free democracy,' Yoon asserted. The main opposition Democratic Party controls 171 seats in the 300-member parliament. In particular, Yoon said that opposition parties blocked a revision to anti-espionage laws despite two separate instances in which Chinese nationals filmed South Korean military installations and the National Intelligence Service. He also said the opposition parties were 'advocating' to lift sanctions against North Korea. In response, China’s foreign ministry said Thursday it was 'deeply surprised and dissatisfied.' 'We are deeply surprised and dissatisfied with the remarks made by the South Korean side,' Mao Ning, Beijing foreign ministry’s spokesperson, said during a regular press briefing. 'We firmly oppose the South Korean side linking its internal issues with factors related to China, making up false charges of so-called Chinese spies and disgracing normal economic and trade cooperation,' said Mao, adding that a verdict has not been reached yet in the mentioned cases and that China is maintaining related communication with South Korea. She also urged South Korea to guarantee the safety and legal rights of the individuals involved.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWemAQr5P7Qc6RsfXy0ZSQNY	2024-12-14T15:41:15-08:00	
Maldivian President Muizzu Losing Shine Due To Economic Mismanage...	But his tight grip on parliament will ensure continuance in power for now. Trouble appears to be brewing for the Maldivian President Mohamad Muizzu. Within a year of his taking office, there are murmurs about the ineffectiveness of his rule on the economic front. To be fair, Muizzu cannot be blamed for all that has gone wrong, as some of the problems have been inherited. But his management of the Maldivian economy is seen to be wanting in several ways. The present unhappy situation is partly attributed to his priorities and policies. However, sources in Maldives say that the regime as such is not under threat given the fact that his party, Peoples' National Congress (PNC), has an absolute or super majority in parliament. He also has a tight grip on PNC MPs. There is no chance of PNC MPs defecting to the opposition because of the anti-Defection law which he recently got passed. As per this law, a defector will automatically lose his seat. MPs are thus tied hand and foot. However, in the public eye, Muizzu's image has suffered a dent. If the dent gets deeper, it could affect his position in the PNC and parliament too. But the gainer from Muizzu's weakening may not be the Maldivian Democratic Party (MDP), the main opposition party, headed by former President Ibrahim Solih. After being mauled in the Presidential and parliamentary elections, the MDP is still unable to throw up a new and more inspiring leader to replace the jaded Ibrahim Solih. Muizzu is trying destroy the MDP completely. Parliament recently approved a motion to request the Attorney General to initiate a criminal investigation against Solih and two of his former ministerial colleagues for allocating state funds and property to unauthorised individuals. Muizzu's group blamed the MDP for the recent fire in a government building in which many important files were destroyed. Questions were asked as to whether the fire was linked to parliament's decision to investigate cases involving Solih and MDP Chairperson and former Economics Minister, Fayyaz Ismail. Abdulla Yameen An emerging, but still shadowy, figure in the power struggle is former President Abdulla Yameen of the Peoples National Front (PNF). Yameen may eventually benefit from the dimming of Muizzu's image. The PNF had grown out of the PNC and the PNC itself grew out of the Progressive Party of the Maldives (PPM) in which Yameen and Muizzu were colleagues and shared its ideology. A power struggle resulted in a parting of ways in 2023. Yameen, a trained economist who was President of Maldives from 2013 to 2018, was efficient at managing the economy but because he was charged with high corruption and human rights violations, he could not get a second term. Released after a short period of imprisonment for money laundering, Yameen has re-entered politics founding a party the People's National Front (PNF). If he supplements his economic acumen (a need of the hour) with better interpersonal and public relations, he could emerge as a rallying point for anti-Muizzu groups. But there is doubt about Yameen's willingness or ability to change his dour persona. Therefore, there is, as yet, no challenge to Muizzu from the existing political line up. But what Muizzu should watch out for is the possibility of alienating the masses due to the pursuit of wrong economic policies. Wrong Economic Policies In their article on the 2025 budget inwww.maldiveseconomy.com Ahmed As'ad, Ahmed Mohamed, Ahmed Saruvash Adam, Ali Hashim & Ibrahim Athif Shakoor say that there is too much reliance on the tourism sector which is subject to factors beyond Maldives' control. Secondly, the focus is on non-growth-generating capital projects, which have high recurrent costs. The national debt is increasing. Prices are going up with the reduction in subsidies. At the same time salaries and other state expenses have gone up ballooning the budget deficit. 'The entrenched culture of spending more than we earn has been a facet of the national budget for quite some years. Consequently, the national debt is increasing rapidly year after year. Total government direct debt and public guaranteed debt is projected to reach MVR 149.9 billion in 2025, which is more than three times the national debt of MVR 43 billion in 2017.' 'As a result, the interest payable on debt has risen to be equal to 10 percent of the total budget. This is 32% higher than 2023 and 7% higher than 2024.' 'The debt ratio for 2025 is 124.8% of GDP. This is more than twice the 60% advocated for prudency reasons,' the authors point out. The 2025 budget shows a 37% increase for staff expenses over the 2023 budget and 20% increase over the revised figures for 2024. A total of MVR 19 billion is required to finance the projected deficit of the 2025 budget. In 2025, the target for foreign finance is MVR 11.8 billion. This includes budget support loans and a large share of foreign loans for development projects. But as in the previous two years, it is unlikely that the estimated external financing targets will be met.' 'Further, the budget figures indicate a borrowing cost of an average of 2.8%, which, given the current international financial climate and a time when our credit ratings have been downgraded, seem to be implausible.' Local Financiers The 2025 budget means to raise MVR 7.2 billion from local financial institutions. Of special concern is the budgeted figures of MVR 6.7 billion to be raised by commercial banks as budget support. In addition, the amount of financing required is likely to exceed if revenue generation measures are not fully effective and because of delays in implementing budgeted expenditure reductions, the authors warn. 'Hence, the burden of financing the budget deficit, like in previous years, will likely fall again on the local financial market. It appears inevitable that in 2025 too, the local market will have to bear a significantly higher burden than the MVR 5 billion currently estimated in the budget,' they say. Squeezing Out Private Sector Raising such big amounts from the domestic financial market to finance the budget deficit prevents the private sector from accessing limited development funds in the local banking industry, thereby crowding out the private sector severely. Such crowding out limits the opportunities for the private sector to expand and grow, the authors argue. Therefore, in 2025 too, private sector businesses will face increased difficulties, compounding the adverse impact on the Maldivian economy. The 2025 budget plans to cut subsidies. This will significantly increase the financial burden on the general public. Simultaneously, salaries and allowances to state employees have been increased by MVR 2.3 billion. 'Therefore, while the reform and stabilization of the subsidy regime is set to begin, the budget does not reflect any intention to reduce other expenditures, especially salaries and other administrative expenditures.' Recurrent expenditure accounts for 63 percent of the total state budget and only 37 percent is identified for capital expenditures and contingencies. The excess of recurrent expenditure over capital expenditure indicates that the budget does not adequately accommodate expenditure for growth inducing economic projects. The correct approach would be to prioritize growth for capital infusion and induce investments which will increase revenue and employment, the authors recommend. Fisheries Not Exploited Before tourism came on the scene, fishing was the main plank of the Maldivian economy. But it has declined for lack of incentives. The year 2024 has proved to be an adverse year for the fishing industry. Government figures show that companies purchased 68,000 mts of fish till September 2023, while this year, they purchased 41 percent less, or just 40,000 mt. Total exports too have declined over this period. 'Inconsistent and unviable state policies over many years have caused injury and harm to the long-term health of the fishery industry. Over the past few years, governments and state-owned companies have been offering highly paid land-based jobs, giving additional incentive to the youth to stay away from the more challenging life at sea. The prospects for the fishery industry, therefore, has been grim resulting in closure of private sector processing factories, and with many dhonis (fishing boats) being anchored in Maldivian harbours, ' the authors point out.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWemAQr5P7Qc6b6kQ0Ik1MLS	2024-12-14T15:39:09-08:00	
What Assad’s Overthrow Revealed About Syrian Regime’s Captagon Em...	By Jonathan Gornall For more than a decade, the illegal drug Captagon has been mass produced in Syria, in laboratories either run by or with the blessing of a regime hard hit by Western sanctions and desperate to generate revenue. The scale of the trade, targeted mainly at young people in the Gulf states, particularly Saudi Arabia, was revealed last year in an Arab News expose produced in collaboration with the New Lines Institute. A cheaply made form of amphetamine, Captagon has been flooding into countries of the Middle East for more than a decade, causing social harm on an unprecedented scale. Embossed with its distinctive twin half moons logo, which gives the drug its Arabic street name, 'Abu Hilalain,' or Father of the Two Crescents, the pills are easy to make, readily available, and relatively cheap to buy. On Dec. 4, the New Lines Institute in Washington launched a unique interactive online tool designed to help researchers and global law enforcement agencies research, track, and understand the scale and complexities of the trade. Just days after the launch of the project, the Syrian regime, which had been locked in a grinding civil war with armed opposition groups for almost 14 years, suddenly collapsed. In the early hours of Sunday, Dec. 8, President Bashar Assad and his family fled to Moscow, where their Russian allies granted them asylum. Since then, multiple Captagon laboratories have been overrun in areas formerly controlled by the Syrian government, with raw materials, machinery, packaging and countless thousands of pills found abandoned in haste. But no one should think for one moment that the collapse of the Assad regime means the end of the curse of Captagon, according to Caroline Rose, director of the Strategic Blind Spots Portfolio at the New Lines Institute. 'We are going to see a shift in the trade now that Hayat Tahrir Al-Sham and a lot of communities in Syria have started to disassemble Captagon production sites and incinerate Captagon pills,' she told Arab News. In his victory speech at the Umayyad Mosque in Damascus on Monday, HTS leader Abu Mohammed Al-Golani made a specific point of condemning the drug and Assad’s part in its production. The ousted president, he said, had caused the country to become 'a major Captagon factory in the world, and today Syria is being cleansed of it.' It is 'very clear that if you are a Captagon manufacturer who did not flee with the regime, you are now in trouble, Rose said. 'But I think what we’re going to see now is overspill, what people often call the ‘balloon effect.’ Production is being squeezed inside Syria, but we are going to see the emergence of larger-scale Captagon production facilities in a few countries where alarm bells have already been ringing.' Authorities across the region have frequently reported seizures of the pills, intercepted at ports, airports, and border crossings, in an ongoing battle of wits with smugglers resorting to increasingly ingenious methods. The New Lines Institute’s Captagon Trade Project, the product of years of research, is the first time that information about all reported global seizures of the drug, showing the sheer scale of the trade, can be accessed in one place. And clues to the changing profile of the Captagon trade in the months leading up the regime’s collapse can be found in the project’s data, which reveal that production facilities have been popping up in countries including Iraq, Lebanon and Turkiye. In Lebanon, the Iran-backed Hezbollah militia, under intense pressure from Israel, 'has an incentive to build up its own financial reserves, and Captagon is an easy way to do that,' Rose said. A couple of Captagon labs were found earlier this year in Turkiye, a country where 'we had not seen labs in a very long time.' Production facilities have even been found as far away as Europe, in Germany and the Netherlands. In all these cases, it was certain that governments were not involved in the trade, according to Rose. 'Syria was a very interesting and rare case where we did see the involvement of so many high-level officials in the regime, implicated in Captagon production and trafficking,' she said. While Assad himself carefully distanced himself from the trade, his brother Maher was heavily implicated with production and smuggling efforts in his role as commander of the Fourth Armored Division, a military unit whose primary mission was to protect the Syrian regime from internal and external threats. Quite where he is now remains uncertain. 'I have heard that Maher and his Fourth Division commanders made their way through Iraq to Iran and are now in Tehran,' Rose said. 'However, other reports say HTS has found and detained him. That’s not confirmed yet. But if Maher is still there, it’s likely that a lot of members of the regime’s Captagon organization are also still in Syria.' Either way, there is now 'an assumption that this is the end of Captagon, but it’s not. We need to keep in mind that over the past two years Captagon production had already started to trickle outside of Syria. 'For the longest time, regime-held Syria was the hub of Captagon production. Then we started to see labs being seized in southern and northern Iraq and even in Kuwait, which is interesting and makes sense. They were starting to build this bridge through Iraq to get closer to destination markets in the Gulf.' At the same time, there were signs that the regime was cracking down on the Captagon trade — or, rather, pretending to — as revealed by the comprehensive seizure data in New Lines Institute’s online mapping tool. 'We saw the regime’s incentive to normalize relations with the Gulf states, and recognition that it needed to be seen to be cracking down on this trade, while quietly still reaping the economic benefits,' Rose said. 'For that reason, we think, in the past year we have seen the supply of Captagon — or, at least, what was seized — decrease dramatically, especially in Gulf states such as Saudi Arabia and the UAE, which were the two targets for normalization discussions for the regime. 'We have cause to believe that the flow of Captagon was actually halted by the regime. They were stepping on the hose to create the appearance that they had stopped Captagon production, in the hope that it would bring the Gulf states to the table. 'In fact, as we’ve seen with the finds in Syria over the past few days, they seem to have been stockpiling the drug. Most likely later on they would have flooded the market.' Sandwiched between Syria and Saudi Arabia, Jordan has long borne the brunt of smuggling attempts orchestrated by the Syrian military and Iran-backed militias operating in the south of Syria. It has, for many years, been a key battleground in the fight to stem the tide of the drug. Over the past few months, however, there have been telltale signs of changes in the nature of attempts to smuggle Captagon through Jordan to Saudi Arabia and beyond. 'Unusually, we’ve not seen any seizures in Jordan since early November,' Rose said. 'Typically, around this time of the year we would see an uptick in Captagon there, not only in smuggling incidents, but also in clashes along the border, because that’s when the wintry conditions start to set in, creating conditions that make it perfect for a smuggler to bypass surveillance systems.' In Saudi Arabia, meanwhile, the most recent recorded seizure was on Dec. 7 at the Al-Wadiah border crossing with Yemen. The two before that were both on Nov. 30, at the checkpoint on the King Fahd Causeway to Bahrain and on the other side of the country at the Port of Duba on the Red Sea. 'One was about 200,000 pills, the other one 280,000, so nothing major,' Rose said. 'What we’ve noticed is that the number of seizures is increasing, but the sizes of the consignments are dwindling.' In other words, smugglers are making more frequent runs, but with smaller batches of pills, which implies smaller players smuggling overland, rather than major, connected players shipping in bulk via sea. Whatever HTS chief Al-Golani might say, or even intend, Syria is not yet free of Captagon, according to Rose. 'I am positive that there are actors who are picking up a few thousand pills and peddling them on the street,' she said. 'This is still a very lucrative trade. Syria is not out of the woods economically, and there will be many people who will want to try to make a profit.' Made for about $1 and typically sold for 15 times as much, Captagon is an exceptionally profitable product, which is estimated to have earned the Syrian regime more than $2 billion per year. 'And at the end of the day, old habits die hard,' Rose said. 'For a lot of these individuals, not necessarily high-level regime officials, this has been their way of life for years, and so it’s going to be very difficult for any new government in Syria to convince these criminal actors to give up this source of revenue.'	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWemAQr5P7Qc6VifjhBe7OLn	2024-12-14T15:36:26-08:00	
The Horn Of Africa States: Somalis Know – OpEd	Somalia was a self-sufficient country in food until at least the late 1970s, when intervention of the IMF and the World Bank in the early 1980s reversed the trend and turned the country into a chaotic real estate ever since. That is, at least, what the Third World Traveler on the real causes of famines in Somalia, excerpted from the book, 'The Globalization of Poverty and the New World Order' by Michel Chossudovsky ,Global Research, 2003, paperback [first edition 1997], on page 95, says and this was so, despite the recurrent famines and droughts. Somalia is the real Horn of Africa and is a land mass of some 638 thousand square kilometers with a coastline of some 3,333 km along the Indian ocean and the Gulf of Aden. It is a land space which has been the envy of many a nation including the neighboring countries of Ethiopia and Kenya and others from beyond the region, which would have liked to exploit the rich natural resources of the country, for their own ends. It is a land which was inhabited by its Indigenous people, the Somali for, at least, the past ten thousand years and who have fiercely defended it from any and all of those who coveted it from any quarter. The latest invasions included the Ethiopian invasion of Ethiopia in 2006/2007, which ended up in a disastrous retreat for Ethiopia. Others have tried before and after, through differing processes including twisted diplomacy and other means. Somalis always say, 'Kii dhuumanayow ee dhabarku muuqdaw, waa dharaar lagu dhawrayaa….,' which literally means 'The one who thinks, he is not being seen, must know that he is being seen like in day time and is being watched….' This is to say that those who are cheating Somalia, thinking that Somalis do not know, must go back to their calculations for Somalis are fully aware of their activities and know. It is an old race which has lived in this harsh environment and survived preserving its culture and way of life in tact despite the advances of technology in the world of today. Somalis are entrepreneurial and are known for their adaptability to all kinds of environments from the harsh cold north of the Scandinavian countries and Canada to the hot deserts of Arabia and to the jungles of Africa and they all thrive, not forgetting their homes back in Somalia to which they still contribute to its recovery from the imposed long civil war. Somalia’s richness is its people, first and foremost, and despite its family quarrels, they have stuck together and survived some of the most brutal exposures to cousin killing another cousin to exposures of wastes buried in its seas and even in its lands to invasions by neighboring countries like Kenya and Ethiopia and some Arab Gulf countries. There is now the talk of the mediation by Türkiye of the Somalia and Ethiopia disputes. It was actually another invasion of Somalia’s integrity and sovereignty by Ethiopia. Somalia had to defend itself and it did quite well on the diplomatic front. On the physical front, Ethiopia poured so many of its soldiers into Somalia, without permission from Somalia. This appears not have been addressed in the Ankara Declaration. Was Somalia’s arm twisted again to accept whatever was handed over to it? It is not clear. Türkiye, no doubt is working for its own interests and Somalis should be aware of that. The graceful hand that Türkiye extended to Somalia at a weak moment of its history should not be forgotten, though, for always. Somalia is still rewarding Türkiye for that kindness. The partnership contracts on the oil and gas and the resources of its seas of Somalia are but examples of what Somalia has done for Türkiye, so far, without tendering as this should have been. Somalia is a poor country on the surface, but it is a rich country, should all its resources be exploited, at least, at 25%. The resources include not only its location but its long and beautiful beaches which can be converted into a tourist heaven through the construction of first-class hotels and resorts, where tourists can enjoy the warm blue waters of the country throughout the year at reasonable prices lower than most other tourist destinations across the globe. Construction of a rail line just along its coast from its furthest west point at Loya Ado near Djibouti, following the Gulf of Aden and turning at the stunning Horn of Africa at Ras Asir to the south all the way to Ras Kiamboni would be a great journey many would enjoy. The arable land space of the country can feed some 163 million people. It has about 8.1 million hectares of arable lands and a much bigger lands space for animal rearing where some of the largest animal populations of Africa live. According to AI Overview, Somalia has 7.1 million of camels, 5.3 million of cattle, 30.9 million of goats, and 13.6 million of goats. It has also may different kinds of birds, 727 species of them, including eight endemic species - Somali pigeon, Black boubou, Lesser hoopoe-lark, Archer's lark, Ash's bushlark, Somali bushlark, Obbia lark, and the Warsangli linnet. The national animal of Somalia is the leopard, while the national bird of the country is the superb starling, and its national plant is the king protea. The country is inhabited by one people, the Somali, who are homogenous in tongue, religion, and language and despite the quarrels they have, still live together in the same clusters anywhere in the world. The people are organized into clans who intermarry and are therefore interrelated. Despite the wars and struggles, they all help each other and the clan structure, which most see as the disaster in the country, is also the saviour of the country. It is a sword with two edges, which if used positively can reproduce the pre-conflict Somalis, who were all brothers and sisters despite the differences in political views. As noted earlier, its people is the best asset that Somalia has. The country has a rich heritage and is also resource rich and such a combination can forge a successful and lively society in the region. Somali politicians, who seem to be the main stumbling block as they pursue their political agendas, need not rely on the cheating foreigners who control them. they should revert to their Somali-ness. Being a nationalist but with some vision for the nation will be more helpful than the personal agendas, which they currently pursue. One may also read my previous article in Eurasiareview.com and entitled: Somalia: Resilience In The Face Of Relentless Assaults – Analysis, dated July 16th, 2024. It is a more expose of the resilience of Somali people and the harsh environments they were exposed to over the years. With a population of some 32 million at present and growing, the land space of Somalia and its maritime space, will be able to provide the needs of the country. But this needs quite a shift in the attitudes of the political class which is currently busy enriching themselves at the expense of their people. It is the main curse of the country. The successful business class of the country can and should play better in helping raise a more efficient and more productive political class that can contribute to the growth of their businesses and development of the country in the process.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWemAQr5P7Qc6SRsehwduQ-7	2024-12-14T15:34:15-08:00	
Ukraine War As A Humanitarian Crisis: Call For A Shift In Interna...	The war in Ukraine has precipitated one of the most acute humanitarian devastations in recent history, resulting in disastrous impacts for millions of civilians. The intensifying conflicts have uprooted millions, disrupted vital healthcare, aggravated gender-based violence (GBV), and generated significant socio-economic vulnerabilities, especially among women, children, and marginalized groups. As the major geopolitical players used to concentrate predominantly on military support, this crisis necessitates a reevaluation of priorities to highlight humanitarian relief and peacebuilding initiatives. The protracted war has resulted in the displacement of around 6.7 million Ukrainians, predominantly seeking refuge in EU nations, while a further 3.7 million are internally displaced. Among the 14.6 million individuals in Ukraine necessitating immediate humanitarian aid. This humanitarian disaster affected 4 million women of reproductive age and 2.6 million youth, a significant number of them are internally displaced persons (IDPs). Ukrainian refugees in EU nations are encountering significant difficulties, with 2.2 million in need of humanitarian assistance. Marginalized populations, particularly individuals with disabilities—14% in Ukraine and 6% among refugees—face increased vulnerability, underscoring the critical necessity for inclusive and focused interventions. The war has also seriously affected Ukraine's healthcare system; female reproductive healthcare suffers especially terrible effects. Many times, without access to secure delivery facilities or prenatal and postnatal treatment, pregnant and nursing women emphasizing the widening disparity in basic services, the International Federation for Human Rights notes the great toll the war takes on women's sexual and reproductive rights. Premature births have been increasing significantly; some clinics, including one in Kharkiv, now account for three times the average rate, 50% of all newborns. Stress, starvation, infections, and poor medical support—all of which the war aggravates—could be held responsible for these issues. Attacks on healthcare institutions and air raid sirens have added more problems since late-stage pregnant women and newborns usually cannot be relocated to subterranean bunkers in an emergency. These disturbances draw attention to the junction of conflict with the pressing need of protection of reproductive healthcare. Commercial surrogacy, which is allowed in Ukraine, has also been adversely impacted. The war has put surrogate mothers and newborns in dangerous situations, as there are around 2,000 surrogate births for foreign parents each year. Some surrogacy organizations have built bunkers for mothers and their children, while others have pushed mothers into staying in Ukraine for birth under pain of imprisonment. Documentation issues hinder the process, preventing surrogate-born infants from lawfully exiting the country. This terrible circumstance demonstrates how conflict exacerbates the vulnerabilities of women and children. The war has severely impacted education for millions of children and young people. Schools have been damaged or converted as emergency shelters, limiting pupils' access to formal instruction. According to UNICEF, around 5.7 million school-aged children are affected, with many relying on online learning platforms or informal community-based education efforts. Young people in Ukraine are among the most affected by the conflict, with 2.6 million requiring specific interventions. UNFPA has initiated projects in Dnipropetrovsk, Donetsk, and Luhansk to promote young resilience, mental health, and socioeconomic empowerment. These programs are especially important for IDPs, providing avenues to recovery and long-term stability. However, the magnitude of the problem necessitates increased foreign assistance to enable the successful execution of such programs. The violence has greatly increased the risk of GBV, with the UNFPA claiming that almost 98,000 people have benefited from GBV preventive and response services. Crisis centers and safe places have been built in Ukraine to assist survivors, such as the Dnipro day center and the Kramatorsk crisis room. Neighboring countries have also responded to the issue, with Belarus providing safe locations for refugee women, including older women and those with impairments. Initiatives like Poland's 'Living Library' allow survivors to tell their stories and seek help, while digital tools like Romania's Safe You app raise awareness and improve service accessibility. Despite these efforts, GBV remains widespread. Family stress, displacement, and socioeconomic issues all used to contribute to the increasing violence against women and girls. Comprehensive solutions that address both urgent needs and systemic challenges are critical for safeguarding vulnerable people. The inflow of refugees into EU countries has put a tremendous pressure on host states. Moldova, for example, has endeavored to offer affordable health coverage for Ukrainian women refugees aged of 18 to 55 with temporary protection status. Medical equipment donations, such as blood collection chairs for emergency obstetric care, are one way to boost healthcare systems. Meanwhile, Belarus has set up safe areas for vulnerable refugee women, including those with impairments. However, obstacles persist, particularly in guaranteeing continuous access to healthcare and documents for displaced people. Sexual abuse has emerged as a worrisome issue in the Ukrainian conflict. Reports of rape and sexual exploitation, especially against women and girls, highlight sexual violence as a weapon of war. Survivors face tremendous stigma, with limited access to healthcare and little psychosocial support. Addressing this issue requires a robust international response that holds offenders accountable and provides justice for survivors. Crisis centers, legal aid, and mental health services must be extended to address the growing needs of those affected. International Focus on Military Aid vs. Humanitarian Needs The major players’ response to the Ukraine crisis has primarily focused on military aid, which, while important for defense and security, has overshadowed the urgent humanitarian needs of millions of civilians affected by the war. The U.S. and NATO's emphasis on military assistance risks neglecting the broader human cost of the conflict. A shift in focus is necessary, redirecting some military aid toward humanitarian relief to address critical gaps in healthcare, gender-based violence (GBV) prevention, and youth support. Key areas for improvement include rebuilding healthcare infrastructure, expanding reproductive health services, and supporting survivors of GBV. Empowering grassroots initiatives and local organizations is essential for sustainable, community-driven solutions. The international community must recalibrate its approach to prioritize humanitarian aid alongside military support to alleviate immediate suffering and lay the groundwork for long-term recovery and stability. Strengthening healthcare infrastructure is critical, with a focus on rebuilding facilities, particularly maternal and neonatal care centers, and establishing mobile clinics and telemedicine options for remote areas. Expanding GBV prevention and response mechanisms is urgent, requiring more crisis centers, safe spaces, and digital tools to improve access to support services. Community-driven programs that prevent violence and support survivors are also necessary. Supporting youth resilience and empowerment is significant, with a need for mental health and socio-economic programs, as well as accessible education and vocational training for young people, especially internally displaced persons (IDPs). Addressing systemic barriers to aid and recovery through inclusive policies and legal frameworks is crucial to meet the needs of marginalized groups. Closing the funding gap is paramount, with a call for additional resources from international donors to address the $44 million shortfall identified by humanitarian organizations. Transparency in fund allocation is essential to maximize the impact of spending on urgent interventions. Fostering Peacebuilding Solutions Finally, peacebuilding solutions must be prioritized in the response, with diplomatic attempts to de-escalate hostilities and address the core causes of the conflict. A comprehensive approach that blends immediate humanitarian help with long-term peacebuilding efforts is required to alleviate suffering and support Ukraine's recovery. The scale of the humanitarian catastrophe is overwhelming, but financing remains insufficient. UNFPA has raised $61 million of the $105 million required to meet the needs of conflict-affected communities, leaving a $44 million gap. This financing imbalance jeopardizes the delivery of critical services such as sexual and reproductive health (SRH) care, GBV response programs, and youth resilience initiatives. The scarcity of resources is especially harmful to vulnerable individuals in conflict-affected areas, whose demands are increasing as the war continues. Conclusion The humanitarian catastrophe in Ukraine serves as a sharp reminder of how catastrophic war can be for civilians. From the disruption of reproductive health care to the rise in GBV and the hardship of displaced communities, the war has a massive human cost. While organizations such as the UNFPA have made tremendous progress in tackling these issues, persistent financing deficits and the international community's emphasis on military aid limit the extent of humanitarian efforts. A rebalancing of international priorities is critical. By focusing humanitarian relief and peacebuilding solutions, the U.S., NATO, and other global players can reduce millions' immediate suffering, respect human rights, and develop pathways to recovery.

Chinese Migrants In US Illegally Uneasy After Fourth Removal Flig...	By Bo Gu After more than two years of separation, Chinese migrant Duan Chunxia, 51, recently met face to face with her husband and daughter at Stewart Detention Center, a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement facility in Georgia. 'My wife has lost a lot of weight, and her hair turned gray,' her husband, Ni Jinfang, told VOA Mandarin in an emotional video interview. 'Our daughter cried so much when she saw her mother. Her tears were all over her face and neck.' That tearful reunion on December 1 was the latest in an emotional roller-coaster ride for the family as they’ve separately come to the United States seeking political asylum. Following the COVID-19 pandemic, there was a surge in Chinese nationals entering the United States illegally and seeking asylum. Over the past year, those numbers have dwindled, and U.S. authorities are stepping up efforts to send a growing number back to China. There is also increasing concern among undocumented migrants from China about President-elect Donald Trump’s pledge to carry out mass deportations. Deportation flights Just days after Duan met with her family, she was scheduled to be sent back to China on a U.S. government-chartered removal flight. That flight departed Monday, but Duan was not on it. Following a second asylum interview, authorities agreed to give her more time to appeal the deportation order. The charter flight marked the fourth time in six months that the United States has deported undocumented migrants back to China. Three previous flights in June, October and November carried a total of at least 350 Chinese citizens back to their homeland. The last previous large-scale repatriation occurred in 2018. Growing cooperation In a statement Wednesday, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) said the flight 'is yet another example of the department’s ongoing cooperation with [China] and other international partners to deter irregular migration.' It added that DHS and its counterparts in China 'also continue joint work to counter the human smuggling networks that facilitate irregular migration.' DHS did not say how many migrants were on the flight. Chen Chuangchuang, an immigration lawyer in California, told VOA Mandarin that the Chinese and U.S. governments have cooperated more closely on immigration issues this year than previously. 'In the past, China rarely cooperated with the U.S. government in accepting illegal migrants,' Chen told VOA in a December phone interview. 'China has recently exchanged prisoners with the U.S. many times and also accepted undocumented people. [Chinese leader] Xi Jinping calls it ‘law enforcement cooperation’ rather than ‘border and immigration issues.’ ' How they arrived Ni, 53, and the couple’s 18-year-old daughter entered the U.S. on tourist visas in 2022. After Duan’s husband and daughter left China, she applied for a tourist visa the following year, but her application was rejected. More than one year after that, in late September, she illegally entered the U.S., crossing the southern border with Mexico. Duan made the hazardous journey through Ecuador and then traveled overland through Colombia, Central America and Mexico to the U.S. border. Both Duan and Ni are from China’s central city of Suzhou, just outside Shanghai. The city is relatively wealthy but human rights violations are not unheard of. In 2012, Ni lost his house and land following a government-led forced demolition. He tried to sue the local government in 2013 but was not given a chance to file his lawsuit. He continued to petition the government without result. In 2016, Ni was assaulted by local police officers and put in jail for 171 days for the crime of 'disturbing public order.' Ni continued to speak against the Chinese government after coming to the United States and participated in a protest in San Francisco last November, when Xi visited the city for the APEC summit and met with U.S. President Joe Biden. Panicking Another Chinese immigrant who entered the United States last year via the same route as Duan and is now living in New York state spoke with VOA on the condition that his name not be used because of his undocumented status. In a telephone interview, he said that with the recent deportations and Trump’s pledges, many in the Chinese immigrant community are a little panicked. 'After he takes office, everyone will be worried about being deported, not just us illegal immigrants,' he said. 'The ones with green cards, aren’t they afraid, too?' Before entering the United States, this man said he had openly criticized Xi on Chinese social media. He said that if he is deported, he will undoubtedly face a prison sentence in China. The man, who is in his 30s, has already begun applying for political asylum and is still hopeful. 'Although I don't like this result [Trump's victory], this is the choice of the American people, and there is nothing I can do. We are all entering an uncertain era, and everyone's future is uncertain,' he said. Immigration lawyer Chen said that Chinese immigrants in the U.S. who have not yet obtained legal status do face a 'real threat.' 'The Republicans have already occupied both houses [of Congress], and conservatives also have a clear advantage in the Supreme Court,' he said. 'We can say with absolute certainty that the second Trump administration will have way more resources, in terms of manpower, law and finances, to support the implementation of his deportation plan. This is bound to happen.' However, Chen does not think that all Chinese immigrants who apply for asylum will be unsuccessful. 'For those who have a deportation order, if you have a legal reason to apply to stay in the U.S., there is still a chance for review. It’s not easy though. The standard will be raised,' Chen said, adding that individuals need to prove that they will be persecuted if they return to their home country.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWemAQr5P7Qc6fuP9FjDlTjT	2024-12-14T15:29:35-08:00	
Russia And Ukraine May Agree To Ceasefire In 2025, But Peace Not ...	Over the course of 2024, both participants and observers of Russia’s war on Ukraine have frequently changed their assessments of its likely outcome. Some once predicted the victory of one side, then shifted to predicting the triumph of the other, only to reverse themselves again at a later point (see EDM, January 16, July 1). This behavior, of course, was on view even earlier in the conflict (see EDM December 13, 20, 2023, January 28.) On the one hand, this pattern reflects changing definitions in Kyiv and Moscow as to what victory would look like (Window on Eurasia, September 1). On the other hand, these shifting assessments are the product of major changes in the performance of the two forces on the battlefield, the domestic situations the two countries find themselves in because of the war, and the changing constellation of forces in the international system. As the war heads into 2025, however, a consensus is emerging that some kind of agreement that will end the fighting can and will be reached in the coming months (The Moscow Times, December 6; Gazeta.ru, December 7). The evolution of the war during 2024 strongly suggests that achieving even a mere ceasefire would be extremely difficult. Likewise, any accord that does emerge will be, at most, a truce rather than a peace. Both countries would use a ceasefire to rebuild and expand their forces. Russia will do so because President Vladimir Putin’s war in Ukraine has always been about a greater conflict with the West (Window on Eurasia, September 1, November 10). Ukraine will do so because Russia will remain an existential threat to its territorial integrity and sovereignty unless Moscow is fundamentally transformed, something that may not happen anytime soon (The Moscow Times, December 5). Kyiv will have an interest in pursuing a truce—especially if, given the sad history of Western security guarantees beginning with the Budapest Memorandum more than two decades ago, the West does not offer it membership in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) (see EDM, September 24, 2009, March 10, 2014; Window on Eurasia, November 15, 2022). Consequently, Moscow and Kyiv will try to present any such agreement as a triumph that will guarantee 'peace in our time,' something they and their propagandists can be counted on to do. There is every reason to believe that 2025 will be marked both by political scrambles involving all the relevant international parties and by major security moves by Russia and Ukraine, even if the guns fall silent along the front. A ceasefire will in all likelihood result in many assuming that the conflict is over. This assumption would be fundamentally incorrect, as the duration of the truce would be used by Moscow to test the West’s resolve in Ukraine and elsewhere. Similarly, Kyiv would necessarily spend the time preparing to defend itself against future Russian attacks—something made all the more likely by the dwindling military assistance it is expected to receive. The most important change in 2024 has been the scaling back of both sides’ definitions of victory. For Putin, the war in Ukraine has always been part of a larger campaign against the West, but it became increasingly apparent over the last 12 months that he is currently more interested in inflicting a massive defeat of the West in Ukraine than full territorial annexation (Window on Eurasia, September 1, November 10). The Kremlin may have even come to recognize that absorbing all of Ukraine would be counterproductive (Window on Eurasia, March 17, 2022). Extracting concessions from the West about what it will and will not do for Ukraine—including promises not to provide Kyiv with arms, admit it to NATO, or continue sanctions against Russia for its aggression in Ukraine—is now more important to the Kremlin leader than simply gaining territory. In achieving these goals, Putin would show the world and the Russian people that he has the power to compel the West to concede. That will, in turn, impact both the former Soviet republics—which Putin believes should be part of a Russian sphere of influence—and countries further afield. Simultaneously, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy concedes now that Kyiv will not be able to retake all the territories Russia has seized since 2014 by force of arms and will require time to recover from the Russian onslaught (RG.ru, December 9). Consequently, some offer of a security guarantee from the West and the chance to further strengthen Ukraine’s defense establishment with Western help would constitute a victory for Zelenskyy at this point. If these shifts have changed the underlying negotiating positions of the two sides, developments on the front and the expansion of what constitutes 'the battlefield' have also changed what is likely to occur in 2025. The quality and rapidity of such changes, however, are a reminder that those who expect the future to be a continuation of current trends are likely to be disappointed. In 2024, Ukraine promised a major counterattack but did not carry it out. Instead, it radically expanded its drone attacks on facilities in Russia and even invaded Russia’s Kursk oblast (see EDM, August 14, 15). Moscow threw enough forces at the frontlines to block the much-ballyhooed Ukrainian offensive, recover about half of Kursk’s territory occupied by Ukraine, and continue its advance into Ukrainian areas. The Russian offensive proceeds slowly and at great cost in terms of life and treasure, and their forces have shot down many, but far from all, Ukrainian drones targeting Russian territory (The Kyiv Independent, November 11). As each of these events occurred, many commentators in Moscow, Kyiv, and the West shifted their predictions about the future, though these predictions were then compelled to change again as the war progressed. Behind these changes on the battlefield, larger and potentially more important domestic changes have occurred in the two countries most directly involved. In Russia, Putin continues to enjoy public support for his war. Evidence suggests that said support is more broad than deep, with most Russians prepared to say they back Putin’s actions, but ever fewer willing to sacrifice anything in support of the war (see EDM, September 10). As a result, the Kremlin has worked hard to treat the war as distant as possible from the concerns of ordinary Russians. In 2024, for example, Moscow was unable to conduct a general mobilization because of popular opposition and the risk of a new emigration by the country’s military age population. Instead, the Kremlin has been forced to pardon criminals who agree to serve, offer ever larger bonuses (several times the average yearly wage in most regions) to get men to sign up, and bring in foreigners to fight its battles (see EDM, October 24). The war has come home and is now affecting ordinary Russians’ daily lives. Money that previously went to social programs is being reallocated to military ones, inflation is rising, and many goods are no longer available because of sanctions (see EDM, October 3, 21). The Ukrainian advance into Kursk oblast and the increasing number of drone attacks deeper into Russia and on Moscow itself has brought the fighting to everyday Russians’ doorsteps. The return of Russian men in coffins, the appearance of ever more former soldiers disfigured by war ds on Russian streets, and the rising number of otherwise-healthy veterans with PTSD and other psychological conditions may affect Russian society the most (Window on Eurasia, November 23; see EDM, January 19, July 16, 24, November 19, 27). The longer the war goes on, the greater the effects of all these factors will be—and the more problems Moscow will have with a population that is increasingly divided about the war. The Kremlin fears these effects’ influence on the war’s popularity will persist, making it harder to ignore how many sacrifices have been made with less to show for them than Russian propagandists suggest (Window on Eurasia, December 3). Ukraine also faces a series of internal problems, including but not limited to difficulties raising enough troops, war weariness, and damage to property, particularly housing and hospitals. The rising number of deaths due to the war and emigration exacerbated by the conflict are both intensifying the country’s demographic decline and causing difficulties in many sectors of the economy. While these get less attention abroad than the difficulties Russia faces (except in Russian media), they too contribute to issues within Ukrainian society (see EDM July 18, October 18;Window on Eurasia, July 28). The changing international environment is also having a greater impact on the war than it has previously. Widespread war weariness exists in many Western countries. This has helped power the rise of right-wing populist governments that are more isolationist than their predecessors and willing to defer to regional hegemons such as Russia—especially if they see economic advantages for themselves in doing so (Ukraina.ru, December 8). The election of Donald Trump as US president is part of this trend, as he has pledged to end the war in Ukraine quickly and restart relations with Russia, even if such a move would require putting enormous pressure on Kyiv. For Ukraine, this might mean threats of a major scaling back in or a potential end to US assistance entirely. European countries are trying to devise ways to assist Ukraine if this comes to pass, but given the continent’s problems, it is uncertain whether they have the ability and/or will to do so (The Kyiv Independent, November 18). These changes have sparked hopes in Russia and fears in Ukraine that the West, in general, and the United States, in particular, will seek a settlement in Ukraine to allow for a drawdown of Western efforts. Even with all these developments, reaching a ceasefire will be difficult. Working to ensure that such an accord will, in turn, lead to peace appears to be harder still. The first step toward a ceasefire, the shift in international conversations from total victory or defeat toward cries for ending the bloodletting and sanctions, has already occurred. That being said, as the most thoughtful Russian commentators have noted, Putin is not currently compelled to seek a ceasefire. He has enough resources to continue his war on Ukraine for a long time. In the words of social and economic analyst Sergei Shelin, Putin certainly does not want a truce with Kyiv 'but might agree to one' for several reasons: the war is costing more than expected, his imperialism is increasingly at odds with the nationalism of the Russian people, and the population itself is tired of war (The Moscow Times, December 6). Consequently, Putin has the ability to drag his feet, hoping the West will make more concessions to Moscow and force Ukraine to go along with them. After all, the Kremlin leader knows that he will be able to present almost anything he ultimately gets as a Russian victory (Kasparov.ru, December 2). Putin also is aware that once a ceasefire is in place, the West is likely to redirect its attention elsewhere. This would make it easier for Putin to conduct additional activities across the former Soviet space and, more generally, rebuild his military capabilities. This is precisely what policymakers in Ukraine fear and why Kyiv will cautiously approach any talks about a ceasefire, even if there is a desire to bring an end to the war. More than that, precisely because the West appears so ready to make concessions to Moscow and is so reluctant to provide credible security guarantees to Kyiv in the form of NATO membership—a deal killer for Moscow—Ukraine is certain to be forced to consider how it can defend itself in the future (see EDM, July 18, August 6, 7, 14 [1], [2]). This would necessitate strengthening its already powerful drone industry, building up its armed forces, and potentially developing nuclear weapons. That final step is far more unlikely, regardless of Russian propaganda around the possibility of Ukraine re-joining the nuclear club (see EDM,July 8, October 8, November 8, 13, 21). Kyiv will have an interest in expanding the portion of its arsenal that is domestically produced to avoid being subject to a Western veto over how its weapons are used, something that has been a problem up to now (see EDM, June 4). No shortcut to peace between Russia and Ukraine exists, and a rapid pursuit of a ceasefire by the West in pursuit of peace could backfire, raising the risk of an even larger conflagration in the future (see EDM, October 21). Some Russian commentators are already warning about such a possibility (T.me/dimitriy_savvin, October 31, reposted atKasparov.ru, November 11; Izvestiya, December 9). Western policymakers’ have feared that offering NATO accession to Ukraine risks Russian escalation. On the contrary, a willingness to make concessions in the pursuit of peace could make a broader war with Russia more likely.

The New ‘Baltic Way’: Assessing The Baltic Defensive Line Concept...	By Kevin Ryan On August 23rd, 1989, an estimated two million citizens from the countries of Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania linked arms to form a human chain spanning the 600 km distance between the respective capitals of Tallinn, Riga, and Vilnius. The peaceful protest marked 50 years since the secret agreement known as the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact between Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union, which the USSR used to justify occupation of the Baltic nations in 1940. The so-called Baltic Way demonstration influenced the Soviets to invalidate the pact, a crucial step in the eventual recognition of independence in the Baltic states. Now the Baltic nations embark on a new kind of Baltic Way, this time connecting military defensive perimeters on their eastern borders through a project called the Baltic Defence Line (BDL). Announced jointly by the three nations’ Ministers of Defense on January 19, 2024, the BDL is intended to connect 'anti-mobility installations' along the eastern flank of the region to deter Russian aggression and produce a capability to defend the territory 'from the first meter,' a reference to NATO’s 2022 Madrid Summit declaration, which agreed that the Alliance would 'protect our populations and defend every inch of Allied territory at all times.' Like its peaceful forbearer, the BDL is strengthened from the collective cooperation between the three nations, acknowledging that their relatively small defense budgets, lack of defensive depth, and shared history of Russian occupation make them more vulnerable when they stand alone. But the plans announced to date are quite parochial and have faced criticism for the inordinate cost to taxpayers and landholders. It also presents a one-dimensional solution to a multidimensional defense problem; one that the same Madrid communiqué defined as a '360-degree approach, across the land, air, maritime, cyber, and space domains, and against all threats and challenges,' a fact that Latvia was reminded of recently when a Russian drone penetrated its airspace and crashed 90 km inland. For the BDL to truly influence Russian decision-making and deter aggression, it must connect its defensive concepts in the same way its citizens connected their arms in the unbreakable chain between its capital cities, through sharing the burden of such a defense and inspiring collective action within their civilian populations to not only strengthen the physical space to defend but the will of the people to defend it. The Baltic Eastern Flank The hostile eastern flank of the Baltic region that borders Russia and its ally Belarus is approximately 1,360 km (~845 miles). Lithuania’s hostile border includes a western flank with the Russian exclave Kaliningrad Oblast, adding 275 km (~171 miles) to its defensive problem. Lithuania is also the principal defender among the Baltic nations for the Suwałki corridor, its 90 km border with Poland that is the shortest land bridge between Belarus and Kaliningrad. This analysis focuses on the hostile eastern flank only, but Lithuania’s western and Suwałki corridor dilemmas contribute to its defense posture. Estonia has the smallest hostile land border and enjoys terrain features like the Narva River, and Lakes Peipus and Pihkva, that restrict overland movement on its eastern flank and reduce its most vulnerable terrain down to approximately 210 km (~130 miles). Latvia shares a 387 km (~240 miles) border with both Russia and Belarus, with multiple rail and surface roads facilitating cross-border maneuver, and virtually no terrain features impeding overland movement. Lithuania is similarly situated to Latvia but with nearly two and half times the border area to cover, more rail and surface roads crossing its hostile borders, and capital just 40 km from Belarus. Baltic Defence Line Issues The first issue with the BDL is unequal burden sharing. Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania have each committed €60 million annually to the project, which is the cost estimate before factoring in land negotiations to install permanent defensive architecture in this area. €60 million is equal to 8% of the Latvian and Estonian defense budgets respectively, and only 2.8% of the Lithuanian defense budget. Reports also indicate that Lithuania will use this money to defend its western border and that the EU intends to defer some of the cost. The fact that Lithuania would pay the least but have the biggest defensive problem indicates that these estimates are unrealistic. For the BDL to be transparent and truly cooperative, it must achieve equal burden sharing relative to the percentage of each country’s defense budget. The next issue is the cost to landholders in the eastern region of the Baltic nations. It is safe to assume that significant concessions from the government will be needed to convince citizens to give up parts of their land for peacetime war preparations, and surveys suggest that ethnic identity could further complicate the negotiations in Estonia and Latvia. According to a 2024 survey commissioned by the Ministry of Defense, 67% of ethnic Estonians would give up their land to defense forces if Estonia was attacked, as opposed to only 38% of non-ethnic Estonians. The Estonian plan features construction and installation of approximately 600 bunkers, some of which would be built in Ida-Viru county in northeast Estonia; the only county in Estonia where ethnic Russians outnumber ethnic Estonians at a rate of 3.5 to one. In Latvia, at the major ground crossing points in the municipalities of Ludza, Viļaka, and Daugavpils, the percentage of ethnic Russians is higher than the national average, and Russian is the dominant ethnicity in the Belarussian border municipality of Daugavpils. Even in southeast Estonia, where the majority of the bunkers would need to be emplaced and the ethnic Estonian population outnumbers the Russian population three to one, citizens have sought to halt the expansion of the Nursipalu training area, signaling that even ethnic Estonians on the front line with Russia are uncomfortable with the government taking their land. While prepared defensive positions have helped impose high costs on the Russian armed forces in Ukraine, the Latvian and Estonian land acquisition plans — particularly in areas where ethnic Russians live — could risk escalating tensions with Russia, which has used flimsier pretexts for defending its diaspora in the past. The Lithuanian plan to preposition engineer assets in critical locations is a more preferred way to establish these defensive positions and avoid costly land grabs. Additionally, highly mobile artillery systems, man-portable air defense and anti-tank systems, and large amounts of low-cost unmanned aerial vehicles are a few examples of how to keep the cost-to-kill ratio low, trade space for time, and stay out of citizens’ backyards during peacetime. The countries should also spend money on conducting annual joint exercises with active and reserve soldiers on each other’s borders to ensure they understand how to hand off potential targets along the BDL — a critical demonstration for an integrated defensive posture. The last issue with the BDL addressed here is the willingness and capability of the citizenry to defend, using Estonia’s defensive problem and the October 2023 Hamas attack on Israel for context. Estonia maintains an active-duty force of 4,200 across all components, with 38,800 reservists in 'permanent readiness' status, and up to 230,000 citizens who have 'military obligations' but do not actively practice. If the 600 proposed bunkers are to be manned immediately, it will come from the regional ready reserve forces who will need to exercise this mission at least twice a year to follow the Israeli reserve model. At the 2024 Annual Baltic Conference on Defence, a senior Israeli military official recounted the mobilization of Israeli reserve forces in response to the Hamas attack on October 7, 2023, observing that the country’s reservists helped resecure Israel’s border with Gaza in a matter of hours. For context, Israel secured a border that is approximately 59 km (~37 miles), with established defensive positions, against a non-state actor, and a seasoned reserve force that is estimated to be 220,000. Estonia, which has the simplest ground defensive problem of any of the Baltic nations, must secure a border 3.5 times larger than the size of Israel’s border with Gaza, against a determined nation-state actor, with less than one-fifth of the combat power. Moreover, only 48.5% of Estonians in the 20-39-year-old demographic would commit to taking up arms to defend their country. Conclusion – A ‘Baltic Way’ Defence Line Suppose the defense establishments of the Baltic nations want to present a credible deterrent across their eastern flank. In that case, they must share the cost of such an endeavor and put those funds toward useful purchases, like weapon platforms that have seen success on the battlefield in Ukraine, and large-scale exercises including mass mobilization of reservists and cross-border coordination. They must not disenfranchise the segment of their population most susceptible to Russian influence, or inadvertently provide Russia pretext for defending the Russian diaspora. Most importantly, they must harness the spirit of the Baltic Way and inspire their citizens to want to defend every inch of their territory by metaphorically locking arms across the eastern flank of the Baltics.

War, Revolution, And Ambition – OpEd	There are several wars happening in the world at present – those in the Middle East, the one in Ukraine, and recently the renewed war in Syria. Anyone who has kept track of the connections between these and the encompassing attempt, by a bunch of globalists, to bring about a totalitarian world government, will know that these wars are an integral part of this global putsch. Could it be, however, that the outcomes of these wars (which are by no means a foregone conclusion) could perhaps promote the interests of the worldwide Resistance against the globalist cabal? Hannah Arendt, writing in the early 1960s, seems to have been prescient about what would be happening from 2022 onwards, and it is worthwhile taking note of her insights in this regard. In her book, On Revolution, she writes (Penguin Books, 1990, p. 11): Wars and revolutions…have thus far determined the physiognomy of the twentieth century. And as distinguished from the nineteenth-century ideologies – such as nationalism and internationalism, capitalism and imperialism, socialism and communism, which, though still invoked by many as justifying causes, have lost contact with the major realities of our world – war and revolution still constitute its two central political issues. They have outlived all their ideological justifications. In a constellation that poses the threat of total annihilation through war against the hope for the emancipation of all mankind through revolution – leading one people after the other in swift succession ‘to assume among the powers of the earth the separate and equal station to which the Laws of Nature and of Nature’s God entitle them’ – no cause is left but the most ancient of all, the one, in fact, that from the beginning of our history has determined the very existence of politics, the cause of freedom versus tyranny. One might think that her reference to ‘the threat of total annihilation through war,’ which reflects the danger, around the time of the Cuban missile crisis, of nuclear conflict, would invalidate her earlier claim, that at the time ‘war and revolution still constitute[d] its two central political issues,’ and leave only (nuclear) war as the decisive political issue. This would be erroneous, however, considering that the passage concludes with the claim that the only remaining cause, and the oldest one, is ‘the cause of freedom versus tyranny,’ which unambiguously brings revolution back into the picture. Why? Because at present, when the threat of nuclear conflict has been resurrected, we face the biggest threat to our freedom that has ever existed. Think about it: all the struggles for freedom in the past have either been restricted to certain countries – such as during the American and French revolutions – or, on the largest scale before now, during the two World Wars of the 20th century, when several countries were directly involved in the conflicts, although arguably the rest of the world was also implicated. But now it is different. The ambition of the billionaire class is nothing less than total domination; that is, total control of everyone (and everything) on the planet. In other words, the only thing that could stop them is a global revolution, but to accomplish that, it appears that the wars that are raging at present need to be won by those who oppose the globalists, or alternatively defused through peaceful negotiations (which is not likely regarding the Ukraine war), to stop the tyrants in their tracks. Or is it more complicated than that? While it may be difficult to name the anti-globalist parties in the Middle East, the one in Ukraine is easy to identify. It is Russia. I know that many people would disagree with me because they have fallen for the demonisation of President Vladimir Putin by the West’s mainstream media, but there is overwhelming evidence that Putin and Russia are on the side of the people, as I have argued before. Perhaps the best evidence for this claim is the apparent determination of NATO – the attack dog of the neo-fascists – to trigger a ‘hot’ world war in Ukraine, regardless of its demonstrable potential to escalate to a nuclear level, which would cause incalculable death and destruction globally. If Russia did not stand in the way of their megalomaniacal quest, there would be no reason to continue the war indefinitely. There would have been no reason to send Boris Johnson to torpedo the Istanbul peace talks in 2022. No – as far as the cabal is concerned, the macabre ‘show’ must go on because – apart from their end goal of dystopian rule – the longer it continues, the more people (mainly Ukrainians) die in the service of what I believe to be their depopulation agenda. The kind of revolution required today, to gain freedom from oppression on an unimaginable scale, is nothing less than a global revolution. Kees Van der Pijlunderstands this clearly when he writes (in States of Emergency, Clarity Press, 2022, p. 8-9): Society as we know it—global capitalism with its home base in the West —has entered a revolutionary crisis. After years of preparation, the ruling oligarchy, which today exercises power across the globe, has seized on the outbreak of the SARS-CoV-2 virus and the respiratory disease attributed to it, Covid-19, to declare a global state of emergency in early 2020. This seizure of power is intended to prevent the Information Technology revolution…the impact of which can be compared to that of the coming of the printing press at the end of the Middle Ages, from ushering in a democratic transformation… Although he does not mention this here, the information technology revolution – which is precisely what has enabled ‘digital warriors’ in the (not yet co-opted) alternative media such as Brownstone, Real Left, and FRONTNIEUWS, to fight back through the internet (to the chagrin of WEF-puppet John Kerry) – cannot carry the revolution by itself, although it comprises an indispensable component of its infrastructure. Military-type resistance is unavoidably required too, as the war in Ukraine demonstrates; without it, NATO as the servant of the globalist cabal cannot be defeated. The war in the Middle East may even escalate to that level, although I sincerely hope it doesn’t. Hannah Arendt reminds one that freedom has not always been seen as the ultimate aim of revolution (1990: 11-12): Under the concerted assault of the modern debunking ‘sciences,’ psychology and sociology, nothing indeed has seemed to be more safely buried than the concept of freedom. Even the revolutionists, whom one might have assumed to be safely and even inexorably anchored in a tradition that could hardly be told, let alone made sense of, without the notion of freedom, would much rather degrade freedom to the rank of a lower-middle-class prejudice than admit that the aim of revolution was, and always has been, freedom. Yet if it was amazing to see how the very word freedom could disappear from the revolutionary vocabulary, it has perhaps been no less astounding to watch how in recent years the idea of freedom has intruded itself into the centre of the gravest of all present political debates, the discussion of war and of a justifiable use of violence. If this was the case in the early 1960s, when the spectre of nuclear conflagration raised its ugly head, how much more isn’t this assessment justified today, when that unsightly prospect seems to be much more probable, not least because reason has evidently been abandoned in most quarters – from the US State Departmentthrough NATO to the EU Parliament, all of which seem, incomprehensible as it may be, to be eager for the war in Ukraine to escalate to the level of a ‘hot’ world war, if not a nuclear confrontation. In all of this, the only two leaders who have so far maintained a rational approach to the irrational fanning of war flames appear to be Vladimir Putin and Donald Trump, both of whom have repeatedly indicated their preference for peace negotiations. Moreover, just as ‘freedom,’ according to Arendt (1990, p. 14), was introduced into the debate on war around the 1960s ‘like a deus ex machina to justify what on rational grounds has become unjustifiable’ – given that the technical means of destruction in the guise of nuclear Armageddon could no longer justify their use rationally (civilians and soldiers could no longer be separated regarding probable death, that is) today we find a repetition of this dilemma, but with a twist. This concerns the spurious claim, with regard to the war in Ukraine, that America and NATO have to ‘stop Russian aggression’ by arming Ukraine and funding its war effort with unheard-of largesse, to secure the ‘democracy’ (which includes freedom, of course) that Ukrainians are (supposedly) entitled to. The mainstream media would never furnish one with the requisite information to corroborate this claim, being in the service of the ‘ruling elites,’ as it were; for this purpose, one has to avail oneself of as-yet uncaptured alternative media. Recent indications have been that the globalists, NATO, and the US would even be willing to risk World War III (and the possibility of a nuclear conflict) to guarantee Ukrainian ‘freedom.’ Arendt’s elaboration on ‘deterrence’ (1990, p. 15-17) is equally relevant today, insofar as its focus on the (nuclear) arms race during the Cold War – where, paradoxically, weapons capable of the complete annihilation of life on Earth in the event of war, were developed at frantic pace with the express purpose of preventing such a war – similarly applies to the conflict in Ukraine, but again with important differences and specifications. The first is that, compared to the Cold War, the restraint that was exercised by the hostile parties at the time – paradigmatically during the Cuban missile crisis – is clearly not evident today. Secondly, a novel element was introduced by Russia recently, with the ‘test firing’ of its new Oreshnik (Hazelnut) hypersonic missile which, while capable of delivering nuclear warheads, reportedly bears sufficient destructive capacity, even with conventional warheads, to inflict comparable damage, but without the radioactive fallout. Again, it is as if Arendt anticipated such an event where she writes about ‘…the threat of total annihilation, which conceivably could be eliminated by new technical discoveries such as a ‘clean’ bomb or an anti-missile missile’ (1990, p. 14), where the ‘clean’ bomb resonates with Russia’s hypersonic missile, the Oreshnik. By contrast, her observation (in the light of deterrence via nuclear arms development), ‘that a possible serious substitution of ‘cold’ wars for ‘hot’ wars becomes clearly perceptible at the horizon of international politics’ (1990, p. 16), appears to be inverted by current developments in Ukraine, where we witness the increasing likelihood that an openly hot war may replace a putative cold war between NATO and Russia. Unless, of course, Russia’s production of the Oreshnik missile should serve the (preferable) cause of maintaining a cold war. Today one may therefore even perceive similarities with Arendt’s hypothetical remark (1990, p. 16), that: ‘It is as though the nuclear armament race has turned into some sort of tentative warfare in which the opponents demonstrate to each other the destructiveness of the weapons in their possession,’ something which, she admitted, could ‘suddenly turn into the real thing.’ In light of the globalist cabal’s involvement in the conflict, chances are that activating the ‘real thing’ assumes the greater probability, simply because they would do everything in their power to precipitate the hot war, or even a nuclear war, regardless of its potential for demonstrable total mutual destruction; without it, the ultimate aim of this evil coterie, to achieve world domination, may remain a mere pipe dream. When they emerge from their (no doubt well-stocked) nuclear bunkers after a decade or more, they may find that there is not much left in the world to preside over, however. What does all of this have to do with the connection between war and revolution? Here I shall quote Arendt at length, given the pertinence of her insights for the fraught present (Arendt 1990, p. 17-18): There is finally, and in our context most importantly, the fact that the interrelationship of war and revolution, their reciprocation and mutual dependence, has steadily grown, and that the emphasis in the relationship has shifted more and more from war to revolution. To be sure, the interrelatedness of wars and revolutions as such is not a novel phenomenon; it is as old as the revolutions themselves, which either were preceded and accompanied by a war of liberation like the American Revolution, or led into wars of defence and aggression like the French Revolution. But in our own century there has arisen, in addition to such instances, an altogether different type of event in which it is as though even the fury of war was merely the prelude, a preparatory stage to the violence unleashed by revolution (such clearly was Pasternak’s understanding of war and revolution in Russia in Doctor Zhivago), or where, on the contrary, a world war appears like the consequences of revolution, a kind of civil war raging all over the earth as even the Second World War was considered by a sizeable portion of public opinion and with considerable justification. Twenty years later, it has become almost a matter of course that the end of war is revolution, and that the only cause which possibly could justify it is the revolutionary cause of freedom. Hence, whatever the outcome of our present predicaments may be, if we don’t perish altogether, it seems more than likely that revolution, in distinction to war, will stay with us into the foreseeable future. A perceptive reader would immediately notice the almost uncanny manner in which Arendt’s words apply to the current struggle in the world, on a global scale, which has culminated in ‘hot’ wars in Ukraine, the Middle East, and Syria, but which arguably started manifesting itself with the event of 9/11, in 2001, and again with the financial crisis of 2008. More definitively, it reared its ugly torso with the engineered ‘pandemic’ of 2020, since which time this struggle between the forces of evil – a term I use advisedly – and the forces of good has become too conspicuous to ignore. In Freudian terms, it is the struggle between Eros (love, constructive force) and Thanatos (death, destructive force), and it shows no signs of abating; on the contrary. More specifically, where do we stand regarding the sequential relationship between war and revolution, described as three alternatives by Arendt, above? Does the present war (or wars) precede, and promise, a revolution to follow (keeping in mind that the latter could similarly be marked by violence, as Arendt suggests), or the other way around, or do they go hand in hand, as with the American revolution? Considering what I wrote in the previous paragraph, it would appear that it is more complex than the alternatives she notes, because two kinds of revolution are at stake today. First, there is the ‘malign revolution’ launched by the globalist cabal, probably decades ago if one includes its planning stages, and which aims at replacing a constellation of sovereign nation-states with a one-world totalitarian government. Then there is the ‘benign revolution’ (or should it be ‘benign counter-revolution’?) driven by ‘We the people’ or the Resistance, which was provoked by the cabal’s attempt to kick-start their intended ‘total revolution,’ which has since stagnated somewhat, although they are tenaciously clinging to every means at their disposal, including war, to ram it through. Will war ever disappear, as Immanuel Kant hoped in the 18th century? Probably not, given Freud’s observation, that the tension between Eros and Thanatos (see above) can never be conclusively removed. And Arendt’s chilling comment, below, is not exactly reassuring either; in fact, it articulates exactly what the neo-fascists would love to see, and to use without any scruples (Arendt 1990, p. 17): Seventeen years after Hiroshima, our technical mastery of the means of destruction is fast approaching the point where all non-technical factors in warfare, such as troop morale, strategy, general competence, and even sheer chance, are completely eliminated so that results can be calculated with perfect precision in advance. My hunch is that these sociopaths would rely on AI for such cold-hearted calculations. It is too early to say with certainty who will triumph, but I tend to agree with Van der Pijl (2022, p. 9) that the totalitarian cabal is bound to lose (provided, of course, that they don’t trigger a nuclear conflagration): ‘…the entire effort at suppression is doomed to end in failure.’ Whatever happens, however, Arendt’s remark, above, that: ‘Twenty years later, it has become almost a matter of course that the end [note the ambiguity of this term: ‘end’ as conclusion or goal; B.O.] of war is revolution, and that the only cause which possibly could justify it is the revolutionary cause of freedom,’ remains in force, but with an important qualification; namely, that this statement is articulated from the perspective of the Resistance. This implies that the technocratic globalists could claim the same thing, minus the words, ‘the revolutionary cause of freedom,’ which they would replace with something like ‘the neo-fascist cause of total control.’ It is up to us, the Resistance, to make sure that human freedom prevails, because that (with all it entails) is all that is worth fighting for, whether as soldiers in a hot war or as digital warriors.

The Democratic Party Faces Its Day Of Reckoning – OpEd	Following its crushing defeat in the 2024 election, the Democratic Party might finally face its day of reckoning. The party markets itself as the champion of the working class and a bulwark against the party of the plutocrats. But this has been a lie for at least three decades. The Democratic Party has partnered with Wall Street donors since at least the 1990s. Under President Bill Clinton, the party overturned Glass Steagall and other New Deal programs that had effectively restrained Wall Street greed for 60 years. It also sold out American workers with so-called trade deals that freed their bosses to ship American jobs overseas. It ended welfare 'as we know it' and passed draconian crime bills that destroyed mostly black and brown communities, sending mothers and fathers to prison for decades in the name of a cruel and senseless war on drugs. Into the 21st century, the Democrats continued pushing the lie that they were fighting for working people. After September 11, 2001, the party put up a token resistance to the Bush/Cheney regime of illegal regime-change wars, black sites, indefinite detention and torture. All the while, it continued soliciting campaign contributions from the arms dealers profiting from Bush's wars. In 2008, the party found a Black face to carry on its Wall Street-friendly agenda. Gullible Americans, myself included, were taken in by Barack Obama's promises to end 'dumb wars' and to institute a single payer healthcare system. We ignored the red flags, like the fact that Obama's campaign broke records in pocketing Wall Street donations. It was later revealed by Wikileaks that nearly every member of Obama's cabinet had been selected by the giant Wall Street bank Citigroup. It didn't take long for President Obama to crush our hopes that he was a different kind of Democrat. One of his first acts as president was to funnel trillions of dollars to the big banks that, newly freed by Clinton from FDR-era regulations, had embarked on an orgy of unbridled greed, swindling millions of Americans out of their homes and retirement savings with a scheme to sell worthless mortgage-backed securities. Adding insult to injury, Obama saw to it that the bailed-out bank executives faced no criminal prosecutions and received their year-end bonuses. In their place, the Obama Justice Department brought federal mortgage fraud charges against thousands of poor people—I represented a half dozen of these folks—who had signed their names to the phony mortgage loans that the Wall Street bankers encouraged, packaged and sold to pension funds and other unwitting investors. The pipe dream that Obama would be an anti-war president was also quickly dispatched. During his two terms, Obama ushered in a new era of continuous war, envisioned by George Orwell and favored by Wall Street. Obama expanded Bush's bombing campaigns into Libya, Pakistan, Yemen, Syria and Somalia. Today's Democratic Party is indistinguishable from the Republicans in its ties to war profiteers and trillion-dollar Pentagon budgets. Obama also effectively ended the Democrats' promise to fight for a true national health care system in which all Americans would be able to go to the doctor when sick without fear of bankrupting their families. In its place, Obama pushed through a health care plan developed in right-wing think tanks, that guaranteed profits (and taxpayer subsidies) for the private insurance industry and did little to contain costs. By 2012, Glen Ford of the Black Agenda Report was describing the Democratic Party as the 'more effective evil' for using its reputation as protector of the working class to neutralize effective opposition and push through right-wing policies that the Republicans could not get passed. In 2016, the Democrats received a wake-up call when their chosen successor to Obama lost the White House to a crude-talking New York City real estate developer and game show host with no prior political experience. But with the help of its partners in corporate media, the party managed to limp along for another eight years, first by telling the American people that President Trump was an agent of Russia, and then by claiming that Trump was Hitler who was planning concentration camps and firing squads for his political enemies. Now after the November 2024 elections in which Trump won every swing state and the popular vote, the Democratic party is finally being forced to face some uncomfortable truths. The party's partners in the corporate media initially tried blaming the election result on the voters for being too misogynist, too racist, or too dumb to vote correctly. But there is little trust that remains in corporate media. The party's corporate consultants have put the blame on the party's excessive focus on identity politics. But the issues for the Democrats run much deeper than bad messaging. The real problem is that the party takes direction from plutocrats whose interests are antagonistic to the needs of the working people it pretends to represent. Both Democrats and Republicans are financed by the same corporate interests. Thus, there is general agreement and support for policies that guarantee high rates of return on investment capital, policies like continuous war, for-profit health care, and outsourcing jobs. This leaves few issues for the parties to fight about other than abortion and identity politics. Fifty years ago, American capitalists still relied on American workers to build everything from cars and televisions to sneakers and light bulbs. These titans of industry had to care about things such as functioning schools, decent wages, cities and public transportation. But the times have changed. Today's plutocrats support outsourcing jobs to low-wage countries and have little concern for the condition of American workers. And while ordinary Americans want the country's resources to be spent at home, plutocrats are heavily invested in foreign wars, and they shun diplomacy. These contradictions could only be covered up for so long. Even with reliable partners in the corporate press, the internet has given Americans alternative sources for their news. During the last few years, in a desperate effort to keep its scheme afloat, the Democrats embraced censorship and a regime of corporate 'fact checkers' to police social media and remove or punish unsanctioned speech. In so doing, the party abandoned the last of its core principles: standing up for free speech and the right to dissent. Many Democrats argue that they had to go after Wall Street money to compete with the Republicans. In 2016, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer explained the strategy: 'For every blue-collar Democrat we lose in western Pennsylvania we will pick up two moderate Republicans in the suburbs in Philadelphia, and you can repeat that in Ohio and Illinois and Wisconsin.' But for this plan to work, the party still needed an actual message to take to the voters. Forbes Magazine reports that during the 2024 presidential race, Kamala Harris's campaign raised a billion dollars while Trump's campaign raised $388 million. Harris's substantial edge in fundraising allowed her to flood the airwaves with commercials. But she had nothing of substance to say to voters. The Atlantic Magazine reports that early in her campaign, Harris gained ground by attacking Trump as a stooge of corporate interests—and touted herself as a relentless scourge of Big Business. But then, suddenly, Harris abandoned her attacks on big business at the urging of her brother-in-law, Tony West, Uber's chief legal officer. Many Democrats, especially in swing states, opposed the Biden Administration's unfailing support for Israel's genocidal campaign in Gaza, which has killed more than 43,000 Palestinians and displaced nearly all of its 2.3 million residents. Harris could have gained the support of many of these voters by promising to stop arming Israel during the genocide. But her Party's donors wouldn't allow her to even hint at such a change in policy. Two days before the election, while campaigning in the swing state of Michigan, Harris stated, 'I will do everything in my power to end the war in Gaza.' But as Ali Abunimah of the Electronic Intifada pointed out on election night, this promise carried no weight because Harris had also promised that she would never do the one thing within her power to stop the slaughter: cut off the flow of bombs to Israel. After decades of malfeasance and deception, it has become evident that the corporate Democratic Party cannot serve as the lone opposition party to the corporate Republicans. The American people need a viable political party that represents the interests of ordinary working people. A true workers party will not raise as much money as the corporate Democrats. But it will have an honest message with the potential to appeal to large numbers of Americans. Further, a political party that actually represents workers will press for reforms that begin to even the playing field between the haves and the have nots. For example, one the most effective ways plutocrats game the political system is by flooding campaign contributions to the lawmakers who sit on the key committees that oversee their businesses. Members of Congress covet these committee chairs because they guarantee high fundraising numbers. Lawmakers who sit on the House Financial Services Committee have jurisdiction over banks and insurance companies and are targeted by those firms with campaign contributions. Lawmakers who sit on the Armed Services and Appropriations Committees provide funding for lucrative government contracts and are flooded with war industry cash. These practices are corrupt and deprive American citizens of their right to be governed by representatives free from conflicts of interest. A judge who has received political contributions from a litigant must be removed from the case. Similarly, the most important functions of government, such as determining tax and how our tax revenue will be spent, should be performed by lawmakers who have not been bribed. In 2017, the Center for American Progress, a think tank aligned with the Democratic Party, proposed a 'Committee Contribution Ban' for Congress. It asserted: 'Congress should enact a law to make it unlawful for members of Congress to accept campaign contributions from entities that fall within the jurisdiction of their committees.' Unsurprisingly, this proposal never reached the floor of Congress, that I could find. Some states have enacted similar conflict of interest rules. And Congress could certainly pass such a law, if it chose. Of course, this will never happen as long as we are ruled by two corporate parties that benefit from the corruption. But if we had a political party that represented ordinary people, countless opportunities for positive change would soon emerge. About the author: Leonard C.

Serbian President’s Plan To ‘Protect’ Kosovo Serbs Still A Work I...	Three months after it was announced, Serbia has made little progress in implementing President Aleksandar Vucic’s five-point plan to 'safeguard the future' of Serbs in Kosovo. On September 13, Serbian President Aleksandar Vucic announced a five-point plan to safeguard the future of Serbs who live in a northern pocket of Kosovo, responding to a crackdown by Kosovo authorities on Serb-run, Belgrade-backed ‘parallel institutions’. He announced the plan in a typically meandering address to the nation, hotly anticipated by government-friendly media. 'From the documents you received,' Vucic told the gathered reporters, 'you will see how serious and responsible the Serbian state is.' Three months on, however, BIRN’s analysis of the plan’s progress shows that none of the five points Vucic outlined has been fulfilled in full. Some are in progress, but it is unclear when they will be finished or what their real impact might be. Serb return to institutions Vucic defined the first step as a 'return to status quo ante'. 'We want to return to everything that was achieved in the process and procedure of the dialogue,' he said, in reference to European Union-mediated talks between Belgrade and Pristina, which began in 2011. The talks were aimed at ‘normalising’ relations between the two following Kosovo’s 2008 declaration of independence, which Serbia does not recognise. Over 13 years on, negotiations are still ongoing. In his address, Vucic set a raft of conditions for 'any serious progress' in the dialogue: local elections in the four Serb-majority municipalities in the north of Kosovo, 'with the participation of the OSCE mission and EU control', and the return to work of Kosovo Serb police officers, judges and prosecutors who resigned en masse in November 2022 in coordinated protest against alleged breaches of agreements made between Serbia and Kosovo in Brussels. Vucic also demanded the withdrawal of Kosovo special police checkpoints in the northern municipalities; the 'urgent, immediate and final' formation of an association of Serb-majority municipalities as agreed in the Brussels negotiations but still being resisted by the Kosovo government. He further called for the 'immediate implementation' of security guarantees given in December 2022 by the EU and the NATO-led peacekeeping force, KFOR and the release of Serbs arrested for erecting barricades or taking part in protests. On top of that, he said he wanted the 'immediate enabling of smooth payment transactions and postal services', in reference to Kosovo’s crackdown on the use of the Serbian dinar and postal service in the northern municipalities. Kosovo’s official currency is the euro but Serbian money was widely used in the north. Dragisa Mijacic, director of the Belgrade-based Institute for Territorial Economic Development, InTER, says Step 1 amounted to an admission 'that a mistake was made when the Serbs withdrew from the institutions'. 'By this, they are asking for the unconditional return of the Serbs to the institutions they left without fulfilling the conditions that caused the Serbs to leave the institutions,' he said. Those conditions included the creation of the association of Serb-majority municipalities. Vucic, he said, had put the ball in Pristina’s court, 'knowing both then and now that it would be impossible to implement [Vucic’s conditions] on the eve of the election campaign in Kosovo'. Kosovo is due to hold a parliamentary election on February 9, 2025. Laws pending Vucic said parliament would adopt to laws, one declaring Kosovo an 'area of ​​special social protection' and the other asserting Serbian jurisdiction over crimes committed in Kosovo since the day it declared independence in February 2008. The first effectively provides financial aid for unemployed and elderly Serbs in Kosovo who do not have an income. A list of those eligible for the support should be drawn up by end-January 2025. The second calls for the creation of a special department within the Higher Prosecution in Belgrade for tackling crimes committed in Kosovo, which would then be tried before the Higher Court and the Court of Appeal in the Serbian capital. Experts told BIRN Serbia has no means to carry out criminal investigations on the territory of Kosovo and that the law is little more than a publicity stunt. The laws have yet to be adopted in parliament. ‘Remote’ public services Another step called for the opening of government offices in Rudnica and Ribarici, just inside Serbia’s border with Kosovo, where Vucic said Kosovo Serbs would be able to access Serbian public services. Local media reported that one such office was set up in Rudnica on October 8. Tatjana Lazarevic, editor-in-chief of Mitrovica-based news outlet KosSev, said that certain Serbian state institutions had begun working 'remotely', but questioned the impact. 'The most vulnerable segments of society are additionally burdened by travelling to ‘border’ towns, by the additional costs, by the further exhaustion and weakening of this part of the population,' she said. The additional effort and complication required 'makes a nonsense of their remaining in their place of residence'. Rejection of Kosovo laws As the fifth step, Vucic announced that parliament would adopt a decision 'on the illegality of all bodies and institutions established on the territory of Kosovo and Metohija after the illegal unilateral declaration of independence, as well as the non-existence of all their acts that have been passed or will be passed'. 'Everything they [the Kosovo government] make as decisions and are contrary to the Brussels Agreement, such as the establishment of their police bases, their police authorities in the north… are non-existent, invalid for us,' Vucic said. The Brussels Agreement of 2013 called for the creation of association of Serb-majority municipalities as well as the integration of Serbs into the police, judiciary and security structures of Kosovo. This parliamentary decision was supposed to happen within 45 days of Vucic’s address. It did not happen.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWdpiiQ7e2PAN9vZ7qDHkLeF	2024-12-13T16:48:05-08:00	
ASEAN’s Path To G20 Membership – Analysis	By Allan Dharma Saputra Despite its decade-long presence as a guest at G20 summits, the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) faces a complex journey towards full membership in the world’s premier economic forum. The African Union’s historic admission as the G20’s first new member in 2023 has sparked discussions about ASEAN’s potential elevation from guest to member. But this transition requires the navigation of uncharted diplomatic waters. ASEAN’s current relationship with the G20 is strong but limited. While Indonesia is the only ASEAN nation among the G20’s permanent members, the bloc’s wider presence comes through the ASEAN Chair as an invited guest, alongside Singapore, which receives consistent invitations to G20 gatherings. While this arrangement grants speaking rights at G20 forums, it does not give ASEAN the consensus-building power held by full members. This distinction is crucial, as guests can voice positions but cannot shape or block final decisions on global economic policies that directly impact Southeast Asia’s population of 676.6 million and US$3.8 trillion economy. The region’s economic significance is clear. Southeast Asia serves as a critical hub for global manufacturing, shipping and digital innovation. The region’s strategic waterways, including the Strait of Malacca, channel approximately one third of global trade. Ports in Singapore, Indonesia and Malaysia demonstrate efficiency that surpasses North American and European operations combined. The digital economy’s trajectory is equally impressive, with projections estimating that US$1 trillion will be added to regional GDP by 2030. These metrics suggest that ASEAN’s economic weight matches or exceeds several current G20 members. Beyond economic metrics, ASEAN’s strategic importance lies in its role as a diplomatic bridge. The bloc has developed expertise in managing great power relations, particularly between the United States and China, while maintaining regional cohesion. This experience in balancing diverse interests could benefit the G20, especially as global governance faces increasing polarisation. ASEAN’s contributions to issues relevant to the G20 deserve recognition. The bloc has made significant strides in strengthening global supply chain resilience, particularly through the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership, the world’s largest free trade agreement. Its pioneering work in digital integration, including the ASEAN Digital Economy Framework Agreement and cross-border payment connectivity initiatives, serves as a model for financial inclusion. And ASEAN’s approaches to climate transition financing, notably through the ASEAN Taxonomy for Sustainable Finance, demonstrate innovative regional solutions to global challenges. But the path to G20 membership presents unique challenges. The African Union’s admission in 2023 marked the first membership change in G20 history, requiring unanimous consensus from all existing members. This breakthrough came with strong backing from India during its G20 presidency, demonstrating the importance of strategic support from key members. While this precedent is groundbreaking, it doesn’t establish a clear roadmap for future expansions. Unlike the African Union, which successfully presented itself as the voice of a unified continent, ASEAN faces the complex task of demonstrating its ability to act cohesively despite its diverse membership. Internal coordination remains a critical challenge. While Indonesia, as the sole ASEAN member within the G20, can advocate for the bloc’s interests, the pursuit of effective membership requires unified support from all ten ASEAN members. Varied responses within ASEAN to regional challenges like the South China Sea disputes and Myanmar’s political upheaval highlight difficulties in achieving consensus on major international issues. This internal dynamic complicates the task of presenting ASEAN as a coherent voice in global governance. The transition from guest status to full membership demands a strategic shift in ASEAN’s approach. While speaking rights at G20 meetings provide valuable opportunities for input, full membership would grant ASEAN direct influence over global economic decisions affecting its region. This elevation requires more than just economic credentials but also a coordinated diplomatic campaign that demonstrates ASEAN’s capacity for unified action. A successful membership bid would require several concrete steps. ASEAN needs to leverage its existing presence at G20 forums more effectively. The ASEAN Chair and Singapore, as regular guests, could coordinate their messaging to consistently highlight the bloc’s contributions to global governance. Indonesia’s position as a G20 member creates additional opportunities to champion ASEAN’s cause, but this effort should be supported by proactive diplomacy from all member states. ASEAN must also strengthen its case by showcasing practical solutions to global challenges. The bloc’s achievements in digital payment integration, supply chain resilience and climate finance initiatives align directly with G20 priorities. These successes should be framed within a broader narrative about ASEAN’s role in addressing global economic challenges. More importantly, ASEAN needs to demonstrate improved crisis management capabilities, learning from its experiences with regional disputes and political challenges. The path forward requires careful diplomatic orchestration. ASEAN should identify and cultivate support among G20 members sympathetic to its aspirations. Building alliances with other emerging G20 economies, particularly those advocating for greater Global South representation, could create momentum for membership consideration. The bloc should also address potential concerns about decision-making efficiency by proposing clear mechanisms for its participation in G20 consensus-building processes. The quest for G20 membership is an opportunity for ASEAN to redefine its role in global governance. While the African Union’s admission has opened the door for membership expansion, ASEAN’s success will depend on its ability to unite behind this goal and effectively demonstrate that full membership would enhance the G20’s effectiveness through its proven economic credentials and commitment to global cooperation.

Corporate Income Tax Collections Rise When They Are Not Voluntary...	As Donald Trump prepares to embark on another round of MAGA tax cuts it is worth a quick review of the corporate side of the last one, and the Biden administration’s efforts to reverse the revenue loss. One of the unheralded successes of the Biden administration was increasing corporate income tax collections as a share of profits. Most of the focus on taxes at the moment is on the individual income tax, since these cuts are the ones that expire in 2026. However, Trump has also talked of another round of corporate tax cuts. The 2017 tax cut reduced the corporate tax rate from 35 percent to 21 percent. Since very few companies were paying anything close to 35 percent of their profits in taxes (due to various loopholes), the cut was sold partly on the idea that we would lower rates but eliminate the loopholes and thereby collect roughly the same amount in taxes. It makes good sense from almost any angle to have the actual tax rate be close to the nominal rate set in law. There is no point in having companies waste large amounts of resources in gaming the tax code; we should want the tax rate to be close to what we actually collect. (If we really want to eliminate tax gaming, we could make returns to shareholders, dividends and capital gains, the basis for the corporate income tax.) Since tax collections were already around 21 percent of corporate profits, there would be little downside if we made the tax rate 21 percent, and actually collected something close to that amount. Not surprisingly, it didn’t work out that way. Corporate income tax as a share of corporate profits fell from 21.8 percent in 2016 to 16.1 percent in 2018 and just 15.3 percent in 2019, as shown below. (These data are from NIPA Table 1.10, Line 16 divided by Line 15.) This drop continued a long decline in the share of corporate profits paid in taxes from more than 30 percent in the 1980s and 1990s. However, there was a turnaround in tax collections under Biden. The tax share rose to 17.4 percent in 2021, and then increased further to 20.1 percent in 2022 and 20.4 percent in 2023. This was a striking reversal. In 2023 alone it implied an increase in corporate tax collections of more than $150 billion. This is roughly double the sum at stake with the expanded child tax credit. While there were some tweaks to the tax code, none of them would plausibly raise this sort of revenue. The most obvious change was that the Biden administration took enforcement seriously. Under Trump, there was not much interest in policing tax filings. The Republicans called I.R.S. efforts to enforce the tax code 'harassment.' The Biden administration expected that large corporations would pay the taxes they owe just like the rest of us do. It appears its enforcement efforts made a real difference. This is an important point to keep in mind as we look at changes in the tax code proposed by Trump and the Republicans in Congress. They have openly pledged to weaken I.R.S. enforcement efforts. The result is that tax collections are likely to fall by considerably more than a simple calculation based on changes in tax rates. After all, most people, and especially most rich people, will not pay taxes if they don’t have to. And Donald Trump and the Republicans have pretty much said that rich people shouldn’t have to pay taxes, so it’s a safe bet that many rich people, and their corporations, will choose not to.

The First Element Of A North Korean Nuclear Proliferation Network...	By Robert Kelley On the night of 6 September 2007 Israeli jets bombed a building in Northen Syria. The building was alleged to be a nuclear reactor under construction to support a nuclear weapons program. The reactor was reported to be a copy of the small plutonium production reactor in the Democratic Peoples Republic of Korea (DPRK). There are many allegations in this strange story, but the most important is that the government of DPRK, headed Kim Jong Un was selling nuclear technology. The reactor would have produced weapons grade plutonium (WGPu) for an Iranian bomb. It is likely that the final customer, Iran, paid cash for the design of the reactor, construction assistance and possibly nuclear fuel. There are many loose ends in this story. How materials were to be transported. Associations between DPRK, Iran and Syria. Why Iran would have chosen a North Korean reactor in Syria to make plutonium when Iran had a uranium-focused program. The absence of support facilities. But if there is any truth to this story, confirmed by the US CIA,[1] the Israeli Government and many independent sources, DPRK was exporting bomb-related materials for cash.[2] After exploding its own first nuclear bomb in 2006. Similarity to A Q Khan of Pakistan This event is very important because it connects directly to events in 2003 in DPRK. It is also a sharp reminder of the nuclear proliferation network of A Q Khan, a Pakistani metallurgist. Khan acquired critical gas centrifuge enrichment technology, by espionage, in the early 1970’s. He used that technology to assist Pakistan in producing enough highly enriched uranium to build a significant stockpile of uranium-based nuclear weapons. Once Pakistan had mastered enrichment technology, and satisfied its own weapons material needs, Khan turned to exporting the knowledge he had acquired. He offered nuclear weapon design information to Iraq in 1990. Using reverse espionage, he offered and then supplied gas centrifuge knowledge to Iran that is the basis of Iran’s very large uranium program. He supplied actual centrifuges to Libya in 2004. Very importantly, Khan began supplying actual centrifuges and advanced design knowledge to DPRK as early as 1998. DPRK embraced this technology. It built its own gas centrifuge plants. The earliest western confirmation of a DPRK uranium enrichment plant was in 2010 by a team of American visitors. That plant was reported to have started construction 2009 and the Americans believe it was not the first plant. It was too large and too well-engineered to be the first prototype. Kim Jong-Un Demands More Weapons Grade Uranium In 2023 the Chairman of the DPRK, leader Kim Jong Un exhorted his technical cadre to rapidly increase the production of fissile materials for weapons. The increase could only mean that gas centrifuge enrichment was the necessary production route. Nuclear reactors and reprocessing plants to separate WGpu are not easy to build quickly or to hide. Increments of additional plutonium production are slow and might take a decade from start to finish and even then, fissile materials production rates in small reactors are slow. Centrifuge cascades can be built in small increments and added frequently as machines are produced and floor space increases. It is clear that DPRK has been enriching uranium since 2010 and probably before. This has led to a significant HEU stockpile, probably far exceeding the small plutonium stockpile that DPRK has produced. Western estimates of plutonium production are relatively accurate because of the many observables around the single DPRK production reactor and reprocessing plant. Things like water vapor condensation visible from cooling towers, river turbulence are independent observables that help analysts determine operating time. In addition, many western observers have been in the reactor facility and reprocessing plant for years. IAEA has made measurements and documented quantitative data. The uranium enrichment program is completely different. It has never been inspected at close range, only a single observation from a distance for a few minutes. The building that was observed is known and it has been doubled in size according to overhead imagery.[3] Other plants are suspected but completely unknown. In 2024 the first-ever photographs inside a DPRK centrifuge plant were published. The original observers can say that the buildings look different from what they saw. The externals of the machines are not the same as the 2010 observations.[4] The very respected Federation of American scientists (FAS) predicted in 2024 that DPRK may have produced enough HEU for at least 50 and possibly 90 basic nuclear weapons.[5] This is enough for a huge military offensive capability for a small country : DPRK. Most of its military targets are presumably in the Republic of Korea, South Korea (ROK). Neglecting threats against the United States, DPRK has enough nuclear weapons to saturate ROK. The exhortation to greatly increase fissile material production suggests a second purpose. DPRK as a Nuclear Proliferation Network There is already one accepted instance of DPRK selling nuclear weapons technology in return for cash. DPRK is a notably poor country that survives by any means legal or not. Heavily sanctioned, it makes money with counterfeiting, cryptocurrency, computer hacking and sanctions busting. Fissile materials sales could be another valuable source of income. DPRK has conducted several successful nuclear tests. Their most recent standardized weapon design fits in missiles, bombs and torpedoes. The A Q Khan network serviced DPRK in its quest for enrichment technology. DPRK has already benefited from smuggling nuclear technology into the country from Khan and quite a few other sources. On at least one occasion it has tried to export technology for cash. Now it appears Kim is poised to possibly begin a proliferation network of his own. There is a Proliferation Market in the 21st Century Traditional non-proliferation thinking has been that States are the only customers for nuclear weapons. Only States have the resources and technological capability to build nuclear weapons. The nonproliferation regime, through IAEA materials verification, has considered all States to be equally suspect, but this has evolved to focus largely on a few States with regional ambitions. Several developed States, even throughout Europe, studied and decided against nuclear weapons programs. Successful proliferation suppression outcomes in Iraq, Libya and South Africa have led to a generally peaceful world focused on other military activity. Iran is the obvious outlier today as peace remains elusive in the Middle East. Iran Iran was once an alleged customer for DPRK plutonium assistance. Iran gave up plutonium long ago and has a vital uranium enrichment program, that it argues strongly is only for civil purposes. The Iranian nuclear program is under intensive IAEA nuclear materials verification activity. In over 20 years only one nuclear facility has been discovered that Iran failed to declare. It seems unlikely that there are additional unknown plutonium reactors, enrichment plants, reprocessing plants or necessary fuel cycle activity in Iran. Most proliferation concern is that Iran will back out of IAEA safeguards and attempt to misuse known nuclear facilities. It would be a foolish red line for Iran to back out of safeguards and misuse facilities known to the West. During the time it would take for Iran to turn civilian facilities to military use there would certainly be military consequences. If Iran remains under transparent IAEA verification all its known nuclear facilities can be verified to remain in peaceful activities. A weaponization program has very few external observables and is completely outside the mandate or expertise of the IAEA. If Iran had a clandestine source of imported HEU, it could easily develop a significant stockpile of DPRK designed and tested weapons and become a nuclear power quickly and silently. Past assistance from DPRK in missiles and the reactor in Syria, show this is possible. A Dark Web of Material Supply DPRK is in the position of creating a bank of nuclear material available to the highest bidder. The country has an excess of fissile material, namely Very Highly Enriched Uranium, and has publicly boasted of accelerated production of even more. The lessons of the A Q Khan network of nuclear supply should not be lost. Khan sold the means of producing nuclear materials. That has led to several countries achieving threatening status. This threat was tempered by the necessity of a country needing time and enormous technical effort to produce the material. The direct sale of nuclear weapon-usable nuclear material would bypass this industrial hurdle and remove many of the intelligence indicators that a State was on the verge of proliferation. There would be no warning. The threat would be complicated by the possibility that DPRK also provided proven nuclear explosive designs. It is not just States that will be of concern in the next decades. Individuals of unparalleled power are appearing in several regions of the world. The ability of a rich individual to drive policy either of his own, or by manipulating a State program is a possibility that has not existed before. Conclusion Throughout the 1970’s Pakistani A Q Khan ran a network designed to produce Very Highly Enriched Uranium and give Pakistan the nuclear material for a bomb. He succeeded. Throughout the 1980s and 1990s he reversed the process and created a consequential nuclear proliferation network. He supplied enrichment technology, some nuclear materials, and in at least one case, alleged designs for a nuclear explosive. We need to have learned some lessons from his activities. In 2007 the Leader of North Korea supplied assistance to build a weapons plutonium reactor in Syria. This may have been his first attempt to create a proliferation network. Now he has exhorted his cadre to produce more fissile materials; produce more and do it quickly. This can only be done quickly by adding uranium enrichment capacity. He has already been very successful at generously increasing his own growing stockpile. The ability to supply a developing world with unlimited VHEU, a working tested bomb design, possibly even nuclear explosives themselves. This is a moment to seriously remember what A Q Khan accomplished in reducing world security. Time to make sure a new A Q Kim does not replace Khan.

What Is Driving State-Sponsored Attacks On Citizens Abroad? – OpE...	Kidnappings and killings of citizens by their own governments abroad are becoming increasingly common. The normalization of this trend will erode the sovereignty of all nations, as well as the safety of their citizens. In July 2020, Iranian dissident Jamshid Sharmahd was visiting Dubai when he was suddenly abducted. Mobile phone data later traced his movements to Oman's port city of Sohar, before the signal went silent. Days later, he reappeared in Iran, accused of leading a terrorist group and orchestrating attacks in Iran, charges his family denies. After years in detention, he was executed in October 2024. Iran's actions are part of a longstanding pattern. Since the 1979 Revolution, its government has targeted dissidents overseas. Notable cases include the 1991 stabbing death of the Shah's last prime minister in Paris and the 1992 assassination of four Iranian-Kurdish dissidents at a Berlin restaurant. These operations appear to have escalated again, with an Iranian journalist kidnapped in Iraq in 2019, an opposition leader kidnapped in Turkey in 2020, and a thwarted attempt to kidnap an Iranian journalist in the U.S. that year as well. Functioning governments exercise a monopoly on violence and detention within their borders, including lawful imprisonment and capital punishment. In conflict zones, these powers sometimes extend into contested areas, blurring legal distinctions. However, Iran's extraterritorial operations mark a trend of smaller nations increasingly adopting tactics reserved for major powers, bypassing international protocols to punish citizens overseas. Covert operations targeting your own citizens in other countries require substantial resources and intelligence to track individuals, orchestrate a hit, and avoid detection. The modern era of such operations was shaped in part by the surge of political assassinations by militant and terrorist groups in the early 1970s. Governments responded with their own covert actions, both domestically and internationally, broadening their targets to include political activists and opposition figures. Globalization, interconnected diaspora networks, and advances in surveillance technologies have further enabled these activities. As diplomatic repercussions wane and global enforcement diminishes—particularly from the U.S., which has faced its own criticism for extraordinary rendition and drone strikes on U.S. citizens abroad—states act with growing impunity and plausible deniability. Civilians unaffiliated with political disputes are occasionally caught in the crossfire, diminishing the sanctity of national sovereignty further. Few countries are as brazen as Iran has been for decades, but other countries are also demonstrating their reach. In neighboring Pakistan, national forces recently apprehended a Pakistani citizen in Myanmar in October 2024. Turkey, however, has escalated its extraterritorial operationsthe most in recent years in response to the 2016 coup attempt. Turkish authorities claim to have abducted over 80 individuals from 18 countries between 2016 and 2018 alone. One incident in 2018 saw six Turkish nationals kidnapped in Kosovo and sent back to Turkey, prompting a diplomatic rift between the two nations. Turkey's assertiveness in targeting its citizens abroad has not stopped other governments from using it as a stage for their own actions. In 2018, Saudi Arabia orchestrated the killing of U.S.-Saudi citizen journalist Jamal Khashoggi inside its consulate in Istanbul. The killing drew global outrage and strong condemnation from the Turkish government. However, Washington's reluctance to impose significant consequences on Saudi Arabia emboldened other states. Algeria abducted a dissident in neighboring Tunisia in 2021, continuing a practice that has become common in parts of Africa. South Sudan, for instance, kidnapped two of its citizens from Kenya in 2017. In another high-profile case, three Rwandan diplomats were expelled from South Africa in 2014 after being implicated in the murder of a former Rwandan intelligence chief and attacks on two other Rwandan exiles. In Eastern Europe, assassinations of government officials became a grim reality amid the political and social upheaval of the 1990s. Governments often responded in kind, targeting individuals beyond their borders. Russia's approach has been particularly notable for its persistence and evolving methods. Dozens of Chechen separatist supporters and others with links to organized crime have been killed in other countries, with operations often executed by Chechens to obscure Moscow's direct involvement. These include killings in Turkey in 2011 and Germany in 2019. Russia's political killings in the UK have also drawn international attention. In 2006, former FSB agent Alexander Litvinenko was fatally poisoned with a radioactive substance in London. In 2018, another former Russian intelligence agent, Sergei Skripal, survived a poisoning attempt, though a local civilian was killed. These high-profile attacks conveyed to other Russians seeking to flee the country that even in the intelligence capital of Europe, no one is beyond Russia's reach. Further afield, Russian authorities are believed to have been involved in the 2018 killings of three Russian journalists in the Central African Republic, investigating Russian private military companies. And since the start of the Ukraine War, Russian authorities are suspected to be behind numerous deaths of prominent Russian citizens in other countries, as well as of at least one defector in Spain in 2023. Russia's actions have set a precedent for other post-Soviet states. Uzbekistan has a history of targeting dissidents overseas, starting with the 2006 kidnapping of Uzbek human rights activist Muzafar Avazov from Kyrgyzstan. Accusations have since included a 2012 attempted assassination of an Uzbek citizen in Sweden and suspected involvement in the 2014 murder of an Uzbek Islamic cleric in Turkey. In 2021, Belarus forced a Ryanair flight traveling through its airspace to land in Minsk so authorities could board the plane and detain a journalist. Although technically in Belarusian airspace, it violated international norms regarding the sanctity of civil aviation. China has also adopted sophisticated measures to suppress dissent in other countries. Its growing power allows it to enforce cooperation with some governments to repatriate wanted Chinese nationals, including the increasing use of 'overseas police stations' to intimidate expatriates into compliance—a practice unmatched in its scope, though other nations have employed similar tactics to convince citizens to return home. But China's history of abductions, in one of the largest expat populations in the world, spans decades. A pro-democracy activist was seized in Vietnam in 2002, for example, while a former Chinese diplomat who had sought asylum in Australia was allegedly drugged and transported via ship back to China in 2005. Its actions have become more visible in recent years, particularly in Southeast Asia. In 2015, a book publisher was kidnapped from his apartment in Thailand, followed by a pro-democracy activist in Thailand the next year. Thailand itself has been implicated in targeting dissidents abroad. In 2019, the killing of government critic Ko Tee in Laos raised suspicions of Thai involvement, as did the targeting of other critics, including an activist in Cambodia in 2020. North Korea demonstrated its willingness to use foreign agents to silence critics when Kim Jong Nam, the estranged half-brother of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, was assassinated in Malaysia in 2017. A Vietnamese and Indonesian citizen were accused of acting on Pyongyang's behalf. Later that year, Vietnam faced backlash after its agents were accused of kidnapping a Vietnamese oil company executive in Berlin and forcibly returning him to Vietnam, sparking a diplomatic conflict with Germany. India has also stepped up its efforts against individuals it accuses of supporting the Khalistan independence movement, which seeks an independent Sikh state within India. In 2023, tensions flared between India and Canada when evidence surfaced linking India to the assassination of a Sikh separatist leader in British Columbia, as well as a foiled plot to kill another leader in New York. The incidents triggered a major diplomatic row, while additional reports revealed India was intensifying its surveillance of diaspora communities in the UK and Australia. India's actions in particular pose a risk to normalizing this behavior further. Countries like China, Russia, and Iran already engage in extraterritorial operations, but India's status as a growing partner to the West raises the stakes. If a nation with close ties to Western democracies can act with relative impunity, what might other states feel emboldened to do? India's actions will potentially pressure Western states to crack down on Khalistan independence advocates to maintain diplomatic balance, and these concessions could inspire others to act in a similar manner to get the same results. The increasing willingness of countries like India to test these boundaries has been preceded by decades of U.S. intelligence agencies kidnapping and assassinating U.S. citizens abroad. But after 9/11, the U.S. intensified and officialized such practices under the banner of 'extraordinary rendition,' detaining hundreds of foreign nationals and U.S. citizens accused of terrorism, many of which were later sent to third countries and often tortured. The increasing use of drone technology has transformed government operations abroad, including the targeting of their own citizens. In 2011, U.S. citizen Anwar al-Awlaki, a Yemeni American cleric linked to Islamic extremism, was killed in Yemen by a U.S. drone strike. Despite his ties to extremist groups, his killing raised serious concerns about the erosion of due process, though the strike encountered limited domestic pushback. The operation reflected a broader policy shift by the U.S. in the 21st century, justified under the premise that military action is permissible in areas where states are 'unwilling or unable' to address terrorism. By 2013, the Obama administration publicly acknowledged that four U.S. citizens had been killed by similar drone strikes overseas. Advancements in technology are making it steadily more difficult for individual citizens to evade governments seeking to track them abroad. States are showing a growing boldness in crossing borders, encouraged by Washington's targeting of its own citizens and its leniency toward allies engaging in similar actions. Concerns are also linked to the increasing involvement of dual citizens in these situations. Many countries refuse to recognize dual citizenship, complicating their treatment under international law and further straining diplomatic norms. This escalation of targeting one's own citizens in other countries risks evolving into broader attacks on foreign nationals. In November 2024, Israeli citizen Zvi Kogan was assassinated in the United Arab Emirates, reportedly by three Uzbek nationals. While the motives remain unclear, the incident follows a year of heightened tensions between Iran and Israel, as well as years of Israeli operations targeting Iranian citizens within Iran and elsewhere. Rising sabotage and covert operations in the West and Russia since the Ukraine war have shown the ease with which foreign powers infiltrate other nations. Alongside the increasing trend of governments targeting their own citizens abroad, the possibility of citizens being attacked by external actors within their own countries is becoming alarmingly real. A world where sovereignty is routinely undermined—where states deny asylum, target their citizens, and strike foreign nationals—threatens to further erode trust, security, and the rule of law in an already fragile global order. Perhaps if these practices can occur anywhere, confirming that no state is immune to the consequences of unchecked impunity, then even powerful nations may find themselves incentivized to curtail them.

Assad’s Fall Is A Blow To Russia: Here’s What It Means For The Wa...	By Roksolana Bychai and Steve Gutterman (RFE/RL) -- When he launched the full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, Russian President Vladimir Putin apparently believed Russian forces would topple the government within weeks and restore Moscow's dominance over the country after 30 years of independence. Putin was mistaken, and the war he started rages on nearly three years later. It's hard to imagine Putin didn't mull over his miscalculation when militant-led opposition forces seized Damascus and swept Syrian President Bashar al-Assad from power less than two weeks after launching an offensive. The Kremlin's focus on the war against Ukraine is one of the factors that fed into the speed and success of the Syrian rebel offensive. Russian warplanes stepped up attacks on rebel-held territory as the offensive took hold, but with its military capabilities in Syria limited and its eyes on Ukraine, Moscow made no massive effort to stop it. Now that Assad has fallen, what effect will Russia's big Middle East setback have on its war against Ukraine? On the battlefield, not a huge one, analysts say, though it will depend in part on the fate of Russia's forces and bases in Syria: the airfield at Hmeimim and the naval facility at Tartus. 'A partial or full withdrawal would free up some reconnaissance, air force, special forces, and intelligence assets…. But Russia's presence in Syria is probably only a few thousand troops,' Dara Massicot, a military analyst and senior fellow in the Russia and Eurasia Program at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, told RFE/RL in e-mailed comments. Andriy Kovalenko, head of the Center for Countering Disinformation at Ukraine's National Security and Defense Council, said in a Telegram post that as of this past summer 'there were about 6,000-7,000 Russian military personnel in Syria,' including members of private military companies tied to the Russian state. 'Even if all these soldiers were transferred to the Russian Federation and then sent to the war against Ukraine, this would not significantly affect the situation on the front, given the rather high daily losses of the Russian Army in assault operations,' Kovalenko wrote. The Russian military has suffered massive casualties as it seeks to augment its gainsin recent months, particularly in Ukraine's eastern Donbas region, ahead of what is widely expected to be an effort by U.S. President-elect Donald Trump to push for peace when he takes office in January. Analysts pointed out that if Russian ships based at Tartus leave the Mediterranean, they cannot enter the Black Sea because Turkey has restricted passage through the Bosporus. The departure of warplanes from Syria would be more meaningful because 'it could strengthen the aviation group fighting against Ukraine,' Kyiv-based military analyst Mykhaylo Samus told RFE/RL's Ukrainian Service. 'It is the aviation component that could play a negative role' for Ukraine. Ivan Kyrychevskiy, an analyst at the consulting firm Defense Express in Kyiv, was more dismissive, saying, 'Russia's manipulation of its resources in Syria will in no way affect Ukraine' and that, at this point, 'We can't say that the Russians are leaving [Syria,] and that's the end of it.' 'Russia would be willing to offer a lot to the new coalition in Syria to retain some presence there as a first priority,' Massicot told RFE/RL. 'Russia will try to solidify agreements in Libya and Sudan as a partial offset.' Some experts said the reputational blow Russia has suffered in Syria may further sharpen Putin's hunger for control over Ukraine. 'Assad's collapse has…shaken Putin, making him less inclined to demonstrate flexibility with Ukraine,' Tatyana Stanovaya, a senior fellow at the Carnegie Russia Eurasia Center, wrote on X. 'The war in Ukraine has, to some extent, cost him Syria, which reinforces his unwillingness to compromise.' Ruth Deyermond, a senior lecturer in the Department of War Studies at King's College London, said the events in Syria seem unlikely to affect Russia's determination to prevail in Ukraine. 'Given how tightly Putin's presidency is tied to the war in Ukraine, how far he's been willing to reshape Russian economy and society, how many lives he's been willing to sacrifice for it, and how dependent he's made Russia on other states (China, Iran, North Korea), it's hard to imagine that the loss in Syria will make much difference because it's hard to see how the Kremlin could take victory in Ukraine more seriously than they already do,' she wrote in e-mailed comments to RFE/RL. Massicot suggested it would depend on how much of a presence in Syria and the surrounding region Russia manages to salvage. 'If Russia is pushed out entirely from Syria and they are unable to offset with basing elsewhere in the region, such a serious blow to Russian power would probably make Putin more rigid and determined to show control and 'success' in Ukraine,' she wrote. At the same time, Ukrainian commentators said the collapse of a regime that had stood as a symbol of newfound Russian clout abroad could prompt the rest of the world to view Moscow as weaker and more vulnerable than when Assad's grip on power seemed firm for almost a decade after Russia's military intervention in Syria in 2015. The 'myth that Russia is great, invincible, and so forth -- it's all just propaganda. And I think this was seen clearly once again in many capitals, and it will influence all subsequent events,' Volodymyr Ohryzko, Ukraine's foreign minister in 2007-09 and now the head of a center for the study of Russia, told RFE/RL's Ukrainian Service. 'For us, I think this is a positive moment in our work with Western partners. And we must take advantage of this moment,' Ohryzko said. 'We can use this in Ukraine, showing that nuclear powers can lose. The Soviet Union lost in Afghanistan, the United States essentially lost in Vietnam,' Ukrainian political analyst Oleksandr Khara told RFE/RL's Ukrainian Service, adding it could help persuade Kyiv's supporters 'that we can win in Ukraine if they help us with the necessary weapons and other things.' 'We've seen in the past that the West has been willing to extend further support to Ukraine when they've had military successes against Russia. The Kremlin's inability to take any serious steps to prevent this geopolitical humiliation [in Syria] shows how overstretched they are in Ukraine,' Deyermond wrote. 'That and the failure of Putin's recent nuclear threats should encourage NATO members in their support for Ukraine.' Roksolana Bychai is a reporter for RFE/RL's Ukrainian Service.

Mali: Atrocities By The Army And Wagner Group, Says HRW	Mali’s armed forces, supported by the Russia-backed Wagner Group, and Islamist armed groups have committed serious abuses against civilians since the withdrawal of the United Nations peacekeeping mission, MINUSMA, from the country a year ago, Human Rights Watch said today. The Malian government should work with the National Human Rights Commission and the UN Independent Expert on the situation of human rights in Mali to establish a reliable means of monitoring and reporting on armed groups’ and security forces’ abuses. Since May 2024, Malian armed forces and the Wagner Group have deliberately killed at least 32 civilians, including 7 in a drone strike, forcibly disappeared 4 others, and burned at least 100 homes in military operations in towns and villages in central and northern Mali. Two Islamist armed groups, the Al-Qaeda-linked Group for the Support of Islam and Muslims (Jama’at Nusrat al-Islam wa al-Muslimeen, JNIM) and of the Islamic State in the Greater Sahara (ISGS), have summarily executed at least 47 civilians and displaced thousands of people since June. The JNIM has also burned over 1,000 homes and looted thousands of livestock. Human Rights Watch received credible reports of hundreds more civilians killed, but due to the difficulties of conducting research in central and northern Mali, the numbers in this report are conservative. 'The Malian army with the Wagner Group and Islamist armed groups have been targeting civilians and their property in violation of the laws of war,' said Ilaria Allegrozzi, senior Sahel researcher at Human Rights Watch. 'Since MINUSMA left Mali a year ago, it has been extremely difficult to get comprehensive information on abuses, and we are deeply concerned that the situation is even worse than reported.' The UN Multidimensional Integrated Stabilization Mission in Mali (MINUSMA) completed its withdrawal from the country on December 31, 2023, at the requestof Malian authorities, heightening concerns about the protection of civilians and the monitoring and reporting of abuses by all sides. Between July and October 2024, Human Rights Watch interviewed 47 witnesses and 11 other informed sources about abuses by the Malian army, Wagner Group, and Islamist armed groups. Human Rights Watch also analyzed satellite imagery showing burned homes in several villages and verified and geolocated photos and videos posted on social media or sent directly to Human Rights Watch. On October 15, Human Rights Watch wrote to Mali’s justice and defense ministers, providing its findings and related questions, but has not received replies. Human Rights Watch documented Malian armed forces’ violations during nine counterinsurgency operations against the JNIM since May. Witnesses said soldiers carried out abuses against communities they accused of collaborating with the JNIM. A dozen witnesses described the involvement of fighters from the Wagner Group, which has supported the Malian government since December 2021. The military security company was rebranded 'Africa Corps' following the death of its leader, Yevgeny Prigozhin, in 2023, when it came under direct control of the Russian Defense Ministry 'Our area is dominated by the JNIM, and you must deal with them,' said a 30-year-old man from Ndorgollé, in the central region of Ségou. 'They give you permission to graze cattle and to fish. It’s a matter of survival not collaboration. But when you deal with them, you become a [government] target, even if you are not a jihadist.' Human Rights Watch documented a Malian military drone strike in the town of Tinzaouaten, Kidal region, in August, that killed seven civilians, including five children. 'My son was wounded in the head, one eye was torn apart, and he lost a lot of blood,' said the father of a 14-year-old boy. 'Next to him were other dead and injured kids. I put my son on my shoulders and begged a motorcyclist to take me to the hospital, but he died on the way.' Human Rights Watch previously documented two indiscriminate drone strikes by the Malian army in central Mali in February that killed at least 14 civilians as well as other serious abuses by the Malian security forces and allied Wagner forces and by the Islamist armed groups. The JNIM has burned homes and looted livestock in Bandiagara region since June. JNIM fighters attacked several villages in the Doucombo and Pignari Bana district areas, setting over 1,000 homes on fire, stealing at least 3,500 animals, and forcing thousands of residents to flee, according to witnesses. Residents said the attacks were in apparent retaliation against communities that the JNIM accused of collaborating with the Dan Na Ambassagou militia, an umbrella organization of self-defense groups created in 2016 'to protect the Dogon country.' The militia provided security in many villages of the area. 'The JNIM said women must cover themselves from head to toe,' said a 50-year-old man from Danibombo 1 village. 'We said ‘No,’ and the JNIM started beating our women. So many joined or supported Dan Na Ambassagou. This has made our villages [the JNIM’s] target.' Human Rights Watch also documented an ISGS attack in August against a displaced peoples’ camp in Ménaka city, Ménaka region, that killed seven civilians. 'They started shooting at us,' said a 42-year-old man. 'I hid inside a tent. I could feel the bullets flying over my head.' On April 4, the UN Human Rights Council extended the mandate of the Independent Expert on the situation of human rights in Mali for one year. While this is an important step to maintain an international human rights monitoring presence in the country, the Independent Expert does not have the resources to gather in-depth reports, which are critical for accountability. The Malian government has primary responsibility under international law for ensuring justice for serious crimes, but successive governments have made scant progress investigating, much less prosecuting, those responsible for the grave offenses since the armed conflict began in 2012. All parties to Mali’s armed conflict – the national armed forces, the Wagner Group and other allied militias, and Islamist armed groups – are bound by international humanitarian law, notably Common Article 3 of the Geneva Conventions of 1949 and customary laws of war. Individuals who commit serious violations of the laws of war with criminal intent – that is, intentionally or recklessly – may be prosecuted for war crimes. Individuals may also be held criminally liable for assisting in, facilitating, aiding, or abetting a war crime. Mali is a party to the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court (ICC), which has opened an investigation into alleged war crimes committed in Mali since 2012. 'Malian authorities’ failure to hold members of the security forces, the Wagner Group, and other armed groups to account for grave abuses has eased the way for further atrocities,' Allegrozzi said. 'The government should work closely with the UN Independent Expert to promptly investigate and appropriately prosecute all those responsible for grave abuses.'	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWdpiiQ7e2PAN_dq62gjW8AT	2024-12-13T16:25:47-08:00	
France: Centrist François Bayrou Appointed Prime Minister	By Laurent Geslin (EurActiv) -- French President Emmanuel Macron appointed the fourth prime minister of 2024 on Friday (13 December), handing seasoned centrist François Bayrou the challenge of navigating an increasingly divided National Assembly. A true veteran of French politics and a longtime Macron ally, Bayrou, 73, was chosen to succeed the short-lived Michel Barnier, who was ousted by a no-confidence vote in the National Assembly on 4 December. The appointment of Bayrou, leader of the Democratic Movement (MoDem), marks a clear departure from the 'new world' Macron had aspired to represent during his initial 2017 campaign. His primary mission will be to avoid another no-confidence motion.'The President of the Republic has appointed Mr François Bayrou as Prime Minister and tasked him with forming a government,' the Élysée announced in a brief statement issued shortly before 1pm on Friday. Bayrou brings extensive political experience, dating back to the early 1980s. His career has included 19 years as a member of the National Assembly, service as minister of education, and time in the European Parliament. A three-time presidential candidate (2002, 2007 and 2012), Bayrou was also an early supporter of Macron, although he sometimes allowed himself to criticise him. 'François Bayrou has the necessary qualities; he is pragmatic and has a clear vision,' a MoDem deputy told Euractiv on Thursday. MoDem has been advocating for a 'national unity government' since the summer, calling for the inclusion of all centrist movements, including the Socialist Party (PS). Jean-Noël Barrot, minister for Europe and foreign affairs and a fellow MoDem member, immediately praised the appointment. 'Warm congratulations to François Bayrou on his nomination as Prime Minister. Those who have shared his battles know he will address the country’s deep needs for reconciliation and unity,' he said. However, Socialist leaders have insisted that the new prime minister should come from the New Popular Front (NFP), a left-wing coalition hastily formed before the summer legislative elections. On Thursday, Boris Vallaud, leader of the PS group in the National Assembly, warned that appointing a figure from Macron's camp, such as Bayrou, 'would risk exacerbating the political and institutional crisis he created.' This did not stop the Socialists from asking Bayrou in a letter to renounce Article 49.3 of the Constitution, which allows laws to be passed without the support of Parliament, in exchange for non-censorship, specifying that they would remain in opposition. Bayrou’s appointment appears to be an attempt by Macron to fracture the left-wing coalition and isolate La France Insoumise (LFI). LFI has already announced it will support any future no-confidence motions against the government. 'We want a change in policy,' stated Fabien Roussel, first secretary of the Communist Party (PC), shortly after the announcement, adding on the contrary that he was 'ready to engage in dialogue' with the new prime minister. On the political right, Les Républicains (LR) have pledged to avoid bringing down the government unless it includes LFI ministers or implements NFP policies. Despite past grievances with Bayrou, stemming from his endorsement of François Hollande over Nicolas Sarkozy in 2012, LR is expected to offer conditional support.Meanwhile, Jordan Bardella, president of the far-right National Rally (RN), commented that Bayrou 'must understand he lacks both democratic legitimacy and a parliamentary majority.' However, RN leaders might view his appointment favourably, given Bayrou’s recent legal vindication in February 2024 over allegations similar to those facing RN regarding the misuse of European Parliament funds. Bayrou has also expressed concerns about democratic fairness, opposing any immediate enforcement of Marine Le Pen’s potential five-year ineligibility, should she be convicted in the RN embezzelment trial. Preventing Le Pen from running in the 2027 presidential race, he argued, could 'bias democratic life' and alienate voters. Floated as a potential leader for some months, Bayrou recently expressed his willingness to serve, hinting at his ambitions. Following a meeting between Macron and party representatives (excluding LFI and RN) on 10 December, Bayrou proposed a 'democratic cooperation agreement' and suggested delaying contentious issues like pension reform and immigration. The immediate challenge for Bayrou will be drafting a budget for 2025. A 'special law,' presented to the cabinet on Wednesday, will be debated next week in the National Assembly to ensure the continuation of public services, provisional tax collection, and expenditure rollovers from 2024. However, longer-term solutions to reduce the public deficit – expected to exceed 6% of GDP in 2024 – will likely require either tax hikes or spending cuts. Bayrou’s appointment, like that of his predecessor Michel Barnier, is likely to be well-received in Brussels. Known for his pro-European stance, Bayrou has consistently supported EU institutions and policies. 'Congratulations, François Bayrou on your appointment as Prime Minister of France. Europe has always been close to your heart. Let's all work together for a stronger, more competitive Europe that has the means to defend itself', reactedthe President of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWdpiiQ7e2PAN-Hzuf4i5kwW	2024-12-13T16:19:45-08:00	
Trump Has The Tools To Address Ukraine Conflict Effectively – Ana...	By Luke Coffey One of the top foreign policy challenges facing the next administration of President Donald Trump will be the ongoing war between Russia and Ukraine.When Trump enters the Oval Office on Jan. 20, Russia’s invasion of Ukraine will be nearing its third anniversary. Speculation abounds about how Trump will approach this conflict, but it seems clear that he genuinely desires a peaceful resolution.Achieving this, however, will be no easy task. For peace to endure, Ukrainians — who are the victims in this war — must feel that any negotiated settlement is fair and just. Additionally, they will need assurance of future security.Leading up to the US presidential election, many expressed concerns about how a Trump victory might affect Ukraine. Would he withdraw US support? However, since his historic victory last month, the world is beginning to see how he might approach the issue. Early indications suggest that Ukrainians have reason to be cautiously optimistic.Trump will want to avoid appearing weak. Any resolution that leaves Russia looking victorious and Ukraine defeated would undermine America’s global image. Avoiding a geopolitical disaster akin to the chaotic withdrawal from Afghanistan will likely be a priority for his administration.Moreover, Trump’s innate desire to be seen as a winner will compel him to secure a deal perceived as favorable to both Ukraine and US interests. Among America’s partners in Europe, the Middle East, and East Asia, abandoning Ukraine would be seen as a failure — a perception Trump is unlikely to tolerate.Trump’s appointments to key national security positions bode well for Ukraine. While the nomination of former Congresswoman Tulsi Gabbard as director of National Intelligence has sparked controversy, the rest of his team appears solid.His nominee for secretary of state, Sen. Marco Rubio, has a strong understanding of the Ukraine conflict and has consistently supported US engagement in the region. Similarly, National Security Adviser-designate Mike Waltz has shown a commitment to robust American leadership and understands the threats posed by Russia. Retired Gen. Keith Kellogg, who will serve as Trump’s special envoy for Russia and Ukraine, brings credibility and strategic insight to the table. Notably, Kellogg has publicly endorsed Ukraine’s use of long-range American missiles, arguing this provides Trump with greater leverage in future negotiations.Recent engagements between Trump and Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelensky offer further hope. The two met in person during the height of the US presidential campaign in September, with reports indicating a productive discussion.This meeting seemed to influence Trump’s rhetoric, which shifted to a more positive tone regarding Ukraine. Since the election, Trump and Zelensky have spoken by phone, and top Ukrainian advisers have visited Mar-a-Lago for further discussions. Additionally, at the reopening of the Notre Dame Cathedral in Paris, French President Emmanuel Macron hosted a trilateral meeting with Trump and Zelensky. Such sustained engagement suggests a serious intent to address the conflict responsibly.Trump’s track record on major foreign policy issues also indicates he will approach the Ukraine situation with deliberation. During his first presidential campaign in 2016 his top foreign policy pledge was to withdraw from the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, also known as the Iran nuclear deal.However, after entering office in January of 2017 it was not until May of 2018, about one-third of the way through his first term, that he finally took America out of the deal. And he did so only after a very detailed and months-long interagency review across the US government that resulted in the maximum-pressure campaign against Iran after leaving the deal.One might agree or disagree on whether leaving the deal was sensible or whether the maximum-pressure campaign was the right strategy but nobody can argue that Trump rushed the decision with little or no thought. Therefore, there is reason to believe that he will approach the situation in Ukraine with the same level of diligence.A recent poll shows that almost half of Ukrainians now have trust in Trump, up from only 10 percent in 2023. This reflects widespread frustration with the Biden administration’s approach to the conflict. While Ukrainians appreciated the outgoing administration’s initial support in the early days of the war, many feel its risk-averse strategy — delivering just enough aid for Ukraine to survive but not enough to win — has prolonged the conflict.After nearly three years of stalled progress, many Ukrainians are open to seeing if Trump can deliver a secure, just, and lasting peace.That said, Trump will face competing priorities upon taking office, many of which will involve domestic politics. At the top of the list will be securing the southern border and boosting the economy. While his national security team appears well-equipped to deal with any peace talks, there will undoubtedly be voices within the administration downplaying Ukraine’s importance.Trump must resist these pressures and focus on achieving a fair and just resolution to the war that guarantees Ukraine’s security. Doing so would not only align with America’s national interests but also cement Trump’s legacy as a global statesman — a goal he is likely keen to achieve.With sound political appointments, positive engagement with Ukraine, and a history of methodical decision-making on foreign policy, Trump has the tools to address the Ukraine conflict effectively.There is reason to believe he can help bring a just end to the war — an achievement that would benefit Ukraine, the US, and the international community as a whole.

Ukraine, Syria Key Focus Of Biden Talks With G7	By Patsy Widakuswara U.S. President Joe Biden met virtually with G7 leaders Friday to secure support for Kyiv’s fight against Russia’s invasion, less than six weeks before President-elect Donald Trump, a skeptic of aid to Ukraine, is set to take office. The talks followed Washington’s $20 billion disbursement earlier this week to a new World Bank fund that will provide economic support for Ukraine. The money is part of a new $50 billion loan for Kyiv from the Group of Seven democracies that will be paid back with interest income earned from Russian sovereign assets immobilized in G7 countries. Earlier this week Biden approved a new security assistance package for Ukraine that will provide Kyiv with additional air defense, artillery, drones, and armored vehicles — the 72nd such drawdown package announced by Washington since Russia’s invasion. 'As the president made clear, we’re going to continue to provide additional packages right up until the end of this administration,' White House National Security spokesperson John Kirby said during a news briefing Thursday. On Jan. 20, Biden will hand over power to Trump, who has been critical of using American taxpayers’ money to help Kyiv. Without providing details, Trump often boasts he can swiftly end the war — a statement that many in Europe fear would mean forcing Ukraine to capitulate. 'We are likely to see the G7 redouble support for Ukraine in part because of concerns that President Trump may reduce support,' said William Courtney, adjunct senior fellow at the RAND Corp, to VOA in an interview. Additional sanctions on Russia appear to be in the works, Courtney told VOA. Syria aftermath G7 leaders also focused on fast-moving events related to the momentous transition of power in Syria following the ouster of President Bashar al-Assad. On Thursday , the leaders said in a statement they 'stand ready to support a transition process that leads to credible, inclusive, and non-sectarian governance' in Syria. Support for the new government is conditional upon 'respect for the rule of law, universal human rights, including women's rights, the protection of all Syrians, including religious and ethnic minorities, transparency and accountability,' the leaders’ statement said. Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, the rebel group that toppled Assad, is a U.S.-designated foreign terrorist organization. Its leader, Abu Mohammed al-Jolani, has a $10 million bounty on his head. The U.S. and other G7 countries have signaled that HTS’ delisting from their terror list would be dependent upon how inclusive the new government would be. In recent years, Jolani has distanced himself from extremist ideology. Since the rebels’ victory, he has sought to assure his non-sectarian stance to Syria’s ethnic and religious minorities, which include Christians, Kurds, Druze and the Alawite community, a sect from which the Assad family originates. Trump has also signaled that he wants the U.S. to stay out of the Syrian conflict. 'This is not our fight,' Trump said on social media in response to Assad’s ouster. 'Let it play out. Do not get involved!' It’s unclear whether a new U.S. administration would be able to maintain a hands-off approach that Trump said he wants. There are approximately 900 American troops stationed in Syria, and Washington has close ties with all of Syria’s neighbors including allies Turkey and Israel. Both are already making military maneuvers to secure their interests. Two days after the Syrian rebels took control of Damascus on Dec. 8, Israel launched airstrikes across the country, further weakening what remains of the Assad regime’s military, once a stalwart-ally of Israel’s archnemesis, Iran. Since then, Israeli troops have advanced deeper into the U.N.-patrolled buffer zone separating the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights and Syrian territory. The United Nations said Israel’s actions violate the country’s 1974 Disengagement Agreement with Syria. The U.S. said it is in line with Israel’s right to self-defense, to avoid weapons falling into extremists’ hands amid a vacuum in power. Meanwhile, Syrian Kurds near the northern border with Turkey have been displaced amid clashes between U.S.-backed Kurdish forces and Ankara-backed rebels. The U.S. brokered a ceasefire deal between the groups on Wednesday but it is unclear whether the fragile truce will hold. U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken and National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan are currently in the region for talks, hoping to ensure a smooth transition in Damascus and making a last-ditch diplomatic push to achieve a deal to end fighting between Israel and Hamas in Gaza.

How Will The World Cup Change Saudi Arabia? – OpEd	By Sulafa Alkhunaizi Preparations are set to begin across Saudi Arabia to ensure a seamless World Cup in 2034 after the Kingdom was officially named host. So, how will the World Cup, one of the world’s premier sporting events, change Saudi Arabia? As stated in the Kingdom’s bid, games will be played in 15 stadiums, with 11 yet to be built, spread across Riyadh, Jeddah, Alkhobar, Abha, and NEOM. Luckily, the Kingdom has ample time to learn from previous World Cups, as well as the upcoming event: 2026 will be jointly hosted by the US, Mexico, and Canada, and 2030 jointly hosted by Spain, Portugal, and Morocco. Saudi Arabia’s opening game and final will be held in the new 92,760-capacity King Salman International Stadium in Riyadh. Existing stadiums, including 'The Shining Jewel' in Jeddah, will undergo major refurbishment and expansion. Each stadium must have a capacity of at least 40,000, with quarterfinal and semifinal venues able to accommodate 60,000 spectators. Stadiums for the opening match and the final must have a minimum capacity of 80,000. As well as the stadiums, Saudi Arabia plans to construct around 230,000 hotel rooms across five host cities to accommodate visiting fans and dignitaries. Looking at its eastern neighbor Qatar might give some indication of how the major infrastructure projects will leave their mark on Saudi Arabia. While many of Qatar’s World Cup venues, including the iconic Lusail Stadium, are being used by the Qatar Stars League, others are being repurposed. These include the Al-Bayt Stadium, part of which will be converted into a hotel and shopping center. Ebraheem Alghafees is one of many Saudis excited about the Kingdom hosting the World Cup. Alghafees attended the 2022 tournament in Qatar, and said that it was nothing short of extraordinary. 'Attending the games was thrilling, and the electrifying atmosphere in the stadiums left an indelible impression on me.' He told Arab News that Saudi Arabia can 'draw several lessons' from previous World Cups. 'First, investing heavily in infrastructure and transportation is crucial for accommodating global audiences. 'Second, creating a cultural narrative that showcases Saudi heritage, while leveraging advanced technologies, can help deliver a memorable experience. 'Lastly, fostering a welcoming environment through hospitality initiatives will ensure that visitors leave with positive impressions of the Kingdom.' Describing his excitement about Saudi Arabia’s hosting of the 2034 event, Alghafees said: 'It represents a golden opportunity for the Kingdom to showcase its rapid transformation and global aspirations under Vision 2030. 'Hosting such an event will unite people worldwide and position Saudi Arabia as a hub for cultural exchange, innovation, and excellence. It is an honor to see the Kingdom rise to the occasion on such a grand scale.' Saudi Arabia first held a FIFA event, the World Youth Championship, in 1989. In 1997, there was the Confederations Cup. But during the past five to 10 years, the number of sporting events and tournaments — not just football — held in the Kingdom has skyrocketed, earning the country a solid reputation as a host.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWdpiiQ7e2PAN_hBwoJEp7KJ	2024-12-13T16:07:04-08:00	
Finding The Unmentionable: Amnesty International, Israel And Geno...	It was bound to happen. With continuing operations in Gaza, and increasingly violent activities being conducted against Palestinians in the occupied territories, human rights organisations are making increasingly severe assessments of Israel’s warring cause. While the world awaits the findings of the International Court of Justice on whether Israel’s campaign, as argued by South Africa, amounts to genocide, Amnesty International has already reached its conclusions. In a 296-page report sporting the ominous title 'You Feel Like You Are Subhuman', the human rights body, after considering the events in Gaza between October 2023 and July 2024, identified a 'pattern of conduct' that indicated genocidal intent. These included, among other things, persistent direct attacks on civilians and objects 'and deliberately indiscriminate strikes over the nine-month period, wiping out entire families repeatedly launched at times when these strikes would result in high numbers of casualties'; the nature of the weapons used; the speed and scale of destruction to civilian objects and infrastructure (homes, shelters, health facilities, water and sanitation infrastructure, agricultural land'; the use of bulldozing and controlled demolitions; and the use of 'incomprehensible, misleading and arbitrary ‘evacuation’ orders’'. The report does much to focus on statements made from the highest officials to the common soldiery to reveal the mental state necessary to reveal genocide. 102 statements made by members of the Knesset, government officials and high-ranking commanders 'dehumanized Palestinians, or called for, or justified genocidal acts or other crimes under international law against them.' The report also examined 62 videos, audio recordings and photographs posted online featuring gleeful Israeli soldiers rejoicing in the 'destruction of Gaza or the denial of essential services to people in Gaza, or celebrated the destruction of Palestinian homes, mosques, schools and universities, including through controlled demolitions, in some cases without apparent military necessity.' From its alternative universe, the Israeli public relations machine drew from its own agitprop specialists, working on mangling the language of the report. The formula is familiar: attack the authors first, not their premises. 'The deplorable and fanatical organisation Amnesty International has once again produced a fabricated response that is entirely based on lies,' came the howl from Israeli Foreign Ministry spokesperson Oren Marmorstein. Other methods of repudiation involve detaching Hamas and its war with Israel from any historical continuum, not least the fact that it was aided, supported and backed by Israel for years as a counter to Fatah in the West Bank. Isolating Hamas as a terrorist aberration also serves to treat it as alien, artificially foreign and not part of any resistance movement against suffocating Israeli occupation and strangulation. They, so goes this argument, are genocidal, and countering such a body can never be, by any stretch, genocidal. The pro-Israeli group NGO Monitor abides by this line of reasoning, calling allegations of genocide against Israel 'a reversal of the actual and clearly established intent of Hamas and its allies (including its patron, Iran), to wipe Israel off the map'. Israel’s closest ally and sponsor, the United States, proved predictable in rejecting the findings while still claiming to respect the humanitarian line. The US State Department’s principal deputy spokesman, Vedant Patel, expressed disagreement 'with the conclusions of such a report. We had said previously and continue to find that the allegations of genocide are unfounded.' Patel did, however, pay lip service to the 'vital role that civil society organizations like Amnesty International and human rights groups and NGOs play in providing information and analysis as it relates to Gaza and what’s going on.' Vital, but only up to a point. Far less guarded assessments can be found in the American pro-Israeli chatter sphere. These follow the usual pattern. Orde Kittrie, senior fellow of the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, a name that can only imply that crimes committed in such a cause are bound to be justifiable, offers a neat illustration. Amnesty, he argues, 'systematically and repeatedly mischaracterizes both the facts and the law.' Kittrie suggests his own mischaracterisation by parroting the IDF’s line that Hamas had 'increased casualty counts by illegally using Palestinian civilian shields and by hiding weapons and war fighters in and below homes, hospitals, mosques, and other buildings.' This conveniently ignores that point that the numbers are not necessarily proof of genocidal intent, though it helps. The report also notes that, even in the face of such tactics by Hamas, Israel was still 'obligated to take all feasible precautions to spare civilians and avoid attacks that would be indiscriminate or disproportionate.' Amnesty International’s report is yet another addition to the gloomy literature on the subject. Human Rights Watch, in November, pointed to violations of the laws of war, crimes against humanity, and the provisional measures of the ICJ issued urging Israel to abide by the obligations imposed by the UN Genocide Convention of 1948. The Israeli human rights organisation B’Tselem stated in no uncertain terms in October that 'Israel intends to forcibly displace northern Gaza’s residents by committing some of the gravest crimes under the laws of war'. Battling over the designation of whether a campaign is genocidal can act as a distraction, a field of quibbles for paper pushing pedants. The 'specific intent' in proof must be unequivocally demonstrated and beyond any other reasonable inference. A smokescreen is thereby deployed that risks masking the broader ambit of war crimes and crimes against humanity. But no amount of pedantry and disagreement can arrest the sense that Israel’s lethal conduct, whatever threshold it may reach in international law, is directed at destroying not merely Palestinian life but any worthwhile sense of a viable sovereignty. Amnesty Israel, while rejecting the central claim of the parent organisation’s report did make one concession: the country’s brutal response following October 7, 2023 'may amount to crimes against humanity and ethnic cleansing.'	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWdpiiQ7e2PAN91siAvHAKPk	2024-12-13T16:05:03-08:00	
Malaysia: Immigrants Line Up To Leave Before Repatriation Deadlin...	By Iman Muttaqin Yusof and Ili Shazwani Ihsan After living in Malaysia for 12 years without proper papers, Ramlah, an Indonesian woman, plans to return home through a voluntary repatriation program for foreign migrants that expires on Dec. 31, or face fines or prison. The 57-year-old originally came to Kuala Lumpur to visit her son, and occasionally sold snacks here to make some money. Now, she’s ready to return to Aceh province with her daughter, 10, who was born in Malaysia but holds a non-citizen birth certificate. 'It’s time to go back,' Ramlah, who goes by one name, told BenarNews, while holding her daughter’s hand as they lined up at the immigration office’s compound in Kuala Lumpur. 'I’m grateful to Malaysia for the opportunities here, but this isn’t our country. We have to return and rebuild our lives back home.' Her son, who is in Kuala Lumpur, legally, plans to stay in the country. Ramlah is among 200,000 foreign nationals in Malaysia who have seized on the opportunity to return home through the Migrant Repatriation Program, a 10-month amnesty program where they can leave the country without facing arrest or penalties after paying a small fee and proving they have made necessary travel arrangements. Starting in 2025, immigration offenders who remain in the country face fines of up to 10,000 ringgit (U.S. $2,247), a prison term of up to five years, or both. Those who overstay risk daily compounding fines and harsher penalties for repeat offenses. ‘Self-surrender’ Wan Mohammed Saupee Wan Yusoff, the Kuala Lumpur immigration director, said the program was designed to 'encourage self-surrender among migrants.' The majority of those enrolling in the program hail from Indonesia, Bangladesh, Myanmar, Nepal and India. 'This initiative allows individuals who have overstayed or violated immigration laws to leave Malaysia by paying minimal fines instead of facing legal prosecution,' he told BenarNews. Those who want to return to their home countries must have valid passports and tickets to leave within 14 days of receiving the pass through the program, provided they pay a reduced fine of 500 ringgit ($112) and secure travel documents. The program’s response has been strongest in Selangor and Johor states along with Kuala Lumpur, he said, noting that many undocumented migrants work in construction, manufacturing and domestic services. 'Starting Jan. 1, we will ramp up immigration operations nationwide to apprehend those who remain undocumented. These individuals will face full legal consequences,' Wan Mohammed Saupee said. Kicking off the program in March, Home Minister Saifuddin Nasution Ismail said about 600,000 undocumented immigrants were expected to register by the end of December. Results appear to fall short of the projection – in Kuala Lumpur, over 30,000 migrants have signed up, while local daily Harian Metro reported over 200,000 have participated nationwide.The immigration department did not respond to a BenarNews request for updated data on the program. One returnee, Bangladeshi construction worker Syakir Munsyid, 38, said the program offered a chance to return home with dignity. After nine years in Malaysia, he decided to leave because his son had health issues back home. 'I’m grateful to the government for this program. It has made it easier for me to return with my family,' he told BenarNews. Criticisms Even as officials praise the program for its amnesty approach, critics argue that it is deeply flawed. Adrian Pereira, executive director of the North-South Initiative, a migrant rights advocacy group, said many workers became undocumented because of systemic failures. 'According to our research, workers often lose their legal status due to exploitative employers, lack of proper documentation pathways or even scams,' Pereira told BenarNews. 'Punishing them with fines and blacklisting them from returning is unjust. It’s a brutal system that profits off their hardships.' Pereira also questioned what will be done with collected fines. 'Is this money being reinvested in migrant-related services, or does it disappear into government coffers?' he said. British migrant rights activist Andy Hall acknowledged that while the voluntary repatriation program benefits some workers, it often overlooks victims of forced labor. 'Many workers returning through this program have faced serious abuse and exploitation during their time in Malaysia,' Hall said. 'The government must screen for victims of human trafficking before repatriation to ensure justice and proper remediation.' What’s next? Immigration authorities are preparing for a significant enforcement push, beginning Jan. 1. 'Starting next year, we will ramp up operations nationwide,' immigration’s Wan Mohammed Saupee said. 'Those who remain undocumented will face full legal consequences, including prosecution, fines, or imprisonment. 'We are focusing on three groups – undocumented migrants, employers and those providing shelter,' Wan Mohammed Saupee said. 'Our goal is to create an ecosystem that is unconducive for illegal immigrants.'	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWdpiiQ7e2PAN8ek8dPn3ySr	2024-12-13T16:03:11-08:00	
Alleged Chinese Spy Tied To Prince Andrew Is Businessman Yang Ten...	A businessman with close ties to Prince Andrew who has been banned from entry into the U.K. is a longtime operative who did little to hide his ties to Beijing. RFA can identify the man who served as a business advisor to the Duke of York as Yang Tengbo, a director of the consultancy Hampton Group International, based on details revealed in the immigration judgmentagainst him, as well as evidence gathered from open source intelligence that corroborates information released by the U.K. court. Yang is listed as a director of the London-based group, which was known to have gained connections to top U.K. government officials as early as in 2020, including Prince Andrew. The judgment from the Special Immigration Appeals Tribunal made public Friday determined that a Chinese national, codenamed H6, should be barred from entering the U.K. on national security grounds, as he is alleged to have plotted to secretly advance Beijing’s interest in Britain using his ties to high profile figures. H6 was born on March 21, 1974 and founded a U.K. company in 2005 that changed its name in 2020, according to the ruling. While the judgement does not name the company, Yang Tengbo shares H6’s birthdate and founded Newland UK Ltd in 2005, which changed its name in 2020 to Hampton Group International Ltd, according to Companies House. An emailed enquiry to the Hampton Group on Friday returned a message that the group’s server would not accept emails from RFA. The judgment also noted that H6 was an honorary member of a Sino-British business association, the 48 Group Club, which describes itself as the product of the 'first western trade delegation to the newly formed People’s Republic of China' in 1954. The club’s founder was made an honorary red guard member by Mao Zedong and today the organization is frequently lauded in Chinese media. It was accused of acting as a conduit for the Chinese state to 'groom' senior British businessmen and political figures, in 'Hidden Hand' a 2020 book by Australian researchers looking at covert Chinese influence worldwide. The club has previously insisted that it acts only in the U.K.’s national interest and tried to block the publication of the book. Yang can be found among the honorary members in an archived 'who’s who' page from 2022, where he is listed as 'Mr Chris Yang, Chairman, Hampton Group.' An emailed request for comment to the 48 Group Club was met with an automatic reply promising a response as soon as possible. No further response was received as of publication. Yang’s name has not been published in the U.K. press, despite numerous identifying details about him in the judgment. There is a temporary anonymity order appended to the judgement. When asked by RFA, the U.K.’s Home Office would not confirm the identity of H6 or the reason for the order. Other details from the judgment include the assertion that H6 was working for the United Front Works Department – an arm of the Chinese government that seeks to promote its political, economic and social agenda abroad. Such efforts range from using Chinese nationals and sympathizers to broadcast Beijing-friendly talking points to gathering personal information about people of interest. Yang has frequently and publicly echoed the points United Front advances and had ties to the central government he did not hide, although the judgement notes that he 'deliberately obscured his links with the Chinese State, the CCP and the UFWD' in interviews with U.K. authorities. In 2022, he was photographed attending the Chinese People’s Political Consultative Conference, or CPPCC, in Beijing, where he was also interviewed by the state media outlet China Daily. The CPPCC is the leading body in China’s United Front system. The China Daily quotes Yang as praising China’s Belt and Road Initiative, a vast project of exporting Chinese-funded infrastructure projects abroad. 'As an overseas Chinese businessman in the U.K., I have actively participated in the 'Belt and Road' initiative since it was proposed. China-U.K. cooperation in third-party markets is showing new characteristics of effectively reducing the risk of conflict and promoting harmonious regional development,' he said. In a filmed 2019 interview with Europe Daily News, a Chinese media outlet registered in France widely reported to be a United Front organization, Yang gives his biography to the camera, telling the reporter that he went to the U.K. in 2002 to study at a public administration school. After graduation, he started in the tourism industry to generate cash flow, he says. Those biographical details are echoed in the court judgement. 'Between 2007 and 2012, China experienced a strong trend of ‘going out’,' he says in the video interview. 'We helped domestic enterprises [and] State-owned enterprises expand internationally, starting from tourism and moving into the conference and public relations industries.' 'In 2013, British companies began expressing interest in entering the Chinese market, so our group pivoted to strategic consulting,' Yang continues. 'Next, we plan to transform into an investment group.' He also reveals that 'in 2017, through a very unexpected opportunity, a prince entrusted us with bringing this project to China.' The 'prince' appears to refer to Prince Andrew and the project appears to be the Pitch@Palace program, an initiative by the prince to connect entrepreneursseeking funding to wealthy investors. When asked what was different about making friends with princes and high-ranking figures, Yang replies: 'Trust is the most important thing.' The judgement notes that MI5, the U.K.’s domestic intelligence agency, considered that H6 'poses a risk to U.K. national security.' Prince Andrew’s office issued a statement Friday evening insisting that he had 'ceased all contact' with the alleged Chinese spy following advice from the U.K. government. 'Nothing of a sensitive nature was ever discussed' with Yang, he said, adding that he was 'unable to comment further on matters relating to national security.' Besides Prince Andrew, Yang appears to have had access to the top echelons of British society. A profile of Yang that aired on CCTV, the Chinese state broadcaster, features a shot of his desk, upon which sits a photo of him with former prime minister Theresa May and another with former prime minister David Cameron. Beijing has long defended the United Front, saying the group aims primarily to improve national prosperity and happiness, and calling claims of espionage or infiltration 'conspiracy theories. Such language was echoed in a press statement issued on Friday, in which the spokesperson for the Chinese Embassy in London denounced the judgement as the product of a campaign to 'smear China and sabotage normal people-to-people exchanges between China and the U.K.' 'Some on the British side repeatedly use China’s United Front work as a pretext to accuse China of wrongdoing, discredit China’s political system, and undermine normal exchanges and cooperation between China and the U.K. Such sinister plots will never succeed,' the spokesperson said. 'We urge the relevant parties in the U.K. to immediately stop creating trouble, stop spreading the 'China threat' narrative, and stop undermining normal exchanges between China and the U.K.,' they added. Yang could not be reached for comment.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWdpiiQ7e2PAN57-TWpzP_St	2024-12-13T15:56:22-08:00	
EVM Allegations: Deflecting Accountability In Indian Politics – A...	India, the world's largest democracy, faces the monumental task of conducting elections for a staggering electorate of over 1 billion voters. To put this into perspective, India’s voter base is almost four times larger than that of the United States, the second-largest democracy. While the United States often requires weeks to tally its votes, India achieves this feat within 6-8 hours—a remarkable accomplishment made possible by the adoption of Electronic Voting Machines (EVMs). The 2024 General Elections of India marked a significant milestone for the machine, which has now been used in five parliamentary elections since 2004. The journey of the EVM has been transformative, with its usage significantly enhancing electoral efficiency while simultaneously sparking debates about its reliability and potential for manipulation. The Genesis of EVMs The concept of the EVM was first envisioned in 1977. A prototype was developed in 1979 by the Electronics Corporation of India Ltd. (ECIL), Hyderabad—a public sector enterprise under the Department of Atomic Energy. The journey from conception to implementation required building consensus among stakeholders and ensuring the machine’s technical soundness. The first pilot use of EVMs occurred on May 19, 1982, in 50 polling stations during the election for the Parur Assembly constituency in Kerala. However, their use without explicit legal backing led to a challenge in the Supreme Court. While the court refrained from passing judgment on the efficacy of EVMs, it declared the use of these machines at that time as beyond the jurisdiction of the Election Commission (EC). Consequently, the election results in polling stations where EVMs were used were nullified. Legal Empowerment and Expanded Usage: To address the legal lacuna, the Representation of the People Act, 1951, was amended in 1988, introducing Section 61A, which explicitly empowered the Election Commission to use EVMs. This amendment, which came into effect in March 1989, laid the legal foundation for their broader adoption. Subsequently, Bharat Electronics Ltd. (BEL), Bengaluru, another public sector undertaking under the Ministry of Defence, developed an EVM prototype. Along with ECIL, BEL was tasked with manufacturing these machines. An expert committee convened by the central government in 1990 deemed the EVMs technically robust, secure, and transparent, paving the way for their formal integration into the electoral process. Scaling Up: From Pilot Projects to Nationwide Adoption: EVMs were first deployed on a significant scale during the 1998 assembly elections in 16 constituencies across Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan, and Delhi. Their success prompted further adoption in the 1999 parliamentary elections across 46 constituencies and in 45 assembly constituencies during the 2000 Haryana elections. By 2004, EVMs were used in all 543 Lok Sabha constituencies—a milestone that revolutionized the voting process in India. To enhance security and transparency, EVMs underwent several upgrades. In 2001, new technological advancements were incorporated, and further improvements were made in 2006 to ensure robustness against tampering and to address evolving electoral needs. The Introduction of VVPAT: One of the most significant advancements in EVM technology came in 2013, with the integration of the Voter Verifiable Paper Audit Trail (VVPAT) system. This innovation aimed to address concerns about transparency and trust by allowing voters to verify their choices through a printed paper slip. The Conduct of Election Rules, 1961, were amended to accommodate the use of VVPATs, which debuted in the Noksen Assembly by-election in Nagaland. Today, the combination of EVMs and VVPATs ensures both speed and accountability in vote counting. A Transformative Journey: EVMs have undoubtedly transformed the electoral landscape of India. By drastically reducing the time required for vote counting, they have enabled quicker results and minimized opportunities for malpractices like ballot stuffing and rigging. The machines have also contributed to significant cost savings in the electoral process, eliminating the need for printing millions of ballot papers. However, their journey has not been without challenges. Several political parties and civil society organizations have raised questions about the machines' security and reliability. Allegations of tampering and malfunctioning, though rare and largely unsubstantiated, have sparked debates, leading to calls for further reforms and enhancements in the technology. EVM Credibility Concerns: A Face Saver for many failures Over the past 15 years, Electronic Voting Machines (EVMs) in India have faced persistent scrutiny and controversy, with concerns raised by various political leaders and parties. The debate, which has evolved significantly over time, has had profound implications for India's electoral processes and democratic ethos. The Genesis of Concerns: L.K. Advani's Advocacy for VVPAT The first prominent voice questioning the credibility of EVMs came from L.K. Advani, a senior BJP leader, following the party's defeat in the 2009 Lok Sabha elections. Advani expressed concerns not about reverting to paper ballots but about ensuring EVM reliability. He strongly advocated for introducing Voter Verifiable Paper Audit Trail (VVPAT) systems to enhance transparency and address public skepticism. His advocacy significantly influenced the electoral reforms that followed. In the same year, Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi, then BJP’s election in-charge for assembly polls in Maharashtra, Haryana, and Arunachal Pradesh, alleged that EVM manipulation had contributed to the Congress party's victories. However, Naqvi later backtracked, suggesting other factors could explain the defeats. This marked an early instance of EVM allegations becoming part of electoral rhetoric. Congress' EVM Allegations Post-2014 The Congress party first raised substantial concerns about EVM credibility following its resounding defeat in the 2014 general elections, which saw the BJP secure a sweeping victory. Prominent leaders such as Kapil Sibal, Ghulam Nabi Azad, and Digvijaya Singh questioned the reliability of the machines, alleging potential tampering to favor the BJP. These concerns resurfaced after BJP's unprecedented victory in Uttar Pradesh and other state elections, with Congress joining other opposition parties to demand mandatory VVPAT integration for greater transparency. The Controversial London Demonstration On January 21, 2019, a controversial demonstration against EVMs took place in London, unofficially associated with Congress. Organized by the Indian Journalists’ Association (Europe) in collaboration with the Hackers’ Conference, the event featured Syed Shuja, a U.S.-based self-proclaimed cybersecurity expert. Shuja claimed to have worked on EVM development in India and alleged widespread tampering in past elections. Senior Congress leader Kapil Sibal's attendance at the event drew significant political attention. The Election Commission of India (ECI) dismissed Shuja's allegations as baseless, citing a lack of credible evidence. The event triggered an investigation into potential political motivations, with Congress officially distancing itself from the claims. Persistent Opposition The Congress has consistently raised EVM-related concerns after subsequent electoral defeats, including in Haryana, Maharashtra, and the 2019 general elections. Congress leader Jairam Ramesh recently wrote to the Chief Election Commissioner in January 2024, representing the INDIA alliance’s apprehensions about the lack of action on EVM-related grievances. In October 2024, spokesperson Pawan Khera alleged irregularities during Haryana polls, citing unexplained anomalies in EVM battery charges during vote counting. These allegations added fuel to the ongoing demand for enhanced electoral transparency. The Congress has also pursued legal avenues, filing petitions in the Supreme Court challenging EVM usage. However, these petitions have been dismissed due to insufficient evidence. Globally, comparisons with electoral practices in other democracies have added depth to the debate, highlighting the need for audit mechanisms to bolster confidence in electronic voting systems. Adding a global twist, a recent social media post by Tesla CEO Elon Musk questioned the reliability of EVMs, reigniting domestic debates. This statement aligned with the demands of Congress and allied parties, who have consistently called for reforms or a return to paper ballots in the absence of robust EVM safeguards. In November 2024, Congress MP Shashi Tharoor broke from his party's stance on EVMs after their poor showing in the Maharashtra Assembly elections. In a post on X, he defended EVM reliability, stating they are a significant improvement over paper ballots. However, he acknowledged concerns about potential manipulation within the electoral system, calling it a critical issue from the elections. The Recrudescence of EVM Ghost Following the Bharatiya Janata Party-led Mahayuti coalition’s sweeping victory in the Maharashtra Assembly elections, securing 235 out of 288 seats, allegations of EVM tampering resurfaced among Opposition leaders. A widely circulated video purportedly shows a man claiming over a video call that he can hack EVMs, sparking further controversy. A Facebook post accompanying the video alleged that the man revealed details about the methods and costs of EVM hacking linked to the Maharashtra election results. The Election Commission of India (ECI) dismissed these claims as baseless, filing an FIR against Syed Shuja, who had previously made similar allegations. The ECI reiterated that EVMs are tamper-proof, with the Electronics Corporation of India Ltd. (ECIL) refuting Shuja’s assertion of involvement in EVM development. The ECI emphasized that EVMs are standalone machines not connected to the internet or any network, rendering hacking claims implausible. The Election Commission of India (ECI) invited all political parties to hack the Electronic Voting Machines (EVMs) in June 2017 through an event called the 'EVM Challenge.' The ECI set June 3, 2017, as the date for this event, providing an opportunity for parties to demonstrate their claims that EVMs could be tampered with. Despite widespread allegations about EVM tampering, the challenge saw no significant takers among political parties. The event highlighted the ECI's confidence in the tamper-proof design of EVMs and its willingness to address concerns through transparency. As of August 31, 2024, the poll panel confirmed no discrepancies between EVM and VVPAT data in the verified constituencies. Of the eight constituencies where post-election applications sought result validation, four were checked, and all proved accurate. Similarly, in the Maharashtra elections, 1,440 VVPAT machines across 288 constituencies were cross-verified on the counting day, November 23, and no mismatches were reported. The state's Chief Election Officer reiterated that the results were consistent and reliable. Judicial Endorsement of EVMs In April 2024, the Supreme Court dismissed pleas for 100% cross-verification of EVM votes with VVPAT slips, affirming confidence in the existing system. Despite persistent opposition demands for complete VVPAT verification, the consistent accuracy in matched data has bolstered the ECI's defense of EVM integrity. On November 26, 2024, the Supreme Court dismissed a Public Interest Litigation (PIL) seeking a return to the paper ballot system, underscoring that allegations against Electronic Voting Machines (EVMs) often emerge based on electoral outcomes rather than evidence. The court reiterated its confidence in the stringent checks and balances embedded within the EVM and Voter Verifiable Paper Audit Trail (VVPAT) system, which not only ensures vote accuracy but also empowers voters to verify that their choices are duly recorded. Describing this system as significantly more reliable than the erstwhile paper ballot mechanism, the court emphasized the need to avoid regressive measures unless supported by substantial and credible evidence. The court firmly stated that writ petitions predicated on mere suspicion of rights infringement are inadmissible unless backed by demonstrable evidence of a tangible threat. It invoked the doctrine of res judicata, asserting that issues conclusively adjudicated cannot be revisited unless new, substantive grounds are presented. On the recurring skepticism surrounding EVMs, the court stressed the necessity of a definitive resolution to avoid eroding trust in the electoral system. Moreover, the bench advocated for a balanced perspective, cautioning against unfounded distrust of the system while encouraging constructive critique guided by reason and evidence. This approach, the court noted, enables meaningful reforms while preserving the credibility of democratic institutions. Expressing optimism, it concluded by affirming faith in the electoral process to genuinely reflect the electorate's mandate, with the robust EVM-VVPAT framework standing as a testament to the integrity of India's democracy. The Distinctive Design Indian engineers and domain experts, have reaffirmed the security and tamper-proof design of Indian Electronic Voting Machines (EVMs). Highlighting the advanced M3 model, which served millions of voters in the recent Lok Sabha elections, they emphasized its robust security features. The M3 EVM as a standalone device akin to a simple calculator, incapable of being hacked. Introduced in 2019, the M3 model incorporates automated functions that revert the machine to factory settings if tampering is detected. Crucially, these devices are entirely disconnected from the internet or any external network, enhancing their resilience against intrusion. Experts have also drawn distinctions between Indian EVMs and their global counterparts. Unlike international models, which may interface with external systems, Indian EVMs operate as self-contained electronic units. This 'electronic island' design ensures unparalleled security by eliminating any connectivity to other devices or networks. Indian EVMs undergo stringent checks to uphold their integrity. These include independent third-party software audits and mock polling exercises conducted under the scrutiny of candidates’ representatives. The machines are sealed using specialized security paper from the Nashik security printing press—the same material used for Indian currency notes. Additionally, EVMs are stored in highly secure locations under strict surveillance, with provisions for continuous monitoring by candidates or their designated representatives, ensuring transparency and trustworthiness throughout the electoral process. It is often seen that the political parties blame the EVMs only when they loose the elections. Recently Congress has lost the elections in Haryana and their alliance won in Jammu and Kashmir. They blamed the EVM in Haryana but accepted them true in Jammu and Kashmir. Even last month they rejected the Maharashtra results where they lost but they easily accepted the Jharkhand Assembly Elections Results and Wayanad Parliamentary bye elections results, where they won. The Supreme Court, in its recent judgment, astutely observed that political parties often criticize Electronic Voting Machines (EVMs) only when faced with electoral defeat, while readily endorsing them when victorious. EVMs, in such instances, become a convenient scapegoat, allowing parties to deflect attention from their policy failures, ineffective outreach to the electorate, and inability to address pertinent issues. By casting aspersions on EVMs, these parties seek to convey an illusion of moral victory, asserting that they were wronged rather than acknowledging defeat. Critics often cite examples of nations reverting to paper ballots as justification for their skepticism. However, such comparisons disregard the distinct challenges of India's electoral landscape, which encompasses an electorate of nearly one billion. Reverting to paper ballots would not only escalate the costs of elections but also render the process cumbersome and vulnerable to manipulation. Historical experiences have demonstrated how easily elections conducted through paper ballots can be compromised. A recent example from the Punjab Panchayat elections showcased the chaotic nature of ballot paper counting, with instances of ballot tampering vividly captured on video. The integration of Voter Verified Paper Audit Trail (VVPAT) systems has further fortified the credibility of EVMs, ensuring an unparalleled level of transparency and accuracy. Rather than perpetuating unsubstantiated allegations against EVMs, political parties should adopt a pragmatic approach, critically evaluating their policies, leadership, and engagement strategies. The electorate’s rejection often stems from dissatisfaction with leadership or agenda, yet parties, instead of initiating reforms or addressing internal shortcomings, resort to blaming the EVMs to maintain their internal hegemony. The Election Commission of India, a globally respected institution, has upheld the integrity of India’s democratic process through the adoption of EVMs. These machines have transformed the electoral system into a model admired worldwide, reinforcing the credibility of Indian democracy. It is imperative for political entities to introspect and adapt, focusing on genuine reforms rather than discrediting the tools that have strengthened electoral integrity.

Iran And The Ceasefire – OpEd	Did Iran oppose or approve of the Israel-Hezbollah ceasefire, agreed on November 26 and implemented in the early hours of the following day? ​Opinion is divided, views differing according to the holder's perception of Iran’s complex geopolitical interests in the region. ​Some ​of the media speculate that Iran saw the ​proposed ceasefire as conflicting with its strategic interests by undermining its leverage against Israel,​ and opposed it.​ Some argue that that an enfeebled and disheartened Hezbollah​, ​desperate for a respite from Israel's onslaught, proceeded to negotiate the deal without a green light from Tehran. ​ Most opinion takes a contrary view. The defense editor of the UK’s Daily Telegraph believes Iran has been so weakened ​through the defeats inflicted on its proxies that it was forced into the ceasefire, and that it represents a major setback​ for the ayatollahs. Given the destruction that the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) have wreaked on the infrastructures of both Hezbollah and Hamas, he writes, 'the Iranian regime, which finds itself increasingly under pressure from a disaffected populace, had little option but to bring hostilities to an end. All the indications are that Iran, not Hezbollah, was the driving force behind diplomatic efforts to end the fighting in Lebanon, as it feared that its standing in the region would be further eroded the longer the conflict carried on.' Some commentators have perceived a split developing between Iran and its two main proxies, Hamas and Hezbollah. They believe that a much weakened Hezbollah and the rump of Hamas are both more than willing to prolong the conflict with Israel, believing that the longer it lasts, the more pressure Israel will come under from world leaders to make concessions. This, they think, is what is behind the Hamas leadership’s constant refusal to accept ceasefire terms brokered by the Biden administration. There are, in fact, reports that dissatisfaction with Iran’s agreement to a ceasefire is morphing into talk of betrayal. It has certainly resulted in numerous breaches of the ceasefire terms by Hezbollah, requiring an appropriate military response by the IDF. If Hezbollah is indeed determined to resume hostilities against Israel, the chance of extending the 60-day truce will eventually turn on a struggle of will​s with Iran. Hamas’s savage assault on Israel on October 7, 2023, was probably intended to mark the start of a new era of Iranian strength. If so, subsequent events seem to demonstrate that it was the exact opposite – namely, that October 7 marked ​the highwater mark​ of Iran's power, and it was all downhill from then on. From the moment that Israel chased Hamas back into Gaza, Iran’s power base began to decline. Over the past year the ayatollahs have had to watch their Hamas allies suffer huge losses of manpower and facilities, culminating in the elimination of its leader, Yahya Sinwar. I​n a long, hard struggle​ Hamas as a military entity has been all but destroyed. It has also been ousted from the governance of Gaza, which can no longer be regarded by Iran’s ayatollahs as a launching pad for the invasion and destruction of Israel. Israel’s determined and effective self-defensive action in response to October 7​ has clearly reduced Iran's strength and influence. The regime has also proved powerless to prevent the decimation of Hezbollah’s senior command structure, including the assassination of its leader, Hassan Nasrallah. Some commentators are linking the military successes ​in Syria by Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), referred to by the media as the 'Syrian rebels', to Iran’s evidently weakened state and Russia’s preoccupation with its struggles in Ukraine. Neither could offer Bashar al-Assad much support as HTS forces advanced into the streets of Damascus, greeted by jubilant crowds. Assad’s dictatorial regime seems to have collapsed, while Iran’s 'ring of fire' has blown back on itself. Syria, Lebanon, Hamas and Hezbollah now represent not an unassailable Iranian regional powerhouse, but a diminished and flagging regime.. Iran​ appears to have made a serous, perhaps fatal, strategic miscalculation in April, 2024, when it decided to escalate its conflict with the West by launching its first-ever aerial onslaught on Israel. That first attack was a humiliating failure since some 99% of the missiles and drones were destroyed in flight and failed to reach Israel. The ayatollahs compounded their failure by essaying a second bombardment on October 1. Although more powerful missiles were deployed, the results were only minimally more effective. The ultimate humiliation, perhaps, was that Iran’s direct assaults on Israel triggered retaliatory airstrikes which prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu has indicated struck Iran’s nuclear program. While the regime has managed to win some victories in the propaganda war – successfully persuading many young, Left-wing people in the West that Israel is the aggressor in this conflict – it has been discomfited on the battlefield. and diminished geopolitically. The strategic goals it has worked toward for years have become pipe dreams in a matter of months. Iran’s aim of regional domination seems less attainable than ever. The disintegration of Iran’s carefully-constructed terrorist network in the Middle East could even have profound implications for the survival prospects of the regime itself and its ruling ayatollahs. Openly calling for the overthrow of the Islamic Republic are Iranian opposition figures such as Reza Pahlavi, the son and heir of the last Shah of Iran, who heads a body called the National Council of Iran for Free Elections, and his rival, Maryam Rajavi, the head of the National Council of Resistance of Iran. Both claim to be acting as a government-in-exile. In November Pahlavi called on Iranians to take the country back, adding that he was ready to lead any interim rule. Having expended billions of dollars supporting terrorist proxies throughout the region, the ayatollahs are likely to find themselves under increasing pressure from disaffected voters. Inflation is currently running at 35 percent, and more than 20 percent of young people are unemployed. Apart from the failing economy, the regime is holding the lid on a seething cauldron of discontent about the restrictions imposed on women by the religious police. Every so often the people’s frustration explodes in the form of public protests which are invariably put down ruthlessly by the IRGC (Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps). With the Trump administration, which is likely to take a hard line on Iran, soon to assume power in Washington, the ceasefire deal in Lebanon could be the first indication that the ayatollahs’ days are numbered.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWf0iZEu2B4imuOsGsF0Ie30	2024-12-13T08:56:23-08:00	
The Fall Of The Assad Government In Syria – OpEd	As the rebel forces led by Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (Syria Liberation Committee) seized Damascus, Syria’s capital, on December 7, 2024, the president of Syria, Bashar al-Assad boarded a flight to Moscow, Russia. It was the end of the rule of the Assad family that began when Hafez al-Assad (1930-2000) became president in 1971, and continued through his son Bashar from 2000—a 53-year period of rule. Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), which seized Damascus, was formed out of the remnants of the al-Qaeda affiliate in Syria, Jabhat al-Nusra (Front for the Conquest of Syria) in 2017, and led by its emir Abu Jaber Shaykh and its military commander Abu Mohammed al-Jolani. For the past seven years, HTS has been restrained in the city of Idlib, in Syria’s north. In 2014, a group of al-Qaeda veterans created the Khorasan network (led by Sami al-Uraydi, the religious leader), whose intent was to control the city and the Islamist movements. Over the next year, al-Nusra tried to form alliances with other Islamist forces, such as Ahrar al-Sham, particularly for the governance of the city. The Russian military intervention in 2015 damaged the ability of these groups to advance out of Idlib, which led to the formal break of many of the Islamists from al-Qaeda in 2016 and the creation of HTS in January 2017. Those who remained linked to al-Qaeda formed Hurras al-Din (or Guardians of the Religious Organization). By the end of the year, HTS had seized the initiative and become the major force inside Idlib, took over the local councils across the city and declared that it was the home of the Syrian Salvation Government. When the Syrian Arab Army, the government’s military force, moved toward Idlib in early 2020, Turkey invaded Syria’s north to defend the Islamists. This invasion resulted in the Russian-Turkish ceasefire in March 2020 that allowed the HTS and others to remain in Idlib unscathed. HTS rebuilt its ranks through alliances with Turkish-backed armed forces and with fighters from across Central Asia (including many Uyghur fighters from the Turkistan Islamic Party). Operation Deterrence of Aggression, launched by HTS in November 2024 with Turkish and Israeli support, whipped down highway M5 from Aleppo to Damascus in about fourteen days. The Syrian Arab Army dissolved before them and the gates of Damascus opened without enormous bloodshed. The Jihadi Blitzkrieg The surprise victory of HTS had been predicted in November by Iranian officials, who informed Assad about the weakness of the state’s defenses because of the sustained Israeli attacks on Syrian army positions, of the Israeli invasion of Lebanon, and of the war in Ukraine. When Iran’s foreign minister Abbas Araghchi met with Assad in Damascus after Aleppo fell to the rebels, Assad told Araghchi that this was not a defeat but a 'tactical retreat.' That was clearly illusionary. Araghchi, knowing this, told Assad that Iran simply did not have the capacity to send new troops to defend Damascus. It had also been made clear to the Assad government that the Russians did not have the surplus capacity to defend the government, not even the Russian naval base in Tartus. During the HTS drive against the Syrian army, the Russian presidential envoy for Syria Alexander Lavrentyev said that he had been in touch with the incoming Trump administration to discuss a deal between 'all parties' over the Syrian conflict. Neither Russia nor Iran believed that the Assad government would be able to unilaterally defeat the various rebels and remove the United States from its occupation of the eastern oil fields. A deal was the only way out, which meant that neither Iran nor Russia was willing to commit more troops to defend the Assad government. Since 2011, Israel’s air force has struck several Syrian military bases, including bases that hosted Iranian troops. These strikes degraded Syrian military capacity by destroying ordinance and materiel. Since October 2023, Israel has increased its strikes within Syria, including hitting Iranian forces, Syrian air defenses, and Syrian arms production facilities. On December 4, the heads of the militaries of Iran (Chief of Staff Major General Mohammad Bagheri), Iraq (Major General Yahya Rasool), Russia (Defense Minister Andrey Belousov), and Syria (General Abdul Karim Mahmoud Ibrahim) met to assess the situation in Syria. They discussed the movement of HTS down from Aleppo and agreed that with the fragile ceasefire in Lebanon and the Syrian government’s weakened forces, this was a 'dangerous scenario.' While they said that they would support the government in Damascus, there were no concrete steps taken by them. The Israeli attacks inside Syria meanwhile increased the demoralization within the Syrian army, which has not been properly reorganized after the stalemate began with the rebels in Idlib in 2017. When Russia entered the conflict in Syria in 2015, the Russian military command insisted that the Syrian government no longer permit pro-government militia groups (such as the Kataeb al-Ba’ath and the Shabbiha) to operate independently. Instead, these groups were integrated into the Fourth and Fifth Corps under Russian command. Meanwhile, the Iranian officers organized their own battalions of Syrian soldiers. The soldiers’ declining economic standards combined with the foreign command accelerated the demoralization. Even the Republican Guard, tasked with defending Damascus and in particular the presidential palace, had lost much of its historical power. At no point after 2011 was the Syrian government in control of the territory of the country. Already, since 1973, Israel had seized the Golan Heights. Then, during 2011, Turkey had eaten into the borderlands of northern Syria, while the Kurdish resistance forces (YPG and PKK) had formed a zone alongside the Syria-Turkey border. Northwestern Syria had been taken by the rebels, who included not only HTS but also a range of Turkish-backed militia groups. Northeastern Syria was occupied by the United States, which had taken charge of the oil fields. In this region, the US forces contested the Islamic State, which had been pushed out of both northern Iraq and northeastern Syria, but which continued to appear in spurts. Meanwhile, in southern Syria, the government had made a series of hasty agreements with the rebels to provide an appearance of peace. In cities such as Busra al-Sham, Daraa, Houran, and Tafas, the government could not send any of its officials; these, like Idlib, had come under rebel control. When HTS moved on Damascus, the rebels in the south rose up as did the rebels in the country’s eastern edge along the border with Iraq. The reality of Assad’s weakness became apparent. Israel’s Advantage As if in a coordinated fashion, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu went to the occupied Golan Heights, which Israel seized from Syria in 1973, and announced, 'This is a historic day in the history of the Middle East.' He then said that his government had ordered the Israeli army to invade the UN buffer zone between the Israeli occupation of Golan and the Syrian army posts that had been established during the armistice of 1974. Israeli tanks moved into the countryside of Quneitra Governorate and took over the main town. The border between Israel and Syria has now been shaped by this invasion, since Israel has now moved several kilometers into Syria to seize almost the entire length of the border. During the final days of the HTS advance to Damascus, the Israeli air force provided the rebels with air support. They bombed military bases and the headquarters of Syrian intelligence in the center of Damascus. With the excuse that they wanted to destroy weapons depots before the rebels seized them, the Israelis struck bases that housed Syrian troops and stockpiles of weapons that the Syrian army might have used to defend Damascus (this included the Mezzah Air Base). Israeli officials have said that they will continue these air strikes, but have not indicated whom they plan to target. The Israeli assault on Syria deepened during the protest movement in 2011. As fighting between the rebels and the Syrian government spread across southern Syria, near the Israeli border, Israel began to fire across the border at Syrian forces. In March 2013, for instance, the Israelis fired missiles at Syrian military posts, weakening them and strengthening the rebels. At the end of 2013, Israel created Division 210, a special military command, to begin engagements along the Israel-Syrian armistice line. Importantly, when the HTS predecessor and al-Qaeda affiliate Jabhat al-Nusra began to make gains along the Israeli line of control, Israel did not strike them. Instead, Israel hit the Syrian government through shooting down Syrian air force jets and assassinating senior Syrian allies (such as General Mohammad Ali Allahdadi, an Iranian general, in January 2015, and Samir Kuntar, a Fatah leader, in late 2015). A former press officer in Damascus told me that the Israelis effectively provided air support for the HTS assault on the capital. Syria’s Future Assad left Syria without making any announcement. It is said by former government officials in Damascus that some senior leaders left with him or left for the Iraqi border before the fall of Damascus. The silence from Assad has bewildered many Syrians who had believed fundamentally that the state would protect them from the onslaught of groups such as HTS. It is a sign of the collapse of the Assad government that his Republican Guard did not try to defend the city and that he left without any words of encouragement to his people. The country is polarized regarding the new government. Sections of the population that had seen their way of life degraded by the war and sanctions welcome the opening, and they have been on the streets celebrating the new situation. The larger context for the Middle East is not their immediate concern, although depending on Israel’s actions, this might change. A considerable section is concerned about the behavior of the Islamists, who use terms of disparagement against non-Sunni Muslims such as nusayriyya (for Alawites, the community of the al-Assad family) and rawafid (such as the large Shia population in Syria). Calling non-Sunni Muslims ahl al-batil or the 'lost ones' and using strong Salafi language about apostasy and its punishment sets in motion fear amongst those who might be targets of attacks. Whether the new government will be able to control its forces motivated by this sectarian ideology remains to be seen. Such sectarianism is only the opening of the contradictions that will emerge almost immediately. How will the new government deal with the Israeli, Turkish, and US incursions into Syrian territory? Will it seek to win back that land? What will be the relationship between the Syrian government and its neighbors, particularly Lebanon? Will the millions of Syrian refugees return to their home now that the basis for their migration has been removed, and if they return, what will be awaiting them inside Syria? And centrally, what will all this mean for the ongoing genocide of the Palestinians by the Israelis?

Benjamin Netanyahu’s Lies – OpEd	How can you tell when a politician is lying? His lips are moving. That joke is apropos for the new English language video monologue that Israel Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu released Thursday, and which Netanyahu said in his first words spoken is directed to the 'people of Iran.' He managed to fit a bunch of lies in the under three minutes presentation. Netanyahu said Iranians’ 'oppressors,' by which he apparently means the Iran government, 'keep losing' in Gaza, Lebanon, and Syria 'because they seek to conquer other nations.' But, the support Iran provided relative to Gaza, Lebanon, and Syria was used to oppose the Israel government — the conqueror whose military has been occupying and dispensing death and destruction in all three places. 'The only thing Israel seeks is to defend our state,' further declared Netanyahu in his video monologue. However, it is Israel that continues to take offensive action against a list of countries. And this is a practice Israel has been engaged in since long before the Hamas attack of last year to which Netanyahu and others have pointed at as a justification for imposing a heightened level of carnage. In defending Israel, Netanyahu continued, the Israel government is 'defending civilization against barbarism.' However, the Israel government’s action in Gaza over the last year has taken barbarism to its extreme. Israel has intentionally deprived the people of Gaza of the means to sustain life at even the most basic level, directly killing many civilians and subjecting the rest to dangers of hunger, exposure to the elements, and unrelenting dread and despair. Devastation has also brought the spread of illnesses, made worse by the Israel government’s deliberate destruction of the means of obtaining medical care. These lies by Netanyahu set the stage for this doozy of a fabrication. 'Israel wants peace,' he stated emphatically. This may be the ultimate demonstration in real life of the Orwellian assertion that 'war is peace.' Concluding, Netanyahu declared, 'I know and I believe we will transform the Middle East into a beacon of prosperity, progress, and peace.' Attainment of that condition is a superb hope for the region. The problem is that the government of Israel, with the indispensable backing of the US government, has been working at full tilt to maximize poverty, degeneration, and war. When will American politicians finally stand up to this liar and cut off US support for his government’s rampage?

Why Would A Rabbi Fight And Die For Prophet Muhammad? – OpEd	Ibn Ishaq, the earliest biographer of Prophet Muhammad, relates an amazing story about Rabbi Mukhayriq, a wealthy and learned leader of the tribe of Tha'labah, a Jewish tribe allied with one of the three major Jewish tribes that had lived in Medina for centuries; who fought alongside Prophet Muhammad in the battle of Uhud on March 19, 625 AD, and died in that battle. That day was a Saturday and Rabbi Mukhayriq addressed the people of his tribe and urged them to go with him to fight alongside Muhammad. The tribe's men said that today is the day of Sabbath. According to Halakah (orthodox Jewish Sha'ariah) we are not supposed to go to war on the Sabbath unless we are directly under attack. The pagan Arabs from Makka will not attack us, they only want to persecute the Muslims in Medina as they had for several years as was done in Makkah. The Torah (Deuteronomy 20:8-10) says: Jewish men who are afraid or disheartened (by thoughts of fighting on the Sabbath) should be told to go home. The Mishnah, the first legal code (Fiq) of the oral rabbinic Torah states that there are two types of war. A war of defense which is obligatory for all Jewish adult men, and all other wars, which are voluntary. Rabbi Mukhayriq chastised the men of his congregation for not understanding the deeper meaning of what was happening; and announced that if he died in the battle, his entire wealth should go to Muhammad. Mukhayriq did indeed die that day in battle against the Makkans. When Muhammad, who was seriously injured in that same battle, was informed about the death of Rabbi Mukhayriq, Muhammad said, 'He was the best of Jews.' Rabbi Mukhayriq's view was unorthodox. He must have seen Muhammad as a Prophet of the One God. He also knew Prophet Muhammad had told his Muslim followers to pray facing north toward the site of Solomon's Temple, although this was later changed to facing south towards Mecca. Rabbi Mukhayriq also believed that Prophet Muhammad's total rejection of polytheism would someday lead to the destruction of the 360 idols housed in the Ka'bah; and other polytheistic practices of Jahiliyyah would receive similar treatment. The Arabs were extremely immersed in superstitious beliefs and activities like Tatayyur (belief in omens), Tanjeem (astrology), Tabarruk (seeking blessing from objects) and Kahanah (soothsaying); that had been condemned by Allah 1,800 years before in the Torah of Musa: 'When you enter the land the Lord your God is giving you, do not learn to imitate the detestable ways of the nations there. Let no one be found among you who sacrifices their son or daughter in the fire, who practices divination or sorcery, interprets omens, engages in witchcraft, or casts spells, or who is a medium or spiritist or who consults the dead. 'Anyone who does these things is detestable to the Lord; because of these same detestable practices the Lord your God will drive out those nations before you. You must be blameless before the Lord your God. The nations you will dispossess listen to those who practice sorcery or divination. But as for you, the Lord your God has not permitted you to do so. The Lord your God will raise up for you a prophet like me from among you, from your fellow Israelites. You must listen to him.' (Deuteronomy 18:9-15) The last verse Rabbi Mukhayriq may have applied to Prophet Muhammad. Thus, this unorthodox rabbi viewed fighting alongside Muhammad as his personal voluntary fight in support of monotheism. But, why did Rabbi Mukhayriq give such extraordinary life risking support to Prophet Muhammad? And how could Rabbi Mukhayriq think the verse applied to Muhammad: when it clearly refers to 'a prophet like me' 'from your fellow Israelites'. Perhaps Rabbi Mukhayriq believed that Prophet Muhammad was not only a Prophet, but was also one of God's Anointed; who with his Arab followers would enable and facilitate the Jewish people's return to the land of Israel as was predicted in the Bible; just as the Persian King Cyrus the Great; who is called one of God's Anointed by Prophet Isaiah (45:1 ) had enabled and facilitated the return of Jews to Israel eleven centuries earlier. The Persian King Cyrus, is mentioned twenty-three times in the literature of the books of the Hebrew Bible. Isaiah refers to this non-Jewish king as God's 'shepherd,' and as the Lord's 'Anointed,' who was destined to facilitate the divine plan. The fact that the Persians had just a few years previously (614 CE) captured the Land of Israel from the Eastern Roman Empire may, in the rabbi's mind, have stimulated this belief. Thus, this unorthodox rabbi viewed fighting alongside Muhammad as his personal voluntary fight in support of monotheism; as well as a witness to his faith in the arrival of one of God's Anointed Messiahs. Although everyone has heard of the final Son of David Messiah, the rabbis also speak of other pre Messianic Age figures including Elijah and a Son of Joseph Messiah, who will precede the Son of David. This is not only my view. There is a ninth or tenth century apocalyptic Midrash called 'The Prayer of Rabbi Shimon ben Yokhai', an end of the second century CE well known mystic and visionary, who after 40 days and nights of prayer, had a vision of the Kenites (Byzantine Romans); followed by a vision of the kingdom of Ishmael (the Arabs) who will succeed the Byzantine Romans. The archangel Mettatron then informed Rabbi Shimon ben Yokhai that: 'The kingdom of the Kenites (the future Byzantine Romans) will come to Jerusalem, subdue it, and murder more than thirty thousand in it. Because of the oppression which they (the Byzantine Romans) oppress Israel (the Jewish People) the Blessed Holy One will send the Ishmaelites (Arabs) against them (the Byzantine Romans) to make war with them, so as to deliver the Israelites from their hand.' The anonymous author of the 'Prayer of Rabbi Shimon ben Yokhai' viewed the replacement of the Christian Byzantine Roman Empire, by the Muslim Arabs, as an act of God; which rescued the oppressed Jewish communities throughout the Near East, and especially in Jerusalem, from Christian Byzantine persecution. In 614 CE a Persian army, supported by thousands of Persian Empire Jewish volunteers, had captured Jerusalem. This event is referred to in the Qur'an: 'The Romans (Byzantines) have been defeated in the nearest land (Syria/Israel). But after their defeat, they will overcome (the Persians) within three to nine years. To Allah belongs the command before and after.' (30:2-4) In 628 CE the Romans (Byzantines) did recapture Jerusalem, and they massacred all those Jews who had returned to Jerusalem during the period of Persian rule. Yet just one decade later, Arab armies had conquered and displaced the Roman (Byzantine) rulers from Egypt to Iraq. If Rabbi Mukhayriq had not died fighting alongside Prophet Muhammad in the battle of Uhud; he could easily have lived long enough to see the Arab conquest of Jerusalem, and himself been able to return to live there. In the following centuries, Jews from Spain to Mesopotamia lived much freer lives under Muslim rule than previous centuries of Christian and Zoroastrian rule. Rabbi Mukhayriq may have been wrong in thinking of Prophet Muhammad as a Messianic figure, but he was right in thinking Muhammad would begin a new era in world history. Even four centuries after Rabbi Mukhayriq's death there were rabbis who saw Muhammad as an authentic Prophet of God. Natan'el al-Fayyumi, a prominent 12th-century Yemenite rabbi and theologian, and the founder of what is sometimes called 'Jewish Ismailism', wrote in his philosophical treatise Bustan al-Uqul ('Garden of Wisdom') that God sends prophets to establish religions for other nations, which do not have to conform to the precepts of the Jewish Torah. Rabbi Nethan'el explicitly considered Muhammad a true prophet, who was sent from Heaven with a message for the Arabs, but not for the Jews. As the Qur'an itself states: 'He it is who has sent unto the unlettered people an apostle from among themselves, to convey unto them His messages, and to cause them to grow in purity, and to impart unto them the divine writ as well as wisdom - whereas before that they were indeed, most obviously, lost in error.' (62:2) Perhaps Rabbi Mukhayriq's devotion to a Messianic future of peace and brotherhood can inspire Islamic and Jewish religious leaders today to heal past wounds, and make Jerusalem a city of peace in the future. The Qur'an refers to Prophet Abraham as a community or a nation: 'Abraham was a nation/community [Ummah]; dutiful to God, a monotheist [hanif], not one of the polytheists.' (16:120) If Prophet Abraham is an Ummah; then fighting between the descendants of Prophets Ishmael and Isaac is a civil war and should always be avoided. If all Arabs and Jews can live up to the ideal that 'the descendants of Abraham's sons should never war against each other' is the will of God; we will help fulfill the 2700 year old vision of Prophet Isaiah: 'In that day there will be a highway from Egypt to Assyria. The Assyrians will go to Egypt, and the Egyptians to Assyria. The Egyptians and Assyrians will worship together. On that day Israel will join a three-party alliance with Egypt and Assyria, a blessing upon the heart. The LORD of Hosts will bless them saying, 'Blessed be Egypt My people, Assyria My handiwork, and Israel My inheritance.'...(Isaiah 19:23-5)	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWf0iZEu2B4imh4siBZRnR3H	2024-12-13T08:52:33-08:00	
A Diplomatic Victory For Morocco: The End Of The ‘Western Sahara’...	The dissolution of the 'Western Sahara' intergroup within the European Parliament is more than just a procedural matter; it marks a decisive turning point in the battle for Morocco's territorial integrity and a major blow to Algerian-backed separatist lobbying. After two decades of relentless efforts by Algeria to manipulate European institutions in favor of separatist narratives, this decision underscores a shifting diplomatic landscape in Europe, one increasingly aligned with Morocco's legitimate rights and strategic vision for the region. The intergroup, operating under the guise of informal parliamentary collaboration, had long deviated from its intended purpose. Instead of fostering balanced dialogue, it became a platform for propagating separatist agendas, selectively inviting figures aligned with the Polisario Front while ignoring broader realities. Notably, its activities often conflicted with the principles of neutrality and constructive engagement that underpin the European Parliament's work. This dissolution sends an unequivocal message: the European Union is no longer willing to lend its institutions to divisive and unproductive lobbying. It signals a growing recognition among European leaders of Morocco's pivotal role as a stable partner and a cornerstone of the Euro-Mediterranean partnership. By supporting Morocco's autonomy initiative—hailed by the United Nations and numerous global powers as a realistic and durable solution to the Sahara issue—the EU is aligning its stance with the principles of pragmatism and international law. For Algeria, the dissolution represents yet another diplomatic setback in its increasingly isolated campaign. Having invested significant resources into maintaining the intergroup, its closure strips Algeria of an influential—albeit misused—mechanism to sway European opinion. This failure highlights the diminishing returns of its separatist strategy, which has faced mounting resistance not only in Europe but globally, as countries recognize the broader implications of destabilizing the region. At the heart of this shift lies Morocco's proactive diplomacy, spearheaded by a vision that prioritizes cooperation, stability, and shared prosperity. The autonomy plan for the southern provinces under Moroccan sovereignty has emerged as the cornerstone of this approach, offering a balanced framework for addressing the conflict. By fostering economic development, infrastructure investment, and human rights improvements in the Sahara region, Morocco continues to demonstrate its commitment to meaningful solutions that benefit all stakeholders. The dissolution also reinforces the European Union's strategic partnership with Morocco, which transcends the Sahara issue. From security cooperation to renewable energy projects, Morocco has proven itself as a reliable ally in addressing shared challenges. The EU's clear and consistent support for Morocco's territorial integrity not only strengthens this partnership but also sets a precedent for handling separatist conflicts elsewhere, underscoring the importance of pragmatic and realistic approaches. This development is not merely a diplomatic victory for Morocco but also a testament to the growing consensus that regional stability and international law must prevail over outdated and destabilizing narratives. As Europe recalibrates its approach to the Sahara issue, Morocco's steadfast commitment to its sovereignty and its vision for a united and prosperous region continue to gain global traction. The dissolution of the intergroup is, therefore, more than an institutional decision; it is a defining moment in the diplomatic reconfiguration of the Sahara question. It reinforces Morocco's position as an indispensable partner for Europe and a beacon of stability in a volatile region, while sending a clear signal to all actors: the time for separatist lobbying is over.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWf0iZEu2B4imvEPtvp5DmK1	2024-12-13T08:49:55-08:00	
Low Adoption Of Solar Tech Not Just Due To Cost	Despite the immense potential for solar energy in urban areas of the Philippines, the technology’s upfront cost and a lack of public awareness of its benefits remain major hurdles to its widespread use. Government subsidies and promotional campaigns are seen to help boost its adoption. A new study from the Ateneo de Manila University highlights the persistent challenges preventing widespread adoption of rooftop solar power (RTSP) in Metro Manila and nearby provinces. Conducted by Department of Economics Professor Rosalina Palanca-Tan and published in the journal, Challenges in Sustainability, the study surveyed 403 respondents to understand why households remain reluctant to invest in solar technology despite its undisputed economic and environmental benefits. Major selling points: long-term savings, eco-friendliness The Philippines has some of the highest electricity rates in Southeast Asia—as high as $0.20 (approximately ₱11.50) per kilowatt-hour on average, compared to as low as $0.08 (~₱4.50) in Vietnam or even $0.06 (~₱3.50) in Malaysia. This makes the potential long-term savings from RTSP its biggest selling point for many households. Homeowners also recognize that solar energy contributes to environmental protection by reducing greenhouse gas emissions and air pollution, helping combat the effects of climate change. Overall, the respondents generally viewed RTSP as a sound long-term investment, with added advantages such as increased property value and enhanced roof durability. However, the upfront cost of installing solar panels remains a major hurdle to public adoption: a home RTSP setup could easily go for well over $1,700 (₱100,000), equivalent to more than half a year’s salary for minimum wage workers. Many households are unsure if this initial expense is justified by long-term financial and environmental returns. In any case, cost by itself does not significantly influence adoption decisions, the Ateneo survey found. Respondents said that the trustworthiness of providers, clarity on warranties, and the perceived quality of the installations themselves were just as important considerations as cost, if not more so. Government support to spur public adoption Although 82% of surveyed households expressed some interest in adopting solar panels, only 20% had firm intentions to do so. This gap apparently stems from a lack of knowledge: while most survey respondents said they understood the broad concept of renewable energy and its role in addressing climate change, few were aware of the specific advantages of RTSPs and how to access reliable installation services. Concerns over the quality of materials, maintenance needs, and provider credibility also added to their reluctance. Thus, the study urges stronger government intervention and public education campaigns. In particular, the study suggests improving net metering rates, expanding access to financing options, and accrediting trustworthy RTSP providers to build consumer confidence. Word-of-mouth recommendations also proved instrumental in decision-making, as households with friends or family who had adopted solar power were more likely to consider it for themselves as well. Promoting success stories and community-based testimonials could be a crucial key to shifting perceptions and increasing adoption rates of RSTP in the Philippines.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWf0iZEu2B4imoUtX4lxVX2r	2024-12-13T08:47:08-08:00	
Afghanistan’s Media Landscape: Stifled, Silenced, And Suppressed ...	Since the Taliban regained power in 2021, Afghanistan's media landscape has undergone drastic changes, marked by severe restrictions on press freedom. Journalists face constant threats, censorship, and violence, especially when covering topics like women’s rights, human rights, and the actions of the Afghan government. Many media outlets have either shut down or operate under stringent controls, and numerous reporters have fled the country in fear for their safety. International human rights organizations have condemned these actions, warning that Afghanistan is rapidly descending into a state of media silence and oppression. Reporters Without Borders (RSF) has expressed concern over increasing restrictions on journalists in Afghanistan, particularly the authoritarian mandates affecting women reporters. These include rules on their dress code, limits on their access to audiovisual media, and a ban on capturing images or footage of Taliban officials. These measures reflect the broader clampdown on press freedom in the country. Despite nearly two decades of international support, Afghanistan’s once-thriving media sector has collapsed under the Taliban rule. Over half of the country's media outlets have shut down, with television channels, radio stations, newspapers, and news agencies either closing or significantly reducing operations. This collapse has led to widespread unemployment, particularly affecting women journalists. While nearly 80% of Afghan women journalists were forced to quit after the Taliban's return, many have joined or founded media platforms in exile. They have established outlets like Quqnoos TV, Rukhshana Media, Zan Times, and various podcasts and radio stations, ensuring Afghan women’s voices continue to be heard on a global scale. Moreover, due to the increasing media censorship under the Taliban, Afghans have turned to independent media outlets in exile for reliable news. According to the JX Fund Dashboard, 47 such outlets exist, with 57% of them originally founded in Afghanistan and continuing to operate abroad, while 42% were created outside the country. These outlets primarily use websites and social media, reaching millions—36 million views on YouTube and 6 million followers on Facebook. Television remains important in Afghanistan, with 27% of the media offering television formats due to the country's limited internet access and high illiteracy rates. Afghanistan is ranked 178th out of 180 countries in RSF's World Press Freedom Index for 2024. A UNAMA report titled 'Media Freedom in Afghanistan', released in November 2024, highlighted the escalating difficulties faced by journalists and media workers in the country. The report details instances of arbitrary arrests, torture, and severe limitations on press freedom, reflecting the increasing repression of the media under Taliban rule. The Afghan Taliban's crackdown on media freedoms undermines the country's human rights commitments, eroding democracy and accountability by silencing dissenting voices. However, the ongoing repression of the media calls for urgent reforms to safeguard journalists' rights and restore media diversity, further obstructing Afghanistan's international obligations to uphold freedom and democracy. The Interim Afghan Government has systematically undermined press freedom, with 336 documented cases of human rights violations against media professionals between August 2021 and September 2024. This indicates the regime's blatant disregard for the principles of a free press. Furthermore, the UN report highlights the oppressive environment in Afghanistan, documenting 256 cases of arbitrary arrests and detentions, along with 130 instances of torture, which reveal the government's brutal crackdown on journalists targeted for their perceived criticism. Additionally, the report records 75 cases of threats and intimidation, illustrating the widespread climate of fear that surrounds journalists. This ongoing intimidation campaign reflects the government’s systematic efforts to silence dissent and suppress independent reporting, further stifling freedom of expression in the country. Despite Afghanistan's commitments under the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, the de facto authorities have consistently violated these obligations by curbing freedom of expression and suppressing independent media. Their actions demonstrate a persistent disregard for international human rights standards, particularly in silencing journalists and limiting public access to critical information. The Afghan government's crackdown on journalists not only undermines media freedom but also weakens transparency and accountability, which are vital for societal development and informed public discourse. This suppression risks long-term damage to the media sector, potentially diminishing international support and isolating Afghanistan from essential information. As the media landscape contracts, it impedes the country’s social and economic progress, leaving the Afghan people with limited access to critical news and insights. This growing isolation could further destabilize the nation’s future prospects. In brief, the international community must urgently recognize the dire situation facing Afghan journalists and take decisive actions to support media freedom. Providing moral, political, and financial backing for journalists, advocating for the rights of female media professionals, and holding the Taliban accountable for human rights violations are crucial steps. Additionally, supporting Afghan journalists in exile is vital for continuing their work without fear of persecution. Protecting press freedom, supporting independent media, strengthening legal protections, and fostering global partnerships are essential to preserving Afghanistan’s remaining independent media and ensuring journalists can continue their vital work. For Afghanistan to overcome its economic crisis and make progress, the government must reconsider its media policies. By embracing a more open and supportive stance towards media, the country can modernize, foster growth, and move beyond outdated practices. This shift is essential for creating an environment that promotes economic development, transparency, and societal advancement.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWf0iZEu2B4imm8QEJxXlLeN	2024-12-13T08:40:37-08:00	
Rise Of Sick Society Under Capitalism – OpEd	Mental illness, heart attacks, high blood pressure, and other physical ailments, along with social and emotional distress and economic hardships, are inherent and integral aspects of capitalism and its systems. Capitalism thrives on a sick society because it is easier to manage and control. However, the sickness of society under capitalism is not limited to the physical and mental health of individuals. It extends beyond personal afflictions, permeating the broader structure of society itself. The normalisation and mainstreaming of misinformation, deceptive practices, and irrationality are becoming entrenched features of capitalist society. In this system, there is a proliferation of confidently incompetent individuals who present their deceptive values as truth, dismissing factual evidence entirely. This is not a 'post-truth' society but rather a society devoid of accountability, where deceptive figures project themselves as saviours. Such individuals conceal their failures and incompetence within an environment and culture of widespread deception. This environment produces individuals, cultures, families, leaders, states, governments, and institutions whose actions are fundamentally misguided—what Barbara Tuchman aptly describes in her book The March of Folly. Capitalism, in many ways, facilitates this folly. Gradual reforms within so-called parliamentary democracies, driven by capitalist market forces, have failed to alter the capitalist and feudal power structures embedded in society. As a result, a small elite continues to control the means of production, distribution, demand, supply, and consumption. This system paradoxically creates hunger despite vast quantities of food grains being stored in warehouses. It produces an abundance of homes, yet the very workers who construct them remain homeless. Those who clean our hospitals, schools, streets, and parks often find themselves falling ill. Beyond hunger, homelessness, poverty, and unemployment, capitalism produces social alienation, entrenches inequalities of all kinds, and perpetuates exploitative conditions. These factors are central to the perpetuation and growth of a sick society under capitalism. The state and governments have failed to serve the people because their priorities are aligned with advancing capitalist interests at the expense of lives and livelihoods. Under this system, the tragedies of the people are turned into opportunities for capitalism to generate higher profits while subjugating the poor and vulnerable. In this way, capitalism is inherently opposed to prosperity and the creation of a harmonious society where people can live in peace and happiness. It is fundamentally a system of sickness that cannot be reformed. The idea of a 'human face' for capitalism is an impossibility, as the system itself is antithetical to human values, reasons and well-beings of people and nature. Capitalism, along with its apparatuses in the form of states and governments, forms alliances with patriarchal, reactionary, authoritarian, and religious forces to maintain its hegemony over people and the planet. It achieves this by subjugating individuals under the guise of promoting an exaggerated sense of culture, tradition, and family happiness. In the capitalist framework, human beings and nature are reduced to mere resources to be exploited for the purpose of amassing limitless profits. The tragedies of people are not incidental but rather the inevitable outcomes of a sick society engineered by capitalism—a society where individuals are reduced to economic beings to generate profit. This system sustains a capitalist hierarchy that masks widespread alienation to safeguard the entrenched interests of the ruling capitalist classes. In a sick capitalist society, people lose the ability to truly believe in fellow human beings, feel for others, and love one another, or to share their happiness and sorrows with family and friends. It is a society where individuals rationalise their actions in pursuit of pleasure, utility, and satisfaction, yet fail to achieve these goals. This failure stems from the reality that pleasure, utility, and satisfaction are rooted in social solidarity and cannot be attained through isolated, self-centred pursuits within a market-driven society. Individual happiness cannot exist independently of collective happiness. Therefore, the pursuit of collective well-being is the only path to overcoming capitalism and its pathologically sick and alienated society sans human values.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWf0iZEu2B4ims9fpvr5wnVO	2024-12-13T08:37:56-08:00	
Educational Inequality Of Women: Causes And Consequences – OpEd	Educational inequality among women is a critical issue with deep societal, cultural, and economic implications. It manifests in various ways, including limited access to schooling, lower literacy rates, and unequal opportunities for higher education. Some key aspects and factors contributing to this inequality include: a. Barriers to Education: Cultural Norms and Gender Roles: Traditional roles often prioritize domestic responsibilities for girls over formal education. Societal expectations discourage higher education for women in some communities. Economic Constraints: Families with limited resources may prioritize boys' education, viewing it as a better 'investment.' Direct costs (fees, books) and indirect costs (travel, lost household labour) can deter girls from attending school. Safety Concerns: Fear of harassment or violence on the way to school can discourage girls from attending. Lack of separate and safe sanitation facilities in schools also creates barriers. b. Structural Challenges in Education Systems: School Infrastructure: Many schools lack adequate facilities for girls, including proper toilets and menstrual hygiene resources. In rural areas, schools may be too far away, posing logistical challenges for girls. Biased Curriculum: Stereotypical representations of gender roles in textbooks reinforce inequality. Lack of female role models in teaching and leadership positions can impact girls’ aspirations. c. Consequences of Educational Inequality: Economic Impact: Lack of education restricts women’s access to well-paying jobs, perpetuating cycles of poverty. Social Impacts: Educated women are more likely to make informed decisions about health, family planning, and child-rearing, positively affecting community development. Political Representation: Education is key to empowering women to participate in political and civic life. d. Solutions to Address Educational Inequality: Policy Measures: Governments can introduce free or subsidized education for girls. Enforcement of laws against child marriage can ensure girls remain in school longer. Community Interventions: Raising awareness about the benefits of girls' education can help change cultural norms. Encouraging female role models in education and leadership inspires young girls. Infrastructure Improvements: Building gender-sensitive schools with proper sanitation facilities and safety measures. Financial Support: Scholarships and stipends for girls from low-income families can alleviate financial barriers. Addressing educational inequality for women is not only a matter of justice but also a pathway to social and economic progress. Educating women improves individual lives, families, and societies. Main causes Women's educational inequality stems from a complex interplay of societal, economic, cultural, and systemic factors. The primary causes include: a. Socio-Cultural Factors: Gender Roles and Cultural Norms: Societies that prioritize traditional gender roles often see women's education as less important than their domestic roles .Cultural norms in some communities discourage girls from pursuing higher education or certain career paths. Child Marriage: Early marriage often leads to the discontinuation of girls' education, as they are expected to take on household and child-rearing responsibilities. Discrimination and Bias: Gender stereotypes may lower expectations for girls' academic achievements, discouraging them from excelling in school. Safety Concerns: Fear of harassment or violence while commuting to school can discourage girls from attending. Schools without proper security or gender-sensitive environments can be unwelcoming for female students. b. Economic Factors: Poverty: Families with limited resources often prioritize boys' education, viewing it as a better economic investment. Hidden costs of schooling, such as uniforms, transportation, and supplies, can be barriers for girls. Opportunity Costs: Girls are often required to contribute to household income or chores, making education less feasible. Lack of Financial Support: Limited access to scholarships, stipends, or financial aid disproportionately affects girls from low-income families. c. Infrastructure and Systemic Issues: Lack of Schools: Rural and remote areas may lack schools, forcing girls to travel long distances, which increases dropout rates. Poor School Facilities: Many schools lack gender-sensitive infrastructure, such as separate and hygienic sanitation facilities for girls. Teacher Bias: Teachers may unconsciously reinforce gender stereotypes, discouraging girls from pursuing certain subjects like math or science. Rigid Education Systems: Education systems that do not accommodate girls' unique challenges, such as menstrual health needs or flexibility for domestic duties, hinder their participation. d. Political and Policy Gaps: Weak Enforcement of Laws: Inadequate enforcement of laws against child labour, child marriage, and gender discrimination limits girls' educational opportunities. Lack of Targeted Policies: Insufficient focus on creating policies that specifically address the unique barriers faced by girls in education. e. Intersectional Challenges: Marginalized Communities: Girls from minority, indigenous, or refugee communities face compounded disadvantages in education due to systemic marginalization. Urban-Rural Divide: Girls in rural areas face more significant barriers due to infrastructure gaps and cultural conservatism. Addressing these causes requires comprehensive efforts, including promoting cultural change, investing in education infrastructure, providing financial support, and implementing gender-sensitive policies to ensure equal opportunities for women and girls. Impacts of educational inequality Educational inequality, while predominantly negative, can have nuanced effects that shape societies in different ways: a. Positive Impacts: Advocacy for Change: Highlighting educational inequality often sparks movements for reform, leading to policies and programs that promote gender equality in education. Community Awareness: Communities facing inequality may become more aware of the importance of education, especially for marginalized groups, driving grassroots efforts to promote access. Focus on Marginalized Voices: Educational disparity can bring attention to the needs of underrepresented groups, encouraging global and local initiatives to address inequality. Innovation in Educational Models: Educational gaps often motivate innovative solutions, such as remote learning platforms, mobile schools, and community-led initiatives. b. Negative Impacts: Economic Impacts: Reduced Workforce Participation: Educational inequality limits women's access to better-paying jobs, leading to underutilization of half the population's potential. Cycle of Poverty: Poorly educated women often face limited economic opportunities, perpetuating poverty for themselves and their families. Social Impacts: Reinforced Gender Inequality: Limited education perpetuates traditional gender roles, reducing women's ability to challenge societal norms. Intergenerational Effects: Uneducated mothers are less likely to prioritize or afford education for their children, continuing the cycle of inequality. Health Disparities: Women with lower education levels often lack knowledge about health, leading to higher rates of maternal and child mortality. c. Political and Civic Impacts: Underrepresentation: Educational inequality limits women's participation in politics and decision-making roles, reducing diversity in leadership. Weakened Advocacy: Less education limits women’s ability to organize and advocate for their rights effectively. d. Cultural and Psychological Impacts: Perpetuation of Stereotypes: Inequality in education reinforces societal norms that undervalue women’s roles outside the home. Low Self-Esteem: Women with limited education may lack confidence to pursue opportunities or assert their rights. e. Global Impacts: Reduced Development Goals: Educational inequality hampers progress toward global targets like the UN’s Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), particularly those focused on gender equality and quality education. Increased Inequality: Unequal education widens societal divides, exacerbating tensions between different socioeconomic groups. While educational inequality might indirectly highlight issues and inspire reform, its overwhelmingly negative impacts harm individuals, communities, and nations. Addressing it is essential for creating equitable, prosperous, and sustainable societies.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWf0iZEu2B4imquoJLcaSLm0	2024-12-13T08:36:02-08:00	
Syria: Will The Real Al-Jolani Stand Up? – Analysis	Ahmad Hussein al-Shara, aka Abu Mohammed al-Jolani, would like you to think he is a changed man. These days, al-Jolani, a 41-year-old one-time al-Qaeda and Islamic State operative with a $10 million bounty on his head, no longer spews jihadist fire and brimstone. Instead, he preaches pluralism, religious tolerance, diversity and forgiveness as his Hay’at Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) rebels take control of Damascus, the Syrian capital. With the toppled President Bashar al-Assad’s departure to Moscow, Russia, the entire Assad family’s 54-year hold on Syria has reached its end. Now many in the country and the international community ask which one is the real al-Jolani. In a recent interview, al-Jolani, the face of the Syrian rebels, insistedthat his evolution was natural. 'A person in their twenties will have a different personality than someone in their thirties or forties, and certainly someone in their fifties. This is human nature,' al-Jolani said. The real al-Jolani will likely emerge in the way he approaches the formation of a post-Assad transition government, as well as the rights, security and safety of minorities. These include the Shiite Muslim Alawites from which the Assads hail and who long supported their brutal rule. Moreover, even those who question the sincerity of his conversion suggest that al-Jolani may be the one rebel commander who can hold Syria together. 'There is no local military power to stand (up to) or compete with Jolani,' an associate of the rebel leader said when he still publicly identified himself as a jihadist. The former associate warned that if al-Jolani fails, Syria, like Libya, will become a state torn apart by rival armed militias. Al-Jolani 'hasn’t changed at all, but there’s a difference between being in battle, at war, killing, and running a country,' the former associate said. He suggested the rebel leader’s more moderate and conciliatory posture stemmed from a recognition that the Islamic State’s sectarian bloodlust was a mistake. He also stated that al-Jolani 'now considers himself a statesman,' and claimed the rebel leader may follow suggestions that he turn the group into a political party by transferring its military wing to a reconstituted Syrian military. Meanwhile, the HTS paramilitary group moved quickly to safeguard public buildings in Damascus and manage the presence of heavily armed factions in the capital. 'We will soon ban gatherings of armed people,' said Amer al-Sheikh, a HTS security official. Al-Jolani needs to earn international trust On December 10, 2024, the rebels appointed Mohammed al-Bashir as caretaker prime minister for four months. It was not immediately clear what the next step would be. Al-Bashir ran the rebel-led Salvation Government in their stronghold in Syria’s northern Idlib region. Since HTS launched its offensive, he has assisted captured cities, including Aleppo, Hama and Homs, in installing post-Assad governance structures. Beyond ensuring domestic security and stability, al-Jolani will need to secure international support for the reconstruction and rehabilitation of traumatised and war-ravaged Syria. To do so, al-Jolani and HTS will have to convince Syrian minorities, segments of Syria’s majority Sunni Muslims and the international community that they have genuinely changed their colors and are not wolves in sheep’s clothing. A questionable human rights record that has persisted long after they disavowed jihadism compounds HTS and al-Jolani’s reputational problems. As recently as August 2024, the United Nations accused the group of resorting to extrajudicial killings, torture and the recruitment of child soldiers. 'HTS detained men, women, and children as young as seven. They included civilians detained for criticising HTS and participating in demonstrations,' the UN Human Rights Council said in a report. 'These acts may amount to war crimes.' Even so, this week, UN Special Envoy for Syria Geir Pedersen acknowledged that HTS has sought to address concerns in recent days. 'The realities so far is that the HTS and also the other armed groups have been sending good messages to the Syrian people,' Pedersen said. 'They have been sending messages of unity, of inclusiveness… We have also seen… reassuring things on the ground.' Pedersen was referring to rebel assurances given to minorities, a pledge not to impose restrictions on women’s clothing, amnesty for conscripted personnel of Assad’s military, the rebels reaching out to Assad government officials and efforts to safeguard government institutions. United States officials echoed Pedersen despite the US designation of HTS as a terrorist organization. Incidents in Damascus and Hama Against the backdrop of his track record in recent years in administering the Idlib region, the last rebel-held stronghold in Syria when the civil war’s battle lines were frozen in 2020, al-Jolani has sought to project an image of tolerance, reconciliation and ability to deliver public goods and services. Al-Jolani turned Idlib, historically the country’s poorest province, into its fastest-growing region, despite his autocratic rule and frequent Syrian and Russian air attacks. To his credit, there were no major reports of attacks on Christians, Alawites and other minorities or acts of revenge against representatives of the Assad regime, including the military. Further, there was no mass looting as HTS fighters took over cities and towns, including Damascus. That is not to say that everything unfolded incident-free. One Damascus resident reported that unidentified armed men had knocked on the door of an acquaintance and asked about his religion. A neighbor returned home to find his door broken down and his apartment looted. Similarly, a nearby government building was looted despite instructions from rebel leaders against violating public property. The rebels imposed an overnight curfew in Damascus to maintain law and order. Earlier, a man in Hama told prisoners sitting on the ground with their hands tied behind them in a video on social media, 'We will heal the hearts of the believers by cutting off your heads, you swine.' HTS’s statement on Syrian chemical weapons Meanwhile, with Israel bombing Syrian arsenals of strategic weapons, including suspected chemical weapons sites, HTS missed an opportunity to unequivocally garner trust. In a statement, the group said it will safeguard the country’s remaining chemical weapons stockpiles and ensure they aren’t used against citizens. This is a stark contrast to the Assad regime, which used chemical weapons on several occasions against Syrian civilians. In the wake of Assad’s fall, the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW), the UN chemical weapons watchdog, said it had contacted unidentified Syrian authorities 'with a view to emphasising the paramount importance of ensuring the safety and security of all chemical weapons-related materials and facilities.' HTS responded, saying, 'We clearly state that we have no intention or desire to use chemical weapons or any weapons of mass destruction under any circumstances. We will not allow the use of any weapon, whatever it may be, against civilians or [allow them to] become a tool for revenge or destruction. We consider the use of such weapons a crime against humanity.' The group would have done itself a favor by offering to destroy under international supervision what chemical weapons stockpiles fall into its hands and/or ask OPCW to assist in searching for such weapons.

Navigating Myanmar Sustainable Development Plan In A Post-Coup Er...	By Phyo Thura Aung Myanmar’s progress toward the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and the Myanmar Sustainable Development Plan (MSDP) has been set back by political instability, economic challenges, and environmental degradation following the 2021 military coup. Key Takeaways: 1. Myanmar’s political instability, worsened by the military coup and escalating conflict, has undermined progress in governance and peace-building efforts, making MSDP Goal 1 (peace and stability) unattainable. 2. The coup has significantly weakened Myanmar’s economy, with declining GDP, rising food insecurity, and restricted trade, creating substantial barriers to achieving MSDP Goals 2 (economic stability), 3 (job creation), and 4 (Human Resources & Social Development). 3. The military and other EAOs’ exploitation of natural resources has caused severe environmental degradation, while limited resources have constrained sustainable conservation efforts, jeopardizing progress on MSDP Goal 5 (environmental sustainability). Introduction Myanmar, a developing country, approved the Myanmar Sustainable Development Plan (MSDP) in 2018 to guide its efforts toward achieving Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Using 2017 as a baseline, Myanmar achieved notable progress across various SDG sectors during 2018 and 2019. However, in 2020, numerous challenges and crises severely hindered its progress. The country now ranks 120th out of 166, with stagnating progress, data gaps, and declining trends in the peace and environmental sectors. Only slight improvements have been observed in SDG Goals 1, 6, 8, 9, and 12, reflecting significant areas for improvement in government management and leadership. 1. Governance Sector 1.1 State Administration Council (SAC) Since the military coup in 2021, the State Administration Council (SAC) has forcibly seized power, overturning the democratically elected government and violating agreements with Ethnic Armed Organizations (EAOs). The military has conducted violent campaigns against civilians and EAOs, deploying bombs, airstrikes, and other heavy weaponry. These actions have caused significant loss of life, widespread property destruction, and displaced over three million people, creating a nationwide crisis of internally displaced persons (IDPs). Attempting to obscure these realities, the military organized a superficial 'national peace forum' in Nay Pyi Taw involving select EAOs allied with the regime. This forum failed to address critical peace issues or halt military aggression. Reports from ISP Myanmar indicate over 7,000 airstrikes affecting more than 156 townships since the coup, directly undermining MSDP Goal 1, which emphasizes peace and stability as foundations for national development. As a result, most EAOs have withdrawn from the Nationwide Ceasefire Agreement (NCA). Only a coalition of seven EAOs remains engaged with the military, underscoring a significant breakdown in trust and cooperation. This failure highlights the regime’s inability to honor commitments or foster sustainable peace. 1.2 National Unity Government (NUG) In response to the military coup, the National Unity Government (NUG) was established in April 2021 by elected representatives from the 2020 general election. Its primary objectives are to dismantle military rule, restore democracy, and transition Myanmar to a civilian-led federal system. The NUG has formed the People’s Defense Force (PDF) to resist the military junta, protect civilians, and coordinate armed resistance. The PDF collaborates with EAOs such as the Karen National Union (KNU) and the Kachin Independence Army (KIA), reflecting efforts to build a united front despite resource limitations and differing strategies among resistance groups. Seeking international recognition and support, the NUG has gained backing from entities like the French Senate, though global recognition still needs to be improved. The NUG continues diplomatic efforts to expose the junta’s human rights violations while advocating for democracy and inclusivity, aligning with MSDP goals. 1.3 Ethnic Armed Organizations (EAOs) Numerous EAOs have resumed armed resistance against the military since the coup, withdrawing from the NCA in response to the regime’s actions. Notably, prominent groups such as the Karen National Union (KNU), Chin National Front (CNF), and All Burma Students' Democratic Front (ABSDF) have denounced the coup and re-engaged in combat, asserting that the military's actions nullified the NCA. The Three Brotherhood Alliance (3BTA) - comprising the Arakan Army (AA), Myanmar National Democratic Alliance Army (MNDAA), and Ta’ang National Liberation Army (TNLA) - launched 'Operation 1027' in October 2023. This offensive has significantly reshaped post-coup conflict dynamics, capturing substantial territory and highlighting the growing strength of EAOs. While these developments demonstrate increased EAO resistance capabilities, the military retains control over critical urban areas and strategic locations, ensuring ongoing conflict. Airstrikes, forced conscription, and external influences like China’s strategic interests complicate the conflict further. Despite territorial gains by PDFs and EAOs, fragmented governance and lack of coordination with the NUG hinder a cohesive resistance. 2. Socioeconomic Sector 2.1 State Administration Council (SAC) The military coup triggered profound economic and social instability. Myanmar’s GDP has plummeted from approximately $78 billion in 2020 to $64 billion in 2023, marking an 18% contraction. This decline is attributed to reduced foreign investment, trade disruptions, and restrictive policies. In May 2024, the Ministry of Commerce's Department of Trade issued measures tightening requirements for import licenses, enforcing legal actions against goods arriving without the necessary documentation. These policies have disrupted supply chains and contributed to inflation. Consequently, the prices of essential goods have surged, with data indicating that grocery prices have tripled compared to 2020. Meanwhile, wages remain stagnant, exacerbating food insecurity and poverty. International businesses withdrawing from Myanmar have led to widespread job losses, shrinking the formal economy. These trends signal failure in achieving MSDP Goals 2 (Economic Stability), 3 (Job Creation), and 4 (Human Resources & Social Development). 2.2 National Unity Government (NUG) Despite limited resources, the NUG has implemented alternative tax systems to generate revenue in areas under its control. These funds are used to sustain essential public services and stabilize communities. The NUG collaborates with EAOs and local networks to facilitate trade and resource-sharing, mitigating the junta’s economic disruptions. The NUG also addresses the needs of IDPs, coordinating aid to alleviate starvation and economic deprivation. According to UNHCR, international funding still needs to be increased, with only 32% of humanitarian aid needs met by September 2024. These efforts, though constrained, align with MSDP goals and reflect attempts to foster economic resilience. 2.3 Role of CSOs, NGOs, and INGOs Civil Society Organizations (CSOs), NGOs, and UN agencies are crucial in responding to humanitarian and economic crises. CSOs focus on grassroots support, while NGOs like the Livelihoods and Food Security Fund (LIFT) assist with food security and social protection. However, restricted access to conflict zones, limited funding, and military-imposed constraints hinder their efforts. International agencies such as OCHA, UNHCR, and WFP provide essential aid, though their operations face significant funding gaps. By September 2024, only 32% of OCHA’s $1 billion funding appeal had been met, leaving millions without sufficient assistance. The inability of humanitarian organizations to fully address the crisis exacerbates economic instability, joblessness, and the failure to recover economically, significant obstacles to fulfilling these MSDP goals. 3. Environmental Sector 3.1 State Administration Council (SAC) Since the coup, the military has prioritized resource extraction over environmental sustainability, contributing to widespread deforestation and biodiversity loss. As of the 2024 environmental report, Myanmar ranks 177 globally, with a 27.1% score mentioning a failure to comply with the MSDP plan. Furthermore, projects like the Myitsone hydroelectric dam, previously halted due to environmental concerns, are being reconsidered under the junta, threatening ecosystems and displacing communities significantly, threatening more than 5 million people living in low-lying and coastal regions. These actions prioritize short-term economic gains, exacerbating environmental degradation and undermining MSDP objectives. According to Global Forest Watch, from 2002 to 2023, deforestation in Myanmar has intensified, with satellite data revealing that 16% of the country’s total tree cover was lost during this period. This has led to the displacement of thousands of people and significantly undermined livelihoods in the affected regions. 3.2 National Unity Government (NUG) The NUG emphasizes sustainable resource management, empowering local communities through its Ministry of Natural Resources and Environmental Conservation (MONREC). Initiatives such as mangrove restoration projects in the Irrawaddy Delta align with MSDP Goals 4 and 5. However, ongoing conflict limits measurable outcomes. 3.3 Role of CSOs, NGOs, and INGOs Local CSOs, such as the Myanmar Environmental Rehabilitation and Conservation Network (MERN), focus on forest conservation, biodiversity, and climate resilience, including mangrove restoration in the Irrawaddy Delta. Despite military-imposed restrictions, these organizations continue rehabilitating ecosystems and raising environmental awareness. However, illegal logging and resource exploitation by the military and some EAOs complicate their work. International agencies like UNDP and WWF support Myanmar’s environmental policies. The UNDP has assisted in promoting Myanmar’s National Environmental Policy, while WWF has raised awareness about deforestation and illegal resource extraction. Agencies like IUCN provide technical support for conservation projects and sustainable practices. Despite their efforts, the ongoing conflict and instability hinder progress toward the environmental goals of the Myanmar Sustainable Development Plan (MSDP), including land degradation and sustainable resource use. Case studies of affected communities, such as those displaced by the Myitsone Dam, should be integrated to improve environmental governance. More vital coordination between CSOs, INGOs, and global partnerships is essential to align efforts with the MSDP and address Myanmar’s role in regional climate policies. Conclusion Myanmar’s ongoing conflict and political instability have severely impacted its progress in governance, socioeconomic stability, and environmental sustainability. While efforts by the NUG, EAOs, and civil society provide some hope, the challenges posed by the military regime and some EAOs, resource limitations, and international funding gaps highlight the urgency for coordinated action to realign with the MSDP and achieve sustainable development. The following actions need to be performed immediately to address these challenges effectively. 1. International backing for humanitarian efforts must be enhanced, empowering local CSOs, UN agencies, and NGOs to address urgent needs, particularly for displaced populations. 2. Greater diplomatic pressure is needed on Myanmar’s military regime and their affiliated EAOs to encourage peace talks and restore democratic governance. 3. Including civil society from the NUG control area in policymaking will ensure local voices are heard and pave the way for sustainable peace. 4. New policies should curb environmental damage caused by the military’s resource exploitation and advocate for sustainable, community-led conservation initiatives in NUG and EAO control areas such as Kachin and Karen States. 5. Resolving Myanmar’s ethnic and political tensions through strengthened conflict resolution and peace-building mechanisms will be crucial for sustainable progress. By addressing these areas, Myanmar can work toward rebuilding a stable, democratic, and sustainable future while making meaningful strides toward achieving its SDGs and MSDP objectives.

The Democratic Party Changed While We Stayed In Place – OpEd	Let me start by saying I loathe politics. I’ve always been drawn to liberal ideas—individual freedom, protecting the vulnerable, questioning authority, and the fundamental belief that consenting adults should be free to live their lives however they choose as long as they’re not harming others. These aren’t political positions to me; they’re basic human principles. But the game of politics itself repulses me. What I’m about to share isn’t about politics; it’s about our shared reality and how we’ve lost touch with it. The Mindvirus What’s truly mind-numbing to me is how people don’t see what’s happening right in front of them. The media has devolved into nothing more than a propaganda mouthpiece for the establishment, programming people to react rather than think. I’ve experienced this firsthand: When I drew historical comparisons between vaccine mandates and 1933 Germany’s early authoritarian policies, I was instantly labeled an extremist and cancelled by my NYC community. Yet now, these same people casually call everyone at Trump’s MSG rally Nazis. The irony would be funny if it weren’t so tragic. My Liberal Foundation I still believe deeply in core liberal principles: Genuine free speech, not the controlled corporate version we see today Standing against establishment overreach Opposing unchecked corporate power Fighting against unnecessary wars Complete bodily autonomy – your body, your choice, in ALL contexts Defending individual rights consistently, not selectively These aren’t just political positions—they’re principles about human dignity and freedom. The Democratic Party’s Transformation The Democratic Party’s drift from these values didn’t happen overnight. Many of us, exhausted by Bush’s brutal wars, lies about weapons of mass destruction, and the Patriot Act’s assault on civil liberties, invested our hopes in Obama’s promise of change. But instead of the transformation we sought, we got what felt like Bush’s third and fourth terms. Under Obama, we watched as corporate influence grew stronger, not weaker. The Snowden revelations exposed massive surveillance programs. The housing crisis devastated ordinary Americans while Wall Street got bailouts. Rather than challenging institutional power, the Democratic establishment became increasingly entangled with it. The betrayal of liberal values became even clearer with Bernie Sanders. Like Trump, Bernie tapped into something real—a deep frustration with a system that had left ordinary Americans behind. Both men, from vastly different perspectives, recognized that working people were suffering while elites prospered. But the Democratic establishment couldn’t allow an actual progressive challenger. They used every trick in the book—from media manipulation to primary shenanigans—to block him from the nomination. Most disappointing was watching Bernie himself bend the knee to the same establishment he had railed against, leaving millions of supporters feeling betrayed and politically homeless. When Hillary Clinton emerged as the nominee, we were told rejecting her meant rejecting women’s leadership. But we weren’t rejecting female leadership—we were rejecting warmongering and corporate cronyism. What we needed was a leader embodying the feminine divine: qualities of compassion, understanding, nurturing wisdom, and the ability to truly listen. Instead, we got another hawk in the corporate establishment’s pocket. And when that failed, they doubled down on cynical identity politics with Harris. Today, the situation relating to Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. perfectly exemplifies how far the party has fallen. Here was a lifelong Democrat, a member of the party’s most popular family, who wanted to challenge these corrupting influences—and they wouldn’t even let him on the debate stage. I firmly believe that had they given him the opportunity, he could have united the country and beaten Trump. But that reveals the truth: this was never about beating Trump. It was about ensuring they maintained control by installing another establishment stooge who wouldn’t challenge their power structure. His departure from the party isn’t just about one candidate; it’s the culmination of a long betrayal of liberal principles. The Politics of Distraction vs. Real Issues Take abortion rights. This is an incredibly nuanced issue with deeply held convictions on all sides. I’ve spoken with several constitutional lawyers who’ve explained that overturning Roe was legally sound—not a political decision but a constitutional one about federal versus state authority. That makes it even more telling that Democrats, when they had a supermajority, chose not to codify these protections into federal law. Instead, they’ve kept this issue unresolved, using it as a reliable tool to drive voter turnout every four years. While abortion access matters deeply to many Americans, we’re facing multiple crises that threaten the very foundation of our republic: inflation is crushing working families while Wall Street posts record profits; government surveillance of citizens has reached dystopian levels; and our regulatory agencies—the FDA and CDC—have been completely captured by corporate interests, approving one toxic product after another while our children are being poisoned by processed foods, environmental toxins, and experimental drugs. The climate crisis (or what some see as deliberate geoengineering) threatens our very survival. Our border is in complete chaos—while we send billions to foreign conflicts most Americans barely understand. All this while our own infrastructure crumbles and our nation grows more divided than ever. The hypocrisy around women’s rights is particularly telling. The same party that claims to champion women’s bodily autonomy pushed for mandatory experimental medical interventions, despite documented evidence of mRNA vaccines affecting women’s reproductive cycles and fertility. These effects were known from early trials, yet raising concerns got you labeled as 'anti-science.' Meanwhile, they’ve insisted that biological males have access to women’s spaces—including locker rooms, bathrooms, and sports competitions—prioritizing fashionable ideologies over women’s safety and fair competition. The Democrats permanently lost any moral authority on bodily autonomy the moment they advocated for mandatory medical procedures—yet they continue to lecture us about it without a hint of self-awareness. Liberal principles aren’t a Chinese menu where you get to pick and choose which freedoms matter. Take Kamala Harris—she literally campaigned on 'My body, my choice' while simultaneously mandating experimental Covid shots for her own campaign staff. You can’t claim to champion bodily autonomy in one breath and deny it in the next based on political convenience. Either you believe in individual liberty and bodily autonomy, or you don’t. There’s no à la carte option when it comes to fundamental human rights. The Corporate-State Fusion What we’re seeing today aligns disturbingly well with Mussolini’s definition of fascism: the merger of state and corporate power. Look at Klaus Schwab’s World Economic Forum promoting 'stakeholder capitalism,' where corporations and governments form partnerships to control various aspects of society. The WEF’s corporate membership reads like a who’s who of Democratic Party megadonors: BlackRock, which donated millions to Biden’s campaign while pushing ESG policies that benefit their bottom line; Pfizer, which poured over $10 million into Democratic coffers while securing massive government contracts; Google and Meta, which not only donate heavily but actively suppress information challenging Democratic narratives. This isn’t a coincidence; it’s coordination. These same companies shape policy that enriches them: BlackRock advises on financial policy while managing government assets, Pfizer helps write drug approval guidelines while selling mandatory vaccines, and Big Tech collaborates with federal agencies to control information flow. We saw this play out in real time: from day one of the Biden administration, they created backdoor channels into social media companies to censor Americans’ speech about Covid, the 2020 election, and other sensitive topics. This isn’t a theory—it’s documented fact. Every major policy decision seems to benefit these corporate partners: vaccine mandates, digital currency initiatives, censorship programs, climate policies—all funneling money and power to the same corporations that fund the Democratic machine. When corporations and government work together to control information and behavior, that’s precisely the corporate-state fusion that classical liberals once fought against. The Democratic Party has become the party of corporate fascism while claiming to fight against it. The Democratic Facade The current administration embodies everything wrong with our system. Look at Kamala Harris—she dropped out of the 2020 presidential race before any primary, polling below 1%. Biden then selected her solely because he limited his pool to black women—not because of her qualifications, but because of identity politics. Her record as Senator was abysmal—she sponsored zero significant legislation and missed 84% of votes during her brief tenure. Then as Vice President, her role as border czar has been an unprecedented disaster—one the administration now tries to pretend never happened. And here’s the ultimate irony: this is the party screaming loudest about 'threats to democracy,' yet they literally installed Harris as their candidate when nobody voted for her—she dropped out before a single primary vote was cast due to dismal polling. They wouldn’t even let their own members participate in primary debates. They’re lecturing us about democracy while actively suppressing democratic processes within their own party. When they say 'democracy is on the ballot,' what they really mean is their controlled version of democracy where they pick the candidates and we’re supposed to fall in line. Nobody voted for her, and honestly, nobody really likes her—they just hate Trump more. They could prop up a steaming pile of manure as a candidate, and people would vote for it just to vote against Trump. But here’s the real question: If Trump is truly the democracy-ending threat they claim, why didn’t democracy end during his first term? And if Harris is the solution to our problems, why hasn’t she fixed anything while in office? The Trump Enigma My view on Trump has evolved, though not in the way many might expect. I didn’t vote for him in 2016 or 2020. Growing up in this region, I knew him only as a second-generation real estate developer—Woody Guthrie had written those critical lyrics about his father, 'Old Man Trump.' At the time, I thought Donald was just another entitled heir who happened to opportunistically tap into something real. But there’s so much more to this story. His connections to secret societies and the occult run surprisingly deep. His Trump Tower penthouse is essentially a Masonic temple, designed as a replica of Versailles with deliberate esoteric symbolism throughout. His mentor was a 33° Scottish Rite, and Roy Cohn’—master of blackmail and dark arts—shaped his early career. Most intriguingly, his uncle John Trump was the MIT scientist tasked with reviewing Nikola Tesla’s papers after his death—papers that allegedly contained world-changing technologies, from free energy to more exotic possibilities. I don’t know what it all means, but there’s clearly more to this story than the 'orange man bad' narrative we’re fed. At this point, I see only three possibilities: He’s playing his part in a grand political wrestling match (WWF style) He’s a dueling bad guy (genuinely a thorn in the establishment’s side) He’s actually the hero of this story (which would be the most hilarious plot twist imaginable from the vantage point of someone like me) The Path Forward Candidly, I don’t know and at this point, any of these seem plausible. What I do know is what the blue team represents—their actions have made that crystal clear. But Trump remains a bit of a mystery to me. I have a hard time believing any politician could be our savior—real change has always come from the bottom up, not the top down. But something interesting happened that gave me a glimmer of hope: RFK, Jr. jumping on board. The RFK, Jr. situation is fascinating. Here’s a Kennedy—essentially Democratic royalty—teaming up with Trump after being shut out by his own party. This isn’t just any political alliance. RFK, Jr.’s deep understanding of the administrative state, from public health institutions to regulatory agencies, combined with his proven track record of exposing corporate capture and fighting pharmaceutical corruption, makes this particularly intriguing. Maybe, just maybe, this alliance could protect our children from harmful policies and unnecessary wars? I struggle with what comes next because I understand the gravity of our situation. Our republic is incredibly fragile—more fragile than most people realize. The Founders knew this, warning us about the difficulty of maintaining a democratic republic. But I refuse to give up on dialogue, even when it feels hopeless. If people don’t see what’s happening by now—the censorship, the mandates, the war-mongering, what appears to be intentional schismogenesis (I wrote about this idea here)—will they ever? The powers that profit from our division; they’ve mastered the art of keeping us fighting each other so we don’t look up to see who’s really pulling the strings. These aren’t just political issues—they’re existential challenges that require reasonable people to discuss complex solutions. Your neighbor who voted differently isn’t your enemy—they likely want many of the same things you do: safety, prosperity, freedom, and a better future for their children. They might just have different ideas about how to get there. I know this is heavy stuff. You might disagree with everything I’ve said, and that’s okay. What’s not okay is letting these disagreements destroy our relationships and communities. The choice isn’t just about who we vote for—it’s about how we treat each other, how we discuss our differences, and whether we can find common ground in our shared humanity. The way forward isn’t through hatred or fear. It’s through understanding, open dialogue, and most importantly, love. We might be living through the death throes of the American experiment, or we might be witnessing its rebirth. Either way, we’re in this together, and our strength lies in our ability to work through these challenges as a community, as neighbors, and as friends. Let’s choose wisdom over reaction, understanding over judgment, and love over fear. Our future depends on it.

The Sino-Indian Border Deal And Eurasia’s Emerging Strategic Land...	The border accord between Beijing and New Delhi facilitates the advent of a multipolar Eurasia more robust against U.S. unilateralism and protectionism The Sino-Indian border patrol agreement concluded in October brings an end to a four-year military standoff between Beijing and New Delhi. While only China and India are directly involved in the pact, the implications of it go beyond the boundaries of those two states. Deciphering the deal’s significance allows the EU to recalibrate its engagement with China and India, facilitating the emergence of a multipolar Eurasia. Multipolarity, in turn, enables European and Asian states to become more resilient against the second Trump administration’s probable unilateral and protectionist measures. The border dispute has long been a thorn in the side of Sino-Indian relations. Tensions were at a high in the 1960s, when the two sides fought a deadly border war in 1962, followed by low-scale combats in 1967. The turbulent 1960s gave way to precarious stability, until the Galwan valley clash led to the death of at least 20 Indian and four Chinese soldiers in June 2020. After four years of tensions, China and India reached an agreement in October that could enable troops to patrol the disputed border as they did before 2020. The two sides proceeded to withdraw soldiers in contentious areas and the process concluded at the end of October. High-level meetings followed the withdrawal, where Chinese and Indian leaders reiterated their commitment toward rebuilding trust in the relationship. The border patrol agreement has consequences for Sino-Indian strategic, economic and diplomatic interests. With the boundary stabilized, India can reduce its strategic dependence on the U.S., making New Delhi more resilient against Washington’s pressure to align with its geopolitical designs. This serves Beijing’s strategic interests as well, because it puts distance between India and the U.S., preventing the establishment of a coalition against China. In the economic dimension, India has the opportunity to reembrace Chinese investments, while Beijing can double down on India’s 1.4 billion market. On the diplomatic front, both sides can present themselves as responsible powers promoting peace. China and India are the two most populous nations of the planet with growing economic and military capabilities. Conflict and rapprochement between these two actors have profound implications for other major powers as well. Although the EU is not involved in the Sino-Indian border dispute, the border patrol agreement has strategic, economic and diplomatic implications for Brussels too. To begin with, agreement introduces stability to China-India relations, facilitating European, Chinese and Indian efforts of promoting multipolarity. China and India consider Europe as a pole of power and a partner in advocating for a multipolar international system. At the same time, the EU, just as India, strives for strategic autonomy—the capacity to make policy decisions without reliance on external powers. By supporting the SinoIndian push for multipolarity, and pursuing its own strategic autonomy, the EU can contribute to the emergence of independent power nodes across Europe and Asia. In the economic dimension, the agreement lays down the foundation for the normalization of SinoIndian economic relations. The EU could utilize economic ties with China and India to tackle the possible challenge posed by the upcoming second Trump administration. On his campaign trail, Presidentelect Donald Trump promised 10-20% tariffs on all U.S. imports and 60-100% of tax on products imported from China. He later threatened China with 10% of tariffs based on grievances about Beijing’s efforts of countering the flow of fentanyl precursors to the US. Trump subsequently also made a threat of a 100% tariff on all BRICS members—including China and India—if they establish a novel currency to compete the US dollar. Although the EU was omitted from the list of Trump’s initial tariff targets, such punitive measures could have a major impact on Brussels’ economic posture, as it is a key trade partner of Washington. With the looming threat of U.S. protectionism, the EU faces the imperative of exploring alternative markets. China and India are among the ten biggest trade partners of the EU, with EU-China bilateral trade amounting to almost $783 billion and EU-India twoway trade reaching approximately $137 billion in 2023. The EU could utilize the momentum to recalibrate its engagement with both markets and mitigate the impact of Trump’s impending trade policies. By doubling down on its Asian trade partners and reducing dependence on the U.S. market, the EU could ensure that Eurasia’s emerging power nodes have solid economic foundations. On the diplomatic plane, the border patrol agreement could enable EUChinaIndia cooperation on the Ukraine conflict. Until now, the Ukraine issue has been a source of contention between the EU and the two Asian states. The two Asian giants refrained from condemning Russia for its actions in Ukraine and they have maintained trade ties with Moscow amid international sanctions. Brussels, on the other hand, imposed sanctions on Chinese and Indian entities for their purported connections to Russia’s defense industry. The border agreement, however, could bring a new momentum to EU-China-India approaches to the Ukraine conflict. The two Asian states’ close ties to Russia make them potential peace brokers. Russia identified China and India as possible mediators between Russia and Ukraine. The EU also attaches great importance to Beijing’s and New Delhi’s potential contribution to the return of peace in Ukraine. The military standoff on the border and subsequent China-India frictions undermined their bilateral ties and any chance of potential coordination on Ukraine. Now that SinoIndian relations are on the path of improvement, the opportunity is there to align EUChinaIndia attempts toward managing the Ukraine conflict. In other words, the Sino-Indian border agreement is a bilateral matter, but it also shapes the Eurasian geopolitical landscape. A multipolar Eurasia that has independent poles of power, productive economic relationships and joint diplomatic endeavors could withstand the headwinds brought on by the upcoming second Trump administration. As Brussels, Beijing and New Delhi strive for multipolarity, the U.S. will have to design a Eurasia policy that accounts for powers with self-directed strategic, economic and diplomatic agendas across Europe and Asia. The EU and India are likely to double down on their own China policy instead of merely facilitating U.S. efforts of managing Beijing’s rise. With the possibility of the EU, China and India decreasing dependence on the U.S. market, Washington will probably face tough negotiations and countermeasures instead of intimated trading partners. The prospect of EU-China-India diplomatic coordination on the Ukraine question lessens the need for preponderant US involvement in the management of the conflict. At the end of the day, the void left behind by an isolationist U.S. is unlikely to remain unfilled for long.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWdkCpp9nW_v5AgsbnJ6wvLl	2024-12-12T17:40:45-08:00	
Xi Jingping’s Latin Success – Analysis	By Lt Gen S L Narasimhan Chinese President Xi Jinping’s visit to Peru and Brazil from 13 to 21 November 24 made global headlines. There were two purposes for his visit. One, to attend the APEC Summit meeting in Peru and to inaugurate the Beijing-funded Chancay Port, and two, to participate in the G20 Summit in Brazil. He also turned the events into a state visit to both countries. This trip has been interesting as it sought to project China as a champion of the global community in both the summits and separately to improve the bilateral relations with both countries Peru was by far the most impactful of the visits. While there, China and Peru signed an upgraded Free Trade Agreement (FTA), which is expected to boost bilateral commerce by 50%. They signed Memorandums of Understanding on bilateral cooperation in food security and education. The high point was the inauguration of the Chancay Port, done via a video link by both the Presidents. This port in western Peru, a $3.6 billion project and part of the Belt & Road Initiative (BRI), has been constructed with Chinese assistance, with state-owned Chinese shipping company COSCO investing$ 1.3 billion for a 60% shareholding. On plan, it is expected to reduce, by 20%, the trade costs between China and Peru. On a grander plan, China’s goal is to make Chancay a regional trade hub, opening a maritime and land route between China and Latin America. However, Peru’s neighbours, near and distant, have serious concerns about Chancay Port. The land connectivity from Brazil is an issue as it passes through the Amazon forest and the Andes mountains.[1] If connected to Brazil, it will undercut the region’s trade with the U.S., which says it will impose a 60% tariff on goods transiting through Chancay as it may be a conduit for Chinese goods entering the U.S. There are suspicions that this port could serve the dual purpose for China and the PLA Navy, which, could operate from here (See map). The U.S. gift of a few locomotives to Peru was dwarfed by the inaugural of the Chancay Port, the China showpiece in Latin America. Xi also ruffled feathers in his own neighbourhood. During the visit, the China Foreign Office Press release stated that Peru continued to support the One China principle. This drew a sharp response from Taiwan’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs, which called it 'unwarranted statements, which disparage Taiwan’s sovereignty.' [2] In addition to education and food security, Xi’s bilateral meeting with Peruvian President Dina Boluvarte discussed cooperation in minerals, energy, infrastructure, transportation, communications, digital economy, smart customs, artificial intelligence (AI), green shipping, electric vehicles and solar power. China offered Luban[3] Workshops to Peru for skill development. And China’s Suzhou and Chancay were declared as sister cities. Xi prepared the ground for the grand visit prior to his departure to Peru, when he published an article in which he highlighted the Global Development Initiative, Global Security Initiative and Global Civilisation Initiative leading to Global Community of Shared Future. China, it appears, has chosen well in Chancay, its gateway to Latin America. Despite Brazilian concerns, it was not inured to China’s lure. During Xi’s time in there, Brazil and China signed 37 agreements for cooperation across-the-board – from agriculture to infrastructure and industry, mining and technology, and health to culture, extending the cooperation ahead for the next 50 years in areas such as sustainable infrastructure and aerospace.[4] The partnership was upgraded from a global strategic partnership to a 'China-Brazil Community with a Shared Future for a More Just World and a More Sustainable Planet' which brings the countries closer. The two presidents saw synergies between their national flagship policies and programmes like New Industry Brazil, the Growth Acceleration Program, the South American Integration Routes Program, the Ecological Transformation Plan and the One Belt One Road Initiative. Two task Forces, one on Financial Cooperation and another on Productive and Sustainable Development, will be established, with priority projects ready to go within two months. Not to be outdone by Peru, Brazil announced a port route between the Greater Bay Area of China (Guangdong-Macau- Hong Kong) and Port Santana Das Bocas in northern Brazil, the ‘biofertiliser route’[5] that will exchange the rich fertilizer and agricultural produce of Brazil with sustainable trade initiatives with China – and the expectation of reduced transportation costs and time by 14 days across the Pacific. Like Peru, Brazil seems to be following China’s patterns – making grand announcements of an Initiative to End Hunger by 2030 in the world, with claims that 80 countries have supported this, including China. However, China’s Foreign Ministry spokesperson did not mention it.[6] As usual, the statements put out by China and Brazil varied in content. China did have several other bilateral meetings with other countries in Latin America, from Chile to the Honduras. But Xi’s major interaction was with President Biden on the sidelines of the APEC Summit. Xi’s statement from his foreign ministry reads almost like a rebuke[7] to the U.S. The statement puts forth China’s four Red lines as the Taiwan question, democracy and human rights, China’s path and system, and China’s development right. The White House Read Out is passive in comparison and seems to be a justification of U.S. actions.[8] Western analysts dismiss the four red lines mentioned by Xi as exposing the CCP’s insecurity.[9] Multilaterally, Xi had much to say both at APEC and at the G20. At APEC, he expressed support for the Putrajaya Vision 2040 adopted by the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) Leaders in 2020. This outlines a long-term goal to create an open, dynamic, resilient, and peaceful Asia-Pacific community by 2040 with three main economic drivers: Trade and Investment, Innovation and Digitalisation and Strong, Balanced, Secure, Sustainable, and Inclusive Growth). He advocated an open global economy; support to WTO and multilateral trading; FTAs with Asia Pacific countries, and negotiations with ASEAN FTA 3.0, support for Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP), Comprehensive and Progressive Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP) and the newer Digital Economy Partnership Agreement (DEPA). The latter is a trade agreement between the US and Chile, New Zealand and Singapore, designed to facilitate digital trade and create a framework for the digital economy. In his speech at the G20 Xi got attention by his criticism of the US’s concept of 'small yard high fences'[10] for important technology not being permitted to leave the US and especially not to China. Xi continued to plug for economic globalisation – of which China is the major beneficiary – and supporting developing countries to integrate digital, smart and green development. He also plugged the BRI, emphasizing its nature of reducing poverty reduction through cooperation, highlighted the 10 partnership actions with Africa, and announced that China would join Brazilian President Lula’s Global Alliance against Hunger and Poverty. He announced China’s implementation of the G20 anti-corruption plan action plan by strengthening cooperation in fugitive repatriation, asset recovery, denial of safe haven and anti-corruption capacity building. China, he said, is pursuing high-standard opening up, particularly to the least developed countries – which now were provided zero-tariff treatment for 100 per cent tariff lines for them. Clearly, Xi garnered the attention of both APEC and G20. The red lines he mentioned in his meeting with President Biden, will be an important factor in China-US relations in Trump’s second term. China’s economic might seems to be influencing Latin American countries, as evidenced by the increasing interest in signing FTAs with China. The significance of the Chancay Port in Peru cannot be understated. It allows China entry into the economy of South America and surely opens up an opportunity for the PLA Navy to be supported from there. Finally, he was able to include China’s global initiatives in almost every meeting. All these successful Continental engagements, taken along with reports of China operating a communications centre in Cuba,[11] makes it apparent that it is increasing its influence in the proximity of the U.S., its main global competitor.

Health Insurance Killing: Economics Does Have Something To Say – ...	I’m not one to generally tout the wisdom of the economics discipline, but it actually does offer some useful insights into the likely motive for the murder of Brian Thompson, the CEO of United Healthcare (UHC). According to media accounts, the suspect, Luigi Mangione, was angered by his own and others’ experiences being turned down when submitting claims for healthcare service. United and other insurers make a profit by restricting the claims they pay, so their profit motive goes directly against people’s need to get healthcare. That simple story is undeniably true, but the picture is more complicated. Many of the claims being submitted are outlandishly high, due to high prices for drugs and medical equipment, as well high fees for medical specialists and hospital administrators. In recent years, private equityfirms have also seen the healthcare industry as a promising source of profits. Our doctors on average get paid more than twice as much as their counterparts in other wealthy countries. Our pay structure for CEOs and other top corporate executives is out of whack and badly needs reforming. Private equity is largely a predatory industry that often profits by conducting itself in ways that would be too embarrassing for a publicly traded company. These are all important sources of bloat in the healthcare sector, as is the insurance industry itself, but I want to focus on the relatively simple story of prices for drugs and medical equipment. This is where one of the most basic principles of economics, marginal cost pricing, has much to tell us. When we see drugs that sell for tens of thousands of dollars — or even hundreds of thousands — for a course of treatment, it is almost never because the drug is expensive to manufacture and distribute. It is due to the fact that the government has granted the drug company a patent monopoly for its drug. It’s the same story with various types of medical equipment from scanning equipment to dialysis machines and other devices that can save lives. When a company has a monopoly on an item that can be essential to people’s health or life, it can charge an enormous price. There is a logic to these patent monopolies: They give companies incentive to invest millions, or even billions, in developing these life-saving products. I’ll get back to this, but let’s first focus on the issue from the standpoint of society. Suppose a drug company is charging $100,000 for a course of treatment for a serious disease. This number is not imaginary. When Sovaldi, the breakthrough drug for Hepatitis-C, was first introduced more than a decade ago, the company charged $84,000 for a three-month course of treatment, which was usually a complete cure for a debilitating and life-threatening illness. That would be well over $100,000 in today’s dollars. If a patient told UHC, or any insurer, that it wanted it to pay $100,000 for a drug, it is understandable that it would want to scrutinize the proposed payment closely. It would want to be certain that the person actually had the condition for which they wanted treatment. Maybe it would demand verification from more than one doctor. It would also want to be sure that the proposed treatment would actually be effective. Because of the huge markups allowed by patent monopolies, drug companies have enormous incentives to claim that their drugs are more effective than may really be the case. There may be risks for patients that drug companies conceal, as was the case with the addictiveness of the new generation of opioids. For these reasons, it is understandable that an insurer would want to make sure that the drug really was the best treatment for the patient. The insurer would also reasonably ask if there are lower cost alternatives. If an extremely expensive drug provides only marginal benefits over a cheap generic (e.g. it need only be taken once a day rather than multiple times), it might be reasonable to insist that the patient take the cheap generic. These issues arise because the drug can sell for a price that is far above its marginal cost. If we had Sovaldi selling for a few hundred dollars for a course of treatment, the price of generic Solvaldi, it’s unlikely the insurer would be asking many questions. These sorts of issues arise with many of the situations where insurers decline approvals. This applies not only to drugs, but scans and the use of medical equipment. An insurer may not want to pay for a scan using the latest device but would instead insist on a simple X-ray or other cheaper scan. If there were no patents on the latest device, the cost of using it would be little different than the cost of a simple X-ray machine. In the no-patent world, there would be little reason for an insurer not to tell patients to use the best available technology. Note that these issues would arise even if we had a single-payer system. A monopsonist buyer could force the drug companies and medical equipment manufacturers to accept lower prices, but we still would face the problem that they would be charging prices that are far above their marginal cost. In that case, there would still be good reason to carefully scrutinize the use of new drugs and medical equipment that cost far more than off-patent alternatives. This stems from the mechanism for financing innovation. We want drug companies and medical equipment manufacturers to be able to make enough profit to give them incentive to innovate. If we forced their price down to generic levels, there would be no reason to make the investments needed to develop better drugs and medical equipment. Another Way to Finance Innovation We don’t have to rely on patent monopolies to finance research. There are alternative routes, most obviously direct public funding. We already spend more than $50 billion a year supporting biomedical research through the National Institutes of Health and other government agencies. The industry spends around $120 billion a year which it expects to be reimbursed through its patent monopolies. This spending would need to be replaced. We would probably need an alternative structure to NIH for this funding. (I outline a system of long-term contracts in Rigged [it’s free], but we can debate how a system of public funding could be best structured.) However, the savings from having drugs and medical equipment available at generic prices would be enormous. We will spend over $650 billion this year on drugs and other pharmaceutical products, more than $5,000 per family. The cost would likely be in the neighborhood of $100 billion if they were sold without patent monopolies. We spend another $200 billion on medical equipment. More important than the savings is the changed structure of incentives. Insurers, or whoever was deciding on whether to pay the tab, would be looking at the actual cost of the drug or medical device to society at the point where the patient needs it. As it is now, we are asking patients, who are almost by definition in bad health, to pay for research that might have been done (and paid for) ten or twenty years ago. That makes no sense. We also would take away the incentive for drug companies and medical equipment manufacturers to misrepresent the safety and effectiveness of their products. This is especially the case if a requirement of getting public funding is that all research findings be fully open. In that case, the companies developing a drug or medical device would have no special access to information. The entire community of researchers would have all the same information. Does This Fix the Healthcare System? Having drugs and medical equipment sell at free market prices would eliminate many of the tough calls insurers make today. The insurance industry itself is still an enormous source of waste that would be eliminated with a single-payer type system, but many of the tough calls would still exist if we left our current patent monopoly system in place. If we instead funded innovation upfront, and had cheap drugs and medical equipment, most of these tough calls would go away. There still would be cases where there are tough calls. For example, open-heart surgery can involve many hours from highly paid cardiologists and heart surgeons, as well as extensive preparation and follow-up from a number of other healthcare professionals. Should we be prepared to pay these costs for a person in their eighties or nineties? Of course, this cost would be considerably less if we paid our doctors closer to what they get in other wealthy countries and didn’t have hospital administrators with ridiculously bloated salaries. But getting drugs and medical equipment at free market prices would be a great start in reducing the number of tough calls we have to make in deciding on medical care.

The White Racial Preference In The Employment Of College Football...	Typically, about half of Division I college football players are Black, but less than a fifth of the head coaches are Black.1 This report quantifies and documents the underrepresentation of Black men as college football head coaches as well as the overrepresentation of White men in this occupation. The occupation of college football head coach stands out because of its prestige and high salary. College football is an important part of American culture.2 One observer sees it as 'the most important sport in America,'3 noting that '[t]he most popular of those [college football] teams play in stadiums that hold over 100,000 fans, while NFL stadiums hold no more than 80,000.'4 Many major movies5 and television shows6 have been centered around the sport, often highlighting the head coach. In the top college football subdivision, head coaches had an average salary approaching $4 million in 2022.7 In many states, the college football head coach is the highest-paid public employee.8 The occupation of college football head coach is important as a type of case study of White racial preferences in the labor market. The occupation is somewhat ideal in that there seem to be clear, objective9 statistics to assess the quality or productivity of individuals. If there are occupations that should be free of anti-Black racial discrimination or a White racial preference, one might expect that college football coaching is one of them. On the other hand, if one finds a White racial preference in football coaching, it is even more likely that it exists in other occupations where subjectivity — and therefore the potential for racial bias — plays a greater role. Key Findings Relative to the share of Black college football players, Black men are underrepresented as college football head coaches. White men are overrepresented relative to the share of White college football players. The underrepresentation of Black men and overrepresentation of White men as head coaches has not changed significantly since 2012. Black men are proportionately represented as college head coaches in baseball and outdoor track. They are underrepresented in basketball and soccer, but are most severely underrepresented in football. White men are not underrepresented as head coaches in any of the five sports examined. They are proportionately represented as college head coaches in baseball and outdoor track. They are overrepresented in basketball, football, and soccer. The White male overrepresentation is most extreme in basketball. The data suggests that the most discrimination against Black men as head coaches is in football, but the strongest White racial preference is not in football, but in basketball. It appears to be easier for a Black man to become an athletic director than a college football head coach. An affirmative action program is needed for college football head coaching to counteract the persistent White racial preference in the occupation. Racial Discrimination in the Treatment of Black Football Head Coaches Consider this scenario involving one university’s football team’s succession of three head coaches: Coach A has a record of 21 wins and 16 losses after three seasons. Coach B has a record of 21 wins and 15 losses after three seasons. And, Coach C has a record of 22 wins and 15 losses after three seasons. One of these coaches was fired after three seasons, the other two were allowed additional time to improve their performance. This scenario played out at the University of Notre Dame from 1997 to 2009. The Black head coach, Coach B, was fired after three seasons although the two White coaches, Coaches A and C, were given additional time.10 This suggestion of a bias in favor of White coaches is anecdotal. It is possible that there were factors causing the firing of the Black coach to which casual outside observers are unaware. But some more dedicated observers of college football — sports journalists and Black football head coaches — agree that Black head coaches are more likely to be fired early.11 And, a multivariate statistical analysis supports this conclusion.12 If Black head coaches are more likely to be fired than similarly qualified White coaches, then one could expect anti-Black bias or a White racial preference in all aspects around the occupation of being a college football head coach. As the economist Nolan A. Kopkin, who conducted the statistical analysis mentioned above, observed, 'if decision makers are discriminating against black head coaches when deciding whether to retain them, these racial attitudes are likely present in hiring decisions, as well.'13 He adds, 'On average, institutions with black head coaches are inherently less-discriminatory, as evidenced by them having hired a black coach.'14 In other words, the degree of anti-Black bias may be stronger at colleges that have never hired a Black head coach. Overall, if Black men15 are less likely to be hired as college football head coaches, and more likely to be fired, then there would be a significant underrepresentation of Black men as head coaches. The Underrepresentation of Black Men as College Football Head Coaches Being a college football head coach is an attractive occupation because of the prestige and high salary that comes with it. The median income for a Black man with a bachelor’s degree was about $76,000 in 2022.16 Compare that to the about $4 million for head coaches.17 There is no reason to expect that Black men would be less likely to aspire to this position than White men — if they perceive that they have a fair opportunity to obtain it. If they have reasonable doubts that they could ever be allowed to attain the position, then fewer of them would pursue it. Underrepresentation therefore helps to maintain underrepresentation by discouraging underrepresented groups from pursuing occupations in which they have a low representation. Effective affirmative action programs can help to break this feedback loop. To assess the underrepresentation of Black men as college football head coaches, this analysis will use a representation ratio. This ratio is the proportion of people of a particular race in the occupation divided by the proportion of student-athletes of the same race in the relevant sport or sports. While one does not have to be a man to be a college football head coach, the data in the NCAA demographics database currently only has male head coaches for football. The representation ratio assumes that the racial composition of the players of college football is very similar to the racial composition of the individuals who would have the skills and interest in becoming a college football head coach. One analysis found that 94 percent of head coaches played football in college.18 The average age of a college football head coach is about 50 years old.19 This suggests that the relevant racial composition of college football athletes should be from the mid-1990s. Unfortunately, those data are not readily available. The earliest year’s data in the NCAA database is 2012. The denominator for representation ratio calculations will be based on 2012 data. The data that are available, however, suggests that the general picture of over- and underrepresentation would be largely the same if the mid-1990s data were available.20 Representation Ratios for NCAA Division I Men’s Football Figure 1 shows that Black football head coaches had a representation ratio of 0.35 in NCAA Division I in 2024. In other words, it is only about a third of what one might expect given the share of Black student-athletes in football. The White representation ratio was 1.77, approaching twice what one might expect. Figure 2 illustrates that there has been no progress in improving the representation of Black men as college football head coaches. From 2012 to 2024, the representation ratio for Black head coaches has never exceeded 0.39 and has remained relatively flat. The White ratio has also been relatively flat over the same time period. It has ranged from 1.77 to 1.91. Black men’s access to head coaching positions varies by sport. Figure 3 shows that Black men have basically achieved parity in baseball and outdoor track. Black men are only halfway there in basketball and soccer. Football has the worst ratio of the five sports. The data on the selected sports suggests that the 'worst' outcome for White men is to have representation as head coaches in proportion to the share of White, male student-athletes (Figure 4). White men have roughly proportional representation in baseball and outdoor track. They are significantly overrepresented as soccer head coaches, even more overrepresented as football head coaches, and still even more overrepresented as basketball head coaches. The White male representation ratio in basketball is more than twice what one might expect. These data suggest that, among these five sports, Black men experience the most discrimination preventing them from becoming head coaches in football. While the White racial preference in football appears to be very strong, it does not seem to be the strongest among these five sports. Somewhat surprisingly, the strongest White racial preference appears to be in basketball. Being a college basketball head coach is also a high status and very highly paid position with salaries that rival football head coaches.21 It appears to be relatively easier for a Black man to become an athletic director than a football head coach. The representation ratio for Black male athletic directors is 1.12, slightly better than parity (Figure 5). (The representation ratios for women are very low.) This is much better than the 0.35 for Black male football head coaches. Nonetheless, there still seems to be a strong preference for White male athletic directors. Their representation ratio is 2.06, much better than parity and much better than for Black male athletic directors. Conclusion Black men are well represented as athletic directors, baseball head coaches, and outdoor track head coaches. They have a poor representation as head coaches in basketball and soccer, and an even worse representation in football. Objectively, this is surprising given that the number of Black student-athletes is largest in football, and the very high salary of a football head coach should be a strong incentive. In 2024, if there were 78 additional Black football head coaches, the Black representation ratio would reach parity. For individuals about 50 years old, the age of the average football head coach, there were easily at least 20,000 potential candidates — Black former football student-athletes22 — who could have been developed to fill the 78 slots. There is something not working in the system of economic opportunity for Black male college football players that none of them were able to fill the 78 slots. Football is a complicated game. There are many steps to becoming a head coach. Former Black college football players would have needed to be in the pipeline decades ago. Researchers examining the pipeline have identified a White racial preference throughout.23 If the underrepresentation of Black men as college football head coaches is to end, Black former football student-athletes will need to be given the same opportunities as their White peers. This means that Black former college football players need to be encouraged to pursue coaching, they need to be provided with the training and mentorship, and — most importantly — they need to be given equal access to the head coaching position without anti-Black racial bias. In other words, an affirmative action program needs to be developed. Affirmative action in employment is not a system of racial preferences. Rather, it is a system to counteract the system of White racial preference in the labor market. College football coaching needs it. Without it, the status quo will lead to the continued underrepresentation of Black men as head coaches.

While there is much less subjectivity in evaluating the success rate of coaches than in other many types of evaluations of workers, it may not be free of racial bias. The outcomes of games depend on many individuals who may be affected by the race of the head coach. One study has found that teams with Black head coaches receive more penalties than teams with White head coaches even after controlling for the team characteristics. Penalties can negatively affect the success of the team and lead Black coaches to have worse records than similar White coaches. Thus, the objective statistics of a coach’s performance may still be influenced by racial bias. See Davis, Andrew P., Tom R. Leppard, and Alexander B. Kinney. 2022.

Australia Punts On Cash-For-Favors In Pacific To Squeeze Out Chin...	By Tess Newton Cain It’s the giving season and Australia has been exchanging hard cash for favors with Papua New Guinea and Nauru that gives it an increased role in their sovereign decision-making. A lack of clarity as to how these arrangements can be enforced raises questions of just how 'secure' they really are. Australia’s role as a colonial power in the region may not be as well-known as that of other countries. However, both Nauru and PNG gained their independence from Australia in 1968 and 1975 respectively. The bilateral relationships are well established, multi-faceted and have, at times, been fractious. In the past, agreements giving one nation temporary control over another’s sovereignty have usually been part of the decolonization process and are not entered into lightly by independent states. Long on PNG’s wish list has been for a team to join the Australian National Rugby League competition. That has finally been granted with Australian taxpayers funding a geo-strategic play - worth US$400 million (AU$600 million) over ten years - that will see Australia’s nearest neighbor kick-off in the 2028 season. In parallel PNG has signed a secret 'strategic trust' agreement which reportedly makes the prized NRL team’s existence contingent on declining any offers of a security agreement with China. Australia’s Prime Minister has declared it a strategic victory. If PNG should breach this, the NRL would be compelled to kick it out of a competition that, for this Pacific nation, is not just the de facto national sport but akin to a religion. This is just the latest in arrangements that Australia has struck which leaves Pacific island countries having to factor Australian consent into sovereign decisions about how they engage with third countries – and this essentially means China. Australia is not the only country to have relationships of this type in the Pacific. Most notably, the U.S. provides significant funding and support to Federated States of Micronesia, Palau, and Republic of Marshall Islands in exchange for exclusive military access to their territories. In a similar vein, New Zealand exercises some foreign affairs and defense powers in relation to two countries in its realm by free association, Cook Islands and Niue. But these arrangements have been long-standing and are very different in nature to what Australia has been negotiating. In each case there is a question to be asked: does this arrangement dilute the sovereignty of the relevant Pacific partner? Issues of sovereignty carry a lot of weight in the Pacific islands region. Many countries are very young as independent states. Independence was achieved within living memory and ceding sovereign decision-making powers is not something that is or should be taken lightly. To trace this particular arc, we need to go back to 2023. On the margins of the Pacific Islands Forum Leaders’ meeting, (then) Prime Minister Kausea Natano of Tuvalu and Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese signed the Falepili Union. In the intervening period, Feleti Teo succeeded Natano as prime minister of Tuvalu and ushered the treaty into force in August. When it comes to the question of ceded sovereignty, Article 4 of the treaty has drawn the most attention and concern. It requires Tuvalu to 'mutually agree with Australia on any partnership, arrangement or engagement with any other State or entity on security and defence-related matters.' Teo has been reported as saying he has agreed a 'workable arrangement' with Australia when it comes to Article 4. But the issue remains that Tuvalu has accepted a role for a foreign power when it comes to sovereign decision-making in exchange for a climate migration pathway. Fast forward to earlier this week when the details of the Nauru-Australia treaty were revealed by its President David Adeang and Albanese. Earlier this year Nauru switched diplomatic recognitionfrom Taiwan to China. Whilst it is easy to describe the Nauru-Australia Treaty as Falepili 2.0 there are some noticeable differences. The Nauru-Australia Treaty does not create a migration pathway for Nauruans as was the case for Tuvalu. In the lead up to the announcement of the treaty, it was reported that Adeang had been negotiating hard. So what does Nauru get out of this agreement? First and foremost, they get cash. The treaty provides for a transfer of AU$140 million in budget support and funding for enhanced domestic security services in Nauru over a five-year period. There is no ‘Article 4’ in this treaty, but the security tie-up is certainly there. Article 5(6) stipulates that Nauru must agree with Australia any 'partnership, arrangement, or engagement' with a third party that pertains to a range of security-related items including defense, policing, and critical infrastructure related to banking and telecommunications. The Nauru-Australia Treaty may be worded more subtly than the Falepili Union but it is undeniable that it foresees a role for Australian officials in future sovereign decision-making. The shift to a more subtle form of words may have the effect of making the implications of this treaty more ambiguous. When it comes to foreign policy, these agreements lack both subtlety and nuance. Nonetheless, they will likely make Australia’s relationships in the Pacific deeper and more complex. Whether they will make island nations more secure remains to be seen.

The Second Trump Term And The ‘Sanctions Industrial Complex’ – Op...	By Hekmat Aboukhater As the Washington drawbridge lowers for a second Trump administration, the world attempts to glean any insights that might indicate the direction of his second term. At the top of the list of concerns is the topic of sanctions. As of 2024, the US is actively sanctioning a third of all nations on earth. As the American populace grew more wary of military entanglements and forever wars, consecutive administrations have exponentially escalated the use of the economic weapon. The Obama administration averaged a total of 500 new sanctions a year, while the first Trump administration doubled it to 1,000 a year, and the Biden administration sextupled the figure—imposing more than 12,000 sanctions in 4 years. Now, many wonder whether a second Trump admin will continue or curb this trend. US Sanctions: Past and Present Leading a nascent nation, Thomas Jefferson pushed the US congress to pass the Embargo Act of 1807 to punish the United Kingdom for harassing US ships, and impressing American sailors. A century later, shortly after the conclusion of the first world war—in his failed attempt to whip up support for the League of Nations—Woodrow Wilson advocated for its ability to sanction intransigent global actors by stating, 'A nation that is boycotted is a nation that is in sight of surrender.' However, the unilateral coercive measures—or financial sanctions, as we know them in the modern era—trace to a much more recent origin.The story of modern-day sanctions starts—as with many of our modern American experiences—with the USA Patriot Act of 2001. Title III of the act—concerned with money laundering used for the financing of terrorist organizations—gave the Treasury Department a swath of options to dig into the links between domestic and international financial institutions. Borne out of this new mandate, the Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC), got its first win by severing BDA Bank—a Macau-based bank that was suspected of facilitating North Korean money laundering operations—from the global financial market. The office was able to destroy the bank’s operations with a simple notice of incoming sanctions. Today, the list of sanctioned nations includes Cuba, Iran, North Korea, Russia, Syria, Afghanistan, Balkans, Belarus, Myanmar, Central African Republic, the DRC, Ethiopia, Hong Kong, Iraq, Lebanon, Libya, Mali, Nicaragua, Somalia, South Sudan, Sudan, Venezuela, and Yemen among others. While some are targeted against specific entities or persons, many sanctions indiscriminately target broad sectors of a nation’s economy. Such is the case in Russia, Venezuela, and Iran. Similarly, while some sanctions target heads of states and specific government individuals, others like the ones imposed on Syria target any and all government ministers regardless of complicity in any given crime. As for their merit, sanctions have rarely, if ever, achieved their stated aims. Cuba and Venezuela remain socialist and Bolivarian socialist regimes; Iran and North Korea have yet to denuclearize; and the Syrian and Yemeni regimes have not yet been ejected from or willingly abdicated power. The sanctions have, however, succeeded in three alternative ways.Sanctions have become a convenient tool to destroy the middle classes of targeted countries. Venezuela, Syria, and Iran were hit by inflation rates so high that they decimated savings and brought an end to the possibility of upward mobility within the respective civil societies. Sanctions have also successfully entrenched authoritarian leaders by giving them a convenient enemy, in the form of American imperialism, to hide from their populace behind. Finally, sanctions have succeeded in draining American good will, cultural prowess, and diplomatic soft power for billions across the globe. Other than being felt in the empty stomachs of children across the developing world, the sanctions boom has also brought about policy and financial reverberations closer to home. A new Washington behemoth has sprung up over the last two decades. The Sanctions Industrial Complex—a collective of law firms specialized in sanctions, lobbyist firms rife with revolving door appointees from the treasury department, and consultancies offering solutions in compliance has metastasized in the Washington Beltway. Mixed Signals from Trump 2.0 Trump is partially responsible for the sprawl of the complex. He famously levied unprecedented sanctions against Russia, targeted the Nord Stream 2 Pipeline, enacted the CAESAR Act of 2019 against Syria, and imposed a whole swath of additional sanctions against the Venezuelan Maduro government in 2017. Trump has also tapped Mike Walz as his National Security Advisor nominee. Early November, Walz stated that Trump’s plan to end the Ukraine war should consist of 'intensifying sanctions against Russia' and 'taking the handcuffs off,' implying that the Biden administration’s support of Ukraine has been in some way restrained. Trump also picked Marco Rubio as his Secretary of State nominee. Rubio is an avowed neocon who has yet to see a sanctions bill he didn’t approve of. He is deeply committed to imposing continued sanctions regimes on Cuba and Venezuela. Rubio also famously lamented Brazil and China’s deal to settle trade deals in Reals and Yuans stating that 'they are creating a secondary economy totally independent of the United States…there will be so many countries transacting in currencies other than the dollar that we won’t have the ability to sanction them.' Yet, Trump has also tapped Tulsi Gabbard as his Director of National Intelligence. Tulsi has been derided by the Clintonestablishment, and its mouthpieces like Nikki Haley, for prioritizing diplomacy and advocating against the use of economic sanctions. One of her last acts as a Democratic congresswoman was a bill that would prohibit taxpayer funds or government resources from being used to enact sanctions that inflict suffering on civilian populations anywhere in the world.As for Trump himself, he is showing an inclination away from the use of the coercive tool in his second term. While fielding questions at the Economic Club of New York in September, he stated that, 'the problem…with sanctions is that it ultimately kills your dollar. It has to continue being the world currency.' He added that he 'used sanctions but took them off quickly… China is trying to get their currency to be the dominant currency.' He concluded by stating that he wants to use sanctions 'as little as possible.' Cautious Optimism Trump’s remarks provide solid grounds for optimism among those who consider sanctions as illegitimate and illegal tools of warfare. His statement indicates his understanding that economic engagement with adversaries is ultimately more beneficial for long term US interests than economic coercion.Yet, the system of sanctions is not one that can be reformed overnight. A mere cessation of the imposition of new sanctions won’t go far. Sanctions, secondary sanctions, and asset seizures are pervasively in use by Washington’s empire. Adam Szubin, the former director of OFAC, in a Christmas office karaoke party, sang 'every little thing we do is sanctions' to the tune of the Police’s 'Every Little Thing She Does is Magic.' The consensus in Washington is deeply in favor of sanctions. And, with sanctions seen by Washington as the happy medium between tax-funded drone strikes and tomahawks and empty diplomatic condemnations, that consensus has ossified over time. A second Trump administration could remedy this by taking a proactive approach and providing further transparency regarding the sunsets of previously established sanctions regimes. Similarly, he could lower the compliance threshold for sanctioned entities and third parties potentially in danger of falling foul to secondary sanctions. Ultimately, whether Trump pulls the reins on this novel complex, as of now, remains a decision purely for Washington. However, with a nascent China trying its hand in the practice by sanctioning the US, the Japanese, and even NBA officials, and other economic players like Saudi Arabia dabbling with the tool, our exclusivity in precedent-setting won’t last for long.

ECB Cuts Rates Again As Eurozone Hit By Economic, Political Woes	(EurActiv) -- The European Central Bank cut interest rates again Thursday, citing a worsening growth outlook and slowing inflation, with political turmoil in the eurozone adding to the troubled picture. The central bank for the 20 countries that use the euro reduced its key deposit rate a quarter point to 3 percent, as widely expected. It was the ECB's third cut in a row and fourth since June, when it kicked off its current easing cycle. After hiking borrowing costs from mid-2022 to combat runaway energy and food costs, policymakers have turned their attention to lowering rates as inflation eases and the eurozone economic outlook darkens. Worse-than-expected data, as well as the Swiss central bank making an unexpectedly large rate reduction earlier Thursday, had fuelled speculation the ECB could deliver a hefty, half-percentage-point cut for the first time in the easing cycle. But rate-setters opted to continue cutting at the same pace, with a quarter-point reduction, as inflation remains stubborn, having rebounded back above the ECB's two-percent target in November. The slowdown in inflation is 'well on track', the ECB said in a statement announcing its decision. It cut its inflation forecasts for 2024 to 2.4 percent and to 2.1 percent in 2025 -- down 0.1 percentage point in each case. 'Most measures of underlying inflation suggest that inflation will settle at around the governing council's two-percent medium-term target on a sustained basis,' it said. But the central bank added that it now expects a 'slower economic recovery' than several months ago, and cut its growth forecasts slightly for 2024 and the following two years - to 0.7 percent, 1.1 percent and 1.4 percent respectively. The statement dropped previous language on keeping rates 'sufficiently restrictive for as long as necessary', saying instead that it was 'determined to ensure that inflation stabilises sustainably' around the ECB target. Trump jitters The move by the Swiss National Bank earlier Thursday, which brought its main rate down to 0.5 percent, reflected 'uncertainty' about the economic outlook between political upheaval in the United States and Europe. ECB officials have likewise raised concerns about the weakening growth outlook in the single-currency area, signalling a shift away from being laser-focused on bringing down inflation. Eurozone inflation peaked at 10.6 percent in late 2022 after surging in the wake of Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine and amid post-pandemic supply chain woes. It fell back under the ECB's two-percent target in September but rebounded in subsequent months, reaching 2.3 percent in November. Political headwinds are adding to the tricky terrain that rate-setters will have to navigate. Germany is heading for elections in February, seven months earlier than scheduled, after the collapse of Chancellor Olaf Scholz's long-troubled coalition last month. Even before the latest turbulence, the eurozone's biggest economy was struggling with a manufacturing slowdown, and its anaemic growth rates are weighing down the broader single currency area. Meanwhile in France, the eurozone's second-biggest economy, the government of Michel Barnier was ousted last week in a historic no-confidence vote, deepening the country's growing political and financial chaos. Adding to the troubled picture is Donald Trump's impending return to the White House. He has threatened to slap hefty new tariffs on all imports to the United States, and has previously singled out the EU as the bloc runs a sizeable trade surplus with the world's biggest economy. The ECB's decision comes a week ahead of the US Federal Reserve's next rate-setting meeting on December 17 and 18, with markets betting on another cut in borrowing costs.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWdkCpp9nW_v5OLb8p71SqDX	2024-12-12T17:16:00-08:00	
Why Are Leaflets Protesting North Korea Dropped In Japan? – Analy...	By Eugene Whong and Lee Jeong Eun An organization dedicated to advocating for South Koreans abducted by North Korea plans to air-drop anti-North Korean leaflets in Tokyo on this week. Specifically, the group plans to use drones to drop the leaflets -- containing photos and stories of some of the 516 South Koreans kidnapped by North Korea over the years -- over the headquarters of the General Association of Korean Residents in Japan, which many regard as Pyongyang’s de facto embassy there. North Korea doesn’t have an embassy in Japan because the two countries don’t have formal diplomatic ties. What’s the goal of this tactic? The group is doing this because staffers at the headquarters of the pro-North Korean organization -- also, abbreviated to Chongryon (in Korean) or Chosen Soren (in Japanese) -- refused to accept a hand-delivered list of abductees, according to Choi Sung-ryong, the head of the South Korea-based Association of the Families of Those Abducted by North Korea. Choi said that dropping the leaflets on Chongryon headquarters is like sending them directly to North Korean leader Kim Jong Un -- and he hopes that his efforts can prompt Pyongyang to acknowledge that it has abducted many South Koreans over the years. Choi said he would continue to distribute leaflets until this happens. 'The leaflets include a request to quickly confirm whether the abductees are alive or dead,' said Choi. 'We are asking Kim Jong Un to quickly confirm the fate of 516 family members. That’s why we’re protesting.' South Korea’s Unification Ministry has stated that it fully understands the feelings and efforts of the families of abductees, but it also said it would maintain communication with organizations and related ministries because there are laws and systems related to overseas rallies. Outside of Japan, Choi also plans to distribute leaflets to North Korean embassies in Switzerland and Germany, and he also plans to deliver some to U.S. President-elect Donald Trump. The plan draws similarities to the more well-known campaigns by North Korean escapee advocacy groups in South Korea, who fly anti-regime leaflets to North Korea via balloon. What is the Chosen Soren? The English name of the organization is the General Association of Korean Residents in Japan, and it is aligned with North Korea. Inside, their headquarters, there are vast paintings of Kim Il Sung and Kim Jong Il, the grandfather and father of the current supreme ruler, Kim Jong Un. It is the closest thing to an embassy because Tokyo and Pyongyang do not have formal ties, but the organization does not have the authority to issue North Korean passports or officially represent Pyongyang in diplomatic efforts. But Chongryon does staunchly advocate for Korean cultural and language preservation, and has a number of schools teaching exclusively in the Korean language under curricula that reinforces loyalty to the North Korean state and its leadership. Its rival organization is the South Korea-aligned Korean Residents Union in Japan, referred to colloquially in Japanese and Korean using the abbreviation Mindan. Both organizations advocate for Zainichi Koreans living in Japan -- which for most of the second half of the 20th century was the largest minority in the country, and is now the third largest. What does Zainichi mean exactly? In Japanese, it literally means 'staying in Japan.' Today, there are hundreds of thousands of zainichi Koreans who live in Japan -- they have been living there for generations, but for one reason or another they have not acquired Japanese citizenship. The history behind this is that when World War II ended in 1945, there were around 2.4 million Koreans in Japan, and while most of them returned to Korea over the next few months, around 640,000 stayed behind. In 1947, Tokyo ruled that they were foreign nationals and had to register as Chosenjin, or people of Chosen (in Korean, Joseon), the name of the dynasty that ruled the Korean peninsula prior to its annexation by Japan in 1905. When North and South Korea were founded in 1948, the rival governments both claimed to represent all of Korea and its citizens, so by extension, both Koreas claimed the Koreans in Japan. In 1950, zainichi Koreans were allowed to register as South Korean citizens. But those who wanted to register as citizens of North Korea were never given the option, and instead remained under the previous designation as people of Chosen and essentially stateless. What kinds of discrimination do zainichi Koreans face? Zainichi Koreans are in many ways an invisible minority in Japan as physically they blend in with the majority, and most speak Japanese as their native tongue. But they often face discrimination. Even if they chose to hide their heritage in social situations, their legal status as foreigners made them ineligible for postwar government support. It also bars them from holding public office or civil service positions. In the private sector, employers could refuse to hire them, landlords could refuse to rent to them, and banks could refuse to offer them loans, although over time the situation has improved. Japan became party to several international human rights covenants in the 1980s and since the post-war period there has been a general change in mainstream Japanese attitudes towards minorities. But for much of the early postwar period, the community struggled economically, and community organizations emerged to counter discrimination against Zainichi. The Chosen Soren and Mindan groups have advocated for their rights in Japanese society and preservation of Korean culture and language among the community, including by securing funds from the South and North Korean governments to run schools for Zainichi children. Today, while there is greater acceptance of zainichi Koreans in Japanese society, they still face discrimination.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWdkCpp9nW_v5CCPTXDW2KOw	2024-12-12T17:12:31-08:00	
The International Day Of The Girl Child: A Call For Intervention ...	Each year, on October 11, observance of the International Day of the Girl Child stands as a vital reminder of the myriad challenges girl children used to encounter around the world. Initiated by the United Nations in 2012, this observance brings attention to a range of critical issues, such as access to education, nutrition, legal rights, medical care, and the need for protection against discrimination, violence, and forced child marriage. In contemplating the theme for 2024—'Girls’ Vision for the Future'—it becomes crucial to address one of the most pervasive forms of violence that jeopardizes this vision: Childhood Sexual Violence. This widespread crime not only causes immediate suffering of its victims but also carries profound consequences for societies, economies, and the generations yet to come. The Scale of the Crisis Sexual violence against girl children represents a grave global crisis, impacting millions of lives. Recent estimates from UNICEF reveal that more than 370 million girls and women—around 1 in 8—have faced rape or sexual assault prior to turning 18 (UNICEF, 2024). Expanding the definition to encompass non-contact forms of sexual violence, including online exploitation and verbal abuse, reveals a staggering figure of 650 million, translating to 1 in 5 individuals worldwide. The data unveils a crisis that knows no borders—be they geographical, economic, or cultural—underscoring an urgent call for worldwide recognition and intervention. The inaugural global and regional assessments of sexual violence against children have highlighted the alarming prevalence of this issue and the enduring repercussions it inflicts on survivors. Those who commit acts of sexual violence are frequently individuals familiar to the victim—be it family members, neighbors or peers—rendering the act of disclosure all the more daunting for survivors (Pereda et al., 2009). The stigma associated with sexual violence introduces a profound complexity, often silencing countless victims who grapple with feelings of shame, guilt, and the fear of potential repercussions. The Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action, established in 1995, laid the groundwork for advancing girls' rights, emphasizing the importance of eliminating discrimination and enhancing access to education, particularly in STEM fields. However, despite the progress made, significant challenges still have been lingering on. As of 2024, there are still 119.3 million girls out of school, a decrease of only 4.3% since 2015. Alarmingly, 1 in 4 adolescent girls have experienced partner abuse by age 19, and an estimated 9 million girls will be married as children by 2030 (United Nations, 2024). Moreover, although more girls are enrolling in school, still they remained underrepresented in STEM education and careers, comprising only 35% of STEM graduates and 29% of STEM workers. Bridging this gap could significantly boost the rights of girls. Even though it is widespread, still the childhood sexual violence continues to be one of the most underreported and grave forms of abuse. UNICEF reports that sub-Saharan Africa bears the highest burden, with 79 million girls and women impacted, representing 22% of the global cases (UNICEF, 2024). High numbers of survivors are also reported in Eastern and Southeastern Asia, as well as Central and Southern Asia. The regional disparities observed here reveal a complex interplay of cultural attitudes towards gender and sexual violence, alongside the robustness of legal protections and support systems in place. In such complicated environments marked by civil/ethnic conflicts or political turmoil, the circumstances are considerably more severe. According to UNICEF, in such environments, the incidence of childhood sexual violence stands more than that 1 in 4 (UNICEF, 2024). In conflict zones, sexual violence is often used as a weapon, serving to instil fear within communities and to dominate those who are most vulnerable. In these contexts, girls and women find themselves especially vulnerable to be raped and exploited, as landscape marked by fragile social structures and a lack of protective measures. Sexual Violence in the Digital Age In the contemporary digital age, the realm of sexual violence has broadened to encompass online exploitation and abuse. With the expansion of internet access, the risk of children becoming targets for predators in online environments has been increasing exponentially. When examining non-contact forms of sexual violence, UNICEF's data reveals a staggering increase in the number of affected girls and women, reaching 650 million globally (UNICEF, 2024). The rise of online grooming, sextortion, and the spread of child sexual abuse material is becoming alarmingly common, driven by the anonymity and extensive reach of digital platforms. The psychological harm wrought by online abuse can rival that of physical violence, with long-lasting repercussions that are equally significant. Confronting online sexual violence demands a comprehensive strategy that engages governments, law enforcement, technology firms, and civil society. Enhancing digital safety protocols, refining the oversight of online environments, and escalating consequences for online offenders are essential actions in mitigating the threat of abuse. Moreover, it is crucial to educate children about digital safety, providing them with the necessary tools to identify and report inappropriate online conduct. Long-Term Consequences for Survivors The impact of childhood sexual violence extends far beyond the initial acts of abuses. Survivors frequently bear the weight of psychological, physical, and emotional scars into their adult lives, confronting enduring mental health challenges, including depression, anxiety, and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Research shows that children who endure sexual violence face an increased likelihood of experiencing further abuse, whether from the same individual or different offenders (Pereda et al., 2009). This establishes a relentless cycle of victimization, further complicating the journey toward healing. The aftermath for survivors can be profoundly impactful, encompassing the peril of sexually transmitted infections (STIs), unplanned pregnancies, and enduring reproductive health complications. The emotional and social consequences can be profound, frequently resulting in social isolation, a deep-seated distrust, and a struggle to cultivate healthy relationships. Survivors often face significant educational and employment hurdles, as the psychological burden of their trauma impedes their personal growth. Moreover, societal stigmas frequently hinder survivors from stepping forward or pursuing justice. In numerous cultures, the phenomenon of victim-blaming prevails, leading to discrimination, ostracization, or retaliation against those who dare to disclose their abuse. The problems to disclosure result in numerous cases remaining unreported, which significantly skews the understanding of the actual magnitude of the issue (Pereda et al., 2009). Combatting the Crimes To combat childhood sexual violence, governments must enhance legal frameworks, public awareness campaigns, comprehensive education programs, tailored support services for survivors, enhanced digital safety protocols, and cross-sectoral collaboration. These strategies aim to protect children from physical, verbal, and online abuse, and ensure robust enforcement of laws. Public awareness campaigns should challenge cultural norms and stigma, raise awareness about online risks, and equip children with the knowledge and confidence to protect themselves from potential abuse. Schools should integrate age-appropriate education about consent, healthy relationships, and digital safety into curricula. Governments and NGOs should collaborate to provide targeted support services, including accessible mental health services and community outreach programs. Digital safety protocols should be enhanced, with governments working closely with technology companies to regulate online platforms and implement stricter verification protocols. Specialized training for professionals, such as healthcare workers, educators, and law enforcement, is also essential. Cross-sectoral collaboration and research are also necessary to combat abuse and its underlying causes. Conclusion The issue of childhood sexual violence, manifesting in both physical and digital realms, stands as a critical global concern that requires urgent action. The International Day of the Girl Child underscores the urgency of this crisis, with UNICEF’s alarming statistics revealing the need for a comprehensive and coordinated response. Confronting this violence demands a unified approach from governments, civil society, and international organizations to establish legal, social, and digital protections for at-risk children. By fostering awareness, promoting education, and maintaining an unwavering dedication to justice, society can initiate the dismantling of the entrenched systems that sustain this violence, paving the way for a safer future for all children. In the battle against childhood sexual violence, safeguarding the most vulnerable members of our society must be a paramount global concern. It is only through this endeavor that we can start to forge a world in which every child is liberated from fear and afforded the chance to fully embrace their potential.

Ukraine Situation: Assad’s Loss Of Power In Syria Could Mean Russ...	By Can Kasapoğlu 1. Ukraine Attacks Russian Black Sea Gas Platforms The Ukrainian Navy executed a successful attack on Russian oil and gas platforms in the Black Sea. Kyiv has long targeted these platforms, which Moscow uses for maritime intelligence gathering. In September 2023, Ukrainian Defense Intelligence (GUR) forces seized the Boyko Towersoffshore oil rigs, depriving the Kremlin of crucial facilities for monitoring the region. Last week, in a novel approach, first-person-view (FPV) drones took off from sea drones before zeroing in on a Russian oil platform. The sea drone used in the offensive demonstrated two innovations: a three-hulled, trimaran design and a new type of warhead. These new features highlight the Ukrainian Navy’s ability to adapt and refine its operational concepts. Ukraine has also begun to incorporate short-range air defenses into its unmanned naval warfare systems. In recent engagements, Ukrainian Sea Baby drones were spotted firing anti-aircraft guns and interceptors at Russian helicopters, likely damaging the aircraft and injuring the onboard personnel. 2. Russian Naval Assets May Be Stranded in the Mediterranean The fall of the Assad dictatorship in Syria is affecting the conflict between Moscow and Kyiv, as Russian naval vessels may find themselves stranded in the Mediterranean Sea. A Russian flotilla, forward-ported at the Kremlin’s main overseas naval base in Tartus, Syria, is now stuck in a difficult position. As the Assad regime, a loyal ally of Moscow, fell to rebel forces, the Russian naval deterrent sailed away from the base. But Ankara has invoked Article 19 of the Montreux Convention, an international agreement governing the use of the Bosphorus and Dardanelles Straits in Türkiye. The agreement strictly limits the passage of naval platforms that belong to belligerents in times of war: only vessels based in the Black Sea may return to their home ports, and only after submitting a special request to the Turkish government. The flotilla sailing away from Tartus includes Grigorovich- and Gorshkov-class frigates, the Improved Kilo–class submarine Novorossiysk, and auxiliary craft. Of these vessels, the submarine may face the most pressing circumstances. The Montreux Convention states that submarines of the Black Sea littoral states may only transit the Bosphorus and Dardanelles 'for the purpose of rejoining their base in the Black Sea for the first time after their construction or purchase, or for the purpose of repair in dockyards outside the Black Sea.' The Novorossiysk has been on combat deployment in Syria and can claim no such exceptions. Moreover, even if the Russian surface vessels homeported in the Black Sea did manage to transit the straits, they would immediately become targets of the Ukrainian military. The remnants of Moscow’s Syrian naval presence appear to be stranded at sea for the moment. 3. Battlefield Assessment Russian invasion forces have been advancing steadily toward Pokrovsk despite heavy resistance, primarily through the railroad lines from Selydove. They have now reached the outskirts of the town. In the direction of Kurakhove, Russian formations have reached the Sukhi Yaly River, where Ukraine’s 214th Separate Special Opposing Forces (OPFOR) Battalion, with its heavy armor, remains a formidable obstacle. Toretsk also saw heavy fighting this week. In the north, the Russian military continued to exert pressure on the Kharkiv front, fighting for several hundred yards along the Oskil River. Elsewhere in this sector, Vovchansk saw intensive combat activity. Heavy fighting also continued in the Russian region of Kursk, with mounting material losses and casualties on both sides, though no drastic territorial changes occurred. Visual evidence shows that Ukraine used Joint Direct Attack Munitions (JDAMs) in Kursk, suggesting that Kyiv’s thinly stretched air deterrent has attained some freedom of movement. In late November, Ukraine used the Army Tactical Missile System (ATACMS) it received from the United States to hit a Russian S-400 strategic surface-to-air missile (SAM) system in Kursk. The successful ATACMS salvo likely paved the way for the current JDAM strikes in the embattled Russian region.

Anger Explodes At Health Care CEOS – OpEd	Over 8,000 Americans die every day, many of them unnecessarily. Why? Because the United States still doesn’t have a national health care system that guarantees everyone adequate medical attention. One particular American’s death has driven that point home. On December 4, a gunman murdered Brian Thompson, UnitedHealthcare’s 50-year-old CEO. The bullet casings from the shooting read 'deny,' 'defend,' and 'depose.' Those three words neatly sum up the gameplan America’s giant insurers so relentlessly follow: deny the claim, defend the lawsuit, depose the patient. Last year, United pulled down $281 billion in revenue, boosting annual profits 33 percent over 2021. Thompson himself pocketed $10.2 million in personal compensation. And Andrew Witty, CEO of the overall UnitedHealth operation, collected$23.5 million, making him the nation’s highest-paid health insurance CEO. All private insurers profit by denying help to sick people who need it. But UnitedHealth’s operations have become especially rewarding thanks to the shadowy world of 'Medicare Advantage,' the program that gives America’s senior citizens the option to contract out their Medicare to private health-service providers. These private providers collect fixed fees from the federal government for each of the senior citizens they enroll. They profit when the cost of providing care to those seniors amounts to less than what the government pays them in fees. And that gives private providers an ongoing incentive to limit the care their patients receive. No Medicare Advantage provider, the American Prospect’s Maureen Tkacik points out, has done more than UnitedHealthcare when it comes to 'simply denying claims for treatments and procedures it unilaterally deems unnecessary.' Industry-wide, Medicare Advantage providers deny 16 percent of patient claims. UnitedHealthcare denied 32 percent last year. The public’s frustration with health insurance companies erupted bitterly after Thompson’s murder. UnitedHealth’s official Facebook report on Thompson’s death quickly drew 35,000 responses using the 'Haha' emote. 'Thoughts and deductibles to the family,' read one reaction. 'Unfortunately my condolences are out-of-network.' 'Compassion withheld,' read another, 'until documentation can be produced that determines the bullet holes were not a preexisting condition.' Some of the fiercest reactions to Thompson’s death came from within the medical community. 'This is someone who has participated in social murder on a mass scale,' a medical student wrote in one typical post. 'My patients died,' a nurse spat out in another, 'while those b—-s enjoyed 26 million dollars.' 'If there’s anything our fractured country seems to agree on,' mused Bloomberg’s Lisa Jarvis, 'it’s that the health care system is tragically broken, and the companies profiting from it are morally bankrupt.' 'To most Americans,' agreed the New Yorker’s Jia Tolentino, 'a company like UnitedHealth represents less the provision of medical care than an active obstacle to receiving it.' Among wealthier countries, Americans 'die the youngest and experience the most avoidable deaths' despite spending almost twice as much on health care as others, a recent Commonwealth Fund Study found. And 25 percent of Americans, Gallup polling adds, have people in their family who have had to delay medical treatment for a serious illness because they couldn’t afford it. Thompson’s murder won’t change those stats. The system that enriched him lives on — and the incoming Trump administration figures to make that system even worse. The corporate-friendly Heritage Foundation, in its controversialProject 2025 blueprint for the second Trump term, is proposing that Medicare Advantage become the 'default option' for all new Medicare enrollees. That would 'essentially privatize Medicare' and significantly raise the program’s cost, warns analyst Heather Cox Richardson. With Thompson’s death, America’s health care powers feel and fear the American public’s anger now more than ever. The rest of us need to channel that anger toward ending this system that’s failed America’s health. We need to remake health care into a vital public service — not a tool for profit.

Turkey Mediates Historic Reconciliation Between Somalia And Ethio...	In a world often marked by conflict and division, moments of reconciliation remind us of the enduring potential for diplomacy to resolve even the most entrenched disputes. One such moment unfolded recently in Ankara, where Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan announced what he termed a 'historic reconciliation' between Somalia and Ethiopia. The resolution of a nearly year-long bitter dispute between the two nations signals a new chapter in regional relations and underscores Türkiye's growing influence as a mediator in global politics. The announcement followed extensive peace talks facilitated by Ankara. Somali President Hassan Sheikh Mohamud and Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed, the principal stakeholders in the negotiations, showed exceptional dedication in bridging their differences. This achievement, formalized as the Ankara Declaration, resolves tensions centered around the contested Somaliland region and lays the groundwork for enhanced cooperation and mutual prosperity. Long History of Conflict The modern borders of Ethiopia and Somalia were largely shaped by colonial powers, creating disputes that escalated after both nations gained independence. The first significant conflict between the two occurred in 1964, soon after Somalia's independence. This centered on the Ogaden region, which Somalia claimed based on ethnic ties and invaded in 1977. Although Ethiopia reclaimed Ogaden in 1978, tensions persisted, with both nations supporting insurgent movements within each other's territories, further destabilizing the area. The fall of Somali President Siad Barre's authoritarian regime in 1991 plunged Somalia into civil war and chaos, creating an opportunity for Ethiopian intervention. Ethiopia justified its involvement as a matter of national security. In 2006, it launched a military campaign to oust the Islamic Courts Union (ICU), a coalition of Sharia courts controlling much of southern Somalia. This intervention, backed by the United States, faced strong opposition from various Somali groups. A significant consequence of this was the rise of al-Shabaab, a militant Islamist group, which further complicated the conflict and drew in international actors. This development led to continuous military efforts by the African Union Mission in Somalia (AMISOM) and other forces. Ethiopia has engaged in numerous operations against al-Shabaab, acting both independently and as part of AMISOM. The prolonged conflict has had devastating humanitarian effects, displacing millions and leaving many in urgent need of aid. Türkiye's Strategic Role in Peacebuilding Türkiye's role as a mediator in this reconciliation effort reflects a deliberate and strategic foreign policy approach. Over the past two decades, Ankara has positioned itself as a key partner for African nations through robust economic investments, humanitarian aid, and cultural exchanges. This mediation effort aligns with Türkiye's broader goals of fostering stability and development in Africa, a region increasingly central to its international strategy. Erdogan, addressing a joint press conference alongside Mohamud and Ahmed, emphasized the importance of the agreement as a step toward lasting peace. 'We have taken the first step toward a new beginning based on peace and cooperation between Somalia and Ethiopia,' he declared. He also highlighted Ankara's 'fundamental expectation' of fostering stability in this geopolitically significant region, often referred to as the Horn of Africa. The Context of the Dispute The root of the conflict lies in Ethiopia's engagement with Somaliland, a self-declared independent region that Somalia views as an integral part of its territory. On January 1, Ethiopia entered into an agreement with Somaliland to utilize its Red Sea port of Berbera, a move that Somalia perceived as a direct challenge to its sovereignty. Ethiopia's interest in the Berbera port is not arbitrary. The country, landlocked since Eritrea's independence in 1991, has faced significant logistical challenges in conducting maritime trade. Dependence on neighboring Djibouti for port access has imposed economic constraints on Ethiopia, driving its search for alternative routes. Somaliland, with its strategic location along the Red Sea, offers an attractive solution to Ethiopia's maritime challenges. For Somalia, however, the issue is far more than economic. Recognizing Somaliland's agreements with external parties could be seen as legitimizing its claims of independence, potentially setting a precedent for other breakaway regions. This delicate interplay of sovereignty, territorial integrity, and economic necessity created a flashpoint that threatened to destabilize the region. The Ankara Declaration: A Path to Resolution The Ankara Declaration represents a balanced and thoughtful approach to addressing the concerns of both nations. Among its key provisions are: Technical Negotiations: Somalia and Ethiopia will initiate technical negotiations facilitated by Türkiye in February 2025. These discussions, expected to conclude within four months, aim to establish a practical framework for cooperation. Respect for Sovereignty: Both nations have reaffirmed their commitment to Somalia's territorial integrity, addressing one of the primary concerns of Mogadishu. Economic Collaboration: The agreement recognizes Ethiopia's legitimate need for maritime access while emphasizing mutually beneficial solutions that do not compromise Somalia's sovereignty. This dual focus on sovereignty and economic cooperation highlights the nuanced diplomacy involved in crafting the agreement. By addressing the core concerns of both parties, the Ankara Declaration creates a foundation for trust and collaboration. Türkiye's Growing Influence in Africa Türkiye's mediation in the Somalia-Ethiopia dispute is part of a broader strategy to expand its influence across Africa. Over the past decade, Ankara has deepened its ties with the continent through a combination of trade, investment, and humanitarian initiatives. The Turkish Cooperation and Coordination Agency (TIKA) and other organizations have played a pivotal role in building infrastructure, supporting education, and providing medical aid in African countries. This multifaceted engagement has elevated Türkiye's profile as a partner of choice for many African nations. By stepping into the role of a mediator, Türkiye not only enhances its diplomatic credentials but also reinforces its commitment to peace and development in Africa. Somalia and Ethiopia: Perspectives on Reconciliation For Somali President Hassan Sheikh Mohamud, the agreement signifies a new era of cooperation with Ethiopia. Speaking at the press conference, he expressed gratitude for Türkiye's role in facilitating the talks and reaffirmed Somalia's commitment to regional stability. 'Our countries have always been, and will always remain, true friends,' Mohamud remarked, highlighting the historical ties that bind the two nations. Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed echoed these sentiments, describing the talks as a 'family dialogue' that produced a 'win-win' outcome. For Ahmed, the agreement is not just about resolving a specific dispute but about creating a framework for broader collaboration. He commended Türkiye for fostering an atmosphere of mutual respect and trust, essential for meaningful dialogue. The Historical Significance of Ethiopia's Landlocked Status Ethiopia's quest for maritime access is deeply rooted in its modern history. The Eritrean War of Independence, which spanned three decades (1961-1991), resulted in Eritrea's secession from Ethiopia and the latter's loss of Red Sea ports. Since then, Ethiopia has been landlocked, relying on Djibouti for most of its maritime trade. While Ethiopia has achieved remarkable economic growth despite these challenges, the lack of direct access to the sea remains a strategic vulnerability. The agreement with Somaliland to use the Berbera port was an attempt to mitigate this issue, but it inadvertently triggered tensions with Somalia. The Ankara Declaration provides a pathway to address these competing interests in a manner that benefits both nations. Regional Implications of the Reconciliation The reconciliation between Somalia and Ethiopia holds significant implications for the Horn of Africa, a region often plagued by conflict and instability. By resolving their differences, the two nations set a precedent for peaceful conflict resolution, offering a model for other countries in the region. Furthermore, the agreement could catalyze economic integration between Somalia and Ethiopia. Collaborative projects, particularly in infrastructure and trade, could unlock new opportunities for growth and development. For example, Ethiopia's access to Somali ports could enhance regional trade networks, while Somalia could benefit from Ethiopian investment and expertise. Türkiye's Vision for Peace and Prosperity For Türkiye, the reconciliation effort aligns with its broader vision of fostering peace and prosperity in strategic regions. Erdogan's government has consistently emphasized the importance of dialogue and diplomacy in addressing global challenges. The Somalia-Ethiopia agreement serves as a testament to Türkiye's capacity to facilitate meaningful negotiations and achieve tangible outcomes. Moreover, this success bolsters Türkiye's image as a global peacemaker. By mediating in high-stakes disputes, Türkiye demonstrates its commitment to upholding international norms and fostering stability. This role is particularly significant in a multipolar world where traditional powers often struggle to address complex regional conflicts. Challenges and Opportunities While the Ankara Declaration marks a significant achievement, its success will depend on the implementation of its provisions. The technical negotiations scheduled for 2025 will be crucial in translating the agreement into actionable outcomes. Türkiye's role as a facilitator will be vital in ensuring that these discussions remain productive and focused on mutual benefits. Additionally, both Somalia and Ethiopia will need to navigate domestic political dynamics that could influence their commitment to the agreement. For Somalia, maintaining territorial integrity while accommodating Ethiopia's economic interests will require careful balancing. Similarly, Ethiopia must address internal and external pressures as it seeks to enhance its maritime access. Conclusion The historic reconciliation between Somalia and Ethiopia, brokered by Türkiye, represents a triumph of diplomacy and dialogue. By addressing complex issues such as sovereignty and economic cooperation, the Ankara Declaration lays the groundwork for a new era of peace and collaboration in the Horn of Africa. Türkiye's role in facilitating this agreement underscores its growing influence as a mediator in international conflicts. As Somalia and Ethiopia embark on a journey of reconciliation, the agreement holds the promise of transforming the region into a hub of stability and prosperity. This landmark achievement serves as a reminder of the power of diplomacy to bridge divides and build a more cooperative and peaceful world. Through initiatives like these, Türkiye continues to demonstrate its commitment to fostering global stability, reaffirming its role as a bridge-builder in an increasingly fragmented international landscape.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWdkCpp9nW_v5Enc2dE9PTi8	2024-12-12T16:43:59-08:00	
Techville’s Ethics Might Crash As Weaponized Bird-Like Drones Tak...	By Rafael Hernández de Santiago In the futuristic town of Techville, where espresso machines take orders via Bluetooth and trash cans rate your recycling efforts with a passive-aggressive LED glare, the air these days is alive with the hum of drones. But these are not the harmless Unmanned Delivery Vehicles of yore; they are 'UAVs with a mission,' as local tech mogul Ivan Dronev likes to call them — armed, autonomous, and engineered for defense. Yet as residents nervously scan the skies, they wonder: Have the so-called 'protectors' turned from allies to adversaries? It seems like a scene straight out of Alfred Hitchcock’s 'The Birds' — except these birds have heat-seeking capabilities. Techville’s citizens had grown accustomed to smart gadgets and artificial intelligence-driven cars, yet the prospect of autonomous, weaponized drones flying overhead has brought more than a whiff of unease. 'There’s a fine line between convenience and control,' says Marla Thinkworth, a philosopher at the local university. She is known for her motto: Quis custodiet ipsos custodes? Who watches the watchers? As Marla points out, this is not a matter of merely curbing the next-generation Roomba but rather grappling with ethics that Avicenna himself might have pondered. 'Avicenna once said: ‘The imagination is the agent of the soul,’' she notes with a wry smile. 'In Techville, it seems our imaginations have whipped up a world where our ‘agents of the soul’ have sprouted wings and missiles. The question is, do we trust them?' Drones, or 'defense birds,' as locals sarcastically dub them, were introduced to Techville with the promise of enhanced security and 'smart targeting' capabilities. These UAVs are programmed to identify threats, minimize collateral damage, and act only with 'ethical intention' — a vague phrase that does little to clarify exactly where the algorithm draws the line between friend and foe. Dronev assures the community that these machines are equipped with cutting-edge AI algorithms, learning from past engagements to 'become morally sound.' While this all sounds well and good, some Techville sceptics fear that these drones may have a broader mission than merely defending the city. 'The intentions might be ethical, but I wouldn’t want my life on the line over an algorithm’s split-second decision-making,' mutters Fredrick Bolt, a local baker and former tech enthusiast. He points to a recent case in which one of the drones mistook a delivery van for an imminent threat. 'It only baked the van to a crisp, thankfully,' Bolt jokes, his face a blend of humor and concern. 'Lucky the drone’s AI had a bit of mercy in it. Who’s next? My baguettes?' Much like Hitchcock’s bird-flock frenzy, these drones do not strike individually but in swarms. Autonomous and networked, they communicate faster than the human brain can blink, strategizing, re-evaluating, and adapting. This is all in an effort to make their 'defensive' actions more precise and ethical, according to their engineers. But here lies the crux of the issue: Can ethics truly be programmed? The ethical implications are especially troubling when it comes to militarizing AI. 'The ethics of AI in warfare isn’t about making these machines nice,' says Thinkworth, looking up at the drones weaving in formation above the city’s skyline. 'It’s about making them just. But what is justice to a machine?' Techville’s top brass argue that their approach to AI governance, which they call 'Compassionate Targeting,' is the very essence of ethical warfare. They even went so far as to include a philosopher-in-chief among the council that developed the drones’ algorithms. But for every council meeting on 'Ethical Defense Strategies,' there is a sobering counterargument: Is it possible to maintain human dignity in war, or are we simply paving the way for AI-driven chaos? Many in Techville are calling for what they describe as 'ethical resistance' against the unbridled expansion of weaponized drones. They fear the precedent being set here, where the push for enhanced security might lead to an Orwellian landscape of over-surveillance and AI-driven control. 'These drones may not peck at our windows yet,' Bolt quips, 'but they might as well.' A group of Techville citizens recently gathered in the central square sporting signs reading: 'We Have Minds — Machines Have Algorithms' and 'Leave Defense to the Humans.' Among them, Thinkworth waved a placard quoting Aristotle: 'Virtue is the golden mean between two vices, one of excess and the other of deficiency.' It is a profound statement, particularly given that these drones, for all their 'ethics,' lack the ability to temper justice with mercy, or wisdom with restraint. Local activist group Ethics Over Autonomy argues that the responsibility for making decisions that could harm or kill should not be outsourced to an artificial 'ethics engine.' To highlight their concerns, they held an 'AI-Free Day' last week, urging residents to turn off all smart devices. 'It was great,' one resident reports. 'Until I realized I’d forgotten how to make coffee the old-fashioned way.' Thinkworth’s use of Avicenna’s writings to critique the current situation has stirred the academic waters. Avicenna, a Persian polymath and philosopher, wrote about the importance of the human soul’s role in judgment. 'These drones may have calculations,' Thinkworth says, 'but they have no souls. Avicenna warned against knowledge unmoored from ethical responsibility. 'He wrote: ‘The stronger the power of thought, the more dangerous it becomes when guided by no principle other than its own.’ He could have been talking about Techville.' So, are Techville’s 'defense birds' our allies, or are we standing on the brink of a Hitchcockian nightmare? The town’s residents cannot seem to decide. The city’s tech elite assure everyone that the drones will protect, not harm, while local philosophers remind us that 'AI without human oversight is as blind as a drone in a dust storm.' For now, the drones circle and the citizens watch. And much like Hitchcock’s avian allegory, the question remains: What happens when the drones stop circling and start acting? Is there a line we should never have crossed? Rafael Hernández de Santiago, viscount of Espes, is a Spanish national residing in Saudi Arabia and working at the Gulf Research Center. He holds a doctorate in ethics and artificial intelligence, a master’s degree in international relations, and a certificate from the leadership program for public management at IESE.

Georgia And The European Union: What Lies Ahead? – OpEd	In November, Georgian Prime Minister Irakli Kobakhidze announced the ruling Georgian Dream Party's decision to pause all accession talks with the European Union until 2028. This led to widespread public outcry in the small Caucasian nation, drawing support from Georgia's President Salome Zourabichvili. The protests show no signs of slowing down. With a large section of the country's populace out on the streets, the Georgian police have cracked down on the protesters. Countries such as Lithuania have called for wider sanctions against the Georgian PM and various other key figures associated with the Georgian Dream party. That said, why did Georgia suddenly take a U-turn regarding its potential EU membership? Why Did Georgia Pause its EU Accession Talks? It only takes a momentary look to see the underlying logic here. The status quo suits Georgia—it already has visa-free travel access to the EU and certain economic privileges. Anything beyond that can cause more harm than good. The European Union has a stringent list of reforms, particularly those of a legislative nature, and all such requirements might be a bitter pill to swallow for any East European country, Georgia being no exception. Furthermore, the Georgian Dream (GD) party leaders are trying their level best to play a good balancing act with both the West and Russia. Any further accession talks with the EU can upset Russia, which has a vested curiosity in Georgia and takes a keen interest in the fortunes of Georgian billionaire Bidzina Ivanishvili. As a result, when the EU went as far as calling the Georgian elections unfair and borderline partial, it made good sense for the GD and its Prime Minister to hit back: The ill-wishers of our country have turned the European Parliament into a naked weapon of blackmail against Georgia, which is the greatest shame for the European Union. In the last three years, the European Parliament has adopted five resolutions full of lies and insults, which were not shared by the Georgian society, the European Commission, and even the European Council. Of course, the Georgian PM has kept the window open and stated that his country can resume accession talks in the future, 'but only with dignity and justice and without blackmail.' The question is: what does this entail for the European Union? The EU Needs Georgia Indeed, Georgia's decision to give the cold shoulder to the EU does not sit well with Brussels. Siding with the pro-EU protesters, the Union issued a statement: The Georgian people have once again taken to the streets to reaffirm their aspirations for joining the European Union. The EU strongly condemns the violence against peaceful protesters, who are standing firm for their European and democratic future. These actions by the Georgian government have direct consequences on our relationship. But Georgia is just one rung of the ladder. After all, the EU can respond well with sanctions — GD might hope that their allies, such as Hungary's Viktor Orban, can block such moves. Yet, at the end of the day, the EU needs Georgia more than the latter needs the former. Georgia's move could set a bad precedent for the other candidate countries. Most of them have been annoyed by the EU's long list of never-ending requirements. For example, North Macedonia is far from pleased with Brussels's demand that it amend its constitution and, in the process, grant a few concessions to Bulgaria. Similarly, Moldova may follow suit. Despite outwardly trying to join the EU, Serbia is also not very keen on fulfilling the Union's demands of sanctioning Russia, nor does it wish to solve its differences with Kosovo anytime soon. Geopolitics at Play Georgia's decision to pause its EU accession efforts can have far-reaching consequences. This decision can act as a roadblock to the EU's daydreams of eastward expansion. The pundits may offer all the reasons they want, but the hard truth behind the EU's eastward expansion is to keep a check on Russian influence. After all, the Russian invasion of Ukraine acted as a catalyst in boosting the EU accession talks with Ukraine, Moldova, and even Bosnia. Much like Georgia, Russia's dominant influence in Chisinau or elsewhere might not be ideal for the EU. Quite obviously, this has entailed a desire to expand the Union, and the recent news out of Georgia might have sent alarm bells ringing. Conclusion The people of Georgia are still out on the streets, protesting their government's decision. Naturally, this shows a strong desire to join the European Union, at least among the common masses. It can still be attributed to the feeling that the grass is always greener on the other side. A good section of the East European and Caucasian population holds its governments responsible for the various problems the region is facing. This very group strongly advocates EU membership, assuming it to be a step towards forming a possibly 'utopian' society, akin to their perceptions of the Western world. As a result, any measure that deepens the divide between the East and the West will likely be met with a strong wave of protests, and the Georgian case is no exception. That said, Georgia's entry into the EU has been postponed as of now, if not cancelled. It might take some hard thinking and good efforts on the part of both the European Union and the Georgian Dream party to make it work in the near future.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWdkCpp9nW_v5A8K4AmYGLKA	2024-12-12T16:36:27-08:00	
Trump Invites China’s Xi, Other World Leaders To His Inauguration	By Ken Bredemeier U.S. President-elect Donald Trump has invited Chinese President Xi Jinping and other foreign leaders to his January 20 inauguration, but it is not known yet whether any of them plan to attend the ceremony on the steps of the U.S. Capitol. Trump transition spokesperson Karoline Leavitt told Fox News it was yet 'to be determined' whether Xi will accept Trump’s invitation, which was extended in early November, shortly after Trump defeated Vice President Kamala Harris for a new four-year term in the White House. She did not name other world leaders who have been invited. Typically, foreign ambassadors to Washington and other diplomats have witnessed the peaceful quadrennial transfers of U.S. presidential power but not heads of government. State Department records dating to 1874 show that no foreign leader has attended a U.S. presidential inauguration. But Leavitt said the invitations to the noontime outdoor ceremony in six weeks are 'an example of President Trump creating an open dialogue with leaders of countries that are not just our allies but our adversaries and our competitors, too. He is willing to talk to anyone, and he will always put America's interests first.' If Xi travels to Washington, it could provide a first opportunity during Trump’s second presidential term for the leaders of the world’s two biggest economies to discuss contentious trade and military issues. Trump has threatened to impose massive tariffs on Chinese exports to the United States, partly to push Beijing to curb the deadly flow of fentanyl into the U.S. and to boost the sale of U.S. products in China. The U.S. has imposed a January 19 deadline, the eve of the inauguration, for TikTok's Chinese parent company, ByteDance, to sell the social media app or face a ban in the U.S. TikTok is fighting the ban in court; it lost a bid last week to block the ban but is appealing the case to the Supreme Court. Trump on Thursday, during an appearance at the New York Stock Exchange, where he was ringing the bell to open the market, said he's been 'thinking about inviting certain people to the inauguration' without referring to any specific individuals. 'And some people said, 'Wow, that's a little risky, isn't it?'' Trump said. 'And I said, 'Maybe it is. We'll see. We'll see what happens.' But we like to take little chances.' The Kremlin separately on Thursday said President Vladimir Putin, at war with U.S.-supported Ukraine for nearly three years, has not received an inaugural invitation. Since his election victory, Trump has met or talked with several world leaders, including visits with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban and Argentine President Javier Milei, at Mar-a-Lago, Trump’s Florida oceanside retreat. In addition, Trump met with French President Emmanuel Macron, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and Britian’s Prince William in Paris last weekend at the reopening of the refurbished Notre Dame Cathedral, much of which was gutted by a fire five years ago. 'World leaders are lining up to meet with President Trump because they know he will soon return to power and restore peace through American strength around the globe,' Leavitt said.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWdkCpp9nW_v5CvIrF0joNyw	2024-12-12T16:32:11-08:00	
Trump Criticizes Decision To Allow Ukraine To Strike Inside Russi...	(RFE/RL) -- U.S. President-elect Donald Trump has criticized the Biden administration for giving Ukraine permission to strike inside Russia with powerful U.S. missiles, claiming it is intensifying the war. 'I disagree very vehemently with sending missiles hundreds of miles into Russia. Why are we doing that? We're just escalating this war and making it worse. That should not have been allowed to be done,' Trump said in an interview with Time magazine published on December 12. After more than a year of hesitation, the Biden administration last month finally gave Ukraine the green light to strike military assets inside Russia with U.S.-made Army Tactical Missile Systems (ATACMS). The powerful, precision missiles can strike targets as far away as 300 kilometers. The Biden administration justified the decision saying Russia had escalated the conflict by deploying about 11,000 North Korean troops to the front. John Kirby, U.S. national-security spokesman, declined to respond to Trump's comments regarding ATAMCS, saying only that President Joe Biden will continue to support Ukraine until his term ends next month. Kirby announced a new military package for Ukraine without stating its size. Just days after Ukraine fired its first ATACMS into Russia, the Kremlin responded by striking Ukraine with a new, intermediate ballistic missile capable of carrying a nuclear warhead. The use of the intermediate missile was meant to serve as a message to the West, the Kremlin said. Trump did not say whether he would unilaterally withdraw Ukraine's permission to use ATACMS inside Russia upon entering the White House on January 20 or use it as a bargaining chip with the Kremlin. Trump has said he could end the nearly three-year war between Russia and Ukraine in '24 hours,' raising concern he could force Kyiv to cede land currently occupied by Moscow's forces. The United States is Ukraine's largest supplier of weapons, giving Washington significant influence over peace negotiations. When asked if he would throw Ukraine under the bus to get a peace deal, Trump said, 'The only way you're going to reach an agreement is not to abandon.' Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy has demanded Western security commitments to his country be part of any negotiated settlement. Zelenskiy -- and most Ukrainians -- want NATO membership, saying only that will prevent Russia from invading their country again. Trump was not asked about NATO membership for Ukraine but has been critical of the U.S.-led military organization in the past, saying it is a drain on U.S. finances. The United States accounts for about 60 percent of NATO military spending. During a meeting with French President Emmanuel Macron and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy on December 7 in Paris, Trump said he did not back NATO membership for Ukraine, the Wall Street Journal reported.However, Trump did say he wanted European peacekeeping forces to monitor the cease-fire, the paper reported. The United States would support the effort but not with U.S. troops, he told the two leaders, the Wall Street Journal reported. Separately, in a speech on December 12, NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte called on European members of NATO to step up spending, warning the threat emanating from Moscow will not dissipate anytime soon. 'Russia is preparing for long-term confrontation, with Ukraine and with us,' Rutte said in a speech in Brussels. 'We are not ready for what is coming our way in four to five years. It is time to shift to a wartime mindset, and turbocharge our defense production and defense spending.'	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWdkCpp9nW_v5Ec9vuLKzxCG	2024-12-12T16:30:06-08:00	
‘Uplifting’ Gulf Development Model Will Return To US, Eric Trump ...	By Marco Ferrari The mindset in the Gulf region that fosters the development of iconic projects is 'uplifting' and will make its way back to the US under Donald Trump’s next presidency, Eric Trump told Arab News on Thursday. The president-elect’s second son, who serves as executive vice president of the Trump Organization, praised the region for its innovative approach, which he believes defies common misconceptions held by Western nations. During a visit to the Saudi capital following an official launch event in Jeddah for a new Trump Tower, Eric Trump suggested that the Gulf’s no-limits mentality is something that the incoming US president will adopt. 'It’s a different mindset in the Gulf, and that mindset is going to return to America, believe me, in the next four years under my father. But that mindset really, it’s uplifting. It’s almost empowering. It makes you want to come over here and do something really great. And it kind of makes you want to say no to those other countries where it’s just impossible to navigate the political system. They’re just too cumbersome. They’re too lethargic.' Trump went on to explain that Gulf countries actively encourage developers to realize their grand visions, offering not just permits but also support for larger, more ambitious projects. 'They tell you, ‘not only are we going to give you the permits, but we actually want you to make your project bigger. We want you to make it even more iconic. We want you to make it more luxurious. We want you to attract the greatest restaurants and the greatest amenities. Sky’s the limit.’ And that's a beautiful thing for a developer,' he said. He also revealed that the Trump Organization is planning additional projects in Riyadh, though he did not disclose further details. The Trump Organization has lent its branding to several properties across the Gulf region, including a hotel and golf club in Oman, a golf club and tower in Dubai, and most recently, the Jeddah hotel. Trump Tower Jeddah is being developed in partnership with Saudi developer Dar Global, with the two companies having previously collaborated on projects in Oman and Dubai. Praising Saudi Arabia’s safety and political stability, Trump said: 'Obviously, the people in this country love us, love our company, love our brand, love what we stand for. We have so much unbelievable support in this amazing country.' Ziad El Chaar, CEO of Dar Global, told Arab News that the Trump brand is synonymous with success. 'The Trump name is a global brand that people attach to it always a very big sense of success,' he said. 'You can see the projects of Trump; they always feature the best material, the best design, and are really created for a great living experience and customer experience.' Eric Trump’s visit to the Kingdom came after attending a cryptocurrency conference in Abu Dhabi earlier in the week The Trump family has ties to a new cryptocurrency called World Liberty Financial, and Donald Trump has pledged to launch a strategic national crypto stockpile during his second term. Bitcoin’s value surged following Trump's election win in November, and this week it surpassed the $100,000 mark for the first time.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWcrFdrNV3a3TeJLQaPFxyaH	2024-12-12T16:08:25-08:00	
China Charts A Bold Economic Path For 2025 With Policy Recalibrat...	China's leadership signaled a decisive shift toward bolstering economic growth and safeguarding stability in 2025, with key pledges for an expansive fiscal strategy and a moderately accommodative monetary policy. Meeting on December 9, chaired by President Xi Jinping, the the Political Bureau of the Communist Party of China (CPC) Central Committee outlined its economic and governance priorities. In a landscape fraught with global uncertainty, analysts see this as a calibrated response to stabilize the world's second-largest economy. The policymakers underscored the need for robust macroeconomic measures to stimulate domestic consumption and drive technological innovation. Their strategy also included stabilizing critical sectors like real estate and financial markets, reflecting a commitment to averting risks and mitigating external shocks. Apparently, China's resolve goes beyond traditional frameworks, with promises to expand its policy arsenal, enhance countercyclical tools, and pursue better coordination among various policy levers. By sharpening the focus on targeted, forward-looking regulation, Beijing is seeking not just to recover but to invigorate its economic engine, ensuring resilience and vitality. This agenda also intertwines with a broader anticorruption campaign, suggesting an integrated approach to governance and economic management. As China enters a critical phase of recalibration, the message is clear: the leadership intends to harness every available instrument to fortify its domestic economic base and navigate an increasingly complex international environment. China's pivot toward a 'moderately loose monetary policy,' its first such shift in over a decade, signals a bold recalibration aimed at steering the economy through mounting challenges. With potential rate cuts and reduced reserve requirements by the People's Bank of China, Beijing seems prepared to unleash a suite of measures to reinvigorate growth in 2025. Alongside this, a more assertive fiscal policy hints at prioritizing consumer spending and a recalibration of the beleaguered real estate sector. At the heart of this strategy lies a reaffirmation of the twin pillars of consumption and investment efficiency. Policymakers emphasized the urgency of broadening domestic demand, a move designed not merely to stabilize but to transform the economy into a more dynamic engine of growth. This transformation hinges, critically, on leveraging scientific and technological innovation to drive new productive capacities and cultivate a modern industrial framework. Yet the rhetoric of ambition does not stop there. China's leadership is emphasizing the importance of structural reforms and drastic measures to address entrenched inefficiencies in the economic system. These commitments reflect an acknowledgment that the road to resilience and modernization demands nothing less than a comprehensive overhaul, aimed at reshaping the economic landscape for a precarious global future. China's economy appears to be regaining its footing, showing a steady, if cautious, recovery after months of wide-reaching stimulus efforts from Beijing. The manufacturing sector's official purchasing managers index edged up to 50.3 in November from 50.1 in October, marking its highest point in seven months and remaining safely above the expansion threshold. For a nation grappling with economic headwinds, these incremental gains signal a fragile but noteworthy rebound. The central plank of Beijing's strategy lies on high-level economic openness. Policymakers are doubling down on stabilizing foreign trade and investment flows, recognizing their importance in driving sustained growth. This isn't just about maintaining appearances on the global stage - it's a pragmatic bid to keep the wheels of an export-driven economy turning. Yet, the ambitions don't stop at macroeconomics. The Chinese leadership is also stressing the necessity of strong regional strategies, looking to unlock untapped potential across diverse provinces. Simultaneously, a green agenda is taking center stage, with promises to balance carbon reduction, pollution control, and environmental expansion. China, it seems, is betting on a multipronged approach: steadying its domestic economy while projecting an image of progressiveness. Whether this balancing act succeeds remains to be seen, but the effort is unmistakable. China is leaning into a narrative of resilience and optimism as it charts the course for its economy in 2025. At a December 9 meeting, President Xi Jinping underscored the critical importance of bolstering public confidence, painting a picture of an economy buoyed by untapped potential and inherent resilience. His message was clear: while challenges persist, the fundamental drivers of growth and the economy's long-term trajectory is firmly intact. This meeting, held days after a symposium that sought input from non-CPC voices, revealed the Party's intent to project inclusivity and pragmatism in shaping its economic strategy. The leadership pledged to scale up efforts aimed at improving public well-being, emphasizing a commitment to fostering a stronger sense of gain, happiness, and security among the population. Xi's remarks carried an unmistakable urgency, calling for collective effort from the Party and society at large to achieve the year's ambitious economic targets. The vision he outlined wasn't just about steadying the ship—it was a rallying cry for renewal, resilience, and hard work. For China, managing the complexities of global turbulence and domestic pressures, this is a high-stakes bid to reaffirm stability and inspire a shared sense of purpose. China appears poised to embrace unconventional monetary strategies to navigate the mounting uncertainties of 2025, signaling a bold shift in its economic playbook. Observers speculate that measures such as substantial central bank purchases of government bonds and sharper cuts to interest rates and banks' reserve requirements could form the backbone of this recalibrated approach. These steps align with policymakers' growing resolve to inject potency into fiscal and monetary policy, warding off the specter of a sharp economic downturn. The stakes are high. Strengthening fiscal stimulus is seen as pivotal for offsetting external pressures, including persistent tariff threats from the United States. Experts predict trillions of yuan in additional central government debt may be required to address housing market imbalances and expand social protections. Analysts also foresee cumulative interest rate cuts ranging from 30 to 40 basis points in 2025, with market-driven lending benchmarks potentially witnessing steeper declines. Notably, the December 9 meeting introduced the term 'unconventional countercyclical adjustments' to China's policy lexicon, hinting at a coordinated effort to integrate monetary and fiscal strategies beyond traditional levers like rate cuts. This proactive posture suggests Beijing's determination to maintain GDP growth at around 5%, steering its economy through global turbulence with a mix of innovation and pragmatism.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWctSEBx9NslkUP4yrQaDPjO	2024-12-12T09:42:25-08:00	
The Adani Factor In India-Sri Lanka Relations – Analysis	Days before Sri Lankan President Anura Kumara Dissanayake's visit to India, a group of professionals and university dons have asked him to cancel Gautam Adani's wind power projects in the country in fulfilment of his election promise to 'safeguard Sri Lanka's energy sovereignty'. Dissanayake will be on a visit to India from December 15 to 17, his first as President. The visit is crucial for both Sri Lanka and India as Adani's ambitious project proposals have run into public opposition in the island nation. Those who oppose the projects, especially the Mannar wind power project, expect the President to take up the issue with Indian leaders. But the million-dollar question is: Would Dissanayake be able to face the might of India and the clout of Adani? In a strongly-worded Open Letter released to the media on Wednesday, the professionals said that Adani's wind power project in Mannar island in North West Sri Lanka should be cancelled on environmental, financial and national sovereignty grounds. As per the Open Letter, in March 2022 the then Lankan cabinet had decided to award a tender of the value of US$ 2,600 million to Adani Green Energy without competitive bidding. The power purchase rate was fixed at US cents 8.26 per kWh for 20 years. This controversial decision was kept concealed for two years. The then Lankan government had agreed to buy power at US cents 8.26 per kWh, whereas the purchase price for a kWh unit offered by local companies generated from much smaller wind power projects was half that price. Significantly, even Adani Green Energy's Application for 'Approval of an Investment' dated 18.01.2022 submitted to the Board of Investment, had quoted the price as US cents 6.50 per kWh, which was much lower than what the Cabinet of Ministers had approved. The letter points out that Saudi Arabia has signed an agreement with a Japanese consortium to purchase wind power at a cost of US cents 1.56558 per kWh unit, while a second agreement was reached at the price of US cents 1.70187 per kWh. 'A comparison of these global prices with the price offered by the Adani Green Energy to Sri Lanka, US cents 8.26, leaves no room for doubt of the disingenuous nature of the project and possible corruption involved,' the letter said. Lopsided Agreement The letter said that the agreement was one sided. Documents submitted by different Sri Lankan government agencies in the court cases filed against the contract, clearly pointed to a 'shockingly one-sided economic benefit to Adani Green Energy from the proposed project and at a severe disadvantage to Sri Lanka'. As per the 2022 cabinet decision, all imports, including the wind turbines and all other material required for building the wind farm will be exempt from applicable taxes such as import duty, VAT etc. The Lankan government will be required to develop the transmission evacuation infrastructure at its own cost, or pay Adani Green Energy the cost of such development. The earnings of Adani Green Energy from the wind farm will be fully exempt from Income Tax. The government will be required to provide the 'Adani Green Energy' security for the above payments under the Power Purchase Agreement (PPA), with an International Letter of Credit duly backed by a Sovereign Guarantee of the Government of Sri Lanka. Adani Green Energy will be free to repatriate such tax-free earnings generated in Sri Lanka back to India without any exchange control constrains or any tax deductions. 'In essence, the Government of Sri Lanka will not generate any income for itself from Adani Green Energy's commercial activity in Sri Lanka,' the letter said. Environmental Concerns The chosen location for the project, the Mannar Island, is another critical issue. The citizens' letter says that the wind farm will be located in an environmentally and ecologically 'highly sensitive area of global significance.' The Environment Impact Assessment (EIA) report had identified three other locations – 'Kalpitiya Peninsula', 'Ambewela Cattle Farm' and the South East Coast as being more suitable locations for building and operation of a windfarm, over and above the Mannar Island. However, most shockingly, the EIA itself arbitrarily made a completely different final decision, recommending Mannar Island, without any factual evidence, the citizens' letter said. 'Thus, the irresistible inference is that Mannar Island has been selected notwithstanding the grave and irreparable damage it will cause to Sri Lanka, singularly due to its proximity to India, as opposed to the other more suitable locations,' the letter alleged. Migratory Bird Corridor The project site is positioned within one of the most important migratory bird corridors of a major global flyway, recognized by the United Nations Convention of Migratory Species (CMS) (to which Sri Lanka is a signatory), known as the 'Central Asian Flyway (CAF)'. The Mannar island is one of the main entry and exit points for Sri Lanka to the 'Central Asian Flyway', through which over 15 million migratory birds of 250 species fly annually. Mannar Island and other islands on the Gulf of Mannar have been identified by both local and international scientists and experts as a Key Biodiversity Area, as well as a globally Critical Site for water birds. It is also the most important seabird breeding site in Sri Lanka, many of which are listed as globally critically endangered in the National Red List of Threatened Species of the Government of Sri Lanka and the International Union for Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources (IUCN). The region harbours more than 200,000 water birds during the migration season that spans from September to April, and 72,000 birds fly in a single day, which includes the rarest species of birds recorded in Sri Lanka as well globally. The Project site is also encircled by three Protected Areas – the Adam's Bridge Marine National Park, the Vidataltivu Nature Reserve, and the Vankalai Sanctuary (a RAMSAR site), which are protected sites that fall under the purview of the Department of Wildlife & Conservation (DWC), and all these nature reservations are of vital importance to the biodiversity of the country, and are protected sites under the Fauna and Flora Protection Ordinance. In addition, there are three reserved forests belonging to and protected by the Forest Department namely, Thirukeshwaran Mangrove Forest, Palakaimunai Reserved Forest and Widithalativu Reserved Forest which harbour an extensive population of birds and other biodiversity. Giant Turbines The proposed Mannar Wind Power Project (Phase-II) will comprise a staggering 52 wind turbines (140 meters in height with the diameter of the rotor blades extending to 160 meters), placed in parallel with the existing Thambapawani wind farm (Phase I), which comprise of 30 wind turbines. There is a further proposed extension, which will be established in Pooneryn (Phase III), comprising of a further 21 wind turbines, spreading across the entire width of the Mannar Island (about 5km), that is an area of 15,000 acres covering about 60 km2 area, which is about 40% of the total land mass of the Mannar Island. 'If all three phases are implemented, the Mannar Island will be completely covered with 103 wind turbines, spreading right across the entire width of the Mannar Island, which will irreversibly change the topography of the island and irreparably destroy the Avians and other biodiversity thereof,' the citizens' letter said. Energy Sovereignty According to the EIA report, the Mannar wind power project will control 'around 6%' of the annual energy requirement of the country. This, the citizen's letter said, would severely compromise the 'Energy Sovereignty' of Sri Lanka. 'The said documents also show that Adani Green Energy will also build a further 5 GW wind power plant in the north Sri Lanka to generate electricity and export to India. In addition, there is a further intention to establish a 'floating solar and wind facilities in the territorial waters of Sri Lanka, bordering northern province'. The citizens' letter said that the 'Adani Group aims to create a monopoly in the Mannar North Wind Production in their favour, and their bid, planned capital investment and pricing are developed to support towards such intent being delivered.' 'The Public Utility Commission of Sri Lanka (PUCSL) has strongly opposed the deal,' the letter pointed out. Seabed Exploration The letter drew attention to the Adani Group's proposal for 'sea bed exploration in Sri Lankan waters' in the Mannar sea basin for valuable minerals in Sri Lanka's Ocean bed. In addition to the above, there is also a proposal to build a bridge connecting India to the Mannar Islands across the 'Adams Bridge' in addition an 'Energy Highway' between the two countries. 'Thus, it cannot be overstated that the implementation of the above proposed projects, will place the North and North-Western territory of Sri Lanka and the adjacent territorial seas belonging to Sri Lanka, under the control of India, which will severely compromise not only the Energy Sovereignty of Sri Lanka, but most alarmingly the territorial integrity of the country,' the citizens' letter warned. Public Opposition Large numbers of citizens of Sri Lanka, including organizations and most importantly the rural communities living in the area, and the fishing communities have 'protested, pleaded and railed against the proposed wind power project during the former Government's regime to no avail,' the letter said. 'The indecent haste with which the former Government has pursued the proposed Project is fully reflected by the quick acquisition of private lands in the area for the proposed Project, even before the EIA was published, and in complete disregard of the objections of the people affected by the process.' A number of individuals and organizations filed public interest litigations challenging the proposed project in the Supreme Court. The said cases are presently pending before the Court. An Election Pledge The letter to the President said that he should implement his election promise to cancel the project. 'Excellency, your citizens have elected you and given you the mandate to implement your manifesto. So, we respectfully ask you to honour that promise and not to proceed with the 'Adani' wind power project in Mannar,' the letter said.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWctSEBx9NslkVrQ2-VTwGRy	2024-12-12T09:41:41-08:00	
Why Trump’s ‘Maximum Pressure’ Won’t Work On Iran This Time – Ana...	Donald Trump is back, and so is the 'maximum pressure' campaign against Iran to 'drastically throttle' Tehran’s oil sales. But 2025 is not 2018. Although Iran was on the ropes then, things are different now. America’s support for Israel’s campaigns against the Palestinian and Lebanese people has eroded local support for U.S. moves, as many Middle East capitals are doubtful about 'maximum pressure' and feel it will increase regional tensions. Saudi Arabia and Iran are drawing closer since 2023, when they agreed to resume ties. The Saudi crown prince recently spoke to Iran’s new president. Their military chiefs held defense talks last month, and the countries are increasing economic ties. The presidents of the United Arab Emirates and Iran held their first face-to-face talks in October, and UAE-Iran trade is on the upswing. In addition, Qatar (which shares a natural gas field with Iran) and Iran are trying to broaden their economic ties. The oil market has changed since 2018 as well. According to Argus Media, Iran’s oil exports, which were below 500,000 barrels per day through the second half of 2019 and 2020 due to Trump-era sanctions, began increasing in 2021 and have increased every year since. Iran has expanded its network to bypass sanctions, and has expanded its tanker fleet — so if the U.S. again sanctions Iran, it will find the remaining buyers are 'those who do not necessarily fear sanctions.' After his election, President Masoud Pezeshkian announced his program in 'My Message to the New World' and declared his intent to strengthen relations with Iran’s neighbors. He emphasized the need for a 'strong region,' said he hoped for 'constructive dialogue' with Europe, criticized the Obama administration’s nuclear deal with Iran, and urged Washington 'come to terms with reality.' In October, then-candidate Trump declared, 'I would like to see Iran be very successful. The only thing is, they can’t have a nuclear weapon.' His running mate, JD Vance, agreed: 'Our interest very much is in not going to war with Iran,' he said. 'It would be a huge distraction of resources. It would be massively expensive to our country.' These are hopeful signs of a desire to reach a negotiated solution, but the U.S. has a habit of abandoning inconvenient commitments, such as its first nuclear deal with Iran. Iran’s stronger relations with Russia and China have also added to its resilience. In March 2021, China and Iran signed a 25-year Comprehensive Strategic Partnership agreement that enhances bilateral relations and includes $400 billion investments in Iran’s oil, gas, petrochemicals, transportation and manufacturing sectors. In return, China will receive a steady and discounted supply of Iranian oil. Russia has supplied Iran with Su-35 fighter jets, Mi-28 attack helicopters and Yak-130 pilot training aircraft; Iran has sent Russia drones and ballistic missiles. Non-military trade is also increasing. The Moscow Times reports, 'Russian exports to Iran rose 27% last year, and Russian imports from Iran increased 10%. Both sides have agreed to scale up trade in currencies other than the U.S. dollar, while Russia has pledged to invest an unprecedented $40 billion in Iran’s oil and gas sector.' Despite its economic problems, Iran increased its military budget. It is signaling it is willing to negotiate with the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) — but not 'under pressure.' Iran’s foreign minister, Abbas Araqchi, clarified that when he told state television, 'There is still an opportunity for diplomacy, although this opportunity is not much. It is a limited opportunity.' In November, the IAEA reported Iran was implementing measures 'aimed at stopping the increase of its stockpile [of near bomb-grade uranium]' though IAEA also noted Iran increased its inventory of 60 percent enriched uranium by 60 percent since August 2024. But the IAEA board is determined to test Tehran’s patience as, two days after the IAEA report, it passed a resolution censuring Iran for insufficient cooperation with the agency. Iran’s President Pezeshkian says he is open to U.S. engagement: 'Whether we like it or not, we will face the United States in regional and international arenas, and it’s better that we manage this arena ourselves.' Shargh, the reformist daily newspaper, editorialized that Pezeshkian must 'avoid past mistakes and assume a pragmatic and multidimensional policy,' though others are skeptical anything will change under Trump. Trump ally Elon Musk reportedly met Iran’s permanent representative to the United Nations in November, and addressed 'how to defuse tensions between the two countries.' The meeting would not have happened without Trump’s approval. Trump will not want to start a war with Iran, as he will be sensitive to the impact on the U.S. economy, so sanctions (and the occasional Israeli attack) may be his only options. If so, and if Iran’s economy and oil export scheme is resilient enough, and Russia and China remain constant, we may be looking at years of low-level conflict, to the delight of the American and Israeli hard-liners. Each side lacks empathy for the other — the result of years of successful propagandizing. All the while, the hard-liners in each capital see conflict as key to their continued influence, and reap economic rewards from the status quo. There is a deadline for negotiations with Iran: Oct. 18, 2025, sees the end of the sanctions snapback mechanism, 'the last opportunity for world powers to return to all the sanctions that were lifted in the [Iran nuclear] agreement.' If the U.S. wants to expand a new nuclear deal to include ballistic missiles or Iran’s foreign policy, Iran may suggest similar limits on other countries in the region, and then demand the deal be a treaty to bind future U.S. administrations. The American political class and its media acolytes have only one strategy — more sanctions — and are ill-equipped for peaceable dealings with Iran. If both sides are realistic, throttle the hard-liners, and Iran offers Trump a deal he feels only he could have made, we may see peace, stability and more economic opportunity for the youth of the Middle East. 'Maximum pressure' is a slogan, not a strategy. If Iran says 'yes,' what will Washington do?

Emissions Fall In Hard-To-Abate Sectors But Still Off Track To Re...	The World Economic Forum's latest Net Zero Industry Tracker reveals progress in reducing emissions across eight hard-to-abate sectors – steel, aluminium, cement, primary chemicals, oil and gas, aviation, shipping and trucking. Together, these critical industries, which play a crucial role in the global economy, achieved a 0.9% reduction in absolute emissions from 2022 to 2023, while global energy-related emissions rose by 1.3% in the same period. However, progress remains far behind the pace to meet net-zero targets. The report finds that an additional $30 trillion in investments is required by 2050 – underscoring the scale of the challenge ahead. This includes $13 trillion of direct funding from the industries and $17 trillion from the wider ecosystem such as energy suppliers to these industries. Encouragingly, nearly half of the required greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) reductions can be achieved with commercially viable technologies already available, as per the new research. The report also found that emissions intensity – or the average emissions per production unit – has declined 4.1% over the past five years, highlighting the impact of existing solutions. Intensified cross-sector collaboration, faster deployment of clean-energy infrastructure - in particular renewable electricity - and stronger policymaking will be crucial to advance these efforts and unlock the transformative potential of emerging technologies. The Net Zero Industry Tracker 2024, produced in collaboration with Accenture, assesses the state of energy transition efforts and the future trajectory of the eight hard-to-abate sectors, which account for 40% of global greenhouse gas emissions. It examines key barriers to meeting net-zero goals and presents actionable pathways to accelerate progress, including a comprehensive readiness framework around related technologies, investment strategies, and policies. 'While there is a long way to go, it is encouraging to see that hard-to-abate sectors are making strides in emissions reductions, indicating that they are investing in the energy transition,' said Roberto Bocca, Head of the Centre for Energy and Materials, World Economic Forum. 'Achieving net zero by 2050 will require unprecedented collaboration and financial innovation across sectors to raise the capital needed. However, we already possess many of the technologies and policy frameworks to act now.' Despite increased output, the combined 0.9% reduction in emissions the eight sectors managed between 2022 and 2023 is a significant improvement compared to the increase of overall emissions globally in the same period. Moreover, while overall demand across the eight hard-to-abate sectors increased at an average of 9.2% between 2019 and 2023, total emissions and emissions intensity declined, showing that emissions reductions have been driven by improved efficiency and decarbonization efforts rather than reduced output. Indeed, five out of the eight hard-to-abate sectors (aluminium, cement, chemicals, aviation and trucking) reduced their emission intensity, driven by factors such as increased use of low-carbon power, reduced coal consumption, greater energy efficiency and more recycled metals. The report highlights key barriers to reducing emissions in these sectors, including high interest rates, political uncertainties, trade restrictions and limited availability of new clean-energy technologies. Significant investments must also focus on developing infrastructure for low-carbon power, hydrogen, and carbon capture, utilization and storage. While infrastructure development for low-carbon power has been encouraging, hydrogen and CCUS infrastructure currently address less than 1% of sector requirements. New this year, the Tracker highlights the potential of generative AI to accelerate the decarbonization of hard-to-abate sectors. By enhancing productivity, streamlining operations and optimizing energy use, generative AI could improve capital efficiency by 5-7%, reducing net-zero investment needs by up to $2 trillion. Beyond cost savings, AI offers tools for asset management, R&D acceleration and transparency through product-level carbon reporting. However, the widespread adoption of AI could also significantly increase electricity demand, raising concerns about competition for limited low-carbon energy resources. 'Heavy industries hold the key to global decarbonization goals, with AI demonstrating real potential in helping meet the challenge of net zero,' said Muqsit Ashraf, Group Chief Executive for Accenture Strategy. 'Leaders who harness the productivity potential and economic value of generative AI will be on a reinvention-ready path—one that helps avoid expanding emissions and makes good on the promise of AI as a critical lever for decarbonization.' Espen Mehlum, Head of Energy Transition Intelligence, World Economic Forum, added: 'A system approach is needed to simultaneously solve several challenges associated with scaling up clean-energy technologies and infrastructure important in the hard-to-abate sectors. Policymakers can accelerate developments by creating incentives aligned with the goals of the hard-to-abate sectors, energy suppliers and consumers to benefit everyone involved.'	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWctSEBx9NslkQLaPCXiUbt3	2024-12-12T09:38:16-08:00	
Tibetans Coming To India Reduced To A Trickle – OpEd	The annual flow of ethnic Tibetans entering India has dropped sharply due to strong border controls by the Chinese and stiff surveillance in the Tibet Autonomous Region (TAR) bolstered by modern technology. Experts say this may even have an adverse bearing on the future of the Tibetan government-in-exile based in Dharamsala in Himachal Pradesh. Only 15 Tibetans arrived in Dharamsala in 2023 and exile government officials say the number would be around the same this year. Central Tibetan Administration (CTA) officials say the arrival of Tibetans has dropped sharply since 2008. According to CTA officials, in 2021, only four Tibetans arrived in Dharamshala while five had arrived a year ago. The numbers went up slightly with 10 arrivals in 2022 and 15 in 2023. In the 1980-90s, between 2,500 to 3,500 Tibetans used to cross into India via Nepal. But that changed after 2008, the year Beijing hosted the Olympic Games and Tibet erupted in furious protests as angry citizens sought to draw international attention to 'Chinese repression'. Chinese authorities suspected that the protests in TAR during the 2008 Beijing Olympics were inspired by some Tibetans who returned from India and were close to the exile government. The Chinese border guards heavily tightened the Tibet-Nepal borders and started paying Nepalese border guards to stop Tibetans escaping Tibet. Since 2010, the number of Tibetans escaping Tibet drastically fell from 3,500 a year before the uprising to just 20 to 30,' says Tibetan writer-activist Tenzim Tsundue, who has been frequently arrested in India for anti-China activism that Delhi seeks to curb. He says since the Maoist government took charge in Nepal, it has become very difficult for Tibetans to cross into that country. Other CTA officials say the Chinese have intensified checks on all Tibetans, making it mandatory for now for them to report departure and arrival every time they travel anywhere outside their regular place of residence in Tibet or neighbouring Chinese provinces. 'Many passports have been revoked, ID cards, including ration cards, mobile numbers, and bank accounts, are rolled into one number with DNA details. With such a sophisticated mechanism of control, China has turned Tibet into a police state,' says writer Tsundue. The Chinese started intensifying their border controls since 2005. In October 2006, Chinese border guards opened fire on a group of 70 Tibetan refugees climbing the snow-covered Nangpa Pass en route to Nepal. Beijing claimed the border guards were acting in self-defense, but a video filmed by a Romanian mountaineer showed the Tibetans were unarmed and running away when they were fired upon by the Chinese border guards. A 17-year-old nun, Kelsang Namtso, died in the snow, while 23-year-old Kunsang Namgyal, hit by two bullets, died later, For those seeking to escape Tibet have found it ever more perilous in the post-2008 era, when Beijing intensified its mass surveillance programs and placed severe restrictions on Tibetans' internal mobility, says Ruby Mukherjee, convenor of the 'Save Tibet' campaign in India and an advocate in the Kolkata high court. China's increased controls over Tibetans' movement within the country and over the Tibet-Nepal border has made it almost impossible for Tibetans to reach India. The number of new arrivals dropped to around 400 per year between 2010-14 but now with tougher restrictions since President Xi Jinping took charge, the Tibetan arrivals into India are at an all-time low, never going past 20 annually. CTA spokesperson Tenzin Lekshay claims that after the massive Tibetan uprising in 2008, China has successfully imposed a news blockade to prevent information about Tibet from reaching the outside world. 'They use paid Western Youtubers to paint a rosy all-is-well picture about Tibet but reality is severe visa restrictions on foreigners trying to visit Tibet,' he said. 'China has much to hide.' China denies all charges of repression in Tibet and blames the 'separatist and splittist clique of Dalai Lama' for the false global propaganda. Chinese officials say Tibet has developed enormously since the Chinese Communist Party liberated Tibetans from 'feudal servitude'. Unlike Tibetan hardliners who seek independence, the Dalai Lama has sought negotiations with China to secure extensive provincial autonomy, unsuccessfully so far. Besides China's tightening of Tibet's southwestern borders since the mid-2000s to stem the flow of Tibetan refugees into Nepal and India, the emigration of Tibetan refugees from the Indian subcontinent to the West beginning in the 1990s, and a general decline in the birth rates of exiled Tibetans has brought down the number of Tibetans in India. From a peak of 1.5 lakhs in the 1990s, the number has dropped to below 90,00 . Experts say this has long-term implications. A study by Tenzim Dorjee and Tsewang Rinzim in the journal www.migrationpolicy.org observes: 'The demographic decline of South Asia's Tibetan community poses a threat to the future viability of the government-in-exile—the sole democratic voice representing the Tibetan people both inside and outside Tibet—as well as its institutions and civil-society organizations. 'If this trend continues, it could imperil the Tibetan monastic universities in South India dedicated to safeguarding Indo-Tibetan knowledge systems as well as hundreds of health and education facilities serving tens of thousands of Tibetans and others across India.' With the 14th Dalai Lama already 89 and his succession still caught up in huge uncertainties amidst reports that Beijing may like to put up its own choice, the very distinct Tibetan identity stands imperiled.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWctSEBx9NslkfhBwoJEp7KJ	2024-12-12T09:36:49-08:00	
APS Terrorist Attack: A National Tragedy And A Beacon Of Resilien...	The terrorist attack on Army Public School (APS) Peshawar on December 16, 2014, is etched as one of the darkest chapters in Pakistan's history. On this tragic day, 134 students aged 12 to 18, along with teachers and the principal, were mercilessly martyred by Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) operatives. This heinous crime, meticulously planned and funded under the direction of hostile intelligence agencies, exposed the depths of barbarity to which these perpetrators could stoop. As the nation approaches the 10th anniversary of this tragic event, December 16, 2024, will serve as a solemn occasion to honor the martyrs, stand with their families, and reaffirm Pakistan's resolve to eliminate terrorism in all its forms. The APS attack is not just a painful memory; it is a collective wound for Pakistan. The nation salutes the martyrs who lost their lives in this brutal act of terrorism. Their sacrifice stands as a symbol of resilience and unity for the entire country. The families of the martyrs carry an immeasurable burden of grief, and the people of Pakistan stand in unwavering solidarity with them. Though the pain of this incident can never be erased, the determination to defeat the forces of chaos remains steadfast. The bravery of the teachers and students who faced unimaginable horror has become a rallying point for the nation. Their stories of courage, defiance, and sacrifice serve as a reminder that the spirit of Pakistan will never bow to terrorism. December 16 not only commemorates the martyrs but also strengthens the nation’s resolve to eradicate terrorism. The Pakistani state, its armed forces, and law enforcement agencies (LEAs) have demonstrated unyielding commitment to fighting terrorism. The National Action Plan (NAP), devised in the aftermath of the APS attack, reflects a comprehensive strategy to counter terrorism and extremism. While its complete implementation remains a work in progress, the government and security forces are relentless in their pursuit of this goal. Recent successes against terrorism underscore this determination. In November 2024 alone, 47 terrorists were eliminated during intelligence-based operations (IBOs). These ongoing efforts showcase Pakistan’s zero-tolerance policy toward terrorism and its commitment to protecting its citizens. The sacrifices of the APS martyrs inspire the nation to continue this fight, ensuring that such atrocities are never repeated. The TTP's involvement in the APS attack highlights their brutality and distorted ideology. Misusing the name of Islam, the TTP spreads chaos and hatred, tarnishing the image of the religion through their inhuman and un-Islamic actions. Their barbarity knows no bounds, as evidenced by their willingness to target innocent children in pursuit of their nefarious agendas. Islamic scholars in Pakistan and across the globe have categorically condemned the TTP's actions. The Paigham-e-Pakistan Fatwa has declared terrorism and armed struggle as unequivocally haram (forbidden). This religious decree further isolates the TTP, exposing their ideology as a perversion of Islam’s teachings. The APS attack was masterminded by TTP leaders such as Mullah Fazal Ullah, Gul Zaman Orakzai, Omar Narai, and Muhammad Khurasani, who coordinated with handlers from Indian and Afghan intelligence agencies. These perpetrators have since been neutralized by Pakistan’s security forces, but their actions continue to be a stark reminder of the TTP’s nexus with hostile foreign entities. The APS attack was not an isolated incident; it was part of a broader conspiracy orchestrated by the TTP with the backing of foreign intelligence agencies such as India’s RAW and Afghanistan’s NDS. Evidence gathered from the attack revealed direct communication between TTP operatives and their handlers in Afghanistan. India’s involvement in funding and merging militant factions under the TTP umbrella further underscores their role in destabilizing Pakistan. Pakistan has consistently raised these concerns on international platforms, providing detailed dossiers on Indian-sponsored terrorism. Despite the challenges, the nation’s armed forces and intelligence agencies remain vigilant, dismantling networks and eliminating threats to ensure the safety and security of Pakistan. As the 10th anniversary of the APS tragedy approaches, it is essential to reflect on the lessons learned and the progress made in combating terrorism. The sacrifices of the APS martyrs have not been in vain. They have united the nation in its resolve to root out extremism and build a future free from fear. The state has taken decisive actions to address both internal and external threats. Crackdowns on illegal elements, coordinated efforts to implement the NAP, and relentless operations against terrorists demonstrate Pakistan’s commitment to ensuring peace and stability. On this solemn occasion, Pakistan sends a clear message to its enemies: the nation stands united against terrorism. The sacrifices of the APS martyrs are a beacon of resilience, reminding the world of Pakistan’s determination to overcome adversity. The people and armed forces of Pakistan renew their pledge to uproot terrorism and ensure that the enemies of humanity find no safe haven in the country. The memory of December 16, 2014, will forever remain a reminder of the price of freedom and the unbreakable spirit of the Pakistani nation. By honoring the martyrs and standing with their families, Pakistan reaffirms its commitment to a future free from the curse of terrorism.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWctSEBx9NslkWZUeETBuXim	2024-12-12T09:35:40-08:00	
Pentagon Says Missile Defense Agency Conducts Successful Missile ...	By Matthew Olay The Missile Defense Agency, on Tuesday, conducted a live intercept of a ballistic missile target from Guam, the Pentagon has announced. Partnering with U.S. Indo-Pacific Command and other Defense Department partners, MDA's Guam test represented the first ballistic missile defense test executed from that U.S. territory, Deputy Pentagon Press Secretary Sabrina Singh told the media. 'During the test, the Aegis Guam System intercepted an air-launched medium range ballistic missile targeted off the coast of Guam,' Singh said. The test entailed the Aegis Guam System integrating with a specialized radar and vertical launching system. That integrated system fired a Standard Missile-3 Block IIA, which intercepted an air-launched medium range ballistic missile target off the coast of Guam's Andersen Air Force Base, according to an MDA press release. 'The event marked a pivotal step taken in the defense of Guam and provides critical support to the overall concept for the future Guam defense systems,' Singh said. The test, which MDA designated as Flight Experiment Mission-02, supported 'the overall concept, requirements validation, data-gathering and model maturation for the future Guam Defense System,' according to the release. 'This is a tremendous group effort and provides a glimpse of how organizations within the [department] have come together to defend our homeland Guam now and, in the future,' MDA Director, Air Force Lt. Gen. Heath Collins, is quoted in the release. 'Collectively,' the quote continues, 'we will use this to build upon and validate joint tracking architecture and integrated air and missile defense capabilities for Guam. Thanks to all of those involved, especially the people and government of Guam.' 'Today's flight test is a critical milestone in the defense of Guam and the region,' Commander, Joint Task Force-Micronesia Navy Rear Adm. Greg Huffman, is quoted in the release. 'It confirmed our ability to detect, track and engage a target missile in flight, increasing our readiness to defend against evolving adversary threats. The event's success is a testament to the incredible work of the team both within the DOD and the government of Guam,' he added. Originally proposed by MDA in early June, the flight test underwent an extensive environmental assessment/overseas environmental assessment before being approved. MDA's proposed action going forward is to conduct up to two flight tests or tracking exercises, per year, over the next 10 years, according to MDA's website.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWctSEBx9Nslkbo9nDtGbizL	2024-12-12T09:33:31-08:00	
Bulgaria And Romania Join Schengen Area: A Milestone For European...	On Thursday, the European Union officially approved the accession of Bulgaria and Romania to the Schengen Area, granting full membership effective January 1, 2025. This landmark decision marks a significant step forward for both nations and the broader EU, reinforcing the principle of free movement across the continent. 'This is a great victory for Bulgaria, Romania, and all of Europe,' proclaimed the Hungarian Presidency of the EU Council in a celebratory statement. The decision was hailed as a 'historic moment,' underscoring its importance in strengthening European integration. A Milestone Achievement The Hungarian Presidency emphasized that removing internal land border checks for Bulgaria and Romania had been a top priority throughout its tenure. 'Today, we have made it a reality,' the presidency noted, highlighting the broader benefits of this move. This milestone not only represents a significant achievement for the citizens of Bulgaria and Romania but also brings tangible advantages to the EU as a whole. The inclusion of these two nations will enhance the efficiency of border management, promote economic growth, and foster greater unity within the bloc. Schengen's Expanding Horizon With the addition of Bulgaria and Romania, the Schengen Area now encompasses 29 countries. It includes 25 EU member states, along with non-EU nations Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway, and Switzerland. Together, these countries form the largest free travel area in the world, home to approximately 420 million people. The Schengen Area operates on the principle of open borders, allowing the free movement of people without internal checks. This facilitates seamless travel, trade, and cooperation across participating states, fostering a sense of shared identity and economic cohesion. The Journey to Schengen Membership The road to Schengen membership for Bulgaria and Romania has been long and challenging. Both countries joined the EU in 2007 and have since worked diligently to meet the stringent criteria required for inclusion in the Schengen Area. The decision reflects their significant progress in areas such as border security, judicial reforms, and anti-corruption measures. It also signals the EU's recognition of their efforts and commitment to the values of European integration. A Boost for European Integration The inclusion of Bulgaria and Romania is expected to yield numerous benefits for the EU. By eliminating internal border checks, it will enhance mobility for citizens and businesses, facilitating tourism, trade, and cross-border cooperation. Moreover, this step reinforces the EU's core principles of solidarity and unity. It sends a strong message about the bloc's commitment to inclusivity and shared progress, especially at a time when Europe faces various geopolitical challenges. Looking Ahead As Bulgaria and Romania prepare to fully integrate into the Schengen Area, the EU celebrates this significant achievement as a testament to the power of collaboration and shared goals. The decision not only strengthens the Schengen framework but also reaffirms the EU's commitment to fostering a more united and interconnected Europe. For the citizens of Bulgaria and Romania, January 1, 2025, will mark the beginning of a new chapter, one that brings them closer to the heart of Europe. For the EU, it is a reminder of the enduring importance of its founding ideals: freedom, unity, and cooperation.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWctSEBx9NslkW-QV7RMz2i-	2024-12-12T09:31:49-08:00	
Thailand To Receive Record Number Of Tourists For Christmas And N...	Thailand is set to attract many tourists during this year’s Christmas and New Year holidays. According to Thailand Tourism of Thailand (TAT), the country hopes to welcome 1.56 million foreign visitors during Dec.21 to and Jan. 1 period. According to Vietnam News Agency (VNA) website, TAT Governor Thapanee Kiatphaibool said that there would be a revenue of 62 billion baht (US$1.83), up 23 percent over the same time last year. For the domestic market, 4.41 million trips are anticipated during the five-day holiday from Dec. 28 and Jan. 1 and should generate 17 billion baht, increasing 29% and 30%, respectively. Thailand has increased visa-free stay for citizens of 93 countries, up from the 57, allowing visitors to stay for up to 60 days. Last month, Thailand extended visa-free entry for Indian tourists to attract more visitors from the world’s most populous nation. Chinese tourists accounted for the largest number of over six million tourists, followed by Malaysia, India, South Korea, Russia. There were also tourists from Japan, Australia and New Zealand. Thailand has a target of 36.7 million visitors by end of this year. Next year, it has a bigger target of reaching 40 million tourists. According to VnExpress newspaper, Thailand, the second largest economy in Southeast Asia, Tahapanee said most foreign tourists would start their trips before the Christmas holiday. She attributed the increases to the Thai government's decisions on visa exemptions and the easing of immigration rules as well as the introduction of additional flights that have attracted foreign tourists to Thailand, including those from mainland China, South Korea, Taiwan, India, Scandinavia and France. World-class events introduced by TAT and its partners are also drawing foreign travelers and influencers to Thailand, she said, adding that the country has been recognized by global media outlets, such as Condé Nast Traveler, Timeout and Lonely Planet. The Thai Government has announced a five-day public holiday, which will start earlier on Dec. 28. It has also collaborated with six airlines to reduce domestic airfares by 30% for high-demand routes, such as Chiang Mai, Chiang Rai, Phuket, Udon Thani and Khon Kaen. Thienprasit Chaiyapatranun, president of the Thai Hotels Association, said hotel bookings nationwide remained strong in December, particularly New Year week. He said hotels in some places like the East, covering SriRacha, Chon Buri and Pattaya, are expecting to set records. However, three-star hotels that are not located in prime areas may not do as well as four-star and luxury hotels.

However, three-star hotels that are not located in prime areas may not do as well as four-star and luxury hotels. According to VNA, several Asian countries have made major changes to visa policies, with China, Thailand, Singapore, and Vietnam among those to simplify entry procedures in a fiercely competitive tourism landscape. Vietnam for example has been a bright spot in Southeast Asia as tourist arrivals reached nearly 16 million as of November and closed in on its 18-million target for the full year. In July, Prime Minister Pham Minh Chinh instructed the public security and foreign ministries to consider and amend visa policies to make it convenient for foreign tourists and create momentum for tourism recovery. Vietnam now waives visas for travelers from 25 countries compared to 162 by Malaysia and Singapore, 157 by the Philippines and 93 by Thailand. It issues three-month tourist visas to citizens from all countries and territories and in August last year tripled the duration of stay in Vietnam to 45 days for citizens of 13 countries unilaterally exempted from visas. Singapore has been seen positive signs due to an influx of Chinese and Indian tourists this year. From Feb. 9 it waived visa requirements for Chinese passport holders for stays of up to 30 days, and China promptly overtook Indonesia for the first time to become Singapore's largest source of visitors. Th 2.71 million Chinese tourists represented a 40% increase from last year. Singaporean authorities have streamlined the visa application process for Indian tourists, and as a result the number of Indian visitors rose by 13% to 898,000. India has become the third-largest source of tourists, surpassing Australia. Malaysia announced in June the extension of its visa exemption for Chinese tourists until the end of 2026. This extension reciprocates China's agreement to extend its own visa exemption for Malaysian tourists until the end of next year, according to Free Malaysia Today. The exemption for Chinese and Indian tourists began in December 2023. By October Malaysia had received over 20 million foreign tourists, including 2.82 million Chinese visitors. In 2019, before COVID broke out, there had been 3.1 million tourists from China. Earlier this year Indonesia launched the Bali Remote Worker visa, also known as the E33G, that allows digital nomads to stay on the island for a maximum of one year and requires them to have an income of at least $60,000 a year. In July it also introduced a new 'golden visa ' allowing stays of up to 10 years. For five-year visas, individual investors are required to set up a company worth $2.5 million, while the 10-year option requires a $5-million investment. The number of foreign visitors topped 10.37 million as of September, inching closer to the full-year target of 14 million, according to the country's Central Statistics Agency. Southeast Asian countries have been booming in tourism with changing their visa policies. Chinese and Indians are the big attraction to these countries.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWctSEBx9Nslkd1siAvHAKPk	2024-12-12T09:29:26-08:00	
Interim Afghan Government’s Intransigence Towards Pakistan On The...	Since the Taliban's takeover of Afghanistan in 2021, Pakistan has seen a significant increase in terrorist activities, primarily driven by the Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) operating from Afghan soil. Despite longstanding historical, cultural, and religious ties between the two nations, the Interim Afghan Government has taken a complex and seemingly contradictory approach towards Pakistan. This stance is particularly puzzling given significant diplomatic, political and economic dividends available for the bilateral relations, which offer more strategic benefits to Afghanistan than to Pakistan itself. Ideally, both the nations should have enhanced their bilateral relations by leaps and bounds since 2021. Unfortunately, that has not materialized so far. A primary factor driving the resurgence of violence in Pakistan is the safe havens of TTP (declared as Khawarij by Pakistan) within Afghanistan. These sanctuaries not only allow the TTP to operate with relative impunity but also serve as logistical and operational bases from which the group plan and execute attacks across the border. Terrorist sanctuaries inside Afghanistan have been affirmed by UNSC committee on Analytical Support and Sanctions Monitoring Team; highlighting that that Al-Qaeda, ISIK, TTP, and ETIM are growing in Afghanistan. These reports have further emphasized that TTP operates with support of elements within TTA inside Afghanistan. These are alarming developments and raises alarm bell for the international community. This also creates doubts on the credibility of Taliban Regime regarding fulfillment of its commitments, made in the Doha Accord. Despite longstanding ties between Pakistan and the Taliban, the Afghan Interim Government's failure or reluctance to curb TTP activities has strained bilateral relations and raised questions about its priorities. This inaction by the Taliban regime has fostered an environment of mistrust and insecurity, further complicating relations between the two countries. The growing divergence between Afghanistan and Pakistan comes at a time when both countries could greatly benefit from closer cooperation. The Taliban has repeatedly asserted the lack of capacity in dealing with TTP or avoiding a new front against the TTP. This assertion does not seem to be rooted in reality. The TTP issue is well within the Afghan Taliban's capacity to address, and taking meaningful actions can significantly improve relations with Pakistan. The TTP leaders have, on the record, sworn allegiance to Afghan Taliban’s Supreme Leader – Sheikh Haibatullah. The Afghan Taliban also shares ethnic affinities with the TTP. These two factors viz: religious allegiance and Pashtunwali (historical Pashtun code of conduct), if invoked by Afghan Taliban, can greatly help in reducing the cross-border threat to Pakistan. In doing so, the Taliban can suppress the issue while avoiding any chances of fighting with TTP within the Afghan territory. However, this needs sincerity and a strategic thought which apparently the Taliban regime is overlooking. The Taliban regime, in turn, may seek certain incentives from Pakistan. The incentives and concessions can be manifold particularly in diplomatic and economic domains. On the other hand, Pakistan also need to enhance its diplomatic parleys and security engagement with the Taliban regime. Positive engagement may open valuable avenues of bilateral cooperation. In doing so, both the governments could not only reduce the threat of terrorism but also foster goodwill and pave the way for greater regional stability and development. Hence, the current situation calls for urgent regional cooperation and a reassessment of strategies to address the growing threat of terrorism in South Asia. The Afghan government’s approach—or lack thereof—remains pivotal to the region's security dynamics.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWctSEBx9NslkXsOUTITgv_b	2024-12-12T09:27:40-08:00	
A 35-37,000 Years Old Early Communal Worship Cave In Israel – OpE...	Unlike the open to the sky altars of the imageless monotheistic KaBa and the Jerusalem Temple, early polytheists mostly gathered inside painted caves. Researchers working at a prehistoric cave site in northern Israel have now discovered evidence of a very early example of communal worship, a find that 'sheds light on the role of ritual centers in the evolution of human society'. The discovery is based on a 'ritual complex' dating from around 35,000 to 37,000 years ago found in the Manot Cave, a site in the western Galilee. The ritual complex, was set apart from the main cave area in 'the darkest depths,' is 'enclosed naturally by impressive stalagmites that create a distinctive entrance,' and features 'a unique and impressive rock with geometric engravings resembling a turtle shell' in a central location, the researchers said. The discovery is a 'breakthrough in our understanding of human society' that 'reveals the central role of rituals and symbols in shaping collective identity and strengthening social bonds.' The Manot Cave ritual complex is the 'first evidence' of its kind in the Levant' the authors said. The centerpiece of the discovery is an engraved rock, 'deliberately placed in a niche in the deepest, darkest part of the cave. The turtle-shell design... indicates that it may have represented a totem or a mythological or spiritual figure,' Barzilai said. The rock's 'special location, far from the daily activity areas near the cave entrance, suggests that it was an object of worship.' The area around the turtle-shell rock contained ash remains, 'confirming the use of fire to illuminate the ritual space, likely with torches,' and testing showed the space possessed 'enhanced natural acoustics, which could have created a unique auditory experience for communal activities such as prayer, singing and dancing,' the researchers said. Prof. Hershkovitz said that for prehistoric tribes, 'darkness embodies sacred and hidden qualities, symbolizing rebirth and renewal,' so it is 'not surprising that prehistoric hunters chose to conduct their rituals in the darkest part of Manot Cave,'. Establishing such ritual centers was 'a central element in the development of collective identity,' a step in the transition from 'small, isolated hunter-gatherer groups (bands) based on blood ties between individuals to large (tribal) complex societies,'. The dating of the ritual complex (from 35,000 to 37,000 years ago) coincides with what is called the Aurignacian culture, a phase of prehistory when modern humans were known for cave paintings and the use of symbolic objects. While modern-day Israel is dotted with prehistoric sites inhabited by early Homo sapiens populations as well Neanderthals, evidence of art and symbolic activity in the Paleolithic is scarce in the region. Actually nothing has been found in the Levant that compares to the spectacular cave paintings and exquisite figurines found across Upper Paleolithic Europe; or the 51,000-year-old depictions of pigs from Indonesia. The Paleolithic record in Europe is replete with exquisite works from cave paintings to carvings done tens of thousands of years ago – such as the Lion Man sculpture found in a German cave and made of mammoth ivory some 38,000 years ago. Perhaps the Levant was somewhat negative to religious images. The inhabitants of the Manot Cave descended deep into the earth and had a natural chimney about 10 meters inside. The ritual complex described in this article was found about 50 meters beyond the entrance to the cave, past several rows of stalagmite barriers. For thousands of years before Prophet Abraham, Allah sent tens of thousands of prophets to all the bands, tribes, nations and empires on the earth, and not one of God's Prophets was able to establish an ongoing to the present imageless monotheistic community. Why was it so hard to establish monotheism.? During the many centuries before Prophet Abraham, God's Prophets focused totally on teaching the Divine truth of imageless monotheism. For thousands of years before Prophet Abraham, the prophets who God sent to the thousands of bands, tribes and nations on the earth spreading the Divine truth of imageless monotheism; not one of them was able to establish an ongoing imageless monotheistic community that lasted for more than a few generations. 'And when there came to them a Messenger from Allah, confirming what was with them, a party of the people who were given the Book threw away the Book of Allah behind their backs, as if they did not know it!' (Qur'an 2:101) And: 'The people of Noah denied before them, and the companions of the well and Thamūd; and ʿAad and Pharaoh and the brothers [neighbors] of Lot; and the companions of the forest, and the people of Tubbaʿ. All denied the messengers [Allah sent] so My threat (of punishment) was justly fulfilled.' [50:12-14] Until Prophet Abraham, all Prophets were raised and sent to the whole of mankind in different lands and at different times but with the same message. A hadith puts the number of prophets sent to all mankind as 124,000 (Ibn Hanbal, Musnad, 5, 169) But the number is not important. What is essential is that no land, people or period was neglected; prophets were sent to all. The Qur'an says: There never was a people without a Warner having lived among them' (35:24) and 'We (God) would never visit our wrath (chastise any community) until We had sent a Messenger to give warning.'(17:15) So God decided to do things in a radically different and unique way. Instead of the theology truth of imageless monotheism, God decided to make a partnership loyalty covenant with a small tribe, and send six hundred of his prophets to this small tribe; and work continually for many centuries with the people of this tribe, until they were able to establish an ongoing loyal community that would always have a core of righteous and loyal believers. Qur'an 5:20-21 states: 'Moses said to his people: O, my people, remember the favor of Allah upon you when he appointed among you prophets and made you possessors [of the Land of Israel] and gave you what he had not given anyone among the worlds. O my people, enter the holy land which Allah has assigned to you.' Allah selected Abraham the Hebrew (Genesis 14:13) and the descendants of Prophets Ishmael, Issac, and Jacob to be the first, but not the last monotheistic community. 'There is for you an excellent example (to follow) in Abraham and those with him.' [Qur'an 60:4] and 'Indeed Ibrahim was a nation obedient to Allah, a Hanif, he was not one of the polytheists.' [Qur'an 16:120]. 'Praise to Allah, who has granted to me in old age Ishmael and Isaac. Indeed, my Lord is the Hearer of supplication [14:39]. And 'O our Lord! I have made some of my offspring (Ishmael) to dwell in a valley without cultivation, near your Sacred House (the Ka'ba); in order our Lord, that they may establish regular Prayer: so fill the hearts of some among men with love towards them, and feed them with fruits: so that they may give thanks'. [Qur'an 14:37} 'And remember Our servants; Abraham, Isaac and Jacob. Endowed with power and insight. We made them perfectly pure and sincere by virtue of a characteristic most pure; their constant remembrance of the Abode'. [Qur'an 38:45-7] 'For who has a better religion than him who submits his will to Allah, being virtuous, and follows the creed of Ibrahim, a Hanif? And Allah took Ibrahim for a dedicated friend' [4:125]. And when his Lord tested Prophet Abrahim with certain words, he fulfilled them, He (God) said, 'I am making you the Imam of mankind.' Said he, 'And from among my descendants?' He said, 'My pledge does not extend to the unjust' [Qur'an 2:124]. The covenant between God and the descendants of Jacob (later called Israel) does not include Jews who transgress the 10 commandments. A narration from Abu Dharr relates that one day he asked the Messenger of Allah: 'How many prophets are there in all? He replied: 124, 000.. He then asked: How many of them were messenger prophets? He replied: 313 from the above group. He asked: Who was the first of them? He replied: Adam...The first prophet among Bani Israel was Musa and the last of them was Isa and they were in all 600.' (Biharul Anwar, Vol. 11, Pg. 32.) One of the most important visions of the prophets of Israel occurs in the words of the 8th century BCE biblical prophet Micah. He declared that until the end of history, and throughout the Messianic Age, religious pluralism will continue to be the norm, even among polytheists. 'In the last days the mountain of the Lord's temple will be established as the highest of the mountains; it will be exalted above the hills, and peoples will stream to it. Many nations will come and say, 'Come, let us go up to the mountain of the Lord, to the temple of the God of Jacob. He will teach us his ways, so that we may walk in His paths. Torah will go out from Zion, and the word of the Lord from Jerusalem. He will judge between many peoples and will settle disputes for strong nations far and wide. 'They will beat their swords into plowshares and their spears into pruning hooks. Nation will not take up sword against nation, nor will they train for war anymore. Everyone will sit under their own vine and under their own fig tree, and no one will make them afraid, for the Lord God has spoken. All the nations will walk in the name of their gods, and we (Jews) will walk in the name of the Lord our God for ever and ever. (Micah 4:1-5) The opening section seems to predict Jewish pre-eminence but it doesn't, because it says 'many nations will come' (4:2) not 'all nations will flow to Israel' to be taught God's ways. The second section predicts the universal peace that will reign in the Messianic Age under God' rule. So far this agrees totally with the better known prophecy of Isaiah (2:2-4). Then comes Prophet Micah's revolutionary addition. Micah declares that the verses of the first section do not proclaim Judaism's victory over all other religions, or even over all other God concepts. Even in the Messianic Age the other nations will still be loyal to their Gods just as we are loyal to our God as Micah says in (4:5) 'All the nations will walk in the name of their gods' Indeed, it is possible to understand this verse to mean that the Messianic Age of universal peace will come about because all the nations, including Israel, actually live up to the best principles of their own religions. If all Arabs and Jews can live up to the ideal that 'the descendants of Abraham's sons should never make war against each other' is the will of God; we will help fulfill the 2700 year old vision of Prophet Isaiah: 'On that day there will be a highway from Egypt to Assyria. The Assyrians will go to Egypt, and the Egyptians to Assyria. The Egyptians and Assyrians will worship together. 'On that day Israel will join a three-party alliance with Egypt and Assyria, a blessing upon the heart. The LORD of Hosts will bless them saying, 'Blessed be Egypt My people, Assyria My handiwork, and Israel My inheritance.'...(Isaiah 19:23-5)	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWctSEBx9Nslkcek8dPn3ySr	2024-12-12T09:25:54-08:00	
Turkey And Iran’s Pursuit Of $30 Billion Trade Partnership: Stren...	Türkiye and Iran have embarked on a focused journey to significantly bolster their bilateral trade, aiming to reach an ambitious target of $30 billion annually. This shared goal underscores a commitment to deepen economic ties and foster closer cooperation across various sectors, as highlighted by Turkish Trade Minister Ömer Bolat during his recent visit to Tehran for the 29th Meeting of the Türkiye-Iran Joint Economic Cooperation Commission. In a meeting with Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian, Bolat expressed Türkiye's desire to renew its energy agreements with Iran while enhancing border trade mechanisms. 'We are trying to modernize the border gates and open two more crossings with Iran,' Bolat stated, emphasizing the importance of facilitating smoother customs procedures and strengthening local markets. His remarks reflect a broader vision to transform the trade dynamics between the two nations into a robust and seamless exchange of goods and services. Revitalizing Historical Agreements Bolat also highlighted Türkiye's intent to revive the 2015 preferential trade agreement with Iran. This agreement, originally designed to reduce trade barriers and enhance mutual market access, is seen as a critical step toward boosting trade volumes. In addition to trade, the two sides are exploring a comprehensive agreement on tourism, aiming to capitalize on shared cultural and historical connections to drive people-to-people exchanges. Iranian President Pezeshkian underscored the strategic importance of fostering unity among Islamic nations. 'We must address our challenges as brothers and strengthen the power of the Islamic world practically,' he remarked. His vision includes leveraging the economic and infrastructural capacities of Islamic countries, creating synergies in trade markets, transportation routes, and other shared opportunities. Current Trade Trends Trade between Iran and Türkiye has shown a mixed trajectory over recent years, marked by periodic fluctuations but consistent efforts to sustain and grow economic exchanges. According to the Turkish Statistical Institute (TurkStat), the two nations exchanged $1.75 billion worth of goods in the first four months of 2024, reflecting a modest 2% growth compared to the $1.72 billion during the same period in 2023. Türkiye's exports to Iran during this period reached $1.05 billion, representing a 16% increase from $900 million in the previous year. However, Iran's exports to Türkiye declined by 14%, amounting to $700 million compared to $820 million during the same timeframe in 2023. Despite these recent shifts, the long-term trade relationship between the two countries has shown resilience. In 2023, the total trade volume stood at $5.49 billion, albeit a 14% decline from 2022. The previous year, 2022, had witnessed a significant 15% rise in trade compared to 2021, reaching $6.42 billion. Notably, in 2022, Iran's exports to Türkiye grew by 19%, while Türkiye's imports from Iran saw an 11% increase, reflecting mutual efforts to enhance economic engagement. A History of Economic Collaboration The economic relationship between Türkiye and Iran is rooted in geographical proximity, shared cultural ties, and mutual interests in energy and trade. In July 2023, the two countries held discussions at the Turkish-Iranian High-Level Cooperation Council in Tehran. This meeting, co-chaired by Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, focused on expanding economic relations alongside strengthening political ties. A major outcome of these discussions was the negotiation of a 25-year extension to the gas export contract between the two nations. Energy cooperation remains a cornerstone of their relationship, with Iran being a key supplier of natural gas to Türkiye. President Raisi emphasized Tehran's determination to enhance economic relations with neighboring countries, stating that both nations should implement appropriate policies to achieve the $30 billion trade target. Strategic Developments in Energy and Infrastructure Energy remains a pivotal area of collaboration between Türkiye and Iran. In parallel with the broader economic dialogue, Turkish Energy Minister Fatih Dönmez and Iranian Energy Minister Ali-Akbar Mehrabian engaged in detailed discussions on expanding cooperation in the energy sector. These talks reflect the strategic importance of energy security and diversification for both nations. Türkiye's interest in renewing its energy agreement with Iran aligns with its broader strategy of ensuring stable and affordable energy supplies. Iran, with its vast reserves of natural gas and oil, serves as a reliable partner in this domain. Additionally, plans to modernize border infrastructure, including the opening of two new border crossings, aim to streamline trade and reduce logistical bottlenecks, thereby boosting the overall volume of bilateral exchanges. Overcoming Challenges While the potential for economic growth between Türkiye and Iran is significant, challenges persist. Geopolitical tensions, international sanctions on Iran, and fluctuating trade policies have occasionally hindered the pace of economic engagement. Moreover, the decline in Iran's exports to Türkiye in 2023 highlights the need for balanced trade relations to achieve sustainable growth. However, the shared commitment to strengthening ties, as demonstrated by recent high-level meetings and initiatives, suggests a determination to overcome these obstacles. By focusing on infrastructure development, trade facilitation, and energy cooperation, both nations aim to create a resilient economic partnership. The Road Ahead Türkiye and Iran's ambition to reach $30 billion in bilateral trade reflects a vision of deepened economic integration that goes beyond transactional exchanges. It symbolizes a partnership rooted in mutual respect, shared goals, and a strategic understanding of the benefits of regional collaboration. Reviving the preferential trade agreement and implementing comprehensive tourism initiatives are expected to serve as catalysts for growth. Additionally, modernizing border crossings and expanding transportation routes will facilitate not only trade but also cultural and social exchanges, fostering greater people-to-people connectivity. In the energy sector, the extension of the gas export contract and discussions on broader cooperation demonstrate a forward-looking approach to ensuring energy security and mutual benefits. As both nations work toward diversifying their economies, energy collaboration will likely play a pivotal role in driving bilateral trade growth. Conclusion The economic relationship between Türkiye and Iran is a testament to the potential of regional cooperation in overcoming challenges and achieving shared prosperity. While hurdles remain, the unwavering commitment of both nations to enhance their economic ties offers a promising outlook. With a clear roadmap and strategic initiatives in place, Türkiye and Iran are poised to not only achieve their $30 billion trade target but also set a benchmark for successful economic partnerships in the region. This evolving partnership is more than just an economic endeavor; it is a step toward building stronger regional ties and reinforcing the collective strength of Islamic nations. As the two countries continue their journey toward greater economic integration, the world will be watching their progress as a model for regional cooperation and mutual development.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWctSEBx9NslkagJVzv7uL4W	2024-12-12T09:24:26-08:00	
The Taliban’s Self-Delusion And Afghanistan’s Path To Recovery – ...	Afghanistan’s recent history has been defined by the struggles of its people, their resilience amid chaos, and the unrelenting forces that have shaped their fate. Yet, the self-perception of the ruling Taliban regime, known as the Interim Afghan Government (IAG), is both delusional and dangerous. The IAG, led by a group that claims divine legitimacy, projects an image of being the rightful, ordained rulers of the country. This vision, however, is at odds with the principles of justice, peace, and governance upon which Afghanistan’s future should be built. The Taliban's ideological framework is an increasingly rigid distortion of Islam, manipulated for political control rather than the upholding of justice or compassion. Their policies are a striking contradiction to the core values of the religion they claim to represent. Despite claiming to govern in the name of Islam, the IAG's actions—from the denial of girls' education to public executions and the stripping of women's rights—are antithetical to Islamic teachings, which promote knowledge, dignity, and the sanctity of human life. These acts have drawn condemnation from scholars across the Muslim world, including from the Organization of Islamic Cooperation (OIC), making it clear that the global Muslim community sees the Taliban’s actions as a betrayal of the very faith they purport to protect. Yet, the IAG has embraced a complex stance toward neighboring Pakistan, accusing it of meddling in Afghanistan’s affairs. Afghan media, under the Taliban’s control, amplifies these anti-Pakistan narratives, presenting a distorted view of the bilateral relationship. This portrayal fails to acknowledge the historical, cultural, and geopolitical realities that bind Afghanistan and Pakistan together. The reality is that Pakistan has played an indispensable role in Afghanistan’s survival and stability for decades, offering refuge to millions of Afghan refugees during the Soviet invasion and the years of subsequent conflict. Pakistan’s support during the Soviet-Afghan war, far from being the source of instability as the IAG would suggest, solidified its role as a critical player in Afghanistan’s trajectory. The shared Pashto language, Islamic faith, and centuries-old historical ties create a foundation for mutual respect between the two nations. This bond, often underappreciated, is essential for Afghanistan’s future stability. The Taliban’s ideological rigidity is compounded by its inability to govern effectively. For Afghans, life under Taliban rule has become one of fear and repression. Their rights have been stripped away, their voices silenced, and their aspirations crushed. The IAG has succeeded in creating an environment where oppression reigns, not just through fear, but by entrenching policies that block progress. The denial of women’s education, the systematic erasure of fundamental rights, and the use of fear as a tool of governance have destroyed the foundations of a thriving, hopeful society. The Taliban’s intransigent stance on human rights has alienated the international community, further exacerbating Afghanistan’s isolation and hindering the flow of vital humanitarian aid. This oppression is a far cry from Afghanistan’s history, where tribal traditions and riwaj (customary law) guided society. The Taliban’s rise to power, facilitated by a secretive deal with the U.S. and shaped by external powers such as Pakistan, marked a betrayal of the country's path toward progress. It is not merely a domestic struggle—it is part of a broader geopolitical game. The myth of Afghanistan as the 'Graveyard of Empires' is a misleading oversimplification of the country’s history. While Afghans fought valiantly, their victories were often supported by external forces like Pakistan, the U.S., and Saudi Arabia. The collapse of the British Empire and the Soviet Union in Afghanistan cannot be attributed solely to Afghan resistance; these outcomes were products of complex geopolitical factors. In the wake of the Taliban’s resurgence, Afghanistan is faced with the grim prospect of becoming a haven for regional and global terrorism once again. The IAG's ties to terrorist groups and its failure to uphold the commitments made in the Doha Agreement pose a significant threat to both regional and global peace. Afghanistan’s internal policies are accelerating radicalization, not just within its borders, but spilling over into neighboring regions. The long-term ramifications of this radicalization threaten not only Afghanistan's future but also the broader security of the South Asian region and beyond. Moreover, the Taliban’s claims of tackling corruption ring hollow. Reports of widespread aid mismanagement, such as those from Le Monde, reveal that funds meant to alleviate suffering are instead funneled to a privileged few while the majority of Afghans continue to endure extreme hardship. This misallocation of resources is emblematic of the IAG's failure to prioritize the well-being of its people and underscores the regime's disregard for the needs of the Afghan population. The real tragedy is that Afghanistan’s once inclusive and tolerant culture is being systematically destroyed. The Taliban’s rigid theological policies have torn apart the fabric of Afghan society, replacing the country’s rich cultural heritage with an oppressive regime that undermines individual freedoms. The destruction of Afghanistan’s identity—one rooted in centuries of cultural exchange, pluralism, and resilience—by the IAG is perhaps the greatest tragedy of all. Afghanistan’s path to recovery hinges on the recognition of the international community’s responsibility to support the Afghan people—not the Taliban regime. This is not a question of politics, but of human rights, justice, and the future of millions of lives. Afghanistan’s people deserve the world’s support in reclaiming their identity, their culture, and their humanity. But that support must come with a clear commitment to hold the Taliban accountable for its actions and to provide Afghanistan with the resources and the space to rebuild its future, free from the shadow of radicalism and authoritarianism. The world must reject the IAG’s self-perception as a divinely ordained government and its dangerous portrayal of Pakistan as an antagonist. Afghanistan’s future cannot be shaped by the Taliban’s narrow, self-serving vision. It must be shaped by the collective aspirations of its people, with the support of the international community, in a manner that reflects the true spirit of Islam—one rooted in justice, compassion, and progress. Without this, Afghanistan’s future will remain bleak, caught in the grip of an ideology that has already cost its people far too much.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWctSEBx9NslkZ7-TWpzP_St	2024-12-12T09:22:50-08:00	
Blue Horizons Unlocking Maritime Potential For Shared Prosperity ...	The maritime landscapes of Pakistan and Bangladesh are rich with potential, holding the key to both nations' future economic growth and environmental sustainability. As both countries are situated along the Bay of Bengal, they have a unique opportunity to capitalize on their shared maritime resources. By fostering a strategic partnership built around a sustainable 'Blue Economy,' Pakistan and Bangladesh can pave the way for regional prosperity while ensuring the health of the ocean for generations to come. The concept of a Blue Economy, which focuses on sustainable maritime practices that drive economic growth while preserving the marine environment, is one that both nations can embrace. By collaborating on initiatives such as sustainable fishing, renewable ocean energy, and eco-friendly shipping routes, Pakistan and Bangladesh can maximize the potential of their oceanic resources without sacrificing the health of their marine ecosystems. One of the most promising avenues for this partnership is the establishment of a 'Blue Economy Corridor' — a regional framework that would focus on sustainable fishing, aquaculture, and ocean-based trade. This corridor would not only provide economic benefits through fisheries and trade but would also prioritize the preservation of the Bay of Bengal’s delicate marine biodiversity. According to the World Bank, joint ventures like these could generate significant economic returns, create long-term employment opportunities, and enhance the economic resilience of coastal communities in both countries. For such a corridor to thrive, both nations must engage in robust marine research. A shared Ocean Research Institute could help Pakistan and Bangladesh study vital aspects of marine life such as biodiversity, pollution, and ocean currents. By focusing on these areas, both countries can drive sustainable development policies, while improving regional marine protection efforts. The collaboration would ensure that their economic activities are in harmony with environmental conservation efforts, and it would create a model of responsible stewardship for others to follow. Additionally, Pakistan and Bangladesh can tap into the growing demand for green shipping practices by co-developing eco-friendly maritime routes. This initiative aligns with the goals of the International Maritime Organization (IMO), which emphasizes sustainable shipping as a means of reducing maritime pollution. By implementing greener shipping solutions, the two countries can boost regional trade while positioning themselves as global leaders in green logistics. This would not only benefit their local economies but also serve to minimize the environmental footprint of their maritime activities. Tourism also holds great promise for both nations along their coastal areas. A South Asian Coastal Tourism Initiative could encourage visitors to explore the rich cultural and ecological landscapes of the Bay of Bengal while ensuring that tourism activities are sustainable and respectful of the environment. This initiative would help boost local economies while safeguarding fragile coastal ecosystems, creating a balance between growth and conservation. In the realm of fisheries, Pakistan and Bangladesh face the challenge of overfishing, which threatens food security and marine biodiversity. Through the establishment of a Pakistan-Bangladesh Fisheries Alliance, the two nations could promote sustainable fishing practices and develop long-term strategies for managing marine resources. Global organizations like the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) have emphasized the importance of sustainable fisheries management to revitalize fish stocks. With the right policies in place, both nations can safeguard a steady food supply while fostering regional cooperation in marine resource management. Another vital aspect of the Blue Economy lies in the exploration of renewable ocean energy sources such as wave and tidal power. The International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA) reports that ocean energy has the potential to supply a significant portion of energy needs, offering both Pakistan and Bangladesh a cleaner, more sustainable alternative to fossil fuels. By investing in ocean energy infrastructure, both countries can reduce carbon emissions, enhance energy security, and take meaningful steps toward combating climate change. The importance of maritime security cannot be overlooked in this partnership. Enhanced cooperation between Pakistan and Bangladesh in securing their waters from threats like illegal fishing, piracy, and environmental degradation will ensure a safer environment for both trade and fishing activities. A joint security framework will not only promote regional stability but also help preserve the marine environment that both nations depend on for their economic survival. Furthermore, the partnership could extend to blue technology research, focusing on innovations like ocean-based carbon capture and other cutting-edge solutions for climate resilience. As the world grapples with the effects of climate change, Pakistan and Bangladesh could become pioneers in leveraging blue technologies to strengthen their defenses against environmental challenges. According to the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP), breakthroughs in such technologies can help nations across South Asia build a more sustainable future and set global standards for marine conservation and sustainable development. Pakistan and Bangladesh’s collaborative efforts in building a Blue Economy would not only stimulate economic growth but also create a sustainable blueprint for other countries in the region and beyond to emulate. By sharing resources, expertise, and research, they can transform the Bay of Bengal into a model of sustainable maritime cooperation. This partnership has the potential to redefine the way nations interact with their oceans—prioritizing economic development without compromising the health of the environment. In conclusion, a Blue Economy partnership between Pakistan and Bangladesh is not just an opportunity for economic growth; it is a chance to lead the world in sustainable maritime practices. By embracing this vision, both countries can ensure a prosperous, resilient, and environmentally secure future, positioning themselves as leaders in the global movement toward a greener, more sustainable world.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWctSEBx9Nslkbb4NQsEG0Jp	2024-12-12T09:21:54-08:00	
Uzbekistan Shines At The Global Tourism Forum 2024 – OpEd	On Tuesday, December 9, 2024, the Global Tourism Forum held its annual meeting in Brussels, and the theme of the day was Uzbekistan. The rich architecture inherited from the Timurid Empire, the vestiges of the Timurid Renaissance, the most beautiful square in the world - Samarkand - and all the historic remains recognized by UNESCO, make Uzbekistan the ideal destination for history buffs. According to the World Economic Forum, between 2019 and 2024, Uzbekistan moved up 16 places (+7.8%) in the Travel & Tourism Development Index (Venkina, E. (2024, August 1)). It is also recognized as one of the world's safest destinations for tourists. Uzbekistan took 1st place in the ranking of the safest countries in the world 'Safety Perception Index 2023', which includes 121 countries. During the Forum, held at the Hilton Hotel in Brussels, key speakers included Thomas Emanuel, Director - STR; Dimitris Avramopoulos, Member of the Hellenic Parliament, former EU Commissioner; Farhod Fayzillaev, Advisor to the Chairman on International Affairs, Uzbekistan Tourism Committee, who gave speeches. Source: (n.d.). Embassy of The Republic of Uzbekistan in The Federative Republic of Germany. Uzbekistan recognized as the safest of 121 countries worldwide. Retrieved from Bulut Bagci, President of WTFC, said that tourism is the most important actor for bringing people together. Fayzillaev highlighted that the tourism sector has a critical role in addressing many sustainable development issues. He said, 'On one hand, tourism is a sector which is highly vulnerable to the impacts of climate change, like natural disasters or ecosystem degradation as well as political and socio-economic transformations. On the other hand, tourism also holds immense potential to contribute to solutions, to drive innovation, and to promote sustainable practices, which can benefit whole industries, local communities, and of course the environment.' He added that Uzbekistan has taken some bold steps to develop the tourism sector and has gained some impressive results. 'Let the numbers speak for themselves - in 2016 we had only 2 million foreign tourists visiting our country annually, these numbers have reached almost 7 million last year. This year we are expecting around 10 million travelers coming to Uzbekistan.' He also added that Uzbekistan is promoting energy efficiency by introducing energy-efficient standards for the hospitality sector and implementing renewable energy sources across all kinds of tourism infrastructure. One example: the biggest hub for MICE tourism in the region – The Silk Road Tourism Complex in Samarkand — now runs entirely on clean solar energy. Some serious steps are being taken for ecosystem restoration. Through our Yashil Makon (Green Zone) program, we are working to combat soil erosion and increase biodiversity in key tourist regions. As part of it, 646 million trees have been planted in Uzbekistan over the past three years. 'Green covers' have been created on 1.9 million hectares of the dry seabed of the Aral Sea, as well. He finished by saying that 'Developing sustainable education and science is another significant aspect. Uzbekistan has recently established the Central Asian University for Environmental and Climate Change, better known as the Green University, and the Samarkand campus of the International Academy of Tourism. These unique institutions are focused on solving environmental problems and helping develop eco-tourism in the region.' BIBLIOGRAPHY (n.d.).

Israel’s Wars Repeat The 1980s On Steroids – Analysis	Appalled by Israel’s carpet bombing of Beirut during the 1982 Lebanon war, United States President Ronald Reagan didn’t mince words with then-Israeli Prime Minister Menahem Begin. 'I was angry. I told him it had to stop, or our entire future relationship was endangered. I used the word holocaust deliberately & said the symbol of his war was becoming a picture of a 7-month-old baby with its arms blown off,' Reagan noted in his diary. The August 1982 phone call between Reagan and Begin provides a template for the US’s ability to twist Israel’s arm and the limits of the Western giant’s influence. Begin wasted no time in halting his saturation bombing of the Lebanese capital in response to Reagan’s threat. Yet, he rejected the president’s demand that he allow an international force to enter Beirut to protect the hundreds of thousands of Palestinian refugees in the Israeli-besieged city. His refusal had dire consequences. A month later, at least 800 Palestinians, many of them women and children, were massacred in their homes in Sabra and Shatila in West Beirut by Lebanese Christian gunmen under the watchful eyes of the Israeli military. Public outrage in Israel forced Begin to resign, ending his career. Biden failed where Reagan succeeded More than four decades later, US President Joe Biden understood the stakes when Israel went to war in response to Hamas’s October 7, 2023 attack on Israel. He also knew the levers of power at his disposal after test-driving Reagan’s approach in 2021. At the time, Biden, like his predecessor, picked up the phone to read Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu the riot act. As a new book on Biden, The Last Politician, describes, it was his fourth phone call to the Israeli leader in ten days in which behind-the-scenes diplomacy and cajoling failed to end fighting between Israel and Hamas. The president advised him that he 'expected a significant de-escalation today on the path to a ceasefire.' When Netanyahu sought to buy time, Biden replied: 'Hey man, we’re out of runway here. It’s over.' Netanyahu and Hamas agreed to a ceasefire a day later. Even so, he knew then and now that he had less to worry about than Begin did with the Reagan presidency. In contrast to Reagan’s administration, which allowed the United Nations Security Council to pass 21 resolutions criticizing, if not condemning, Israel’s policies, Biden gave Israel blanket diplomatic cover and provided it with arms. With these, it could prosecute wars that make 1982 pale in comparison. Biden’s test-driving of Reagan’s template, familiarity with the Israeli interventions in Lebanon and annexationist policies in the 1980s and beyond, coupled with his predecessor’s willingness to confront Begin in the 1982 war leave the president with little excuse for refusing to rein Israel in over the past year. Biden’s failure has tangibly devastating consequences for the Palestinians and yet to materialize fallouts for Israelis and the rest of the Middle East. These will haunt the region for a generation, if not more. Like Begin, Biden will likely see his legacy sullied by Israeli conduct on the Middle East’s battlefields. Historic destruction may only increase A heated encounter with Begin during the 1982 war, which involved finger jabbing and fists pounding on a table, spotlights Biden’s lack of an excuse. Echoing Reagan, Biden warned Begin that Israeli settlement policy could cost it US support. In response, Begin snapped, 'I am not a Jew with trembling knees.' Forty-two years later, Biden studiously ignores the fact that Israel’s latest Gaza and Lebanon wars are a repeat of the early 1980s on steroids. Begin created the template for Israel’s systematic targeting of militants irrespective of the risk to civilians with the 1981 bombing of Fakhani. This densely populated Beirut neighborhood was home to the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) and its affiliates. The bombing destroyed a seven-story building and damaged four nearby structures, killing some 90 people and wounding hundreds of others. In a letter to Reagan, written during Israel’s 1982 invasion of Lebanon, Begin compared the carpet bombing of Beirut to the Allied destruction of Berlin during World War II. 'I feel as a prime minister empowered to instruct a valiant army facing ‘Berlin’ where, amongst innocent civilians, Hitler and his henchmen hide in a bunker deep beneath the surface,' Begin said. Begin’s equation of PLO chairman Yasser Arafat and his organization with Adolf Hitler and his associates, like Netanyahu equating Hamas with the Nazis, served to justify civilian casualties in operations that were as much about targeting fighters as they were designed to incite the local population against the militants. 'In certain cases, the Israeli shelling and bombing were carefully targeted, sometimes on the basis of good intelligence. All too often, however, that was not the case. Scores of eight-to twelve-story apartment buildings were destroyed… Many of the buildings that were levelled…had no plausible military utility,' recalled historian Rashid Khalidi, who lived in Beirut at the time of the 1982 bombings. The strategy produced mixed results but, on balance, hardened rather than weakened popular resistance to Israeli policies. There is little reason to believe that the impact of Israel’s current wars will be any different. Israel has already prepared the ground by turning Gaza into what onetime Australian human rights commissioner and United Nations rapporteur Chris Sidoti calls a 'terrorism creation factory.'

Ishiba’s Shaky Ground Further Upset By Tremors Of A Trump Preside...	By Yukari Easton Donald Trump is now president-elect, and his ‘America First’ nationalist vision has returned. Japan, which counts the United States as its sole security ally, must prepare for a second Trump term. Judging from his first term, during which the United States withdrew from the Paris Climate Accord, the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty, the Open Skies Treaty and the Iranian nuclear agreement, Trump will likely further advance this isolationism. With his penchant for dictatorial power and his aversion to international institutions, the United States’ commitment to its allies now looks uncertain. Similarly tenuous are the United States’ bilateral agreements, such as the longstanding US–Japan Security Treaty. Europeans are already looking elsewhere. French President Emanuel Macron asked rhetorically, ‘Donald Trump was elected by Americans to defend the interests of Americans. Are we ready to defend the interests of Europeans?’. Seeing the United States deviate from its long-established security orthodoxy, some allies no longer wish to leave their security in the hands of US swing-state voters. But the alternative that Macron suggests for Europe is not an option for Japan, which is not a part of a strong and self-reliant multilateral defense alliance. Trump’s criticisms of Japan were not, in the past, followed by action. But his complaints were unnerving enough to motivate the late prime minister Shinzo Abe to become the first foreign leader to visit the then president-elect in 2016. Trump had been attacking the US–Japan Security Treaty as unfair and suggested Japan and South Korea should have their own nuclear capabilities. Managing Trump became critical. One of Abe’s tactics was to court an uninformed and impressionable Trump by staging ‘closeness’ through assiduously manufactured golf-buddy antics. But at the time Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba criticised Abe, declaring, ‘There’s no need to play golf with President Trump or go to Trump Tower. It’s important to present Japan as a formidable threat and to have a bargaining chip at the ready’. It remains to be seen whether Ishiba will deal with the Trump administration more effectively as prime minister. So far, he has not been able to procure more than a five-minute congratulatory telephone call. The Ishiba administration has been in a precarious position since taking power in October 2024. Shortly thereafter, Ishiba dissolved the lower house in an epic miscalculation, which led to the Liberal Democratic Party coalition falling short of a majority for the first time in 15 years. Some of Ishiba’s problems can be traced back to playing politics without clear goals coupled with some bewildering choices, such as controversial appointments, revisiting the fringe and destabilising concept of an Asian NATO and delaying the critical active cyber defence bill, an act of political vandalism without any obvious payoff. All of this exhibits a detachment from issues of importance. Meanwhile, Trump’s cabinet nominations are progressing. Senator Marco Rubio for Secretary of State is curious but, so far, one of the more normal appointments. Serving as a ranking member on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and the East Asian and Pacific Affairs subcommittee for many years, Rubio has an understanding of what foreign relations entail. He has been a strong supporter of US alliances, describing the US–Japan and US–South Koreaalliances as ‘pillars’ of US policy. His support of NATO has been steadfast, and his work led to a provision in the Fiscal Year 2024 National Defense Authorization Act limiting a US president’s power to leave NATO without Senate approval or an act of Congress. This pre-emptive safeguard was viewed as necessary after Trump encouraged Russia to ‘do whatever the hell they want’ to supposedly ‘delinquent’ NATO members. That said, even if confirmed, Rubio’s pro-alliance stance might vanish without Trump’s acquiescence, as did his prior support for Ukraine. With his stranglehold over the Republican Party, the constraints seen in Trump’s first term will be absent. Trump’s strong isolationist tendencies, coupled with a cavalier attitude that does not distinguish allies from foes or dictatorships from democracies, make the United States an unreliable partner. Notably, the president-elect is openly opposed to the security concerns raised by his former vice president Mike Pence, secretaries of defense Jim Mattis and Mark Esper, and national security advisors HR McMaster and John Bolton. Trump’s soon-to-be-dropped federal indictments include the misappropriation of top-secret documents, including those relating to the United States’ nuclear programs. Japan must now take more responsibility for its national security. Wishful thinking will not remove the dark cloud hanging over the US–Japan alliance. But Ishiba may not be capable of becoming a leader who executes a new foreign policy and national security approach. A worst case scenario for Japan would be that, with conflicts in the Middle East and Ukraine and increasing tensions over Taiwan, Trump’s transactional disposition pushes him towards Faustian bargains with the United States’ adversaries. The extent to which Trump will change Asian foreign policy is unknown. What is known is that Ishiba has a daunting task ahead of him in preparing for an atypical, volatile and unpredictable US presidency while simultaneously managing a fragile and unpopular coalition government. Ishiba’s foreign policy weaknesses will only become more apparent as Japan prepares to work with the new president-elect. There are distressing times ahead.

How China Hopes To Kickstart Its Flagging Economy – Analysis	By Kitty Wang China has announced it will loosen its monetary policy to boost the economy, in a move that echoes steps taken in 2009 in the wake of the financial crisis. The People’s Bank of China, the country’s central bank, will use a slew of different policy tools to boost the money supply — a move often criticized as 'printing money' — including government debt and changes to interest rates and the amount of reserves it requires banks to hold. The ruling Chinese Communist Party’s Politburo announced the move on Tuesday following a top-level economic meeting on Monday, state news agency Xinhua reported. 'After more than 10 years, the monetary policy orientation has been changed to ‘moderately loose’ again ... sending a positive signal that will effectively boost the confidence of all parties and help China’s economy recover and improve,' it quoted the meeting as saying. It said 'moderately loose' means a 'reasonable money supply, low interest rates, and a relatively loose monetary and credit environment' to boost investment and consumption. What is the point of the policy change? According to the Politburo, the aim is to 'maintain a reasonable abundance of liquidity, reduce the comprehensive financing costs of enterprises and residents, and provide financial support for the continued recovery of the economy.' In other words, the central bank will make it easier for institutions and individuals to borrow money, increasing the amount of money in the system and, if successful, business confidence along with it. Lack of confidence in China’s economic future, particularly after the three-year zero-COVID policy emptied local government coffers and burst the property bubble, has been frequently cited as the main reason behind a mass exodus of people and companies. Experts say the move is also a bid to forestall the impact of 60% tariffs on Chinese goods that president-elect Donald Trump has vowed to impose on taking office. Party leader Xi Jinping has also signaled that he wants to shift China’s economy away from its dependence on exports by boosting domestic consumption. But economists have warned that the government’s growth figures don’t represent the true scale of damage done to the economy, and to confidence generally. How will it work in practice? The government has also said it will combine a looser monetary policy with a 'more active' fiscal stance. That means boosting government spending, particularly on infrastructure projects, a path that has been taken by Xi’s predecessors in response to external shocks. 'More active fiscal policy usually means more active fiscal expenditure, with the government vigorously building bridges and roads to support economic construction and improve people’s lives,' state-run China Radio International’s Voice of China said in a commentary published on Wednesday. 'Under the premise that the government’s fiscal revenue is basically stable, the essence of a more active fiscal policy is actually to increase the fiscal deficit rate, issue more treasury bonds, and expand fiscal spending,' it said. Wasn’t everyone expecting this to happen in September? Chinese stock markets have surged and fallen on hopes of a massive fiscal stimulus package that was initially expected in September, and then again after subsequent high-level economic meetings in recent months. The central bank did cut some interest rates and the government started selling ultra-long bonds as part of a massive 1 trillion yuan (US$138 billion) package. But the measures were nowhere near the levels that markets had been hoping for, with many commentators speculating about a possible fiscal stimulus package along the lines of the one launched by former President Hu Jintao and his Premier Wen Jiabao that kickstarted the Chinese economy in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis. U.S.-based economic commentator Zheng Xuguang said the latest policy change could be much closer to that package. 'This approach means that the central government will rescue the markets and local governments, and stimulate investment and consumption using this active fiscal and looser monetary policy,' Zheng told RFA Mandarin in a recent interview. How did this turn out in the past? Wen is credited with pumping new life into the economy with a massive stimulus program worth 4 trillion yuan (US$586 billion). But critics say the Hu administration’s approach is at least partly responsible for the massive increase in government debt, rampant inflation and the now-collapsed property bubble that China faces today. According to Zheng Xuguang, this is akin to 'quenching one’s thirst with poison.' 'All the central government can do is take action to rescue real estate prices and ease local debts, which could be very damaging in the form of inflation,' he said. Xie Tian, ​​a professor at the Aiken School of Business at the University of South Carolina, said the move means Beijing has abandoned its formerly conservative approach to printing money. 'The only option they have left is to continue printing money at great risk, including the risk of losing power. There is really no other way forward,' he said.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfND9YsuDFJI6ywLSsKTxKC	2024-12-11T16:56:21-08:00	
Who’s Afraid Of George Soros? – OpEd	The raging controversy over the Bharatiya Janata Party’s allegation that the Congress Party leadership is hand in glove with the famous US financier George Soros with an infamous track record of funding the colour revolutions and regime change projects is snowballing. Congress Party may use the floor of the parliament to fuel its public tirades against the government, borne out of the proverbial folklore of Kerala, 'Whether the leaf falls on a thorn or a thorn on a leaf, the leaf is always harmed.' Congress calculates that the Modi government and the BJP would be the losers if this controversy remains in focus. These are early days and how all this pans out is hard to tell, as there are many variables in play. Look at the reticence of the SP and TMC, for instance, to wade into the Adani file. Besides, BJP is a peerless champion for diversionary tactics in Indian politics. From foreign policy angle, the outcome of the slugfest between India’s two mainstream parties, is going to depend on an 'X' factor, namely, George Soros’ clout with the incoming US administration and the attitude of President Donald Trump toward the Deep State’s advancement of a regime change agenda in Delhi as happened in Bangladesh. The BJP has quietly backtracked from its spokesman’s accusation at the press conference in New Delhi on December 6 that 'It has always been the US State Department behind this agenda'. The BJP National Spokesperson and MP Dr. Sambit Patra directly accused the US State Department of trying to 'destabilise India' and claimed that the US 'deep state' is working to 'target Prime Minister Narendra Modi'. 'The Deep State had a clear objective to destabilise India by targeting Prime Minister Modi,' the BJP spokesman reportedly said. In fact, he anchored on the Deep State and the US State Department the BJP’s entire case of Rahul Gandhi being a 'traitor of the highest order' and of Congress 'conspiring with foreign forces' to derail the government because of their 'hatred' for Modi. The BJP demanded on the floor of the parliament that Rahul Gandhi ought to be thoroughly investigated for meeting with the controversial business tycoon George Soros and some other American officials during his periodic visits to the US who have 'a history of peddling anti-India agenda'. Of course, this is an explosive charge that could only have been made with clearance (or instructions) from the highest echelons of the BJP and possibly the government. Surprisingly, however, the BJP subsequently censored the above remarks from its lengthy press release on Dr. Patra’s remarks. The bulk of the corporate media also followed suit with self-censorship, a few exceptions apart. Such backtracking doesn’t behoove India’s ruling party or our media honchos. It smacks of faint-heartedness and lack of resolve. This is happening despite the well-known fact that Soros indeed has a long history of acting as the frontman of the US State Department in its regime change projects abroad. Organisations such as Soros’ Open Society Foundations (founded in 1984) or National Endowment for Democracy (founded in 1983) are to be seen as the US government’s 'white gloves' for instigating colour revolutions to subvert state power in other countries; cultivating pro-US forces in target countries; misrepresenting the human rights situation in other countries; manipulating and interfering in other countries’ elections; inciting division and confrontation to undermine the stability of other countries; and, fabricating false information to mislead public opinion, using 'academic activities' as a cloak for interference and infiltration. This is a complex story on which Professor Sreeram Chaulia, at the O.P. Jindal Global University, had written a well-researched essay titled Democratisation, NGOs and 'colour revolutions' way back in 2006. By the way, Soros is also a globalist by conviction who genuinely subscribes the neocon ideology. He has given to the Foundations over $32 billion of a personal fortune made in the financial markets. The Foundations are estimated to have $25 billion in assets last year, and amongst worldwide activities, they prioritise 'the current challenges … of the rise of new forms of authoritarianism' in foreign countries. Will Trump put Soros out of business? This seems to be the assumption in Delhi, which is predicated on the antipathy between Trump and Soros who had close links with the Democratic Party — and, conversely, on Trump’s jovial attitude toward Modi. Soros is a formidable adversary who has reportedly earmarked one billion dollars for a regime change in India. He views regime changes not simply as a neocon pastime but also as a business proposition. In Ukraine, where he funded the Maidan protests and regime change in 2014, he is investing to generate lucrative business (here and here) No doubt, what remains to be seen is how Trump sees Soros going forward. It is a complicated story, as Soros has his line open to Trump’s inner circle. There are some straws in the wind. Basically, Trump is a dealmaker who has no permanent friends or allies — or enemies, for that matter. The salience of Trump’s one hour twenty-six minutes long interviewwith NBC News on Sunday, his first after the election victory, is that while he may harshly deal with those officials who misused their authority under President Biden’s watch to harass him, humiliate him and hunt him down, he hopes to work with the Democratic Party lawmakers in the Congress to carry forward his agenda. Trump acknowledged the criticality of bipartisan support to make the required constitutional amendments in regard of immigration laws. He even paid tribute to the left wing constituency who voted for him. Significantly, Alex Soros, son of George Soros, had generously contributed to Kamala Harris’ chest, but has since paid a fulsome compliment to Trump. He wrote on X: 'Too many Democrats are fighting each other over campaign tactics, because it is easier than accepting that Trump was underestimated as a candidate. He was a 'super candidate' with increasing appeal to a broader electorate — likely beyond the reach of both Democrats and Republicans.' Interestingly, Elon Musk also responded by calling himself the 'George Soros of the middle. I don’t want the pendulum to swing too far right, but right now it’s just too far left.' The bottom line is that Trump has made a thoughtful decision to tap Scott Bessent for the crucial cabinet position of Treasury Secretary. Bessent’s credentials include his stint on a small team at Soros’ investment firm through the 1980s that in 1992 helped 'break' the Bank of England with crushing trades against the British pound, having amassed a $10 billion bet that the pound was overvalued. The New York Times reported, 'Though the British government tried to support the currency, it wasn’t able to withstand the pressure, and the pound plunged in value. Mr. Soros’s fund earned more than $1 billion, along with credit (and infamy) for orchestrating one of Wall Street’s most audacious trades.' Now, there’s nothing Trump loves more than Wall Street’s seductive success stories. Times wrote, 'it was Mr. Bessent’s experience at Mr. Soros’s fund — including another high-profile bet, against the Japanese yen — that helped define his career, and that his former colleagues and other associates see as a crucial credential' for the cabinet job as Treasury Secretary. And now comes the news that Trump has picked a California lawyer Harmeet Kaur Dhillon to head the US justice Department’s civil rights division and nominated her as assistant attorney-general, who, apparently, empathises with pro-Khalistan activists in the US and Canada. Do not underestimate the ingenuity of the Deep State in America to have its way. Keeping the guard down will be a catastrophic mistake on the part of Delhi establishment. We could get hit when least expected. That’s what happened in Syria and Bangladesh. Eternal vigilance is the price of liberty, as they say. Make no mistake, at the end of the day, Trump is a great patriot and nationalist who stands by 'America First' as his chosen dictum. An equal relationship based on mutual respect is impossible to forge with the US.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfND9YsuDFJI9iqvhxE--L4	2024-12-11T16:54:49-08:00	
Romania’s Electoral Crisis: A Blueprint For Defending Democracy –...	By Antonia Colibasanu What Happened in Romania? (FPRI) -- The Romanian presidential election of 2024 faced significant controversy, culminating in its annulment due to confirmed foreign interference. The first round, held on November 24, 2024, saw independent candidate Călin Georgescu leading with 23 percent of the vote, followed closely by Elena Lasconi of the Save Romania Union (USR) with 19 percent. However, shortly after the election, irregularities surfaced, prompting President Klaus Iohannis to convene the Supreme Council of National Defense (CSAT) on November 27 to address potential election cyber interference. Intelligence reports—declassified after the Supreme Council of National Defense (CSAT) was held—indicated unusual activity on social media platforms, particularly TikTok, raising concerns about external manipulation. At the same time, considering that Georgescu was virtually unknown before the elections on November 24 with no opinion poll suggesting that he would take a top position and claims that the vote may have been fraud, the Constitutional Court ordered a recount of ballots. However, the recount confirmed the initial results, validating Georgescu and Lasconi’s advancement to the runoff scheduled for December 8. However, by December 4, the situation took a dramatic turn when President Iohannis declassified intelligence reports that suggested aggressive hybrid attacks conducted by a 'foreign state' targeting the elections. These attacks included coordinated misinformation campaigns on social media and cyberattacks aimed at influencing public opinion in Georgescu’s favor. Soon after the reports were released, the foreign actor was confirmed to be Russia. In light of these findings, the Constitutional Court annulled the first-round results on December 6, citing Article 50, paragraph 3, of Romania’s electoral law, which allows for annulment if significant fraud or interference likely impacts the election’s outcome. The court ruled that the documented Russian interference met this threshold, rendering the results invalid and mandating a rerun of the electoral process. The annulment decision was met with criticism from both Georgescu and Lasconi who viewed it as undermining democratic processes. Despite these objections, the court’s ruling is final, and preparations are underway to reschedule the presidential election. In the interim, President Iohannis remains in office until a new election is conducted. The Questions Brought Forward The recent events in the Romanian electoral process highlight two unprecedented actions taken by institutions in a democratic country. First, it is the first time that an intelligence agency report on a foreign actor’s interference in the election process was issued before the electoral process was finished and declassified for the public during the electoral process. This led to the second unprecedented action: the annulment of the elections and the restart of the electoral process for the presidential elections. All of this leads to a series of immediate questions. The first question to address, from a geopolitical standpoint, refers to whether Russia could indeed have reasons to interfere in the Romanian electoral process at this moment. What does Russia have to gain? Russia’s strategic goal of undermining the West is intricately tied to its objective of fragmenting the European Union (EU) and NATO, two pillars of Western cohesion and security. To achieve this, Russia employs hybrid warfare tailored to exploit the specific vulnerabilities of individual member states. In countries heavily dependent on Russian energy, Moscow leverages economic blackmail, using gas and oil supplies as tools of coercion to influence political decisions and foster divisions within the EU. Conversely, in nations with less reliance on Russian energy, the Kremlin focuses on disinformation and propaganda campaigns. These campaigns often employ messages that resonate deeply with the public, even when they are unrelated to Ukraine or Russia’s actions. Instead, the messages exacerbate dissatisfaction with domestic governments, weaken trust in institutions, and undermine support for common NATO and EU policies. By amplifying sensitive issues such as economic hardships, social inequalities, or controversial policy decisions, Russia seeks to erode public support for pro-Ukraine stances and disrupt the unity required for coordinated Western actions. This multifaceted approach highlights Russia’s adaptability and determination to exploit divisions and vulnerabilities to achieve its broader geopolitical objectives. Romania holds a critical position on NATO’s Eastern Flank, serving as a strategic buffer against potential threats from Russia and acting as a key ally in securing the Black Sea region. As a frontline state, Romania hosts important NATO military infrastructure, including missile defense systems, and contributes significantly to regional security through its robust support for NATO initiatives and Ukraine’s defense efforts. This geostrategic importance makes Romania a natural target for Russia’s hybrid campaigns. By undermining Romanian public confidence in the government and eroding support for NATO and EU policies, Russia aims to weaken the cohesion of the Eastern Flank and disrupt the alliance’s ability to respond effectively to security challenges. Moreover, Romania’s commitment to diversifying energy and reducing dependence on Russian supplies further threatens Russia’s leverage in the region. A pivotal component of this strategy is the Neptun Deep project, the largest natural gas initiative in Romania’s Black Sea sector. Jointly developed by OMV Petrom and Romgaz, Neptun Deep is expected to commence production in 2027, with an estimated annual output of approximately eight billion cubic meters of natural gas, positioning Romania as a significant energy producer and potential exporter within the EU. This development enhances Romania’s energy security and diminishes Russia’s influence over regional energy markets, challenging its traditional role as the primary supplier. Consequently, Russia perceives Romania’s energy ambitions as a direct threat to its strategic interests, intensifying its efforts to destabilize the country through hybrid warfare tactics. These factors explain why Russia has consistently maintained its influence operations targeting the Romanian public over the past two decades, employing themes that resonate deeply with the local population. One of the most prominent narratives has been centered around keeping Romanian natural resources in the hands of Romanians, a message strategically used to undermine American investments in the country’s oil and gas sector, including projects like Neptun Deep. By supporting the framing of foreign investments as a threat to national sovereignty, Russia has sought to foster public resistance to Western economic involvement. Additionally, Moscow has supported campaigns that appeal to Romania’s Christian nationalist sentiment—a characteristic that many Romanians feel distinguishes them within the EU. This narrative often ties Romania to its Orthodox Christian heritage; although, the Romanian Orthodox Church is officially aligned with Constantinople and frequently at odds with the Russian Church. By tapping into these cultural and religious undercurrents, Russia aims to amplify divisions between Romania and its Western allies, erode trust in foreign partnerships, and solidify its influence in the region. Russia began visibly supporting disinformation campaigns in the early 2000s and significantly escalated its propaganda efforts in Romania after 2016. Since then, articles and social media posts promoting official Russian positions started appearing in Romanian. Most of these messages, though published in Romanian, originated from Moldova (where both Romanian and Russian are spoken), rather than from Romania itself. This reflects Moscow’s caution in directly promoting its narratives within Romania, given the country’s deeply entrenched anti-Russian sentiment. Instead, the disinformation focused on socioeconomic and cultural identity issues that resonate with Romanians, employing subtle tactics to shape public opinion without triggering outright rejection. A clear example of the subtlety in Russian disinformation campaigns has been the effort to undermine support for Ukraine in recent years. One of the key messages promoted by Russian-backed platforms focuses on the false claim that Ukrainian refugee children receive higher financial allocations from the state than Romanian children. This narrative is crafted to fuel resentment and sow division, portraying the government as prioritizing foreign nationals over its own citizens. However, these campaigns deliberately omit the fact that the financial support for Ukrainian refugee children is funded by the EU, not the Romanian government. Romania, as a net beneficiary of EU funds, receives significantly more financial support from the EU than it contributes. (This narrative was further amplified during the presidential campaign of populist candidate Călin Georgescu who used it to tap into economic frustrations and nationalist sentiments. Georgescu also incorporated Christian nationalist symbols into his rhetoric, appealing to voters disillusioned with mainstream politics and those seeking to assert Romania’s cultural and religious identity against perceived external threats.) Given this context, the current events raise an important question: If Russia has been actively supporting disinformation campaigns in Romania for years, why has it chosen to escalate its efforts now? What specific gains does Russia hope to achieve by interfering in Romania’s presidential electoral process at this moment? To address this question, it is essential to consider Russia’s posture in Ukraine, focusing on both its strategic and tactical objectives in the ongoing war. Strategically, Russia aims to bring southern Ukraine, including the vital port city of Odesa, under its occupation, ideally before any negotiation discussions commence. This would ensure that Ukraine is deprived of its most efficient means of trading with the world—access to the Black Sea via Odesa. However, achieving this through military means has proven challenging—it is rather difficult, if not impossible, to do that in a few weeks. Tactically, Russia appears to be pursuing an alternative approach: ensuring that, even if Ukraine retains control of Odesa, it becomes increasingly difficult or impossible for the country to export goods through the Black Sea. This broader strategy highlights Russia’s current focus on Romania, a key Black Sea state and NATO ally. Romania has played a crucial role in supporting Ukraine amid the ongoing conflict by serving as a steadfast ally and a vital logistics hub. Since the war began, Romania has facilitated the transit of military aid and serves as a training hub, including initiatives like F-16 pilot training for Ukrainian forces. Additionally, Romania has donated a Patriot missile system to support Ukraine in the ongoing conflict. In maritime security, Romania has been instrumental in ensuring the safe passage of commercial ships through the Black Sea since the war in Ukraine began. After the Grain Deal was ended, Romania facilitated Ukrainian trade by extending both the Danube and the Black Sea ports facilities and helping secure a new corridor going through its coastal waters and those of Bulgaria. This involves operating a comprehensive network of coastal radars and sensors to monitor maritime activities, deploying advanced unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) for patrol and reconnaissance, and securing major ports such as Constanța—a critical hub for NATO logistics and global trade. These efforts underscore Romania’s strategic significance not only in aiding Ukraine but also in bolstering regional stability and supporting NATO’s Eastern Flank during a time of heightened geopolitical tension. All of this supports the theory that Russia has a vested interest in fostering political instability in Romania at this moment, in particular. Such a scenario would disrupt the country’s ability to serve as a reliable logistics hub and ally for Ukraine. Political instability in Romania would weaken its capacity to maintain critical supply chains, aid shipments, and alternative trade routes for Ukraine’s exports, undermining Ukraine’s resilience in the ongoing war. Furthermore, supporting a political candidate in Romania who campaigns on a platform advocating reduced or no involvement in aiding Ukraine, questioning Romania’s commitment to NATO and the EU, and promoting isolationist policies aligns directly with Russian strategic goals. Such a candidate would erode Romania’s role as a cornerstone of NATO’s Eastern Flank, fracture EU and NATO cohesion, and advance Russia’s broader objective of undermining Western alliances and diminishing coordinated resistance to its aggression in Ukraine. The third, and perhaps most important, question is whether Russia’s strategy can succeed within the context of Romania’s national dynamics. This includes Romania’s response to what seems to be an electoral process influenced by Russian interference. After all, it is Romania’s political landscape and the vulnerabilities within its society that have created fertile ground for extremism and Russian propaganda. The answer to this question is complex and requires a multifaceted analysis that considers both immediate and long-term factors. In the short term, the outcomes of recent events, such as the annulment of the election and the steps taken to address Russian interference, will be critical in determining Romania’s ability to maintain political stability and safeguard its democratic processes. These immediate responses will influence public confidence in institutions and the effectiveness of measures to counter disinformation and hybrid threats. However, the long-term implications for Romania’s posture within NATO and the EU must also be considered. Ensuring that Romania remains a resilient and reliable partner in the face of persistent Russian efforts will require sustained investments in institutional capacity and societal resilience. The broader question involves not only how Romania navigates the current crisis but also how it fortifies itself against similar challenges in the future to uphold its strategic role on NATO’s Eastern Flank and as a key ally for Ukraine. But first, there are short-term implications of recent events. The vote for Georgescu and Lasconi reflects a strong antiestablishment sentiment, signaling widespread public distrust in mainstream politics and the institutions perceived to be under their control. While Romanians harbor deep anti-Russian feelings and view Russian aggression as their greatest threat, they also demand clear and credible evidence that the electoral process was influenced or manipulated by Russian interference. Declassified reports from intelligence services, while significant, are insufficient to convince the public, particularly in a country like Romania where trust in the intelligence community remains limited and perceived as part of the establishment. This skepticism stems from historical experiences; during Romania’s communist regime—a system unparalleled in its severity in Eastern Europe and often compared to North Korea—the infamous Securitate, the communist-era intelligence service, was instrumental in maintaining autocratic control. These historical scars make it imperative for Romanian authorities to provide transparent and independently verified proof of electoral interference to restore public confidence in the integrity of the democratic process. Meanwhile, there is significant uncertainty and many unanswered questions about the future of Romanian politics. According to recent statements by President Iohannis, the next government will determine the date for the rescheduled presidential elections. However, the formation of the next government is still in progress, with political negotiations underway. It remains unclear when the presidential vote will be held and whether the recent parliamentary elections were similarly compromised by Russian interference—an issue worth considering, given that an extremist party leveraged Georgescu’s campaign platform to secure parliamentary seats. While the major parties focus on forming a government and selecting candidates for the upcoming presidential elections, extremist groups and Georgescu—who is under investigation yet continues to hold public political rallies—persist in their campaign, openly challenging the authorities’ conclusions about electoral interference. The longer it takes for Romanian institutions involved in the current electoral process to provide clear explanations and actively work to regain public trust, the greater the likelihood that antiestablishment sentiments and the populist, Christian nationalist rhetoric will expand Georgescu’s electoral base and bolster support for a like-minded candidate in the next elections. Delays in addressing these issues create a vacuum where mistrust and frustration can flourish, fueling the appeal of platforms that challenge the establishment. Simultaneously, prolonged political instability and uncertainty take a toll on the economy. Large logistic and infrastructure projects—critical for Romania’s role as a regional hub—are at risk of stalling, especially as populist narratives calling for nationalization gain traction. In the medium to long term, building social resilience while reinforcing democracy will be key. As a young democracy, Romania has had to grapple with the legacies of its communist past, particularly widespread corruption, which has entrenched a clientelistic approach to politics and economics. Despite significant economic growth in recent years, progress has been uneven, deepening polarization and social disparities between urban and nonurban areas. This divide is common throughout Europe and has been exacerbated by multiple global crises since 2008. In Romania, the divide has led to growing criticism of the market-based economy and a resurgence of nostalgia for communism. Many Romanians recall its perceived benefits, such as job security and stability, while attributing the system’s flaws to the shortcomings of the current democratic framework and distrusting the state’s institutions. The real danger of Russia’s strategy lies in its ability to exploit these vulnerabilities by promoting narratives that resonate with the population’s daily struggles and divisions. These narratives focus on tangible challenges, such as poor economic conditions, inadequate public services, and a still-weak institutional framework, making them more likely to gain traction among a disillusioned public. This is further compounded by mistrust in mainstream political parties, their politicians that are perceived as mostly opportunistic with limited training for tackling governance, and the relative weakness of media and civil society, which are frequently criticized for their ties to state institutions. In such an environment, where politicians fail to demonstrate leadership and governance is perceived as vulnerable, a charismatic candidate who appeals to values and beliefs tied to unique national characteristics can easily win hearts and minds, particularly when aggressive disinformation campaigns erode critical thinking among the masses. Strengthening democratic institutions, addressing socioeconomic inequalities, and countering these divisive narratives are critical to building a resilient society capable of resisting external influence. That is only doable long-term. Lessons for the Future The way Romania handles the case of Russian interference in its electoral process has the potential to set a precedent and serve as a model for addressing similar situations in other countries. This case is unique in that it marks the first time credible evidence of Russian meddling has led to the annulment of an election—a significant step in safeguarding democratic integrity. How Romania navigates this challenge, particularly in terms of transparency and public accountability, will be closely observed by other nations facing similar threats. Perhaps Romania can effectively demonstrate that interference was identified, addressed, and neutralized in a manner that reinforces institutional credibility. Then, it will provide a blueprint for responding to hybrid warfare tactics aimed at undermining democratic systems. However, for Romania to truly establish this model, it must ensure that the evidence of interference is presented in a way that gains the trust of its population. Public skepticism, particularly in countries with histories of authoritarianism or weak institutional frameworks, is a significant barrier to such trust. In Romania’s case, the declassified intelligence reports must be supplemented with clear, independent investigations that leave no room for doubt. Additionally, addressing concerns about whether these findings are being used for political maneuvering is crucial. Any perception that the government or establishment parties are leveraging this interference narrative for their own benefit could erode public confidence and detract from the broader significance of addressing external influence. Romania could seize this opportunity to strengthen its institutions and reinforce the importance of transparency and democratic resilience. This includes, in the long term, creating robust safeguards to prevent future interference, fostering independent media, and ensuring civil society has the tools to hold power accountable. By taking these steps, Romania can transform a moment of vulnerability into a powerful example of how democracies can confront and neutralize hybrid threats. If successful, it will protect its own democratic processes and contribute valuable lessons to the international community in countering external interference. Finally, this case also raises fundamental questions about how the values of liberal democracy and the principles of open, transparent systems should be defended in the face of external threats. The way Romania addresses Russian interference in its electoral process is likely to ignite debates about balancing security measures with democratic freedoms, particularly in a system that values free speech and pluralism. As the situation unfolds, it will test the capacity of democratic institutions to act decisively without undermining the liberties that define them. If Romania succeeds in defending its democratic process while respecting the rule of law and individual rights, it could provide a model for how liberal democracies can protect themselves against hybrid threats without compromising their core values. This will be especially relevant for other nations grappling with the same challenge of external influence in a polarized and digitally interconnected world.

Assad Gone, Trump Coming: What’s Ukraine’s Future? – OpEd	Wars can end practically overnight. Just look at Syria, which was locked in a civil war for a dozen years. Having survived a succession of uprisings, Bashar al-Assad seemed on track to become a tyrant for life. Then, in the space of a couple weeks, his allies effectively deserted him, his army melted away, and he and his family had to decamp to the Kremlin. Vladimir Putin is already in the Kremlin, so that’s one place he can’t escape to if things in Russia go south. Unlike Assad, he doesn’t face rebel armies (not yet, at least). But he should still be worried, given Russian losses on the battlefield, in geopolitics, and throughout the economy. How long will it be before Putin and Assad both have to leave town to take up residence in that last refuge of scoundrels, not patriotism as Samuel Johnson insisted, but Pyongyang? That’s certainly not what Donald Trump meant when he said he would end the war in Ukraine on day one of his administration. He was not talking about helping Ukraine retake its occupied territory, precipitating a regime change in Russia and sending Putin into exile. That was the old Republican Party, which was anti-Russian to its core. The new MAGA party, with an illiberal agenda that overlaps with Putin’s, doesn’t have a foreign policy so much as an arsenal of threats. No surprise, then, that Trump’s 'concept of a plan' for ending the Ukraine war seems to consist only of simultaneous threats designed to push the two sides to come to the table and negotiate a ceasefire. The problem is that Putin is in no hurry to compromise. Oblivious to the implications of Assad’s defeat, Russia continues to press its advantage in Ukraine. In November, it seized nearly 11 square miles of Ukrainian territory every day. But these gains have come at a huge cost—over 45,000 total casualties over that same period. The need to bring in 10,000 North Korean soldiers on the Russian side suggests that these casualties are taking their toll. Other signs of Russian desperation include the astronomically high signing bonuses, prisons empty because of dragooned conscripts, and all the Indians and Yemenis tricked into fighting in Ukraine. The Russian economy, meanwhile, is starting to buckle, with inflation running over 9 percent, the interest rate above 21 percent, and rampant labor shortages resulting from all the young men in the army, in exile, or toiling in military industries. Putin soldiers on, regardless. At the top of his wish list, he wants to kick Ukrainian troops out of the Russian territory it seized around Kursk. Next, he wants all of Luhansk and Donetsk provinces (Russia controls almost all of the former but only around two-thirds of the latter). Putin’s maximalist goal is to 'denazify' the Ukrainian government by installing its own Kremlin-friendly regime and disarming the country so that it doesn’t pose any future threat to Russia. The Ukrainians have dug in their heels in the hopes that Putin will eventually scale back to save his own regime. But even holding the line, much less regaining occupied territory, has become increasingly difficult. Ukraine is struggling so much with its own shortage of soldiers that Volodymyr Zelensky has been talking about trading land for peace (plus NATO membership). Such a ceasefire would cede territory (the Donbas, Crimea) to the Russians, but Ukraine would reserve the right to regain the land 'in a diplomatic way' (whatever that means). Despite his willingness to compromise on territory, Zelensky is not giving up. He’s getting another billion dollars in military assistance from the Biden administration as its going-away present. A $50 billion loan collateralized on the interest on Russian assets frozen in the West is on the horizon, with the United States already allocating its share of $20 billion. To bring in enough troops to stop Russian advances, the Ukrainian government may consider further lowering the conscription age. Trump and his minions think they can force both sides to compromise on the disputed territory. That’s a perennial misunderstanding of the U.S. government. After all, this war is not primarily about territory. It’s about ideology. Putin has an illiberal vision that puts Russia at the center of a new anti-Western axis that contests everything from international law to LGBT rights. Zelensky has been thrust into the somewhat uncomfortable position of representing Western values of democracy and human rights. Ukrainians have a more fundamental fear: that an occupying force will throw them in jail, destroy their culture, or execute them in cold blood as in Buchaand elsewhere. Throwing Donald Trump into this mix is like setting off a bomb in the middle of a life-and-death struggle. Maybe, in the chaos and confusion after the explosion, everyone will throw down their weapons. Or maybe they’ll just ignore the bomb thrower, pick themselves up, and fight on with renewed vigor. Neither side has reached the stalemate that the two Koreas experienced in the final two years of that war. So, don’t bet on an armistice taking place on January 21, 2025. Trump’s Concept of a Plan In the world according to Trump, Russia invaded Ukraine because America was weak. Thus, to resolve the crisis, America must be strong again. That’s the essence of the plan from Trump’s envoy, Keith Kellogg. The United States will threaten to stop all aid to Ukraine to push it to the negotiating table. Then, to Russia, it will threaten to increase aid to Ukraine to get the Kremlin to negotiate. NATO membership for Ukraine would be off the table. But Putin knows that plenty of Republicans, and the constituents who put them in office, just want the United States to stop sending money to Ukraine under any circumstance. So, Putin can safely resist the pressure and then sit back to watch the Republican Party tear itself to shreds over the issue. Putin also knows how Kellogg really feels. 'A war born in American weakness can only be ended by American strength,' Trump’s future envoy wrote in testimony to a Senate hearing last year. 'That’s why the path to bringing these negotiations about is to enable Ukraine to defeat the Russian army in Ukraine … and provide Ukraine with the military armament it needs to [do so].' That explains the Russian response to the plan so far. 'Kellogg comes to Moscow with his plan, we take it and then tell him to screw himself, because we don’t like any of it,' Putin ally Konstantin Malofeyev told the Financial Times. 'That’d be the whole negotiation.' The Russians also know how Trump handled negotiations with the Taliban. In his eagerness to withdraw U.S. troops, President Transactional basically sold out the Afghan government and, in the words of his own national security advisor H.R. McMaster, signed 'a surrender agreement with the Taliban.' With a deadline for U.S. withdrawal and no implementation mechanism to hold the Taliban to its promises, Trump set the conditions that led to the disaster the Biden administration had to deal with several months into its first year. Having promised to end the war and stop sending money plus arms to Ukraine, Trump may well find himself in a similar diplomatic quandary vis a vis Ukraine in 2025. He might make promises to Kyiv that resemble what he promised the Afghan government and offer concessions to the Russians that are similar to what he gave the Taliban. Ukrainians, at least, know how that will end. Actually, it’s hard to imagine anyone getting enthusiastic about an Afghan-like peace in Ukraine. A terrible peace has settled over Afghanistan: the peace of the morgue and the jail cell. And that’s precisely the kind of peace that occupied Russian territories in Ukraine currently 'enjoy.' What Can Ukraine Do? The United States offered Ukraine the most armaments, but it wasn’t the only supplier in town. European allies have pledged to pick up the slack, with Germany leading the way. European leaders are reportedly trying to persuade the incoming Trump administration to keep supplying Ukraine for at least one more year. One more year: that’s probably what Russia has the resources for. It’s increasing its military spending tremendously for 2025, but then the budget starts to fall over the next two years. If the Russian economy really goes off the rails as a result of the war, many Russian will abandon their love affair with Putin. Zelensky’s land-for-peace deal is an interim option. Ukraine may have to settle for some vague promises of NATO accession and some current 'security guarantees' in the form of weaponry (but not nuclear weapons) to deter another Russian invasion. If Russia can be arm-twisted to negotiate—or persuaded by the promise of sanctions relief—Ukraine will probably have to swallow some kind of land-for-peace deal, as noxious as that will be. After Russia seized Crimea and parts of the Donbas back in 2014, I compared Ukraine’s situation to that of Aron Ralston, a hiker who found himself trapped in a remote location with his arm pinned by a boulder. Ultimately, he decided to amputate his arm in order to survive. 'If Ukraine wants to move on with its aspirations to move closer to the West, it will probably have to submit to the knife as well,' I wrote. 'Who knows: after many years of international isolation, lukewarm Russian support, and economic stagnation, the ghost limbs might themselves appeal for reattachment. This is not fair, of course. Russia has been playing a dirty game. But no one ever said that geopolitics is fair. The situation that befell Aron Ralston wasn’t fair either. But sometimes you have to do what’s necessary to survive, even if it means cutting away what you hold dear.' Now, a decade later, the situation is more desperate and even more unfair. But Putin could very well be living on borrowed time, just like Assad for the last dozen years. Russia is not all-powerful (exhibit A: the implosion of its close ally Syria), and neither is Putin. The quagmire of Afghanistan set in motion the collapse of the Soviet Union; the quagmire of Ukraine may well spell the end of Putin’s 'Russian world.' Then the residents of the Donbas and Crimea will beg Ukraine, safely settled in the European Union, to welcome them back.

Implications Of UN Resolutions On ‘International Cooperation On P...	By Kolja Brockmann, Dr Mark Bromley and Giovanna Maletta On 2 December the United Nations General Assembly adopted a resolution submitted by China, and co-sponsored by 27 other states, on ‘Promoting international cooperation on peaceful uses in the context of international security’. The new resolution, like its two predecessors adopted in 2021 and 2022, ‘reaffirms’ that the right to benefit from international cooperation in science and technology for ‘peaceful uses’ should not be hampered by states’ implementation of non-proliferation obligations—a principle reflected in different treaties. All three resolutions also ‘note with concern’ that multilateral and national export control measures are infringing on this right by creating ‘undue’ restrictions on transfers of goods and technology for peaceful purposes. The three resolutions have been viewed by many states as a critique of the multilateral export control regimes—the Australia Group, the Missile Technology Control Regime (MTCR), the Nuclear Suppliers Group (NSG) and the Wassenaar Arrangement—and a threat to their long-term viability. This criticism comes at a time when the regimes are facing multiple challenges to their relevance and functioning. This backgrounder assesses the motivations behind the support for the resolutions, the concerns they have raised, and their potential impact on the regimes and global non-proliferation efforts. The 2024 resolution The 2024 resolution on ‘Promoting international cooperation on peaceful uses in the context of international security’ repeats many of the points that were made in 2021 and 2022. However, it adds more critical language about the controls that supplier states are imposing. While the 2022 resolution noted with concern that ‘undue restrictions . . . persist’, the 2024 text states they are ‘increasing’ and include ‘unilateral coercive measures that violate international law’. The 2024 resolution also adds that the ‘non-proliferation control arrangements’ are being used as vehicles for these efforts. The list of steps that states are encouraged to take to implement the resolution now includes ‘formulating guiding principles as appropriate’. However, the language also indicates support for a less radical overhaul of how the regimes should operate than was outlined in 2021 and 2022. For example, while the 2022 resolution emphasized that the regimes ‘should be transparent and open to participation by all states’, the 2024 version says that the regimes should be ‘transparent and inclusive, in line with their respective mandates’. Debates around the ‘peaceful uses’ resolutions China submitted all three resolutions and has put significant effort into building support for them. The number of states voting in favour has increased with each resolution, going from 78 in 2021 to 94 in 2022 and 105 in 2024. Among the states that voted in favour in 2024 were 15 that had either voted against the 2022 resolution (Liberia and Nauru), abstained (Botswana, Brazil, Colombia, Madagascar, Maldives, Saint Kitts and Nevis, and Seychelles) or registered no vote (Azerbaijan, Cabo Verde, Comoros, Guinea, Somalia and Zambia). However, four states that had voted in favour in 2022 abstained in 2024 (Côte d’Ivoire) or registered no vote (Central African Republic, El Salvador and Papua New Guinea). China’s efforts have been viewed by many states and commentators as an attempt to highlight and delegitimize the widening set of export control measures that the United States, either alone or in partnership with its allies, has imposed on China in recent years. These include controls on transfers of advanced semiconductors and related manufacturing equipment and quantum computers. When adopting these controls, the USA has argued that they are aimed at limiting transfers of technologythat might advance China’s military capabilities. The USA has also asserted that they are motivated by China’s military–civil fusion strategy, which has the goal of helping the Chinese military to benefit from developments in China’s civilian sectors and necessitates treating all exports to China as potential transfers to its defence industry. However, at the same time, US officials have spoken about using export controls, domestic subsidies and other policy tools to stay ahead of other states in key technology areas. China has argued that the USA is using export controls as tools of geopolitical competition and has requested dispute-resolution consultations with the USA through the World Trade Organization. The level of support for the resolutions suggests that China and the other co-sponsors tapped into a wider set of grievances, particularly among developing states, concerning the imposition of supply-side controls on transfers of goods and technologies. These grievances include concerns not only about the multilateral export control regimes, including their admission processes and practices, but perhaps more so about national export control measures and the use of sanctions measures by the USA, the European Union (EU) and other Western states. They also reflect disappointment at the perceived failure of some states to honour commitments made in non-proliferation and disarmament treaties to ensure that restrictions are not placed on transfers of technology for peaceful purposes or peaceful uses. Mechanisms for enabling technology transfers for peaceful uses The 1968 Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT), the 1972 Biological and Toxin Weapons Convention(BWC) and the 1993 Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC) all recognize the right of states parties to participate in the ‘fullest possible exchange of’ equipment, material, and scientific and technical information for ‘peaceful purposes’ or ‘peaceful uses’. However, none of these treaties oblige states parties to transfer technologies and all place requirements that need to be fulfilled by the importing states before such transfers can occur. For example, under the NPT, states should transfer sensitive nuclear technology only if the recipients have effective safeguards measures in place. Mechanisms are available to facilitate international cooperation and access to technologies for peaceful uses. The Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) implements various international cooperation activities designed to help states parties to the CWC develop capabilities in areas related to peaceful uses of chemistry, particularly in those with developing economies. The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) plays an important role in achieving the NPT objective to foster international cooperation for the peaceful use of nuclear energy. For instance, the IAEA has established the Technical Cooperation Programme to support ‘transferring nuclear technology to [IAEA] member states’ in support of their ‘key development priorities’. The BWC Implementation Support Unit acts as a ‘clearinghouse for assistance with national implementation’ and manages a database to coordinate assistance requests and offers among BWC states parties, which can include scientific cooperation and joint research. However, these mechanisms, and the ways states have interpreted and implemented relevant treaty provisions, have long been a focus of criticism for developing states. The members of the Non-Aligned Movement have complained for many years that their right to access technology for peaceful uses under the non-proliferation and disarmament treaties is being hampered by trade restrictions on developing states. Countries in the Group of 77 have also highlighted the uneven allocation of resources between programmes facilitating access to peaceful uses and security-oriented activities that organizations like the IAEA are tasked with implementing. In response to this criticism, several initiatives have been launched in recent years to expand on existing efforts to facilitate transfers of technology for peaceful purposes. In 2022 a group of states launched the Sustained Dialogue on Peaceful Uses (SDPU) at the NPT Review Conference. During its first year of activity, the SDPU focused on promoting peaceful uses of nuclear science in the fields of water security, health, and climate change response. Also in 2022, the BWC Review Conference mandated states to develop a mechanism to support the full implementation of Article X of the BWC (‘International Cooperation’), something the Working Group on Strengthening the BWC is currently addressing. In September 2024, UN member states adopted the Pact for the Future, which recognizes the importance of digital cooperation and sharing science, technology and innovation for sustainable development, and outlines a series of actions to advance progress in these areas. The 2024 resolution welcomes the various initiatives for promoting international cooperation for peaceful uses but implies that more needs to be done, urging states ‘to take concrete measures to promote international cooperation on materials, equipment and technology for peaceful purposes’. It also reiterates concerns that developing states have voiced in other forums that both the way the multilateral export control regimes operate and the manner in which export controls are being applied clash with states’ obligations under other instruments. Efforts to clarify the aims of the export control regimes In response to the resolutions, Western states, both at the UN General Assembly and other relevant forums, have noted that the multilateral export control regimes provide many public goods to the benefit of all states, including guidelines, control lists, outreach and engagement opportunities. They have also sought to highlight the role that the export control standards formulated by the regimes play in building trust and confidence and enabling transfers of technology for peaceful uses. Moreover, some states have argued that there is no evidence that the implementation of export controls has a measurable impact on states’ economic development and access to advanced technologies. In support of these arguments, they have referenced studies that indicate that there is a positive correlation between the adoption of export controls and participation in the trade in high-technology and dual-use items. In some cases, these arguments became more pointed during UN General Assembly discussions in 2024. For example, some states made more or less explicit statements that China’s grievances about the imposition of Western trade restrictions were the motivation for the resolution and that China’s military–civil fusion strategy was one of the main challenges to effective multilateral export controls. EU-led side events on the margins of the NPT and UN General Assembly meetings, in which SIPRI took part, sought to facilitate discussions about the regimes’ role in promoting or hampering technology transfers and scientific exchanges. Participating states, in particular the USA, and the EU are also active in the implementation of export control outreach and capacity-building activities that have resulted in many beneficiaries adopting the regimes’ standards and control lists. In public messaging, representatives of the regimes have also sought to show more sensitivity in responding to concerns about the possible impacts of export controls on economic development. For instance, representatives of the regimes have taken steps to raise awareness about the regimes’ functioning, to demonstrate the regimes’ commitment to not impeding legitimate trade and to show the regimes’ willingness to engage with non-participating states. The previous Swiss chair of the MTCR has stressed some of these points during outreach visits and other public events. Argentina and Brazil, in their recent roles as chairs of the NSG, have highlighted ‘the need to balance non-proliferation and international security objectives with the potential impact on states’ technological and industrial development’. The current South African chair of the NSG has announcedhis commitment to working with both participating and non-participating states to facilitate the responsible transfer of technology ‘with special consideration for the needs of developing states’. Despite these efforts, several states that participate in at least one of the regimes have either supported the three resolutions or abstained. In addition to China, Kazakhstan, Russia and South Africa have consistently voted in favour, while India and Mexico have abstained. Brazil, a participating state and outgoing chair of both the NSG and the MTCR, switched from abstaining in 2022 to voting in favour of the 2024 resolution. Conversely, Argentina, which participates in all the regimes, switched from abstaining in 2022 to voting against in 2024. However, there have been few if any indications that the resolutions have adversely affected the substantive work of the regimes. China continues to participate in the NSG and the resolutions do not appear to have had any impact on its and any other participating state’s willingness to join in the group’s work. In contrast, Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022 has had a profound impact on the regimes’ work. Russia participates in the NSG, the MTCR and the Wassenaar Arrangement, and all three require consensus on significant decisions, something that has proved highly challenging to achieve on many occasions since 2022. Risks ahead While the immediate impact of the peaceful uses resolutions on the substantive work of the regimes appears limited, the growing support for the resolutions makes it important to consider the potential broader impact on the global adoption and implementation of export control measures. At the same time, growing support for the resolutions makes it difficult for states participating in the regimes not to engage on the substance of some of the criticism that has emerged at the UN General Assembly and other forums. A deeper analysis of the claims raised by states supporting the resolutions—and whether these point to effects created by the regimes or focus on issues that are outside their purview—could help to identify areas that the regimes could look to strengthen. Many of the states that voted in favour of the resolutions or abstained have engaged with export control-related capacity-building programmes and have put in place national export control systems that apply the control lists and other standards established by the regimes. If emerging economies and non-aligned states move away from working with these programmes and become less willing to adopt the regimes’ standards—something that both the heated discourse and further unilateral actions by regime participants risks provoking—this could leave the regimes significantly weaker and have a negative impact on non-proliferation efforts. Conclusions and ways forward The 2024 resolution on ‘Promoting international cooperation on peaceful uses’ achieved an even stronger result in the UN General Assembly vote than its predecessors in 2021 and 2022. This occurred despite efforts by the regimes and participating states to clarify the roles of multilateral and national export controls and highlight their positive impact on enabling trade in dual-use items. The new resolution comes at a time when the multilateral export control regimes face a growing list of challenges. For example, Russia has reportedly vetoed recent efforts to add new control list entries to the Wassenaar Arrangement, and this is driving calls for the establishment of new mechanisms for adopting multilateral export controls. The adoption of the 2024 resolution, and uncertainties about how exactly the process of ‘formulating guiding principles’ will work, potentially adds to the challenges. One step to move the discussion forward would be to assess how well the current mechanisms for enabling the sharing of equipment and technology for peaceful purposes and peaceful uses are working and what obstacles they have faced. Discussions in the UN General Assembly during 2024 did little to increase knowledge of this issue, as they focused mostly on the proportion of trade that is captured by export controls and how many licences are issued and denied. Recent analyses of efforts to enable transfers of technology show the issue is more complex, with supply-side restrictions being one factor among many, and sanctions measures often being more significant than multilateral and national export controls. The momentum generated by the Pact for the Future potentially creates space to bring diplomats working on non-proliferation, disarmament and development issues into a more comprehensive discussion about how to address challenges related to transfers of technology for peaceful uses. If the multilateral export control regimes are to maintain their role as key providers of global standards in the field of non-proliferation then both the regimes and their participants need to find ways to demonstrate their ability to continue doing their substantive work and overcome fundamental internal divisions. They should also explore how to become more transparent in sharing outputs and creating opportunities for substantive input from non-participants, as appropriate and feasible. The regimes should also participate more actively in meetings and events connected to the non-proliferation and disarmament treaties. In addition, they should play a bigger part in outreach and capacity-building activities conducted by participating states, or like-minded partners such as the EU, to further clarify their roles and create opportunities for dialogue. Finally, states participating in the regimes could also seek to articulate more clearly their regional and international security objectives, and the role export control measures have in supporting the implementation of the non-proliferation and disarmament treaties and international law more broadly. This backgrounder forms part of a wider project on the future of the multilateral export control regimes which SIPRI is conducting with support from the Swiss Federal Department of Foreign Affairs.

Radicalization In The Northern Caucasus – Analysis	By Jason Wahlang and Saman Ayesha Kidwai The growing re-emergence of radicalisation in Russia’s North Caucasus region (Dagestan and Chechnya) must be understood within the broader framework of domestic security challenges and radicalisation trends (white supremacist or Islamist). The Russian state or the regional leaders have not come up with strategies for countering narratives on radicalisation and violent extremism spawned by radicals, which has helped non-state actors to recruit and radicalise recruits. The Islamic State has perpetrated terror attacks in Moscow in March 2024 and Dagestan in June 2024. The attack on Moscow was unprecedented in terms of scale that was not witnessed since the Beslan school tragedy 20 years ago. Radicalisation in the North Caucasus The Northern Caucasus region has been a hotbed of instability and conflict since the collapse of the Soviet Union. Socio-economic disparities have made it a fertile landscape for the rise of extremist ideologies, including Islamist radicalism. The evolution of the idea of global jihad and the emergence of various groups like Al-Qaeda (AQ) and Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS) has further added to the rise of different groups which had pledged allegiance to the two terrorist outfits by exploiting multiple discrepancies and dissatisfaction due to the socio-economic disparities among the population. The populace’s shift in ideological worldview from Sufism to Salafism in the region, with the rising presence of Salafist mosques has further fuelled radicalisation. The radicalisation has not remained confined to the region, with many North Caucasians joining Al-Qaeda and then ISIS’ ranks beyond Russian borders.1 As per reports in 2020, approximately 5,000 men, women and children travelled to Syria to join ISIS from Chechnya and Dagestan.2 The voluntary removal of radicalised and violent extremist individuals from North Caucasus allowed a sense of calm and limited stability to set in over a period of time. However, the region witnessed a resurgence in violence and instability due to the June 2024 attacks in Dagestan. Chechnya Chechen radicalisation occurred towards the end of the First Chechen War, with the local Chechen separatism co-opted by the radicalised elements. During the nascent stages of the Second Chechen War, the influence of Al-Qaeda transformed the once-Chechen identity based nationalist movement into a radicalised and violent extremist Salafist movement. It was during this time that the rise of jihadist tendencies took root in the republic, initiating a period of radicalisation. The Russian counter-response during the Second Chechen War led to a reduction of radicalisation for a limited period. Russia initiated large scale counter-terror operations against violent extremists and separatist groups and individuals. It promoted alternative versions of Islam to undermine extremists’ ideologies and empowered local leaders such as Ramzan Kadyrov. Moscow also promoted welfare programmes to address socio-economic marginalisation. Despite the collapse of the secessionist movements in the republic, radicalisation still found a conducive ecosystem to proliferate. Soon, groups emerged, such as the Caucasus Emirate (an AQ affiliate) and the Vilayet Kavkaz (an ISIS affiliate). The Caucasus Emirate was established in 2007 under the leadership of separatist radical Doku Umarov, who had vowed support to Al-Qaeda. Additionally, two Chechens—Dzhokhar A. Tsarnaev and Tamerlan Tsarnaev—inspired by AQ, carried out the infamous Boston Marathon Bombings,3 thus showing the connect between AQ and rising radicalisation during that period. The Caucasus Emirate activities within Russia lasted only until 2014, with significant defections from the group towards ISIS.4 Resultantly, the turf war saw ISIS gain an upper hand, and the group, along with its regional affiliates, began dominating the terrorism ecosystem in the region. ISIS, similar to Al-Qaeda, tapped into secessionist tendencies within the region to foment radicalisation and advance its brand of Salafi-Jihadism. This shift in the ideological and theological understanding of the separatist movement in Chechnya, which saw the rise of the Salafist elements, had a spillover effect on other republics, including neighbouring Dagestan. Dagestan Dagestanis, like Chechens, sought independence from the Russian state and its local movements were also co-opted by radical elements and extremists. These developments provided extremist Chechens a critical opportunity to establish a haven in Dagestan, for example, through Kavkaz Vilayet. Similar to the past, where a civil war-like climate was evident in the republic from 2010 till 2014 due to the presence of the jihadi groups,5 Dagestan has remained rife for exploitation by radicalised elements. It recently saw a significant terror attack and a rise in antisemitic events, including an intended attack at the airport in the capital, Makhachkala, which targeted travellers flying in from Israel. This has shown that while Chechnya remains of interest for the jihadi groups, Dagestan has gained increasing prominence among violent non-state actors. Use of Propaganda and External Conflicts In April 2024, ISIS-affiliated Ingush militants, under the guise of mujahadeen of the ‘Ingush Jamaat of the Wilayat Kavkaz’, appealed to the North Caucasus population to join ISIS.6 Similar propaganda has gained traction since Russia’s war push with Ukraine. This can be seen as an attempt of the group to revive ISIS’ Caucasus branch, which had been inactive for years due to the heightened alertness and counter-terror measures applied by Russian forces. Moreover, as part of its turf war with ISIS, AQ has chosen to use the events in Aleppo to disseminate propaganda hailing HTS and other rebel forces’ advance in the war-torn city and its re-emergence as a potent actor in North Caucasus. Despite HTS publicly severing ties with AQ in 2016, doubts remained about the nature of their ties. The recent pronouncements made by AQ celebrating the rebel success in Aleppo reinforced that scepticism. For example, in one of its recent posts, AQ in the Arabian Peninsula proclaimed7 its ‘support and congratulations’ for the HTS campaign and emphasised the need to fight unitedly against the regime forces and its allies (including Russians) by underlining ‘Tawhid’ (belief in oneness and unity of God). Considering that it has failed to garner much traction through propaganda and attacks since ISIS’ rise, AQ could be looking to make inroads again into a region which has remained volatile. However, it is to be seen whether AQ can push back against the notoriety gained by ISIS, more so after the March 2024 attacks in Moscow and the June 2024 attacks in Dagestan, by tapping into events in West Asia to its advantage. At the same time, it is necessary to exercise caution about the implications of factions such as the Turkistan Brigade8 (comprised of violent extremists from Central Asian countries like Uzbekistan and Tajikistan), which has joined hands in the offensive against Assad’s forces. Its members could adapt the lessons learned and tactics to fit the Russian landscape once this conflict recedes as the situation in North Caucasus grows more volatile. Central Asian migrants have been subject to animosity in Russia due to their brethren’s participation in ISIS-related activities9 over the years. The ‘Migrant Expulsion Regime’10 adopted by Russia’s Duma in July 2024, which eased the deportation of Central Asian migrants, especially those suspected of extremist activities, is expected to fuel terrorist propaganda due to reports of rising xenophobia, particularly by ISIS. This terrorist organisation has long expressed disdain for Russia and amplified its propaganda and recruitment efforts directed at vulnerable Central Asians. Conclusion Despite past attempts to curb radicalisation, the current geopolitical and geostrategic disruptions caused by events in Ukraine and Syria could equip violent non-state actors to further destabilise the North Caucasus and the wider Russian state. Rising propaganda could attract more radicalised populations to join the Islamic State or other terror groups, even giving space to AQ to re-emerge as a strong contender. Disgruntled citizens in Grozny, for instance, protested against partial mobilisation announced by the Russian government to bolster its war efforts in Ukraine. This dissatisfaction against the state’s policies stemmed from festering resentment and concern about the war’s impact on the Chechen population. The Chechen population and the Russian state finds themselves at loggerheads on security issues. Despite the Russian leadership accommodating the demands and concerns of the protestors, it is likely that the disillusionment among the locals might fester over time contributing to further radicalisation.

Can Trump Save The Dollar? – OpEd	By J.R. MacLeod During his 2024 presidential campaign Donald Trump repeatedly and in grave terms highlighted the possibility of the US dollar losing its world reserve currency status. This occurred at summits with business leaders at the New York and Chicago Economic Clubs. Trump occupies a rather unique position in this debate since he recognizes the real possibility of the dollar losing its world currency status, he opposes this change and wishes to prevent it, and yet he is not a paradigmatic member of the ruling class. However mainstream he is—today or in the past—he doesn’t possess the establishment credentials of a Ben Bernanke, for instance. Since Trump doesn’t want the dollar to lose reserve currency status, his acknowledgment that this is a real possibility should at least serve as ammunition against those who are oblivious to this change, or who claim that it isn’t happening. Typically, when dollar defenders argue that the loss of reserve currency status is an impossibility, they are arguing against those who wish for this change to happen. When Trump says that the dollar could lose its reserve status—even though he opposes this change—it at least undercuts the factual basis of those dollar defenders who claim its status is secure. Admittedly, the possible loss of reserve currency status is not a short-term trend. Anyone claiming the demise of the dollar is imminent—and particularly anyone trying to sell you a financial package on this basis—should be treated with skepticism. But there is a bizarre school of thought which downplays all blows to the dollar’s position, and claims that these events are insignificant. There are, in fact, many significant events occurring, and they are stacking up to present a real threat to the dollar’s position. Events such as Saudi Arabia trading oil in other currencies, BRICs countries developing a new payment system, and China rapidly decreasing its holdings of US treasuries. How can these events not mean anything? Source If the dollar is in jeopardy, and Trump wants to save it, the question then becomes: can he save it? One approach to achieving this goal would be to manage the dollar more competently. This would involve less creation of new money (inflation), since many national economies were severely destabilized by the massive inflation of recent years. It would also involve a judicious, non-ideological use of dollar-based power, as opposed to weaponizing the dollar over conflicts where a nation perceives its fundamental interests are at stake, and the US interest is peripheral at best, and unjustified at worst. The other approach would be to get tough; to threaten countries who move away from holding the dollar for forex purposes with either economic or military power. Trump has made noise about both approaches, though he seems to lean most heavily towards the use of tariffs to prevent nations from breaking away. In my view, the aggressive approach would only accelerate current trends, since this was the path taken from Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in 2022 up until now, and it created the situation in the first place. A Trump administration managing the dollar the way it used to be managed could placate other nations and slow down current trends, but I think that is all it could do, rather than permanently halt and reverse these developments. A fundamental rupture has occurred and too many important nations perceive it as a fundamental interest to break the power of the dollar as the world reserve currency in the long term. They may be happier if this process is managed slowly and without disruption, but they are committed to it. In my view, it is impossible for Trump to stop the process of de-dollarization. Regardless of how much success he is able to achieve, we should also ask whether this is the right goal in the first place. Undoubtedly the dollar losing global reserve currency status would cause significant short-term economic pain for the American people. Trump seems to have the noble intention of avoiding this pain, but we also know that markets can respond to these events and get the economy working again rather quickly when left alone. Beyond markets, there is also the calculation, by which the government could adjust the ratio of its gold holdings to the dollar (assuming implementation of a hard gold standard). This is explained by Murray Rothbard in the final chapter of The Case Against the Fed. In the event that the dollar loses its reserve status, this plan could very quickly restore the currency to a sound position. It may seem noble to attempt to reinforce the reserve status of the dollar, but defending the Fed, the fiat dollar, and global reserve currency status are the economic equivalent of defending death by strangulation just because it’s slow. This currency system supports the bloated welfare-warfare functions of the government. It has hollowed out American industry by financialization and the fact that dollars can be created out of thin air to pay for goods and services domestically and abroad. This tremendously undercuts genuine production and wealth generation. Because this system creates such an unnatural and unproductive economy, and though this economy has such pernicious effects on society, collapse is inherent in the system sooner or later. The longer the system lasts, the more rot sets in, and the worse the eventual collapse will be. This discussion brings us to the subject of institutionalism. There is a powerful tendency in politics to regard an institution as one’s own, long after one’s own faction has lost it, or even where the institution never belonged to one’s own faction in the first place. Accompanying this is the tendency to want to reform institutions recognized as not aligned with one’s own faction, rather than destroy them. Being unable to recognize when an institution is opposed to one’s political goals, and being unable to recognize when an opposing institution is irredeemably opposed to these goals and, therefore, not subject to reform, can prevent a faction from achieving its desired political goals. In these cases, all energy—by the fact of being directed into these institutions—is then redirected against the goals the political faction wishes to achieve. According to Trump’s stated goals of wishing to revitalize the American economy on behalf of the American people—and not government or corporate special interests—the Federal Reserve and the fiat dollar it supports are irredeemable institutions. Trying to reform and reinforce the status of the dollar as global reserve currency will never achieve these goals. People may be able to point to this or that improvement in economic conditions over the next few years, but I am talking about systemic change and a lasting victory. It is hard to argue that these aren’t necessary over and above small improvements. Between the Biden administration inadvertently and obliviously endangering the global reserve currency status of the dollar through its own incompetence, and Trump’s intention to undo this damage, there is a better path. Any future American administration should create a plan to manage the transition away from the fiat dollar as global reserve currency towards a national gold dollar, that is, a national policy of a 100 percent gold-backed dollar, where other countries are free to set their own monetary policy. This would vastly improve the American economy as well as international relations. About the author: J.R.

War Propaganda And The Fall Of Syria – OpEd	A succession of U.S. presidents have been committed to regime change in Syria. That long-held goal has been achieved in part through a sustained campaign of war propaganda. 'AQ [Al Qaeda] is on our side in Syria.' -- Senior Policy Adviser Jake Sullivan's 2012 email to Secretary of State Hillary Clinton The rapid fall of the Syrian Arab Republic government was both a shock and a catastrophe for that region and for the world. It was incomprehensible that the state which withstood a sustained attack since 2011 from the United States, Israel, Turkey and other NATO members, and gulf monarch states such as Saudi Arabia, would collapse so swiftly. The defeat was political, not military. There was surprisingly little actual fighting on the battlefield. Russia, Syria’s most powerful ally, is engaged in Ukraine, while Turkey, Syria’s nemesis, played a two-sided game of working with its NATO allies while claiming to be negotiating in good faith with Russia. Surely more details are still to come, but treachery and a U.S. commitment to pursuing hegemony won the day and the Axis of Resistance now represented only by Iran, has been dealt a huge blow. The project for a Greater Israel is a reality and the Israeli Defense Forces have destroyed Syria’s air force and navy as Syrian Arab Army soldiers have fled rather than risk capture by the jihadists who have now overrun that country. Syria was the victim of a U.S. regime change plot that began in 2011 and it was carried out by successive administrations with the help of collusion with the media. The U.S. had buy-in for whatever acts it wanted to carry out against Syria because of a sustained war propaganda effort. That effort continued until the last moment before the government fell. After the Barack Obama administration succeeded in destroying the state of Libya and killing its president with the help of jihadist proxies, it turned its attention to Syria in an attempt to replicate that plot. The corporate media assisted with a drumbeat of condemnation against Syrian president Bashar al-Assad. The country, with a long history of supporting dictators and tyrants, declared that Assad was a murderer, a dictator, and a butcher. Their propaganda output included newly created terms such as 'barrel bombs' and a new epithet against anyone who spoke against their regime change project, who were labeled as 'Assadists.' Every tool of war propaganda was put to use, including claims that Assad was using chemical weapons against his people. In a futile effort to end such charges, in 2013, the Russian government assisted the Syrians in destroying their chemical weapons stockpiles , but to no avail. The charges continued without any evidence. Syria was even accused of using chemical weapons on the very day that United Nations inspectors arrived in 2013. The chemical weapons charge was used over and over again and each time the version of events strained credulity. In 2018 the U.S., France, and the U.K. declared they would take military action against Syria if there were any chemical weapons attacks. Like clockwork, on April 7 of that year, 40 civilians were killed in the city of Douma and it was reported that the Syrian government had dropped chemical weapons on the building where the killings took place. But one inspector from the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) cast doubt on that version of events. A leaked document stated, '…there is a higher probability that both cylinders were manually placed at both locations rather than being delivered by aircraft.' The whistleblower disappeared from corporate media accounts, while the likelier explanation that civilians were kidnapped and killed by U.S. proxies, was sent down the memory hole.Consider the odd timeline of events that year. On March 4, a former Russian double agent Sergei Skripal and his daughter were poisoned by a chemical agent in Britain. The British government blames Russia, which has no reason to harm a former spy they swapped eight years prior. Saudi Arabia’s de facto ruler, crown prince Mohammed bin Salman, arrived in London for an official visit on March 7. On March 12, French president Emmanuel Macron stated that France would attack Syria if any chemical weapons are used there. The next day the Russian military claims to have evidence that a chemical attack will be carried out against Syrian civilians as a pretext for war. On March 16 France warned French journalists to leave Syria. Mohammed bin Salman traveled to Washington on March 19. On April 8 the prince known as MBS went to Paris for yet another official visit. On that day Saudi funded jihadist groups and the White Helmets, who were created by a British intelligence officer, reported that a chemical weapons attack occurred in the city of Douma. On April 14, the United States, France and Britain joined in a missile strike against Syria. Just as they had done since 2011, the U.S. media played an important part in supporting U.S. foreign policy as the final blows were being planned. CNN disingenuously reported, 'How Syria’s rebel leader went from radical jihadist to a blazer-wearing ‘revolutionary.’ ' Abu Mohammed al-Jolani is no longer called a 'radical jihadist' leader of Hayat Tahrir Al Sham (HTS) because CNN and the rest of western media orchestrated the transformation. They didn’t interview al-Jolani in years past, but he and his handlers have now been coached in how the game is played. 'I believe that everyone in life goes through phases and experiences…As you grow, you learn, and you continue to learn until the very last day of your life.' It is easy to grow and learn with the help of media image makers. CNN was not alone in offering a helping hand while behaving as an innocent bystander. The British Broadcasting Corporation was also part of the charade with what was essentially the same headline used by CNN. 'From Syrian jihadist leader to rebel politician: How Abu Mohammed al-Jolani reinvented himself.' Reinvention is easy when corporate media offer a helping hand. Al-Jolani was once wanted by the U.S. In 2017, the State Department announced a reward of up to $10 million for his capture. 'We remain committed to bringing leading AQS figures in HTS to justice.' That announcement from the first Donald Trump administration was also phony. Barack Obama and Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and her successor John Kerry knew quite well that their proxies were members of ISIS and Al Qaeda offshoots. The use of jihadists as proxies has a long and ignoble history. In 1993, the British newspaper The Independentinterviewed Osama bin Laden, hailing him as an 'Anti-Soviet warrior' who used his armies for peaceful purposes. The man who less than ten years later would mastermind the attacks of September 11, 2001, and become a hated villain, had, in fact, been a western ally fighting the Soviet Union in Afghanistan beginning in the days of the Jimmy Carter administration. After many fits and starts, the coup de grace has been delivered. The Syrian people who either lived through war or who were forced to become refugees around the world are now ruled by numerous groups of warring jihadists. The U.S. has won a decisive victory and Israel immediately enlarged its occupation of Syria. Before the details of this change of events are known, it is important to point out what is already known. The west and their agents in the Western Asia region have schemed to take over Syria for many years, and they utilized war propaganda as one of their weapons. They will continue to do so as they work to consolidate their malicious but successful handiwork.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfND9YsuDFJI49NN1UtASiM	2024-12-11T16:28:03-08:00	
The Faircloth Amendment Blocks The Construction Of Affordable Hou...	Randall Irvin has been waiting for public housing in Chicago for six years, and his situation is not that unusual. For example, there are over 100,000 families on San Antonio’s waitlist for public housing. In Chicago, there were more than 200,000 families on the waitlist in 2023. Public housing waiting lists are extremely long because there is an inadequate supply – and a 1998 amendment to federal housing law is a significant barrier to building new housing. Table 1 lists the average number of months households waited before they were able to receive public housing in selected metropolitan areas according to the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development. It ranges from a low of 11 months in San Antonio to a high of 84 months (7 years) in Miami. These numbers hide the wide range of variation around the average. In the city of Chicago, families can wait for as few as six months or as long as 25 years depending on the specifics of their situation and their family size. Households that are still waiting for housing or that never receive housing are not included in the calculation of the averages, so these average wait times do not fully capture the difficulty of obtaining public housing. The families remaining on public housing waitlists for housing for years are in desperate situations. They are people who are homeless, who are living in unsafe and unsanitary conditions, and who are struggling to afford their housing. In Washington, D.C., Rosalynn Talley, who waited 14 years for public housing, described her overcrowded housing situation as being 'smashed up like sardines.' Her neighborhood was also unsafe, and there was mold in the house. Congress is to blame for the low supply of public housing. In 1998, Congress passed theFaircloth Amendment which put a cap on the number of public housing units. The cap and the consistent underfunding of public housing has caused the number of public housing units to decline 40 percent from 1.4 million in 1994 to 835,000 in 2022 while the need for affordable housing has steadily increased. Public housing is one of the most affordable forms of housing, but affordable housing policy has shifted to relying on the Low-Income Housing Tax Credit (LIHTC). LIHTC goes to private developers and investors and creates 'affordable' housing that is often more expensive to renters than public housing. The Joint Center for Housing Studies reports that 'LIHTC [housing] does not necessarily protect a renter from [housing] cost burdens.' While the Faircloth Amendment has been a benefit to the for-profit real estate industry, it has hurt low-income renters. Thankfully, there are some in Congress working to undo this bad law. The Homes Actintroduced by Sen. Tina Smith (D-Minnesota) and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-New York), if passed, would repeal the Faircloth Amendment and provide the funding needed to address the maintenance and repair backlog in public housing. Currently, the bill has 40 supporters in the House of Representatives and two supporters in the Senate. Repealing the Faircloth Amendment would open another channel to address the affordable housing crisis.

Gaza’s ‘Lost Generation’ Faces Bleak Future – OpEd	By Osama Al-Sharif UNRWA Commissioner-General Philippe Lazzarini this week made a fresh appeal to the world community to save Gaza’s children from becoming 'a lost generation.' He was referring to the fact that more than 600,000 children in the Strip have had no access to formal primary education since October 2023. Since Israel launched its retaliatory attack on Gaza more than a year ago, it has brushed aside criticisms and denunciations over its deliberate bombing of schools and hospitals. The destruction of Gaza’s infrastructure, such as sanitation and water treatment facilities, is seen as having no military value for Israel. Doctors Without Borders has described what is happening in Gaza as a 'war without rules.' It added that, as of Nov. 5, according to the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, a mere 17 of Gaza’s 36 hospitals remained functional, and only partially so. Eleven field hospitals (five fully functioning and six partially functioning) were operating at that time. But in northern Gaza, where Israel is forcing tens of thousands of Palestinians to abandon their homes, all vital public facilities, including schools and hospitals, are now on the brink of collapse. Last week, four doctors were killed at Kamal Adwan Hospital in besieged northern Gaza after Israeli forces stormed the compound, killing and injuring dozens of people in the surrounding areas. Israeli troops also forced healthcare workers and patients to leave the facility. According to a statement by Dr. Hussam Abu Saifya, the hospital director, they destroyed critical medical supplies. The Israeli army has besieged all three remaining hospitals in northern Gaza and they are being targeted daily. With no access to health or education, more than a million children in Gaza are facing horrific living conditions. Those who are in designated safe areas are facing malnutrition, diseases and a lack of sanitary services. The education system has all but collapsed. According to Save the Children, about 30 percent of the 11,300 identified child victims in Gaza between last October and Aug. 31 were younger than five, according to a newly published breakdown of the ages of about 34,000 people whose deaths have been verified by Gaza’s Ministry of Health. Of those, more than 700 were aged under 12 months. Another 2,800 dead children have yet to be identified. In March, Save the Children issued a report that warned of 'complete psychological destruction,' adding that 'children in Gaza have suffered 'relentless mental harm.' According to the Health Ministry in Gaza, more than 44,000 Palestinians have been killed since October 2023 and at least 17,000 of them are children. The lost generation that Lazzarini is talking about is now a reality. No one has an idea how this war will end or when. But what is certain is that, even when it ends, more than a million Palestinian children in Gaza will continue to suffer from psychological and physical trauma. It is almost impossible to imagine how the education system can ever be restored. Israel has destroyed nearly all universities and 90 percent of schools have been either severely damaged or destroyed. The same applies to the health system, which also lies in ruins. UN experts in April expressed grave concern over the pattern of attacks on schools, universities, teachers and students in the Gaza Strip, raising serious alarm over the systematic destruction of the Palestinian education system. 'With more than 80 percent of schools in Gaza damaged or destroyed, it may be reasonable to ask if there is an intentional effort to comprehensively destroy the Palestinian education system, an action known as ‘scholasticide,’' the experts said. This term refers to the systematic obliteration of education through the arrest, detention or killing of teachers, students and staff and the destruction of educational infrastructure. Experts, including Israelis, agree that Israel has run out of military targets in Gaza. The systematic bombing of schools and hospitals is instead aligned with political goals: making Gaza unlivable, the displacement of hundreds of thousands, and ethnic cleansing. The targeting of so-called safe areas, like Mawasi near Khan Younis, has only one goal: terrorizing the civilians, who are primarily women and children. While the International Court of Justice deliberates on whether Israel is carrying out genocide in Gaza, it is disturbing that the court has remained silent over Israel’s destruction of hospitals and schools and the use of starvation as a weapon, in violation of its provisional order issued in January. In January, the court found it plausible that Israel’s acts could amount to genocide and issued six provisional measures, ordering Tel Aviv to take all measures within its power to prevent genocidal acts, including avoiding and punishing incitement to genocide, ensuring aid and services reach Palestinians under siege in Gaza and preserving evidence of crimes committed in Gaza. Israel has targeted UNRWA staff and buildings in Gaza from the onset, knowing full well that the agency provides essential services to hundreds of thousands of Palestinians in the Strip. Despite living under Israeli blockade for decades, Gaza had among the most developed education and health systems in the region. It is horrifying that the deliberate destruction of both is meant to deny those who survive the war any hope of having access to a decent education or an acceptable health system. The current Israeli government has taken steps to partition the narrow Gaza Strip and create buffer zones that no Palestinians will be allowed to enter. What was already the most crowded strip of land in the world will become even smaller. How the surviving people of Gaza will manage their lives under such conditions is difficult to imagine. The lost generation of Palestinians in Gaza will be at the mercy of radicals and opportunists. Israeli atrocities have left indelible scars in the hearts of hundreds of thousands of young Palestinians. How that generation views Israel today and in the future puts the whole narrative of peace-building and coexistence in the region in doubt.

How To Secure Syria’s Weapons Of Mass Destruction – Analysis	By Can Kasapoğlu The Ongoing Threat from Assad’s Weapons of Mass Destruction This weekend, a joint offensive of various armed opposition groups toppled the dictatorship of Syrian strongman Bashar al-Assad, ending his clan’s 53-year rule. But while the Assad regime is gone, its WMD program remains an urgent problem for the international community. Assad, who is believed to have fled to Russia, leaves a legacy marked by the pursuit and use of WMDs. In 2013, when Syria joined the Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC) and agreed to disarm its chemical weapons program, the Assad regime reportedly declared 1,300 tons of chemical warfare agents and precursors and 1,230 unfilled WMD-delivery munitions across 41 facilities at 23 different locations. But declassified Cold War–era data and recent military intelligence assessments suggest that Syria’s chemical warfare efforts run even deeper than those figures suggest. Just last week, Izumi Nakamitsu, the United Nations under secretary general and high representative for disarmament affairs, warned the UN Security Council that unresolved issues surrounding Syria’s elimination of its chemical weapons program are 'extremely worrying.' In its 2023 special report, the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) also noted that the Assad regime may possess undeclared stockpiles of chemical weapons. This would be no surprise given that Assad’s Syrian Arab Army used lethal agents against its own people long after its 2013 commitment to disarm—including a sarin nerve gas attack on April 4, 2017, in the town of Khan Shaykhun and a deadly chemical salvo on April 7, 2018, in the town of Douma. In response to these violations, Washington (and later a coalition of the United States, France, and the United Kingdom) struck Syria’s chemical weapons production centers and related military targets. The need for similar international cooperation to address the threat posed by Syria’s weapons of mass destruction is no less urgent now that Assad is gone. Three items are of particular concern to the West: VX nerve agent stockpiles, unknown biological weapons capacity, and recent snake venom derivative production. VX Nerve Agent Of the Assad regime’s chemical warfare agents, VX is perhaps the most dangerous. VX rapidly disrupts the signals the brain sends to vital organs, and even limited exposure to the agent can kill a person in minutes. It can be disseminated through aerosols or dispersed into food and water supplies. According to experts, Syria possesses a substantial quantity of VX. Weapons inspectors have also found undeclared traces of the nerve agent in the country. The West needs to secure the regime’s stockpile of this deadly chemical weapon lest it falls into the hands of terrorist groups or rogue states. Biological Weapons Know-How and Research Syria signed but never ratified the Biological Weapons Convention. In July 2012 Syrian Foreign Office spokesman Jihad Makdissi stated that Damascus would never use its chemical or biological weapons, implicitly acknowledging their existence for the first time. In 2014, James Clapper, then the US director of national intelligence, assessed that Syria’s biological weapons program may have progressed beyond research and development and achieved a limited capability to produce biological agents. Clapper also affirmed what many had suspected: that Assad’s Syria had cooperated with North Korea on weapons of mass destruction. Experts have testified before Congress that Pyongyang has managed to weaponize various bioagents, including the contagious and deadly smallpox. Several publications suggest that Damascus and Pyongyang might have acquired smallpox strains from the 1972 Yugoslavian outbreak and modified them. The potential that Syria and North Korea exchanged bioweapons underscores why the international community needs to heighten its vigilance and cooperation to address future WMD threats. Snake Venom Derivatives Open-source intelligence also suggests that Syria’s Scientific Studies and Research Center (CERS) has been researching bioweapons derived from the venom of snakes, including the Indian cobra. That snake’s venom contains powerful post-synaptic neurotoxins and a dangerous cardiotoxin that can beweaponized. Moreover, a pharmaceutical research center run by the Razi Institute in the Iranian city of Karaj might be attempting to weaponize the venom of another lethal snake, the Caspian cobra. Tehran’s military-grade biological research has previously been linked to the Razi Institute, particularly the institute’s vaccine and serum programs. In recent years, Tehran and Damascus have boosted cooperation between Syria’s CERS and Iran’s Razi, raising eyebrows over the rogue states’ research into bioweapons derived from naturally occurring toxins. Previously, the Islamic Republic sought to employ scientists from the Soviet Union’s massive germ warfare program. Though unconventional, these weapons would be deadly in the wrong hands. Securing Syria’s Weapons of Mass Destruction Containing an established and well-dispersed WMD program is no easy task. Yet concerned nations have already begun efforts to ensure that the threat from Syria’s weapons of mass destruction dies with the regime that built the weapons. This weekend, the Israeli Air Force launched a series of attacksagainst Syrian military airbases suspected of harboring chemical weapons. The international community should be ready to intervene further at the first sign that Syria’s chemical weapons stockpiles are at risk of being seized by nefarious actors. The OPCW should be granted full access to any undeclared chemical weapons sites. Safeguarding the regime’s documentation of its chemical weapons program—and military uses of it—will likely be a high priority for those seeking to levy war crimes charges against Assad and his generals. In this respect the armed opposition’s rhetoric has been somewhat promising, but still needs to be proven reliable. Furthermore, the West should encourage the new Syrian regime to comply with the Chemical Weapons Convention and ratify the Biological Weapons Convention. The United States and its allies should also work to prevent Syria’s weapons of mass destruction from falling into the hands of hostile actors such as Hezbollah and its backers in Tehran, as well as al-Qaeda and the terrorist networks of the Islamic State (ISIS). The personnel involved in the research and production of chemical and biological weapons are as important as the agents they produce. Terrorist networks and rogue states will stalk these experts to all corners of the world to acquire their knowledge. Keeping intelligence channels open with the incoming Syrian governance structure will be essential in tracking and securing these critical personnel. Though Bashar al-Assad’s dictatorship has fallen, his regime’s weapons still threaten the world. The West should remain vigilant to contain the chaos that is consuming Syria as best it can.

From South Africa To Syria, Rising Perils For Palestine Solidarit...	The sudden regime overthrow in Syria and the long-delayed opportunity to confront the legacy of Bashar al-Assad’s tyranny are either being celebrated or condemned, as explored below, but they come at a time that poses profound problems for solidarity with Palestine. In Johannesburg, these problems are particularly acute given contradictions exposed last week. There was first, the South African government’s two-faced approach to Israel – condemnatory at The Hague, yet with President Cyril Ramaphosa apparently now backing away from anti-genocide ‘megaphone diplomacy,’ and allowing increased profiteering from local exports into Israel (coal especially, but also diamonds, grapes and even bullets) – just at the moment, second, that Ramaphosa took up formal leadership of the G20 group of wealthy and middle-income states, as the baton was passed from Brazilian President Lula Ignacio da Silva. To signal the dangers associated with G20 fusion of imperial and sub-imperial economies, Ramaphosa began preparing to host the November 2025 Summit here in his primary hometown by obsequiously offering a state visit and round of golf to Donald Trump. Also underway this week are meetings between G20 finance ministry and central bank officials planning their 2025 reform agenda. Moreover, there is increasing clarity on G20 climate change policy, thanks to a refusal at the recent Baku UN climate summit by South Africa’s new white, rightwing environment minister, Dion George, to respect the African delegates’ critiques of Western climate finance offerings. But before exploring such African fissures and G20 fusions on another occasion, two urgent challenges arise due first to Ramaphosa’s retreat from Palestine solidarity, and second to the fall of the half-century old rule of the Assad family on December 8 followed by Moscow exile. Pretoria enters the West Asian drama, this time stage right A common concern in Johannesburg is that the reinsertion of Trumpism in coming weeks will hasten the genocide of Palestinians and erasure of their homelands, and further destabilize not only West Asia, but also amplify a long-lasting Washington-Pretoria-Tel Aviv relay in which mutual economic interests dominate. Beyond the historical function of the three states collaborating in 1970s-80s nuclear weapons technology, the relay dates most conspicuously, a decade ago, to Ramaphosa predecessor Jacob Zuma’s capitulation to Barack Obama and local South African Zionists during an earlier Gaza War. A repeat performance is most worrying to progressives here, in large part because South Africa’s Richards Bay bulk minerals port has become – since August – the world’s main terminal for exporting coal to Israel, which depends on the Orot Rabin and Rutenberg power stations for nearly 20% of its energy grid. It is to be expected that Trump will go on the offensive against the South African filing of the International Court of Justice (ICJ) genocide case against Israel. Trump is a proponent of Israel’s mass murder and illegal settlements, callingpredecessor Joe Biden a 'very bad Palestinian' during a debate last June, for not sufficiently helping Netanyahu to ‘finish the job’ in Gaza. But instead of helping to build the global movement against Israel by highlighting Trump’s threats, Ramaphosa’s new Ambassador to Washington Ebrahim Rasool – formerly part of the ruling party’s leftwing currents – let slip in an interview this week: 'We need to put away the [Palestine-solidarity] megaphone now. And the president’s words were, it is now sub judice… I understand the need to completely recalibrate…that’s the art of the deal. It is about framing the messages in particular ways that make South Africa an ally [of Trump].' Some might be surprised at this betrayal, including Ramaphosa’s nonsensical sub judice posture. Yet beyond its important ideological advocacy megaphone used at the Hague international courts, the Pretoria government has barely lifted a finger for Palestine. Backlash against Pretoria begins The Boycott Divestment Sanctions ‘BDS’ strategy called for by the broadest-ever range of Palestinian civil society in 2005 peacefully addresses one of Israel’s major vulnerabilities: fossil-energy supply. Yet Ramaphosa’s brother-in-law Patrice Motsepe runs a major mining house that partners with Glencore – as did Ramaphosa himself until he became deputy president in 2014 – and thus serves as the main co-supplier of coal to fuel Israel’s genocide of Palestine. Activists insist on BDS, on ending diplomatic recognition of Israel, and on prosecution of South African mercenaries who illegally serve the Israel Defense Force, but they are making virtually no progress. Roshan Dadoo, the coordinator of the local Boycott Divestment Sanctions BDS Coalition, wrote in Amandla! magazine last week, 'South Africa is increasingly being seen as hypocritical, as it does not follow through with implementing the findings of the ICJ… Government has certainly not taken all measures within its power. The Department of International Relations and Cooperation says that coal sales to Israel are a trade-related matter. The BDS Coalition Energy Embargo campaign has been trying to meet the Department of Trade, Industry and Competition, but with little success. A meeting was set up and then cancelled at the last minute, leaving activists frustrated.' Reflecting that frustration, leading personalities associated with South Africa’s three main (often fractious) local progressive political traditions – which might be termed ‘multipolar’, ‘independent-internationalist’ and ‘liberal-constitutionalist’ – penned a strong Open Letter last week: respectively, former Intelligence Minister Ronnie Kasrils, trade union leader Zwelinzima Vavi and anti-apartheid veteran Rev. Frank Chikane. They warned, 'It looks increasingly like the South African government is reluctant to follow its own logic and uphold its legal obligations to isolate and sanction apartheid Israel.' According to Kasrils, Vavi and Chikane, those obligations include following the International Court of Justice (ICJ) Advisory Opinion ruling offered in July, to halt 'aid or assistance in maintaining the situation created by Israel’s illegal presence in the Occupied Palestinian Territory.' The vast majority of countries voting at the UN General Assembly in September (including South Africa) agreed with the ICJ, that the world must 'prevent trade or investment relations that assist in the maintenance of the illegal situation created by Israel.' Coal fuels genocide But as Kasrils, Vavi and Chikane observe, coal mined especially by Swiss-based Glencore and its longest-standing Johannesburg partner since 2006, African Rainbow Minerals (ARM), is still being 'supplied to Israel to generate electricity used to fuel genocide, the Israeli Occupation Forces, including production of military equipment, and maintaining the system of apartheid and illegal settlements.' In spite of ICJ and UN mandates, trade minister Parks Tau claimed in parliament when asked about coal a few weeks ago, 'Sanctions applied by one member against another in the absence of multilateral sanctions by the United Nations would violate the World Trade Organisation principle of non-discrimination and would open the country to legal challenge.' Tau’s specious argument results in his refusal to regulate a dangerous export, a commonly-used state tool. Tau is not the only minister to ignore appeals to abide by the ICJ/UN mandate to disempower the Israeli genocidaires. Pretoria’s Transport Minister Barbara Creecy also refuses to answer BDS correspondence, though she is responsible for Transnet, whose 'rail shipments and Richards Bay port facilitation subsidize the export of coal, which is a state-owned natural resource,' complain Kasrils, Vavi and Chikane. Another guilty of dereliction is Environment Minister George, who last month co-chaired the climate mitigation committee of the UN climate summit in Azerbaijan (which is also the main supplier of oil to Israel). As Kasrils, Vavi and Chikane point out, over the past year, with a coal price 'average of $110/ton, Glencore earns net profits of $40 for each ton of coal sold, what with production costs of $70/ton. Each ton burned creates 2.6 tons of CO2 emissions. The resulting ‘social cost of carbon’ is $1056/ton burned, resulting in a net negative impact of nearly $2-billion climate damage due to South African coal sold [to Israel] since October 2023. So, these coal shipments fuel both Israel’s genocide and the climate crisis.' South Africa’s supply is increasingly vital to Israel, which currently relies on coalto power 17.5% of the electricity in its national grid. The last time fully-disaggregated UN Comtrade coal data were available, in 2021 (before Russia disguised its trade due to sanctions), Israel imported 6.5 million tons, of which 50% was Colombian, 36% Russian, 13% South African and 1% Turkish. In 2023 Israel consumed 5.2 million tons. According to a June 2024 SPGlobal report, between January-May 2024, of 1.4 million tons, Colombia accounted for 60% and 'other key suppliers included Russia with 247,500, South Africa at 169,200, the U.S. at 86,100 and China supplying 53,000.' In May 2024, Turkey imposed full trade sanctions on Israel, although dishonest shippers rerouteexports. The maritime-data company Kpler issued South African BDS activists with new data in November for ships bringing coal to Israel’s Hadera and Ashdod coal ports, revealing that a Chinese firm has apparently resumed shipments, along with one from Australia. Another data source, Vessel Tracker, revealed last week that Colombia didn’t conclusively halt coal shipments as anticipated in August, because on November 27 the Navios Felix took a load of coal – most likely from Glencore – to Hadera. The same ship was in Richards Bay on August 11 to load South African coal to Hadera, arriving on September 27, as its owner Navios Partners acknowledgedhow its fleet ships 'for a broad range of high-quality counterparties, such as… Glencore.' Glencore as coal-BDS target As the world’s largest commodity trader, Switzerland-based Glencore offers no apologies or rationale. In May, at Glencore’s Annual General Meeting, one shareholder asked 'if you’re conducting human rights assessments on the use of the coal you’re exporting to Israel to ensure that you’re not held liable'? Board Chairman Kalidas Madhavpeddi replied, 'The company supplies to many countries around the world and it’s almost impossible to tell you the answer to your question.' The shareholder followed up, 'So you don’t check how the coal is being used?' Madhavpeddi replied: 'Coal is used in power generation, that’s simple.' The two Johannesburg-born South African Glencore directors at the AGM – CEO Gary Nagle and Senior Independent Director Gill Marcus – were notably silent during the questioning. In 2006, ARM Coal had been set up thanks to a $135 million loan to Motsepe from Glencore’s predecessor Xstrata, along with nearly half the black firm’s investment capital. The deal was a major reason Motsepe vaulted to becoming South Africa’s richest black businessman. That year, Xstrata bragged of 13 million tons of coal exports from Richards Bay: 'Outside of Europe, Israel was the largest purchaser of the South African operations’ coal production.' Glencore acquired Xstrata in 2013 and inherited the relationship with Motsepe’s ARM Coal. Meanwhile in 2014, Ramaphosa sold his own Glencore-allied firm, Shanduka Coal – including a stake in the enormous Glencore-owned Optimum Mine whose board Ramaphosa chaired – to become SA’s deputy president. As head of the Eskom ‘war room’ in 2014-15, Ramaphosa allegedly instructed the power utility to pay a price 3.5 times the former cost of Optimum coal, with profits to Glencore. Since its 1994 renaming from ‘Marc Rich & Co,’ Glencore has had a terrible reputation in Africa. Initial earnings had included apartheid-era sanctions busting for white South Africa. Its Congolese dealings with Israeli tycoon Dan Gertler continued until the latter’s 2018 blacklisting by the U.S. government. From 2018-22, Glencore was successfully prosecuted under the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act for widespread bribery and corruption across Africa and Latin America, and paid $1.5 billion in fines. (Suspiciously, it has not been subject to prosecution in South Africa.) Colombia’s Israel coal sales were typically 5% of recent exports, but in South Africa’s case the equivalent was usually lower than 1%, although that may rise to 2% in 2024. Earnings from these exports fluctuate with price and quantity: $101 million in 2021; $184 million in 2022; and $78 million in 2023. But the full costs of coal exports – in terms of local pollution, greenhouse gas damage and depleted hydrocarbons, as well as labor, operating costs and environmental remediation – are far higher than gross income. Still, any worker or community adversely affected by BDS against Glencore and other coal mines prevented from selling to Israel, should in 2025 be first in line for compensation from $14 billion in SA’s Just Energy Transition funding. Another demand was made to Glencore at an August 22 Johannesburg protest: pay reparations, just as did Detroit-based General Motors for profiteering in pre-1994 apartheid South Africa. All firms supporting Israeli genocide should now appreciate this risk. More SA-Israel trade, perhaps including arms Stopping coal sales to Israel is crucial but Pretoria also turns a blind eye to the lucrative diamonds and grape trade. And there are new concerns that a 50% upsurge of artillery ammunition being produced by SA parastatal arms firm Denel in a joint venture with German arms manufacturer Rheinmetall finds its way to Israel. Moreover, both in Pretoria last month and in the U.S. state of Delaware’s bankruptcy courts in August, another weapons link was unveiled when Johannesburg native Ivor Ichikowitz declared that several divisions of his Paramount Group – Africa’s largest privately-held arms dealership – were unable to pay creditors. One of Ichikowitz’s bankruptcy protection requests was for Paramount Industrial Holdings, whose Johannesburg factory was subject to an anti-genocide protest in November 2023. Meanwhile, Paramount South Africa – set up in 2018 to allegedly support ‘black economic empowerment,’ but mainly so as to gain access to SA military procurement contracts – is being accused by United Arab Emirates officials of merely asset-stripping Intellectual Property that is technically owed to Abu Dhabi Autonomous Systems Investments, following a London arbitration ruling against Ichikowitz. In the process of Ichikowitz trying to escape a massive debt to the Emiratis’ drone-manufacturing parastatal, he disclosed not only a previously-reported ongoing joint venture with Elbit, but that the main Israeli arms company retains an address at Ichikowitz’s Johannesburg factory. And Ichikowitz also revealed Paramount’s $725,000 debt to the Israel office of Cognyte Technologies, a spyware firm known previously as a component of Verint, which was prosecuted for corruption in the U.S. and criticized by Amnesty International for contributing to South Sudanese surveillance abuses. Cognyte is also under investigation by even the Israeli courts for providing technology to the Myanmar junta as it carried out a coup and massive civilian killings in early 2021. Earlier this year, South Africa’s leading investigative journalists’ non-profit, Amabhungane, objected to the secretive nature of another of Ichikowitz’s divisions that went bankrupt: 'by operating in low scrutiny jurisdictions, the Paramount group might have placed itself outside of the oversight structures in South Africa that restrict military trade. In addition, questions have been raised about the alleged funding of political interests ranging from South Africa’s ruling party to politicians abroad, and whether political connections have enabled the expansion of the company outside South Africa.' For much of 2023, the Ichikowitz Family Foundation was indeed the single largest funder of Ramaphosa’s ruling party, the African National Congress. And later in the year, as the genocide got underway, the same foundation was a brazen, public supplier of tefillin (spiritual leather garb) to the Israel Defense Forces. As South Africa’s anti-genocide ICJ case began, Ichikowitz published articles in the Chicago Tribune andFortune condemning the proceedings. The Delaware court documents suggest the need for a relook by the Pretoria regulator supposedly monitoring such deals, the South African National Conventional Arms Control Committee (NCACC). Several months ago, the notoriously lax NCACC lost a human rights case in local courts for approving an illegal Myanmar arms deal. The same committee had offered late-2023 denials that Ichikowitz and other local firms worked with the Israel Defense Forces, in spite of Ichikowitz’s mysterious Tel Aviv office and his tefillin supply to the genocidaires. BDS must intensify Could BDS help end the genocide and other IDF attacks? Kasrils, Vavi and Chikane conclude, 'As South Africans, we know that sanctions in support of our liberation struggle played a vital role in bringing down the apartheid regime.' Indeed 1985 when financial sanctions caused such a squeeze that President PW Botha declared a debt default, imposed exchange controls and shut the stock market. The response by business leaders was to visit Zambia to meet exiled black leaders, beginning the democratization process, as whites fearful of further meltdown finally accepted ‘one person, one vote’ democracy. But one reason activists suspect sanctions won’t be imposed unless pressure rises, is the role of Motsepe, a generous financial contributor to a range of local political parties. With a net worth estimate of nearly $3 billion, he is Johannesburg’s richest resident. Motsepe is also the president of the Confederation of African Football and therefore, along with other Federation Internationale de Football Association executives, continues to delay suspension of Israel players from international fixtures, a demand made due to their extensive collusion in genocide and apartheid. Will activists overcome Pretoria’s failures to impose sanctions, to cut diplomatic relations as was mandated by parliament in November 2023, and to prosecute young mercenaries who take their gap year after Herzlia and King David High School degrees to serve as paid IDF genocidaires? A growing activist coalition will be needed. Dadoo notes that 'South Africa’s largest trade union federation, the Congress of South African Unions, and its affiliate, the National Union of Mineworkers, support a ban on coal exports to Israel. So do environmental groups and social justice movements in the country.' Long gone are the days Ramaphosa organized a national strike as the National Union of Mineworkers leader, 37 years ago. But links between the various movements are promising, e.g. on August 22 at Glencore’s Johannesburg headquarters and Cape Town oil company branch, and again on October 8 when climate activists included a protest at the Ichikowitz Family Foundation office during an anti-fossils march – in part because of his role providing military ship and air support to protect Big Oil operating offshore Nigeria and Mozambique – and a leader of SA Jews for Palestine addressed the crowd. Syrian chaos Another new factor that makes BDS work more important everywhere, is Syria’s new government. After pounding his citizenry with bombs and bullets since the Arab Spring arrived in Syria in March 2011, leaving more than 600,000 dead and six million exiled refugees, Bashar al-Assad had witnessed the carving of his country into a balkanized set of territories characterized by U.S., Russian, Turkish and Israel land and resource grabs. The stunning 12-day military campaign coordinated by Türkiye-backed Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) and its leader Abu Mohammed al-Jolani, began the day after Lebanon’s remaining Hezbollah leadership signed a dubious cease-fire with Benjamin Netanyahu’s regime, on November 27. On December 6, the Israel Defense Forces demolished the crossing from Lebanon to Syria to prevent Hezbollah from importing arms from Iran, but also to halt any Lebanese fighters’ defense of Assad against the rapid HTS advance into the capital city of Damascus. This has provoked a series of reactions, including at least three dueling leftwing narratives, as usual distinguishing between an emphasis on top-down geopolitricks and bottom-up, social-struggle: 1) a critique of the role of imperialist+sub-imperialist powers – especially Washington-Tel Aviv-Ankara – in a behind-the-curtain, ‘dirty war’ manipulation of HTS jihadis: e.g., in Mohammad Marandi’s account of Recep Tayyip Erdoğan’s and Joe Biden’s current de facto support for al-Qaeda extremists, or in Vijay Prashad’s summation that 'Israeli bombardment of Syrian military facilities had weakened the Syrian armed forces’ logistical and ordinance capabilities… [and] attacks on Iranian supply depots and military facilities in Syria as well as the attacks by Israel on Iran had prevented any build up of Iranian forces to defend the Syrian government… conflict in Ukraine had certainly denied Syria the ability to call upon further Russian assistance… HTS has received aid and support from Turkey, but also covertly from Israel.' 2) in contrast to manipulation, a recognition that for U.S. and Israeli military interests, as Gilbert Achar puts it, 'the Assad regime and HTS are almost equally bad' – so instead, the explanatory emphasis is on sectarian religious infighting (which weakened the government army’s commitment to defend Assad’s terrain) plus degraded Iranian, Hezbollah and Russian support for Damascus, that together, provided a gap for HTS – but leaving profound concerns that the extreme-Islamist values of HTS and allies, and oppression of secular democratic forces, mean very tough times ahead, including for the Rojava movement of progressive Kurds in northern Syria; and 3) a celebration of the role of popular will in overthrowing the brutal Assad, leaving us with a generally-progressive, bottom-up success story containing democratic and anti-patriarchal potentials, notwithstanding some dubious elements and threats of restored sectarian extremism: e.g. in Moazzem Begg’s approving description of ecstatic Syrians who long suffered Assad’s totalitarianism and torture chambers, or in in Michal Karadjis’ interpretationthat 'The Syrian revolution returns with a bang,' and also in the liberal and feminist elements of the Free Syria Certainly each of the three perspectives contain a degree of truth, but just to disclose, my own far-away interpretation lies somewhere between the second (realist) and third (hopeful) arguments, while still recognizing the fundamental truths of the first line of argument: U.S. imperial malevolence, Israeli regional sub-imperialism, and Turkish brutality to its southern neighbor’s citizenry. The overarching point, though, is that waging a thirteen-year long set of diverse struggles by movements with so many fractured elements, means many dirty deals were (and are) done – e.g. the Kurds of Rojava getting on-and-off protection from Washington while still managing to run a quasi-liberated zone deservedly famous for progressive advances in social ecology, feminism and municipal-socialist collaboration in the style of Murray Bookchin’s bottom-up confederalism. At least, for the sake of clarity, Washington’s interests in having a 1000-strong troop presence in Syria were not to support Rojava, no matter the Kurds’ in holding at bay extreme Islam’s armies. Instead, Trump made clear his reason for betraying Rojava by moving hundreds of U.S. army forces around the northeastern region in late 2019, when during a White House meeting he intonedto Erdoğan, 'We want to worry about our things [sic]. We’re keeping the oil. We have the oil. The oil is secure. We left troops behind only for the oil.' Although he is forever committed to resource grabs, Trump has more recently expressed nervousness about the 500 remaining U.S. troops being ‘caught in the middle,’ declaring to Robert F. Kennedy Jr that he wanted to pull them out. Meanwhile this week, not only do the four remaining U.S. army bases in the northeast appear to be fully operational, so are the Russian military’s Tartus Mediterranean naval port and Khmeimim air base in western Syria. Early indications are that the Kurdish liberation movement will defend Rojava, in spite of 100 000 refugees now fleeing violence. The Kurds are fighting the Syrian National Army – which violently captured the city of Manbij just after Damascus fell on Sunday – and also repelling Erdoğan’s ongoing opportunistic attacks. Erdoğan would be furious if an independent Kurdish state emerges from the Rojava Autonomous Administration of North and East Syria, because it would empower progressive Kurdish activists across West Asia, especially in Türkiye. One Rojava statement celebrated Assad’s fall. Yet no one doubts the danger that a full-fledged collapse of Syrian central state power – and ultimately a far worse balkanization and extremist Islamic state – may result from the turmoil. And for Syria’s masses, including Kurds and hundreds of thousands who do not yet dare return from exile, the need for solidarity could again become acute. Balance needed, as Sam Husseini explains, is that 'It’s possible that the US and other outside forces will decapitate Syria. And it’s possible that they will keep it technically whole but subservient. Or it’s possible that genuine freedom and dignity will assert themselves there and a new Syria will be a meaningful force for good.' The approach from Hamas was to congratulate 'the brotherly Syrian people on their success in achieving their aspirations for freedom and justice. We call on all components of the Syrian people to unite, enhance national cohesion, and rise above the pains of the past… Hamas strongly condemns the repeated brutal aggression by the Zionist occupation against Syrian territories and firmly rejects any Zionist ambitions or schemes targeting brotherly Syria, its land and its people.' The clarity which brave Palestinians provide the world remind of the interrelationships between geopolitics, political economy and bottom-up solidarity – especially critical at a time when even the South African and Colombian governments are failing to meet reasonable expectations to help end genocide.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfND9YsuDFJI99yvk1jmlyp	2024-12-11T16:11:29-08:00	
Scholz Submits Request To Hold Confidence Vote, Paves Way For Feb...	By Nick Alipour (EurActiv) -- German Chancellor Olaf Scholz submitted a request to hold a vote of confidence on Wednesday (11 December), setting in motion the process for Germany to hold snap elections in February 2025, as planned. Scholz had announced last month that Germany would hold early elections after his government coalition collapsed over a dispute on economic policy. He told journalists in Berlin on Wednesday that he had asked the President of the German Bundestag, Bärbel Bas, to schedule the necessary vote of confidence for next Monday (16 December). If a majority of lawmakers votes against the chancellor – as expected – Scholz can ask the German President, Frank-Walter Steinmeier, to dissolve parliament, possibly on 27 December, paving the way for early elections. Scholz had initially stated he would want to hold elections in March, but with mounting pressure to facilitate an earlier date, he settled on 23 February 2025. The elections would allow voters to decide 'how we answer the big questions that lie ahead of us,' Scholz said in Berlin. He named the primary challenges as facilitating more investment, protecting jobs, modernising Germany’s industry, maintaining pensions, health, and care systems, and approaching a just peace in Ukraine 'without dragging Germany into the war.' Scholz also reiterated his intention to pass a number of legislative measures before the parliamentary Christmas recess. But the list has shrunk significantly compared to Scholz’s announcement immediately after the breakdown of his government on 6 November. While he then wanted to implement a pension reform and support packages for businesses, Scholz merely listed his intention to pass tweaks to tax, transport and benefits systems and cap energy costs on Wednesday. His coalition government of Social Democrats (SPD/S&D) and Greens (Greens/EFA) has been short of a majority since the departure of the Free Democrats (FDP/Renew), however. The FDP and the Christian Democrats (CDU/CSU/EPP), the largest opposition party, have already made it clear that they will not support anything but the most rudimentary necessities, accusing the chancellor of masking election gifts as necessary measures. Scholz’s SPD is currently poised to lose power, as it is polling in third place, far behind the CDU/CSU and the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD/ESN) in second place.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfND9YsuDFJI6PeL2qpKFR1	2024-12-11T16:09:01-08:00	
Ukraine Caught In The Middle As US-China Trade Hostilities Target...	By Reid Standish (RFE/RL) -- Escalating trade hostilities between China and the United States are putting drone supplies critical to Ukraine’s war effort in the crosshairs. U.S. media reports suggest Chinese manufacturers are limiting the sale of vital drone components to companies in the United States and the European Union that supply the parts to Ukraine. The Chinese restrictions could hinder Ukraine on the battlefield, where drones have played a pivotal role. Kyiv’s arsenal of cheap but effective drones is used for reconnaissance, dropping explosives on targets, and defending against Russian attacks. Beijing’s move is seen as a response to Washington’s decision in December to restrict the sale of high-bandwidth memory chips and additional semiconductor equipment to China. In reaction, Beijing has already banned the sale of dual-use items to the American military and several materials with high-tech and military applications to U.S. companies. But cutting supplies to drone components that form a key part of Ukraine’s war effort against Russia marks a new element of the escalating trade tensions. The Chinese move, experts say, also sends a message to U.S. President-elect Donald Trump’s incoming administration of China’s ability to counter sanctions imposed by Washington. 'This is partly a response to U.S. tariffs and a form of punishment for American export control measures,' said Joseph Webster, a senior fellow at the Atlantic Council. 'But restricting this drone tech will have battlefield consequences for Ukraine and could be important ahead of potential cease-fire negotiations.' Affordable and commercially available drones have become a staple of the nearly three-year war in Ukraine for both Kyiv and Moscow. The United States maintains an edge in larger military drones. But China dominates the market for cheaper and smaller drones and their components, which have dual-use civilian and military applications. Several independent surveys estimate that China controls 90 percent of the drone market in the United States and 80 percent globally. Given this foothold, experts have warned about a growing dependence on China’s control over the global supply chain for drones. Washington has expressed a need to create new supply chains as tit-for-tat trade moves between Beijing and Washington are poised to escalate under the second Trump administration. 'These new controls only underscore the importance of strengthening our efforts with other countries to de-risk and diversify critical supply chains away from [China],' a State Department spokesperson told RFE/RL. China’s Ministry of Commerce and Ministry of Industry and Information Technology did not respond to RFE/RL’s request for comment. The Trade War Meets The Drone War Since 2019, China has created what it called an 'unreliable entity list' to penalize companies that undermine Chinese national interests and introduced rules to punish firms that comply with U.S. restrictions on Chinese entities. The broader reach of these laws enables Beijing to potentially choke global access to critical components, including materials like rare earths and lithium that form essential components in everything from smartphones to electric vehicles. In terms of the latest limits on shipments of drone components to the United States and Europe, Chinese producers of motors, batteries, and flight controllers have cut the quantities they deliver or in some cases stopped shipments altogether. One notable example occurred in October when the U.S. drone maker Skydio, which supplies Ukraine’s military, was hit by Chinese sanctions in response to winning a contract from the Taiwanese government. Skydio has been heralded as a homegrown U.S. alternative to Chinese manufacturers and dependence on Chinese supply chains. While the U.S. firm had spent years building a supply chain outside China for its products, it still relied on the country for one vital component: batteries. The Chinese restriction on the supply of batteries to Skydio left the company scrambling to source the items and set back shipments to its clients, which includes the U.S. military, which in turn supplies Kyiv. In Search Of New Supply Chains For Kyiv, lessening its dependence on the Chinese supply chain to source drones for the battlefield has proved elusive, with many Ukrainian drone producers still relying on Chinese parts to make the cheap and effective weapons. China in July announced a ban on exports of drones for military use, and Beijing has claimed that it does not provide weapons to Russia or Ukraine. But the continued flow of dual-use equipment from China to Russia has aided the Kremlin's full-scale invasion of Ukraine. Now, the new restrictions by the Chinese government have made it more difficult for Ukraine to acquire drones and their parts. In the case of Skydio, Beijing imposed sanctions before the company had secured alternative suppliers, but the firm is reportedly in talks with several companies in Asia, including those in Japan and Taiwan. Taiwan, which China claims as its own territory, is looking to shore up its own drone supply chain given their growing importance in modern warfare and the specter of a potential conflict with Beijing that could see Taiwan cut off. The self-governing island has stepped up its efforts and has also formed ties with European countries around drone technologies. Its foreign minister led a delegation to discuss the topic in Latvia, Lithuania, and Poland in November and signed memorandums of understanding to advance drone development with all three countries. 'These Chinese trade restrictions could lead to new supply drone chains popping up,' said Webster of the Atlantic Council. 'But expect China to also want to restrict their development.'

US: Russia Could Target Ukraine Again With New Missile	A U.S. intelligence assessment has concluded that Russia could launch another of its experimental hypersonic ballistic missiles against Ukraine in the coming days, although Washington does not consider it to be decisive in the nearly three-year war, a U.S. official said Wednesday. Russia first fired the Oreshnik missile at the Ukrainian city of Dnipro on Nov. 21, in what President Vladimir Putin characterized as a response to Ukraine's first use of long-range U.S. and British missiles to strike deeper into Russian territory with Western permission. 'We assess that the Oreshnik is not a game-changer on the battlefield, but rather just another attempt by Russia to terrorize Ukraine, which will fail,' the U.S. official told reporters. There was no immediate response from Russia. Putin has previously said Russia may fire the Oreshnik missile again, possibly to target 'decision-making centers' in Kyiv, if Ukraine keeps attacking Russia with long-range Western weapons. Russia's defense ministry said that Ukraine had attacked a military airfield in the southern Russian city of Taganrog on Wednesday morning with six of the U.S.-supplied long-range ATACMS missiles and promised retaliation. It said all six had been intercepted, but that falling missile debris had caused some injuries. The Russian leader has claimed that the Oreshnik is impossible to intercept and that it has destructive power comparable to that of a nuclear weapon, even when fitted with a conventional warhead. Some Western experts have said the novel feature of the Oreshnik is that it carries multiple warheads capable of simultaneously striking different targets — something usually associated with longer-range intercontinental ballistic missiles. A surveillance camera video of the strike three weeks ago showed huge fireballs piercing the darkness and slamming into the ground at astonishing speed. Within hours of Ukraine’s attack on the Russian military facility, Putin took the rare step of speaking on national TV to boast about the new, hypersonic missile. He warned the West that its next use could be against Ukraine's NATO allies, which allowed Kyiv to use their longer-range missiles to strike inside Russia. Nonetheless, the U.S. official downplayed the usefulness of the missiles, calling them 'experimental' in nature and said that 'Russia likely possesses only a handful' of them. The official also said the weapon has a smaller warhead than other missiles Russia has deployed in Ukraine. The United States says it is sending more air defense systems to Ukraine even as Russia gains territory in eastern Ukraine six weeks ahead of Donald Trump becoming the U.S. president again. Trump has been a skeptic of continuing U.S. support for Ukraine. Trump has said he will end the war before he takes office but has not said how. He has pointedly refused to say he wants Ukraine to win the war, leaving Washington's long-term military support for Ukraine in question. Trump met with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and French President Emmanuel Macron in Paris over the weekend. Zelenskyy said in his nightly address Tuesday that a rescue operation was 'currently under way' in the southeastern city of Zaporizhzhia, following a Russian missile strike that killed three people and injured 18 others. Zelenskyy added that Ukraine does not have enough air defense systems to protect it from Russian missiles. 'But our partners do have these systems. We repeat, again and again, that air defense systems should save lives, not collect dust in storage bases,' he said. Separately, Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk said Tuesday that Ukraine-Russia peace talks could begin 'in the winter,' a timeline that coincides with Poland taking over the rotating presidency of the European Union on January 1. Tusk offered few details about where, when or even who would be involved in the negotiations, but he told his Cabinet he hoped the 'end effect' of the EU's negotiations would result in peace for Ukraine. Tusk, however, indicated that Poland, which has been a staunch supporter of neighboring Ukraine since Russian forces invaded the country in February 2022, will be a major participant in the talks. 'I really want Poland to be the country that will not only be present but will set the tone for these decisions that are to bring us security and secure Polish interests,' the prime minister said. Separately, France’s Macron is expected to meet with Tusk Thursday in Warsaw to discuss Ukraine.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfND9YsuDFJI7VeiPtDcMc_	2024-12-11T16:04:42-08:00	
Regime Change Inc.: The Deep State’s Playbook For Disobedient Nat...	In the clandestine arenas of global power dynamics, the ideals of democracy, liberty, and human rights are often wielded as instruments of strategic manipulation, serving as pretexts for orchestrating regime changes across the world. While these interventions are publicly cloaked in the language of altruism—aiming to liberate oppressed societies—the ground realities reveal a starkly different narrative: one of destabilization, unending turmoil, and nations plunged into chaos. Over the decades, the United States and its allies have played a central role in reconfiguring the political trajectories of states that dare to diverge from their strategic interests. A forewarning of this grim pattern emerged in 2008, during an Arab League summit in Damascus. Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi, holding up a chilling visual of Saddam Hussein’s execution, declared ominously: 'Your turn will come; they will come for you. What happened to Saddam will happen to you too.' His prophecy, met with laughter from the likes of Hosni Mubarak and Bashar al-Assad, unfolded with unsettling precision in the years that followed: Egypt (2011): The fervor of Arab Spring protests unseated Hosni Mubarak after three decades of autocratic rule. Though Mubarak relinquished power to the military in an effort to avoid violent reprisal, he spent six subsequent years under various forms of detention. Libya (2011): Muammar Gaddafi himself met a brutal end, captured and executed following a NATO-led intervention. Libya, once among Africa’s most prosperous nations, descended into a maelstrom of civil war, lawlessness, and humanitarian crisis. Syria (2011): Bashar al-Assad endured a protracted civil war, fueled by US-backed opposition forces aiming to unseat him. Although Assad clings to power, Syria remains devastated, with millions displaced and its infrastructure in ruins. This modus operandi is far from a modern phenomenon. In 1953, the CIA-engineered Operation Ajax overthrew Iran’s democratically elected Prime Minister Mohammad Mossadegh. In 2003, Iraq became a theater for US-led invasion under the pretense of eliminating non-existent weapons of mass destruction, culminating in the ousting of Saddam Hussein. In both instances, nations that were stable—albeit under authoritarian regimes—were thrust into prolonged chaos. Recent examples continue to illustrate this calculated strategy. In Bangladesh (2024), US-backed student uprisings led to the ousting of Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, who had helmed the nation’s economic ascent. The aftermath has seen the country mired in economic decline and social unrest. Similarly, Pakistan (2022) experienced political upheaval with the removal of Prime Minister Imran Khan amid allegations of foreign interference, plunging the nation into a quagmire of political and economic instability. The agenda behind these interventions is unmistakable: regimes that challenge US hegemony or fail to align with its geopolitical imperatives are systematically targeted. Beneath the veneer of championing democracy and human rights lies a more pragmatic pursuit—control over resources, regional dominance, and ideological conformity. History unequivocally demonstrates that the repercussions of such interventions are calamitous. The aftermath typically manifests as persistent instability, economic regression, and humanitarian catastrophes. Despite these devastating consequences, the cycle continues, highlighting the extent to which powerful nations exploit moral pretexts to safeguard their interests. As an old adage goes, 'He who laughs last laughs best.' While Gaddafi’s grim prediction was initially dismissed with derision, its haunting accuracy reverberates in the fates of leaders and nations that dared to defy the prevailing global order. This article seeks to unravel the intricate mechanics of regime change politics, dissecting the underlying motives and the far-reaching implications of these interventions. A Resurgence of Regime Change: The Deep State’s Unyielding Agenda In recent years, a troubling trend has resurfaced—a renewed wave of regime changes, masked under the pretense of promoting democracy and safeguarding human rights. While such tactics have long been integral to Western geopolitical strategies, the recent upheavals in Bangladesh and Syria signify a calculated escalation by the deep state in its relentless quest for dominance. These coups are far from isolated events; they form part of a broader strategy to assert control over strategically vital regions and coerce nations into serving specific geopolitical, economic, and ideological interests. Bangladesh: An Economic Success Story Undermined Under Sheikh Hasina's leadership, Bangladesh achieved remarkable progress, emerging as one of South Asia's fastest-growing economies. Despite inherent challenges such as a dense population and limited natural resources, her government maintained political stability, achieved robust GDP growth, and implemented transformative social reforms. Yet, her increasing alignment with China and her resistance to Western influence made her a prime target for regime change. The 2024 coup was preceded by ostensibly organic student protests, ostensibly demanding expanded reservations in government jobs and educational opportunities. While these grievances were legitimate, the protests’ scale and coordination bore unmistakable signs of external orchestration. Bolstered by substantial financial backing from international actors and amplified by a complicit media, these protests rapidly escalated into nationwide unrest. Western narratives painted Hasina’s government as authoritarian, undermining her domestic and international standing. The ensuing regime change replaced her administration with a more malleable government aligned with Western strategic imperatives. However, the consequences for Bangladesh have been catastrophic. A nation on a stable growth trajectory now grapples with economic decline, political fragility, and widespread social unrest—a grim reminder of how national progress is often the collateral damage of the deep state’s ambitions. Syria: Rekindling the Flames of Proxy War Syria’s civil war, which erupted in 2011, remains one of the most devastating conflicts in modern history. The attempt to unseat Bashar al-Assad was part of a broader effort to dismantle the Iran-Syria-Hezbollah axis and reshape the Middle East in favor of US and Israeli interests. While Assad weathered years of devastating warfare, recent developments suggest a renewed push by the deep state to destabilize his regime. The latest chapter in Syria's turmoil is characterized by reinvigorated support for opposition forces and intensified economic warfare. Crippling sanctions have further devastated the Syrian economy, stoking internal dissent and fueling fresh protests. International NGOs and media outlets have amplified allegations of human rights violations, crafting a narrative to justify further intervention. This meticulously coordinated campaign seeks to erode Assad’s legitimacy and hinder Syria’s recovery from the ravages of war. Also it can be seen through the prism of broader geopolitical maneuvers like Russia’s entanglement in Ukraine, highlights the persistent drive of external actors to reshape Syria’s future while undermining Moscow’s strategic influence in the region. The Deep State’s Multifaceted Objectives The underlying motives of the deep state in orchestrating these regime changes are strategic and multifaceted: Geopolitical Realignment: The removal of Sheikh Hasina disrupts China's growing influence in South Asia, reaffirming US dominance in the region. Similarly, undermining Assad weakens Iran and challenges the strategic Russia-China-Iran axis. Resource Exploitation: Syria’s strategic location and its valuable oil and gas reserves remain highly coveted. In Bangladesh, control over key infrastructure projects and critical trade routes is a significant motivator. Suppressing Independent Leadership: Both Hasina and Assad exhibited a defiance against Western interference, making them inevitable targets for destabilization. Preventing Regional Stability: A stable and prosperous Bangladesh challenges Western narratives about South Asia’s dependence on external intervention. Conversely, a revitalized Syria disrupts Western hegemony in the Middle East. The Mechanics of Modern Coups The deep state employs a sophisticated array of tactics to orchestrate regime changes: Economic Coercion: Sanctions and trade embargoes are strategically deployed to debilitate economies and incite public dissatisfaction against governing authorities. Social Manipulation: Protests and uprisings are engineered under the guise of addressing legitimate local grievances, often bolstered by substantial external financial and logistical support. Media Propaganda: Orchestrated media campaigns craft narratives that amplify dissent, portraying leaders as autocrats and governments as illegitimate to erode both domestic and international credibility. Utilization of Proxy Agents: In Syria, militant groups act as destabilizing forces, while in Bangladesh, opposition parties and student organizations serve as instruments of disruption. Far-Reaching Consequences The regime changes in Bangladesh and Syria underscore the deep state’s rejuvenated drive to reshape global political landscapes. These interventions erode national sovereignty, destabilize regions, and prioritize hegemonic interests over the welfare of affected populations. The aftermath is invariably devastating. Nations once on the cusp of progress are left in turmoil, grappling with economic decline, political fragmentation, and societal discord—all in the name of democracy and human rights. As history continues to repeat itself, it becomes evident that these actions are not driven by a genuine commitment to liberty but rather by an insatiable quest for power. This relentless wave of regime changes leaves a trail of destruction, despair, and compromised national identities. Iran Under Siege: A Target of the Deep State Iran remains a focal point in the deep state’s geopolitical strategy, given its pivotal influence in the Middle East, ideological defiance of Western hegemony, and alignment with adversarial powers like Russia and China. As tensions rise over Iran’s role in the Palestinian-Israeli conflict and its support for groups like Hamas, efforts to destabilize its regime have intensified. Key Narratives Undermining Iran Mismanagement of Resources: Western-backed media perpetuate claims that the Iranian government prioritizes regional ambitions—such as funding Hamas—over addressing domestic challenges like healthcare, education, and infrastructure. These narratives target younger Iranians, fueling disillusionment with the regime. Women’s Rights as a Flashpoint: Iran’s enforcement of strict moral codes, including hijab mandates, has become a focal point for criticism. Events like Mahsa Amini’s 2022 death in custody spurred protests, organically driven but heavily amplified by external actors and social media campaigns. Women’s rights are strategically used as a rallying cry to galvanize both domestic and international opposition. Allegations of Extremism and Oppression: The regime is frequently depicted as authoritarian and a sponsor of extremism, further isolating it diplomatically while painting an image of internal disconnect and incompetence. Economic Warfare: Long-standing sanctions have devastated Iran’s economy, fueling public frustration. Framed as tools to counter regional threats, these sanctions primarily aim to weaken internal cohesion and stoke unrest. Tactics of Deep State Interference Media Domination: Global media networks amplify dissent within Iran, portraying protests and unrest while downplaying external provocations. Social media platforms serve as echo chambers for anti-government sentiment and mobilization. Backing Opposition Groups: Exiled entities like the Mujahedin-e-Khalq (MEK) receive substantial support, despite their limited domestic legitimacy, and are presented as viable alternatives to the current regime. Cultural Subversion: The promotion of Western ideals of individual freedom and gender equality undermines traditional Iranian values, creating a cultural schism. NGOs and cultural organizations serve as conduits for disseminating these ideals. Economic Subjugation: Targeted sanctions exacerbate civilian hardships, directing public ire toward the regime and framing economic struggles as internal failings rather than consequences of external aggression. The overarching agenda regarding Iran appears to focus on systematically undermining its sovereignty, diminishing its cultural identity, and establishing a government that aligns with Western interests. This proposed regime would disrupt Iran’s strategic connections with significant regional partners such as Hezbollah and Hamas, leading to a fundamental shift in the balance of power within the Middle East. It would also reject Iran’s nuclear ambitions, thereby mitigating a key element of its strategic deterrence. Additionally, a shift in foreign policy towards the West would markedly diminish the regional influence of competing powers like China and Russia, thereby altering geopolitical alignments to strengthen Western supremacy. This complex approach highlights a wider initiative to adjust regional interactions to support a Western-oriented global framework. However, historical precedents—such as in Iraq, Libya, and Syria—demonstrate that such regime changes often usher in protracted instability, civil conflict, and humanitarian crises. For Iran, the deep state’s maneuvers represent a profound threat to its sovereignty and the stability of the broader Middle East. Despite efforts to consolidate power and counteract these narratives, the convergence of sanctions, internal dissent, and external interference renders Iran a focal point for the next chapter of regime change. India Under Siege: The Deep State’s Covert Strategy India's ascent on the global stage, bolstered by its independent foreign policy and nationalist government, has made it a prime target for deep state forces. These forces—often embodied by influential financial elites and geopolitical power brokers—focus on destabilizing regimes that challenge their overarching objectives. In recent years, evidence suggests that international actors, in concert with segments of the domestic opposition, are working to undermine the Indian government under Prime Minister Narendra Modi. George Soros and the Open Declaration of Hostility A notable expression of this agenda came from billionaire investor George Soros, who publicly criticized Modi’s administration, citing concerns over democracy and human rights. Soros’s call for regime change, while framed in the rhetoric of activism, underscores a broader agenda to destabilize India by leveraging domestic dissent and amplifying socio-political tensions. Key Movements Exploited to Challenge the Indian Government Shaheen Bagh Protests (2019-2020): Initially framed as grassroots opposition to the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA), the Shaheen Bagh protests evolved into a global campaign portraying India’s policies as discriminatory. External funding, logistical support, and widespread international media coverage suggest an orchestrated attempt to frame the Indian government as oppressive. NGOs and organizations with international affiliations were instrumental in perpetuating this narrative under the guise of human rights advocacy. Farmers’ Agitation (2020-2021): The protests against agricultural reforms gained significant international traction, with endorsements from foreign celebrities like Greta Thunberg and Rihanna. The infamous 'toolkit' revealed strategies to tarnish India’s image on global platforms, raising concerns about foreign interference in domestic policy debates. Evidence of financial and logistical backing from external sources pointed to a coordinated effort to destabilize the government and undermine its economic reforms. Khalistani Separatism and Diasporic Influence: Reviving the Khalistan movement has been another strategy employed by anti-India forces, particularly in Canada. Diplomatic strains between India and Canada underscore the deep state’s exploitation of diasporic communities to propagate separatist narratives. These efforts aim to disrupt India’s internal stability by fomenting unrest in regions like Punjab and undermining national unity. Political Alignments with External Interests: Allegations of collusion between certain opposition leaders and international actors have surfaced, suggesting coordinated efforts to weaken the Modi government. Reports of financial and strategic support, alongside international lobbying campaigns, often coincide with domestic protests, amplifying narratives that paint the administration as authoritarian and divisive. Broader Objectives of the Deep State in India Eroding India’s Global Influence: India’s rise as a geopolitical heavyweight, coupled with its assertive stance on issues like BRICS, the Russia-Ukraine conflict, and trade relations with China, poses a challenge to Western hegemony. The deep state seeks to curb India’s independent foreign policy by discrediting its leadership and creating political instability. Economic Sabotage: India’s burgeoning economy and growing influence in global markets threaten established financial systems dominated by Western powers. Movements such as the farmers' protests and environmental campaigns are leveraged to disrupt key economic reforms and industrial projects, hampering India’s economic trajectory. Exacerbating Societal Divisions: India’s rich socio-religious diversity provides fertile ground for divisive narratives. Misinformation campaigns targeting caste, religion, and regional autonomy are strategically deployed to fracture societal cohesion and create a perception of widespread unrest. Compromising Strategic Autonomy: India’s refusal to align with Western interests on various global issues has drawn the ire of power brokers. Destabilizing the current administration serves the deep state’s aim of installing a more pliant leadership that aligns with Western geopolitical objectives. A Systematic Undermining of Sovereignty The deep state’s focus on India is part of a larger strategy to neutralize emerging powers that prioritize sovereignty and independent policymaking. By exploiting genuine grievances, fueling dissent, and leveraging separatist movements, these forces seek to destabilize India’s political and social fabric. The Modi government has thus far demonstrated resilience in countering these challenges. However, the persistence of these subversive efforts highlights the importance of vigilance. Ensuring national stability will require: Strengthening internal unity across societal and political spectrums. Countering misinformation through transparent and effective communication. Addressing legitimate concerns via democratic mechanisms to neutralize vulnerabilities. In the face of these relentless attempts to undermine its sovereignty, India must remain steadfast, united, and proactive in safeguarding its global standing and internal stability. In summary, the recurring phenomenon of regime changes, presented as efforts to advance democracy and human rights, uncovers a more profound agenda influenced by the strategic objectives of dominant global actors. The interventions in regions such as the Middle East and South Asia systematically undermine the stability of sovereign nations, hindering their political and economic development for the purpose of geopolitical advantage. The situations in Libya, Syria, Bangladesh, and India emphasis the consistent strategies employed by the deep state, including economic coercion, media manipulation, and the exploitation of internal dissent, aimed at destabilizing regimes that oppose Western interests. Although presented as initiatives to promote democratic principles, the actual outcomes of these interventions frequently result in extended instability for nations, eroding their sovereignty and causing enduring humanitarian challenges. As history unfolds, it becomes evident that these actions are driven not by a sincere dedication to liberty, but by an unyielding quest for global supremacy and authority.

Beijing Rapidly Expanding Its Influence Across Russian Far East, ...	Beijing has been rapidly expanding its influence in the economy and government offices of the Russian Far East, often with Vladimir Putin’s help because the defeats he has suffered elsewhere mean that he has no choice but to give in to what the Chinese want, according to Aleksandr Nemets. The US-based Russian analyst says that this trend began more than a decade ago but is accelerating because of Putin’s problems in Ukraine, Syria and with the Russian economy (m.kasparov.org/material.php?id=674D9776C7941&section_id=444F8A447242B&subject_id=230 and kasparov.ru/material.php?id=675449E4EA866). Not only are there more than three million ethnic Chinese in the Russian Far East, far more than the 40,000 registered residents the Russian authorities admit to, Nemets begins; but China now makes no secret of its aspirations for control of the region and has already achieved great success in dominating the economy and even regional governments. And this has happened with Putin’s help because he needs China given his weakened position and therefore is deferring to Beijing on issues large and small in the Far East, including but not limited to accepting border changes in China’s favor, expanding the ability of Chinese firms to rent land, and extending extraterritorial rights to Chinese operating in that region. Officials in Russian regions, whatever they may feel personally, take their lead from the Kremlin, and as a result, China is finding it easier and easier to rent more land for longer and longer terms and to act as a neo-colonial power, confident that no one locally or in Moscow will show any resistance. Nemets sees Moscow’s willingness to extend virtual extraterritorial status to the Chinese working and living in the region as the most serious development because it gives both the Chinese and the local Russians the sense that the Chinese are already the more important of the two, despite everything Putin says about Russians and Ukrainians elsewhere	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfND9YsuDFJI7na3sLS5IiZ	2024-12-11T15:59:14-08:00	
Robert Reich: How Are You Doing? – OpEd	We are in a queasy interregnum. Four weeks ago, we learned that Donald Trump won the 2024 election. In six weeks, he’ll be taking over the United States government. To run that government, he’s nominated a Star Wars cantina of fanatics, extremists, conspiracy theorists, billionaires, sexual harassers, and disreputable no-goods. Republican senators — the only firewall against this bunch — seem reluctant to take Trump on, other than drawing a line at the reprehensible Matt Gaetz. The person Trump wants to run the FBI is pledging a campaign of vengeance against his political enemies. The people he wants to put in charge of the military and the border are promising a mass roundup and deportation of undocumented immigrants. The billionaires he’s put in charge of eliminating 'waste' are gunning for Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid. The person he wants to run the nation’s health is a nutcase who doesn’t believe in vaccinations. And so on. This time there will be few if any grownups around him to constrain Trump’s worst instincts. Some of you are frightened. Me too. You’d have to be living on another planet not to fear what will happen starting in six weeks. Meanwhile, most of the criminal charges against Trump, as well as his sentencing for the felonies he was found guilty of having committed, have been dropped or vacated. Many of you are furious that Trump won’t be held accountable. I am too. Yet I’m surprised at how many of the people I speak with are in denial. They tell me 'Trump is just bluffing,' or 'He’s not so stupid as to try these things.' Or they say 'the Constitution is strong enough to withstand Trump.' I fear they’re wrong. He’s nuts, he and his minions will try these things, and the Constitution is already near the breaking point. I’ve also been surprised at the silence of the Democrats. Where’s the Democratic leadership? Who’s speaking up for the rule of law right now, other than Liz Cheney? Why have Joe Biden and Kamala Harris seemingly disappeared? Democratic leaders apparently believe it’s better for them to say nothing now and let Republicans take the heat. But there’s little or no heat. Trump seems to be taking over Washington without a whimper of opposition. I just heard from an old friend who’s also a U.S. senator, who writes: 'The new administration isn’t as bad as we thought. It’s worse.' I wish him well. We need people of integrity on the front lines to try to constrain Trump and his sicko sycophants. Yet even those of us who aren’t on the front lines must be activists. If you don’t want to watch the news, I understand. If you’re feeling frightened or furious or worried, you’re in good company. But I hope you feel more determined than ever to fight the fanatics who will take charge in just six weeks. Stand up to them. Call them out. Do not tolerate intolerance. We cannot compromise with cruelty. There is no middle ground between democracy and fascism. I use these daily posts to you as ways of finding some hope in the dark. As small tokens of resistance. As means of fortifying you in these difficult times. Thank you for reading. Thank you for sharing. Thank you for your comments and your words of encouragement. Mostly, thank you for your commitment to a fair and decent society. As we head into the darkness, we need each other to help light the way forward.

South Korea’s Constitutional Crisis: Presidential Authority And D...	South Korea, often hailed as a model of democracy in Asia, is facing a political crisis as President Yoon Suk Yeol encounters increasing criticism for actions deemed unconstitutional. This controversy has arisen following Yoon's proposal for an 'orderly resignation,' which coincides with his declaration of martial law. Legal experts contend that these measures violate the nation's Constitution. Additionally, the ruling People Power Party (PPP)'s intervention in state affairs has sparked concerns about political overreach, democratic accountability, and stability. These developments challenge South Korea's constitutional framework and draw international scrutiny, placing the integrity of the nation's democracy in the global spotlight. The controversies surrounding President Yoon's use of authority and the PPP's actions highlight significant challenges to South Korea's constitutional order and raise alarms about the health of its democratic system, Challenges to Presidential Authority At the core of this issue are the constitutional limitations placed on presidential authority. South Korea's Constitution specifies that the suspension of presidential powers can occur only through impeachment or voluntary resignation, both of which require formal legal processes. Legal experts, including Han Sang-hee, a law professor at Konkuk University, argue that the concept of 'orderly resignation' is legally flawed and incompatible with the nation’s legal framework. This proposal implies that the president can step back from responsibilities without following a formal process, undermining the rule of law. The Constitution is structured to prevent arbitrary shifts in power and mandates clear procedures for transitions of authority, ensuring that executive power remains legitimate and accountable. Further complicating the situation is the role of Prime Minister Han Duck-soo, whom critics claim has effectively assumed presidential responsibilities. This unprecedented action raises serious constitutional concerns regarding the separation of powers and suggests that such a transfer of authority could violate the Constitution, contributing to political instability. As commander-in-chief, Yoon retains control over the military, complicating any efforts to restrict his authority without legal processes. This governance confusion signals a potential constitutional crisis that threatens to disrupt the checks and balances designed to protect the democratic system. Without adherence to the established mechanisms of impeachment or resignation, South Korea risks eroding public confidence in its political institutions. The Role of the Ruling People Power Party (PPP) The involvement of the ruling People Power Party (PPP) in this controversy has sparked significant criticism from legal scholars and political analysts. While political parties typically act as intermediaries between public sentiment and state institutions, their interference in state affairs undermines the principles of democratic governance. Attorney Noh Hee-bum has highlighted that the PPP, as a political entity, lacks constitutional authority to exercise administrative powers or directly influence government operations. The PPP's announcement of collaboration with Prime Minister Han Duck-soo to stabilise the government amid Yoon's controversial actions has been described as overreach. Critics contend that such actions blur the lines between political accountability and state administration, threatening the integrity of the democratic process. Instead of focusing on its legislative responsibilities, the PPP has taken on a role that some perceive as an attempt to consolidate power rather than address fundamental constitutional issues. This direct involvement in daily governance poses a risk of establishing a dangerous precedent, allowing political organisations to routinely interfere with executive actions. Such interference jeopardises the balance of power enshrined in the Constitution and threatens to blur the distinct roles of the executive, legislative, and judicial branches. This overstep not only intensifies domestic tensions but also raises serious questions about the party's commitment to democratic principles and constitutional order. The Global Perspective: 'The World is Watching ' South Korea's political turmoil has garnered international attention. As a significant player in both regional and global politics, the integrity of South Korea's democracy is closely monitored by allies and adversaries alike. The United States and other Western democracies have historically regarded South Korea as a strategic partner and a model of democratic governance in Asia. However, recent developments raise concerns about the nation’s capacity to uphold these ideals. If the erosion of democratic norms continues unchecked, it could damage South Korea's international reputation, impacting its diplomatic standing and economic relations.The global implications of this crisis are profound. South Korea’s role in regional security, particularly in addressing threats from North Korea, relies on stable and effective governance. Any perception of political instability could undermine the nation’s position in military alliances and diplomatic negotiations, thereby diminishing its influence in key international affairs. Additionally, media coverage of the crisis has raised alarms about the potential impact of weakened democratic norms on foreign investment and economic partnerships. The risk of democratic backsliding may also deter global support for significant issues such as climate change, trade, and technological innovation. In our interconnected world, South Korea’s domestic challenges resonate beyond its borders. As a member of international organisations like the United Nations, G20, and World Trade Organisation, South Korea's political stability has essential implications for global governance. Restoring constitutional order and reaffirming a commitment to democratic principles is crucial not only for domestic stability but also for preserving the nation’s global reputation and its role in regional affairs. The Way Forward: Preserving Constitutional Integrity Resolving this crisis necessitates a return to constitutional principles and a clear demarcation of roles between state institutions and political organisations. First, it is essential to prioritise adherence to legal mechanisms, such as impeachment or voluntary resignation, to address concerns regarding presidential authority. Any alternative methods pose a risk of further destabilising the political system and eroding public trust. The legal and political processes outlined in the Constitution must be followed to ensure that executive power remains accountable and legitimate. This adherence will help restore confidence in the political system and prevent a broader governance crisis. Second, the ruling People Power Party (PPP) must acknowledge its constitutional limitations and avoid exceeding its political mandate. Rather than intervening in state affairs, the PPP should concentrate on legislative measures that promote transparency and accountability. By respecting the principle of separation of powers, the PPP can foster a healthier democratic environment and ensure that state resources are used effectively to meet the needs of the populace. This approach will not only restore public confidence but also reinforce the importance of institutional checks and balances that are vital for a functioning democracy. Finally, the government must actively work to rebuild public trust and demonstrate its commitment to democratic governance. This involves clear communication with citizens, adherence to constitutional procedures, and initiatives to strengthen the rule of law. The government should initiate a transparent and inclusive process for resolving the crisis, ensuring that all political parties and branches of government act in good faith and within the constitutional framework. By addressing these challenges directly, South Korea can reaffirm its democratic values and restore stability, reinforcing its position as a model democracy in Asia. Conclusion and Recommendations The controversy surrounding President Yoon Suk Yeol’s authority and the interventions by the ruling People Power Party present a critical test for South Korea's democratic institutions. The Constitution must remain the cornerstone of governance, ensuring that power is exercised within legal bounds. To safeguard its democratic system, South Korea’s leadership should prioritise legal mechanisms that uphold the separation of powers and restore public trust. Additionally, resolving this crisis swiftly and transparently on the global stage will reassure allies and maintain South Korea’s standing as a model democracy.

Central Asia: The Blind Spot Trump Can’t Afford To Ignore – Analy...	When President-elect Donald Trump starts his second term January 20, he will face a full foreign policy agenda, with wars in Ukraine and the Middle East, Taiwan tensions, and looming trade disputes with China, Mexico, and Canada. At some point, he will hit the road on his 'I’m back!' tour. Hopefully, he will consider stops in Central Asia in the not-too-distant future. The 'United States Strategy for Central Asia 2019-2025: Advancing Sovereignty and Economic Prosperity,' says all the right things like supporting regional sovereignty, independence, and territorial integrity; promoting the rule of law; and encouraging U.S. investment. But it was released when U.S. forces still occupied neighboring Afghanistan. Eighteen months later, those forces were gone. So, what should President Trump do about Central Asia? First, show up! No sitting U.S. president has ever visited Central Asia. Russian President Vladimir Putin has made 73 visits to the five republics, while China’s XiJinping has made 13 visits to four of the republics since he ascended to the presidency in 2012. President Joe Biden met the presidents of the five former Soviet republics – Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan -- during last year’s 'C5+1' meeting of the U.N. General Assembly. The unprecedented summit, while described by the president as 'historic,' actually lasted less than one hour, making the gathering more of a photo-op. By the time everyone gave their remarks, it was on to the next event. No matter how good your diplomats, nothing greases the wheels like a face-to-face meeting of the bosses. Second, understand that the republics think multipolarity is a good thing. The republics are finally free of the Russian Empire (1721-1917), Soviet empire (1917-1991), and the American empire (2001-2021) and are not interested in any arrangement that limits their ability to balance between the major powers, or play them off one against the other. And getting directions from faraway Washington and Brussels will remind them of the Soviet era. The republics have language and business ties with Russia, have received significant investment from China, see Iran as a beckoning market and the host of needed transport routes, and are investing in Taliban-controlled Afghanistan. The republics soberly understand they are all 'neighbors forever' and have no interest in serving as launchpads for attacks on Iran or Afghanistan. Third, hands off the culture. The republics are old cultures, but young nations. They are still engaged in state formation and are open to technical support on various issues such as World Trade Organization accession, but they are not interested in changing their culture to accommodate foreigners. And if the West can’t restrain its tendency for social engineering, they can always deal with China, which is run by a Communist Party but isn’t exporting Communism. Their concern with defending cultural sovereignty isn’t a reaction to Western culture and pushy NGOs. During the Soviet era, Moscow took a keen interest in Islam in Central Asia and made a concerted effort to control Islamic education and appoint imams in the interest of revolutionary Socialism in recognition of the religion’s continuing influence in the officially atheistic Soviet Union. Fourth, Afghanistan is part of Central Asia. The Central Asian countries are interested in reducing tensions and instability in the region, and that requires developing common approaches to maintaining peace in neighboring Afghanistan. For example, the Trans-Afghan Railway, a 357-mile connection from Central Asia to the Pakistani seaports of Karachi, Gwadar, and Qasim, is a long-term contribution to stabilizing Afghanistan. In addition to contributing to the development of a sustainable Afghan economy, the project will hopefully create thousands of jobs and reduce the social base of support for extremist groups in the region. The construction and operation of the corridor will provide opportunities for American contractors, equipment manufacturers, engineers, and logistics companies. Direct or indirect U.S. participation in the project will support job creation and income for American business, which should find favor with Trump. And, as an alternative to China’s 'One Belt, One Road' projects, the Trans-Afghan Railway will also serve to diversify Central Asian trade in world markets and reduce the region's dependence on Beijing, which also serves long-term U.S. interests. Andrew Korybko, an American political analyst at the Peoples’ Friendship University in Moscow, notes that even partial completion (due to security challenges in Pakistan) of the railway may still benefit the republics if they can backhaul Afghanistan’s minerals for processing in Russia or China. (The republics themselves aren’t able to process the minerals due to water shortages.) Completion of the railway could also bring Afghan minerals to the Western markets via Pakistani ports, but that would require a relaxation of banking and financial sanctions against the Taliban. In addition to Afghanistan’s mineral wealth, valued at over $1 trillion, the five Central Asian republics hold a significant share of the world’s critical minerals, including manganese, chromium, lead, zinc, and titanium. Some of the republics 'sit among the world's top 20 producers for critical minerals which are most essential to the development of green technology,' according to British solicitors Herbert Smith Freehills. Mostly-landlocked Central Asia has been 'out of sight, out of mind' in assessments of supply chain opportunities and vulnerabilities as the world plans for the energy transition. China has recently banned the export to the U.S. of the critical minerals antimony, gallium and germanium, which are used in semiconductors, infrared technologies, and electric vehicle batteries, so Washington may need to use the C5+1 Critical Minerals Dialogue as a way to return to the region in order to secure long-term access to its mineral wealth. Last, think about economics. The U.S. does little trade with Central Asia, but the region is key to East-West trade between Europe and China, as it has been since before Marco Polo’s famous adventures. The Middle Corridor, also known as the Trans-Caspian International Transport Route, is a trade route that links China and East Asia with Europe via Central Asia. This route has seen a substantial volume. It aims to reduce transit time between East Asia and Europe to as little as 12 days. The China-Kyrgyzstan-Uzbekistan (CKU) railway finally started constructionin October and will help isolated Kyrgyzstan 'go out into the world.' China is also working with Kazakhstan to upgrade existing rail infrastructure and, in 2022, 'the railway freight volume between China and Kazakhstan reached 23 million tons, marking a 20 percent year-on-year increase.' Should the Trump administration be so inclined, there are also two major opportunities to link Washington’s crusading impulse to significant environmental efforts in Central Asia: the drying up of the Aral Sea and methane emissions in Turkmenistan. The desertification of the Aral Sea, now known as the Aralkum Desert, has had profound economic effects on the region: fishing industry collapse and resulting widespread unemployment, and agricultural decline and increased salinization of the soil, not to mention adverse health effects, including increased infant mortality, growth retardation and anemia in children, respiratory disease, and elevated occurrences of cancers. The environmental and economic hardships have forced people to migrate in search of better living conditions, leading to depopulation of the region, further economic decline, and pressure for jobs and housing in urban centers. Turkmenistan is a significant emitter of methane, a potent greenhouse gas. Methane leaks from Turkmenistan's gas fields are substantial: over 2.9 million tons of methane, equivalent to more than 403 million tons of carbon dioxide, more than the annual carbon emissions of the United Kingdom. Given Washington’s own experience with reducing methane emissions, the U.S. could offer meaningful technical assistance. While Trump has regularly bashed the United Nations, he might now consider partnership with the Central Asian governments through the UN Multi-Partner Human Security Trust Fund for the Aral Sea Region, the Global Methane Pledge, and UN Water to flow the money, technology, and political support needed to help the region repair the adverse effects of these environmental catastrophes.

Do Not Allow Execution of Freedom Fighters In Iran’s ‘Saydnaya’ T...	The fall of the Syrian dictator and the subsequent opening of Syria’s prisons by the country’s freedom fighters revealed the horrific crimes committed by the Syrian regime—crimes that occurred in the silence and inaction of the international community. Let us not allow silence to once again grant the Iranian dictator the opportunity to continue massacring Iran’s freedom fighters. With 850 executions since the beginning of the year, Khamenei’s Iran has tragically broken the global record for executions per capita. This horrifying statistic is not just a number; it represents lost lives, erased stories, and the names of heroes who fell for freedom and who will forever remain in our memory. Among the most recent condemned are the names of six courageous men: Mohammad Taghavi, 58 years old, who was previously imprisoned in the 1980s and 1990s (sentenced on November 25, 2024); Ali Akbar Daneshvarkar, 57 years old, a civil engineer; Babak Alipour, 33 years old, a law graduate; Vahid Bani-Amerian, 32 years old, with a master’s degree in management; Pouya Ghobadi, 32 years old, an electrical engineer; Abolhassan Montazer, 65 years old, an architect who was also imprisoned in the 1980s and suffers from chronic illnesses. Their crime? Advocating for the People’s Mojahedin Organization of Iran (PMOI/MEK). Beyond fabricated and baseless accusations, their primary 'offense' is belonging to an organization that fights for democracy and freedom against an oppressive dictatorship. The Case of Mohammad Taghavi Mohammad Taghavi, who had previously been arrested in 2020 and imprisoned for three years on charges of connections to the PMOI, has been separated from the other five individuals and transferred to solitary confinement in Ward 209 of the infamous Evin Prison. Such a transfer to solitary confinement often indicates that his execution is imminent. The notorious Ward 209, under the control of the Ministry of Intelligence, is infamous for its brutal torture and inhumane treatment of political prisoners. Among these six prisoners, Mohammad Taghavi is one of the few remaining witnesses to the 1988 Massacre. This may be an additional reason why the Iranian dictatorship seeks to eliminate him. The 1988 Massacre and Genocide Recognition In his latest shocking report, Professor Javaid Rehman, the UN Special Rapporteur on Human Rights in Iran (serving from July 2018 to July 2024), described two major waves of killings in Iran—the 1982 executions and the 1988 massacre—as genocide. He explained that the Iranian religious dictatorship executed its opponents solely because of their beliefs and religion, aiming to systematically destroy them. In 1988, 30,000 political prisoners, of whom 90% were PMOI members, were massacred while serving their prison sentences. The report, titled 'Atrocious Crimes,' highlights not only the 1982 and 1988 massacres but also other crimes, including persecution of religious minorities—particularly Baha’is—sexual violence and abuse against women, execution of children, arbitrary and extrajudicial executions, and the ongoing crime of enforced disappearance of thousands of political dissidents. Targeting Mohammad Taghavi’s Family Two of Mohammad Taghavi’s brothers, Mojtaba and Ali Taghavi, have also been sentenced to imprisonment and exile by the same judge and court, simply because they are his brothers. Do not let silence shield these crimes. Just as the world became aware of the atrocities committed in Syria’s Saydnaya Prison after the fall of Assad, we must act to prevent similar horrors from happening in Iranian prisons. History will judge us on our ability to defend the defenders of freedom and to put an end to this barbarity.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfc3lA2i2_35RWSpE5FfLrj	2024-12-11T09:31:09-08:00	
What Realities Can Be Seen In The Mirror Of The Syrian Revolution...	On the morning of Sunday, December 8, 2024, Syria and the Middle East witnessed one of the most significant transformations in their history: the fall of Bashar al-Assad's regime. This historic event not only marks the end of a brutal dictatorship in Syria but also carries profound and far-reaching implications for the political and social dynamics of the region, particularly for the Iranian regime. Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei had repeatedly justified his regime’s costly interventions in the region by emphasizing their strategic importance, stating, 'If we don’t fight and spend resources in Syria, Lebanon, and Iraq, we will have to fight in the streets of Kermanshah, Hamedan, and other provinces.' Similarly, cleric Hossein Taeb declared, 'If the enemy attacks us and seeks to take Syria or Khuzestan, our priority must be to preserve Syria. If we hold onto Syria, we can also reclaim Khuzestan. But if we lose Syria, we won’t be able to hold onto Tehran either.' Reality 1: The Collapse of the Iranian Regime’s Strategic Depth The Iranian regime had always considered the fall of Syria as a strategic defeat for itself. From the onset of the Syrian crisis, the mullahs prioritized the survival of Assad’s regime through extensive military, financial, and ideological interventions. However, several key factors demonstrate the failure of this strategy: 1. Weakening of the IRGC and Hezbollah: The Iranian regime relied on Syria as a logistical and operational hub to supply arms and manpower to Hezbollah. Assad’s fall dismantled this critical support base, significantly undermining Hezbollah’s power in Lebanon and the region. 2. Iran’s Domestic Crises: Popular uprisings, economic collapse, and international pressures have eroded the regime’s capacity to sustain its proxy forces. This, coupled with Hezbollah’s military setbacks and the mullahs’ diminishing influence in Syria and Iraq, paved the way for Assad’s downfall. Reality 2: The Role of the Syrian People in Toppling Dictatorship Assad’s fall was primarily the result of the persistent struggle and resistance of the Syrian people against over four decades of dictatorship by the Assad family. What began as civil protests transformed into a widespread armed uprising due to relentless crackdowns. This resistance underscored the fragility of the regime’s grip in the face of collective public determination. Reality 3: Armed Struggle as the Only Path to Overcoming Dictatorship Syria’s experience once again highlights that armed struggle can play a decisive role in confronting regimes like those of Assad, Shah, or Khamenei. Civil disobedience and non-violent resistance often prove inadequate or even prolong the lifespan of oppressive regimes. For the Iranian people, this is a valuable lesson. The fall of Assad demonstrates that regimes built on internal repression and regional interventions are highly vulnerable to organized and revolutionary uprisings. Reality 4: The Parallels between the Syrian Revolution and Iran’s 1979 Revolution The Syrian revolution evokes striking similarities to Iran’s 1979 revolution. Just as the Iranian people, during their anti-monarchical uprising, tore down the symbols of monarchy—statues of Reza Shah and Mohammad Reza Shah—they also flung open the doors of prisons, liberating detainees from the Shah's torture chambers. Similarly, in Syria, the people expressed their rage against decades of corruption and oppression by dismantling the symbols of the Assad dynasty and toppling its brutal dictatorship. They also opened the gates of Assad’s prisons and torture facilities, freeing countless victims of his oppressive regime. Bashar al-Assad’s flight to Russia mirrors Mohammad Reza Pahlavi’s escape, highlighting a remarkable resemblance between the two dictators. Both sought to deny their atrocities, but history has judged—and will continue to judge—them differently. The horrifying and shocking images of atrocities committed by Assad’s regime and Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) in prisons like Saydnaya reveal the extent of the brutality of such dictatorships. They also expose Assad as a puppet of the Iranian regime. These atrocities forcefully illuminate the reality of despotic governments like the mullahs' regime in Iran. Moreover, these brutalities expose the disgraceful policies of appeasement pursued by global powers. These policies not only undermine human rights but also embolden tyrants, allowing atrocities akin to the horrific crimes of Hitler to resurface. Impacts and Consequences of Assad’s Fall 1. Severe Weakening of the Iranian Regime: For years, Khamenei argued that his regime’s survival depended on its presence in Syria. Assad’s fall marks the loss of a crucial strategic pillar for Tehran, dramatically increasing both internal and external pressures on the regime. 2. Weakening of Hezbollah: Hezbollah, which had long benefited from logistical and military support via Syria, has now lost this strategic base, leaving it more vulnerable to internal and external challenges. 3. Reduced Iranian Influence in the Region: Assad’s collapse restricts the mullahs’ ability to exert influence in Iraq and other parts of the region, further isolating the regime internationally. Conclusion: A Mirror for Iran The Syrian revolution reflects a potential future for Iran. Just as Bashar al-Assad was brought to his knees by the will of his people, the mullahs’ regime is similarly vulnerable to growing popular uprisings and the erosion of its domestic and regional power base. Assad’s fall illustrates that organized and revolutionary struggle is an inevitable path for oppressed nations striving for freedom and democracy.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfc3lA2i2_35Z69GrtU_Ua2	2024-12-11T09:30:18-08:00	
India: Anniversary Of Memory, Anniversary Of Pain – OpEd	Games of terrorism, games of power There is a quite famous saying that says he who is a terrorist on one side is a freedom fighter on the other. On November 26 2024 an anniversary of painful memory took place for India. Sixteen years have passed since the terrorist attack that took place in Mumbai in 2008. This terrorist attack changed the course of the counter-terrorism history in India, much like the attack that occurred on the Twin Towers on September 11, 2001 in New York. The events that took place even provided material for the film 'Hotel Mumbai' in 2018, directed by Anthony Maras. Let’s take a brief look at the incident itself. On November 26 ten armed militants from the Pakistani terrorist group Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) infiltrated the city by sea and carried out a series of coordinated attacks at multiple high-profile locations, including the Taj Mahal Hotel the Oberoi Trident Hotel the CST railway station, and the Nariman House. The terrorists took hostages, engaged in gunfights with security forces, and carried out brutal attacks on civilians, resulting in the deaths of 166 people, including 18 security personnel, and injuring over 300 individuals. The attacks lasted nearly four days, with Indian police working tirelessly to free the hostages and neutralize the terrorists. However, when the bloodshed ended, the responsibility was not immediately attributed to the real culprit, but followed a path of attempted misdirection. Initially, within a context of speculation regarding the identity of the terrorists, an unknown group under the pseudonym Mujahideen Hyderabad Deccan claimed responsibility for the attacks via an email. However, an email was later traced to a computer in Pakistan, and it became clear that no such group existed. Investigators began to look for the culprit through the profile of the people who had been targeted. The way the terrorists allegedly targeted western foreigners at both luxury hotels and Nariman House led some to believe that the Islamist militant group al-Qaeda might have been involved, but this appeared not to be the case after the lone captured terrorist, Ajmal Amir Kasab, provided substantial information about the planning and execution of the attacks. Kasab, a resident of Punjab province in Pakistan, told investigators that the 10 attackers underwent extensive guerrilla warfare training at Lashkar-e-Taiba camps. Additionally, he revealed that the group of terrorists had spent time at the headquarters of a second and related organization, Jamaat-ud-Dawa, in the city of Muridke before traveling from Punjab to the coastal city of Karachi and departing for Mumbai by sea. Ultimately, it appeared that Lashkar e Taiba was behind the attacks in Mumbai, which aimed to make the global community perceive the landmark city of Indian progress in the Indo-Pacific region as vulnerable and weak. The terrorists had a good, if not diabolical, plan. After first traveling on a cargo ship under a Pakistani flag, the armed men seized an Indian fishing vessel and killed its crew; then, as they approached the coast of Mumbai, they used inflatable boats to reach Badhwar Park and the Sassoon Docks, near the city's Gateway of India monument. At that point, the terrorists split into small groups and headed towards their respective targets. All these cruel actions were the actios of the notorious Lashkar-e-Taiba. Let's take a moment to consider the organization and operation of Lashkar-e-Taiba, this extremist Islamic organization that operates in Pakistan, India, Kashmir, Sri Lanka, and Bangladesh under the nickname 'The Order of God.' The leaders of the organization knew what they were doing and how they planned their missions. As for the terrorist attack in Mumbai ,young fanatical men were sent on the battlefield, whose lack of education and the context of deprivation had made them exactly what the organization needed: capable of anything, desperate, and expendable. It is not coincidental that even in the film, the young men who had taken over the hotel were seen receiving instructions for their steps from a voice on the phone whose face was never revealed. Fortunately, the terrorists were neutralized. One of the terrorists from the hotel attack was arrested. Kasab who was charged with various crimes, including murder and waging war later retracted his confession. In April 2009, his trial began, but there were several delays, including a postponement as officials confirmed that Kasab was indeed over 18 years old and therefore could not be tried in a juvenile court. Although he admitted his guilt in July, the trial continued, and in December he recanted, declaring his innocence. In May 2010, Kasab was found guilty and sentenced to death. He was executed two years later. In June 2012, the Delhi police arrested Syed Zabiuddin Ansari (or Syed Zabiuddin), who was alleged to be one of those who trained the terrorists and guided them during the attacks. Here we enter the next chapter, where we examine the profiles of the trainers and guides of the terrorists, with the most significant case being that of David Coleman Headley. a Pakistani-American, who pled guilty in 2011 to assisting the terrorists in planning the attacks, and in January 2013 was sentenced to 35 years in prison by a U.S. federal court. Admitting his guilt and later testifying for the government in the trial of a co-defendant, Headley admitted that he attended training camps in Pakistan run by Lashkar-e-Taiba. By late 2005, Headley was instructed by three Lashkar members to travel to India to conduct surveillance, which he did five times before the Mumbai attacks in 2008. According to Headley's confession and testimony, he attended the following training camps operated by Lashkar: a three-week course that began in February 2002 and provided ideological training on the benefits of jihad, then a three-week course that began in August 2002 and provided training in the use of weapons and grenades; a three-month course that began in April 2003 and taught close combat tactics, the use of weapons and grenades, and survival skills; a three-week course that began in August 2003 and taught counter-surveillance skills; and a three-month course that began in December 2003 and provided training in combat and tactics. He had all the training he needed. After receiving instructions in late 2005 to conduct surveillance in India, Headley changed his name from Daood Gilani in February 2006 in Philadelphia to facilitate his activities on behalf of Lashkar, presenting himself in India as an American who was neither Muslim nor Pakistani. In the summer of 2006, Headley and two members of Lashkar discussed opening an immigration office in Mumbai as a cover for his surveillance activities. They were preparing for the attack. Headley eventually made five extended trips to Mumbai — in September 2006, February and September 2007, and April and July 2008 — each time filming various potential targets, including those attacked in November 2008. Before each trip, Lashkar members and associates would guide Headley on specific locations where he needed to conduct surveillance. After each trip, Headley traveled to Pakistan to meet with Lashkar members and associates, report on the results of his surveillance, and provide the surveillance videos. Headley was therefore a higher-ranking official in the organization's hierarchy who, due to his knowledge and connections, was part of the organization's core. This man was eventually located and given the punishment he deserved for his actions. But we need to see who is behind this organization, and most importantly, who funds it, we need to get to the core in order to create ways of preventing such terrorist actions from happening again. Through the provision of social, educational, and medical services in Pakistan, Lashkar-e-Taiba, (LeT) has expanded its support base in the country. LeT funds such activities through donation boxes placed in shops across the country. Additionally, LeT collects ushr, an Islamic land tax that requires farmers to donate 10 percent of their crops or income to charitable purposes. LeT generates revenue through the group's 'legitimate' businesses, which include fish farms, agricultural lands, and mobile clinics. LeT also raises funds by imposing tuition fees in its schools and by selling jihadist material and other goods. A former member of LeT revealed in an interview that sometimes traders associated with LeT ask buyers to pay an additional 5 to 10 Pakistani rupees 'for jihad.' LeT has also used its international connections to seek funding, and this is the most interesting point we should focus on. The group is reported to have received donations from members of the Pakistani diaspora in Europe and the Persian Gulf, as well as from clerics and other Saudis who support the global jihadist movement. Through JuD (Jamaat-ud-Dawa), IKK, and other front organizations of LeT, the group has also collected donations abroad for disaster relief and other humanitarian purposes within Pakistan. The group is known to divert money donated for charitable purposes to fund its military activities. Especially until 2002, the year Let was banned in Pakistan, almost every shop in the central market of every Pakistani city, big or small, had a Lashkar collection box for raising funds for the fight in Kashmir. After analyzing these events, it is difficult to be optimistic even if we want to. The organization may have been declared illegal for years and significant figures operating within it, such as Headley, may have been arrested and received the punishment they deserved from the authorities, but unfortunately, extremist organizations originating from Pakistan continue to strike India and Kashmir. Unfortunately, evil must be struck at its root, and here it is deeper than the religious differences between Hinduism and Islam. It is a condition that weaponizes the religious fanaticism of its followers, sending them like sheep to the slaughter by turning them into terrorists on the front lines who do not hesitate to take their own lives along with the lives of others in the name of Allah. All these disposable, misguided people are the pawns who move according to the desires of the economically powerful who indirectly or directly fund these organizations. If we want to find the root of the problem, we must broaden our thinking and include countries like China, as well as certain forces in America and in Saudi Arabia that indirectly control such extremist groups by financially supporting them.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfc3lA2i2_35XHzjBmuI2jm	2024-12-11T09:29:17-08:00	
US ‘Deep State’ Seen Meddling In India’s Affairs – OpEd	Corruption charges against Indian tycoon Gautam Adani and BJP's charge against the Gandhi about teaming up with George Soros to destabilize India threaten Indo-US relations Washington's discomfort with India is growing as it is being dragged into two major controversies rocking the South Asian country today. The first is the Bharatiya Janata Party - Congress slugfest over a US court's indictment of Indian tycoon Gautam Adani. The second is the BJP's narrative linking Congress leader Sonia Gandhi to US billionaire-philanthropist George Soros in an alleged plot to destabilize India. Last month's indictment of Adani, who is close to the ruling Narendra Modi-led BJP government, has exacerbated the already heightened cynicism that a majority of Indians feel towards the US government's intentions. US prosecutors had charged Gautam Adani, 62, his nephew Sagar and other defendants for paying over US$ 250 million in bribes between 2020 and 2024 to Indian government officials to win solar energy contracts on terms that could potentially bring in more than US$ 2 billion in profit. Following that, the Congress demanded a thorough investigation into the charges and accused the government of shielding Adani. The Adani Group has dismissed the charges as 'baseless'. The US indictment of Adani has severely affected his businesses–which are a critical part of India's economic landscape. Any legal action against him is seen not just as targeting an individual, but as having broader economic and geopolitical consequences for India. This has led to suspicions about the true motives behind such actions even outside the BJP's narrative that actions against Adani are tantamount to actions against the Indian national interest itself. No matter who is US President—Joe Biden or President-elect Donald Trump—the US will never be a true friend of India, say Indian geopolitical analysts. A majority of Indians believe that the US' strategic interests are at play behind the scene in these too instances of interference. The BJP's narrative linking to Hungarian-born George Soros taps into a broader conspiracy theory that sees Soros as meddling in global politics to serve Western interests. By associating Sonia Gandhi with Soros, the BJP aims to portray the opposition as being influenced by foreign powers, further fuelling nationalist sentiments and distrust towards the West. These events are part of a larger pattern where the US is often viewed with suspicion in India. The relationship between the US and India is complex and multifaceted, influenced by a range of political, economic, and strategic factors. While the US and India have developed a strong partnership over the years, there are several reasons why some believe that the US may never be a 'true friend' of India, regardless of who is in the White House. The perception that US geopolitical considerations, particularly in keeping China at an arms-length in the South Asian region, outweigh its friendship with India is shared by most Indians. Many feel that the US engagement with India is primarily driven by this strategic need to contain China rather than a genuine desire for a balanced and mutual partnership. Historical Context US-India relationship has evolved significantly since the end of the Cold War. During the Cold War, India had a policy of non-alignment, which often put it at odds with both the US. However, the end of the Cold War and India's economic liberalization in the early 1990s opened new avenues for cooperation between India and the US. US and India have since developed strong ties in areas such as defence, trade, and technology. Despite these advancements, there are underlying geopolitical considerations that complicate the relationship. The US has historically viewed India through the lens of its broader strategic interests in Asia, particularly in relation to China and Pakistan. While it sees India as a key partner in countering China's influence in the Indo-Pacific region, it also keeps a relationship with Pakistan, which has been a longstanding ally in the fight against communism and terrorism. This dual approach has created tensions in the US-India relationship. The leadership styles and policies of US Presidents have significantly impacted the relationship with India. Under President Donald Trump, the US-India relationship saw notable developments, especially in defence and trade. Trump's administration emphasized the importance of the Indo-Pacific region and looked to strengthen ties with India as part of its strategy to counter China's rise. The personal rapport between Trump and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi also played a role in fostering closer ties. However, Trump's approach to foreign policy was often transactional, and his administration's focus on 'America First' sometimes led to tensions with India on trade issues. For instance, the US imposed tariffs on Indian steel and aluminium, and India responded with retaliatory tariffs on US goods. These trade disputes highlighted the challenges of balancing strategic cooperation with economic interests. Under President Biden, the US-India relationship has continued to evolve, with a focus on shared democratic values and cooperation on global challenges such as climate change and public health. Biden has emphasized the importance of multilateralism and alliances, and his administration has sought to strengthen the Quad, a strategic partnership between the US, India, Japan, and Australia. However, Biden's approach to China is more nuanced than Trump's. The latter's approach could affect the US-India relationship. While Biden looks to counter China's influence, he also aims to engage with China on issues like climate change and global health. The formal indictment of Indian tycoon Gautam Adani by US authorities has added another layer of complexity to the US-India relationship. This controversy has significant implications for the US-India relationship. On the one hand, it underscores the importance of transparency and accountability in business dealings, which are key principles for both countries. On the other hand, it highlights the potential for political and economic tensions when prominent figures close to the Indian government are implicated in legal issues in the US. The Adani case has also fuelled criticism from opposition parties in India, who argue that the Modi government is too closely aligned with controversial business figures. The BJP claims that Sonia Gandhi, as co-president of the Forum of Democratic Leaders in Asia Pacific (FDL-AP), is connected to an organization funded by the George Soros Foundation, which has supported the idea of Kashmir being an independent country. These allegations have sparked a political firestorm in India, with the BJP accusing the Congress party of colluding with foreign entities to undermine India's sovereignty, and the Congress party dismissing these claims as baseless and politically motivated. The controversy has also drawn attention to the broader issue of foreign influence in Indian politics and the role of international organizations in shaping domestic affairs. Many Indians perceive US policies as being self-serving, designed to advance American geopolitical interests rather than genuinely fostering mutual benefits. The double standard often seen in US foreign policy, where strategic interests override democratic and human rights principals, further contributes to this mistrust. A majority of Indians blame the US 'deep state'.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfc3lA2i2_35RtKQwad08GZ	2024-12-11T09:28:31-08:00	
Institutionalised Repression On Pakistan Occupied Jammu & Kashmir...	Named ‘Azad’ [liberated] Jammu & Kashmir by Islamabad, this area of J&K under Pakistan’s illegal occupation [PoJK] since 1947 unfortunately doesn’t quite live up to its name as its people are anything but free. To begin with, Para 7 [3] of PoJK constitution criminalises freedom of expression by mandating that 'No person or political party in Azad Jammu and Kashmir [PoJK] shall be permitted to propagate against, or take part in activities prejudicial or detrimental to, the ideology of the State’s accession to Pakistan.' One doesn’t have to be a Sherlock Holmes to deduce that this draconian stipulation aimed at muzzling public opposition by the residents of PoJK against its illegal occupation by Pakistan has been incorporated into the constitution since Islamabad knows very well that locals are unhappy about annexation of their land by Pakistan. The irony is that while it tries to portray PoJK as an independent entity, in reality Islamabad treats it as its colony and rules this region with an iron fist, brazenly exploiting its natural resources. This is evident from the frequent protests and repeated demands for azadi [freedom] made by agitating PoJK residents. The Pakistan army’s un-soldierly conduct in PoJK has further alienated locals and one illustrative example that comes to mind is its abject apathy towards civilians that came to the fore during the devastating 2005 earthquake. Human Rights Watch [HRW] in its 2006 report states, 'In the first seventy-two hours after the earthquake, thousands of Pakistani troops stationed in Azad Kashmir [PoJK] prioritized the evacuation of their own personnel over providing relief to desperate civilians.' It further mentions that the international media even 'filmed Pakistani troops standing by and refusing to help because they had 'no orders' to do so as locals attempted to dig out those still alive, sending a chilling message of indifference from Islamabad.' [Emphasis added]. But this is not all. In 2006, Asia Director at Human Rights Watch [HRW] Brad Adams had noted that 'The military shows no tolerance for dissent and practically runs the region [PoJK] as a fiefdom.' Furthermore, the 2006 HRW report, mentions that it 'knows of no cases in which members of military and paramilitary security and intelligence agencies have been prosecuted or even disciplined for acts of torture or mistreatment [of PoJK residents].' Due to such step-motherly treatment and excess by the Pakistan army, PoJK residents rightly consider themselves to be second and class citizens leading to widespread dissatisfaction. And pushed against the wall, from all walks of life in PoJK have rallied under the banner of Joint Awami Action Committee [JAAC] of PoJK, a civil society alliance, to unitedly press their demands. In May 2023, JAAC launched a massive public campaign to protest against withdrawal of subsidies on food grain and the inordinately high prices of wheat flour and electricity. Strong-arm measures to sabotage the JAAC protest such as indiscriminate preventive detention of its leaders, intimidation, imposition of curfew, and use of brute force that led to casualties failed to deter the residents of PoJK from taking to the streets. Ultimately, while the administration was forced to accede to their genuine demands, Islamabad viewed this public unrest as a threat to its illegal occupation of PoJK and decided to put curbs on public gatherings As doing this ran the risk of antagonising the already incensed people, Islamabad’s proxy PoK government kept quiet for six months. Thinking that public tempers had cooled, the PoJK government promulgated the ‘Peaceful Assembly and Public Order Ordinance 2024’ last month which debars unregistered organisations from holding gatherings or protests. Even registered organisations have to submit a written application seeking permission for any public gathering seven days in advance and the administration reserves the right to unilaterally reject any such request. Known for its complete subservience to Islamabad, PoJK’s judiciary summarily dismissed two writ petitions against this ordinance that outrightly violates the fundamental right to freedom of expression. This led to massive public protests organised on Saturday by JAAC demanding repeal of the oppressive ordinance and release of 14 of its detained activists by 11AM. Widespread protests that paralysed the entire PoJK and showed Islamabad the mirror. According to media reports, the contentious ‘Peaceful Assembly and Public Order Ordinance 2024’ has now been revoked. However, given the deep sense of insecurity regarding PoJK that haunts Islamabad and more so Rawalpindi, it’s extremely unlikely that the people of PoJK would be allowed to exercise their democratic right to peacefully protest. Hence, it’s quite likely that the army will use every trick in the book and further intensify its campaign to smear JAAC using its pet strategy of portraying it as an anti-national organisation fomenting sedition in PoJK at the behest of New Delhi. How far Rawalpindi succeeds in demonising this civil society alliance and eroding its mass appeal will be evident next year when JAAC undertakes its long march to draw attention of the authorities towards the pathetic condition of PoJK residents. Tailpiece: Those who feel the Government of Pakistan is solely responsible for the sorry state of affairs in PoJK and that Rawalpindi is being unnecessarily dragged into the PoJK imbroglio may like reflect on the observation made in 2006 by HRW’s Asia Director that 'There is a façade of an elected local government, but the federal government in Islamabad, the army and the intelligence agencies control all aspects of political life in Azad Kashmir[PoJK].'	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfc3lA2i2_35TxQzcghq1AP	2024-12-11T09:27:38-08:00	
Minorities Ill-Served By Their Leaders – OpEd	The populist surge needs to go further: the elites who claim to represent minorities are too often working against their needs. Take the issues of school choice and affirmative action. African Americans, Asians and Hispanics favor the former but oppose application of the latter; in general, their leaders oppose the former and favor the latter. The National Urban League, the NAACP and the National Action Network are all opposed to school choice and charter schools. Marc Morial, president of the Urban League, says school vouchers 'would be devastating to black kids.' The NAACP called for a moratorium on new charter schools in 2016. And the Rev. Al Sharpton, founder and president of the National Action Network, claims charter schools have a racist history. The black elite badly misrepresent their people. No demographic group is more gung-ho for school choice than African Americans. Fully 73 percent want the right to send their child to the school of their choice. They are also demanding that their public officials provide more money for charter schools. These same three black civil rights organizations are also pro-affirmative action. When asked a generic question about affirmative action—'Is it a good thing?'—61 percent of blacks agree that it is, but when it is applied to a specific subject, the results are different. For example, 71 percent of blacks say colleges should not consider race or ethnicity when deciding which students to accept. The National Council of Asian Pacific Americans (NCAPA) is a coalition of 38 national organizations. It has plenty to say about education, but it is noticeably silent on school choice and charter schools, owing, no doubt, to the fact that Asians favor both. Indeed, 70 percent of Asians want school choice, and in big metropolitan areas, they are in the forefront of the pro-charter school movement. NCAPA strongly supports affirmative action, and while 53 percent of Asians say that it is a good thing in general, 76 percent say it should not be a deciding factor in school admissions criteria. There are two Hispanic civil rights organizations that claim to speak for their people, the League of United Latin American Citizens (LULAC) and UnidosUS (formerly National Center of La Raza). Not too long ago they wanted to drop the terms Latino and Latina in referring to Hispanic men and women, respectively, favoring instead the sex-neutral term, Latinx. But due to the backlash from their own people, LULAC dropped the term from its communications in 2021 and UnidosUS only sparingly invokes its, such as when referring to LGBTQ Latinx. There is a reason for this: only 2 percent of Hispanics like Latinx—they are quite comfortable being identified as a man or a woman. LULAC is opposed to school choice but favors charter schools. UnidosUS is agnostic on school choice but is also supportive of charter schools. By contrast, 71 percent of Hispanics want school choice (they also favor charter schools). LULAC and UnidosUS support affirmative action, but only 36 percent of Hispanics say it is a good thing in general; 81 percent are opposed to it being a factor in deciding which students to admit. It is striking how much influence the big donor class has on these civil rights groups. Black, Asian and Hispanic organizations had better bow to their left-wing demands or they will be cut off lickety split. So even if it means selling out their own people, the leading spokesmen are prepared to do so. It is not white supremacists who are working against the educational interests of minorities—it is the leaders in their own community. They are a national disgrace.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfc3lA2i2_35S6vLuj96nsM	2024-12-11T09:26:17-08:00	
From River To Sea Both Should Be Free From Hatred And Suffering –...	Gaza peace activist Ahmed Fouad Alkhatib has embarked on a one-man social media campaign to draw attention to the human plight of the majority of Gazans who are not involved with terror, and call for mutual recognition between Palestinians and Israelis in the hope that the two peoples will someday be able to share the same land in peace. He has published editorials in Haaretz, the Wall Street Journal, and The Forward, among others, and has laid out his vision for peace in his blog with The Times of Israel. His dovish advocacy efforts, has gained him a following of over 33,000 on X. 'There's a reason why the Palestinians have no state 75 years after the establishment of Israel,' he said. 'It's their awful leadership that goes back to the pan-Arabism of the Nasser days, and that has adopted different ideologies – the secular PLO [Palestine Liberation Organization], the Marxist PFLP [Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine], or Islamist Hamas – to sell different versions of the same narrative: We're going to liberate all of Palestine.' But more than 43,000 people in the Gaza Strip have been killed in the first 14 months of fighting, a figure that includes some 20-22,000 Hamas terrorists Israel says it has killed in battle. In Arabic, the word Jihad is a noun meaning the activity of 'striving and/or persevering.' According to Prophet Muhammad there are two types of Jihad: minor and major. Once when Muslims were returning from a military expedition, which for Prophet Muhammad was a minor jihad. He said to the fighters that now they had to go through the major jihad. When Prophet Muhammad was asked what he meant by major jihad, he said it was the spiritual jihad. On another occasion, he said the real mujahid is the one who declares jihad against his/her carnal soul. (Tirmidhi). Exercising self-control and using willpower and reason to overcome one's anger is described by Prophet Muhammad as 'the major jihad.' Overcoming our own feelings of hatred, revenge and anger is much more difficult than overcoming our enemies. In today's world of fanaticism and extremism the words of Al-Ghazali, a 12th century Persian Muslim theologian, need to be repeated by all the world's religious and political leaders: 'Declare your jihad on thirteen enemies you cannot see – Egoism, Arrogance, Conceit, Selfishness, Greed, Lust, Intolerance, Anger, Lying, Cheating, Gossiping and Slandering. If you can master and destroy them, then you will be ready to fight the enemy you can see.' Congresswoman Rashida Tlaib says, 'From the river to the sea is an aspirational call for freedom, human rights, and peaceful coexistence, not death, destruction, or hate.' I say we can make it truly aspirational by making it focus on both people first and the land second. 'From the river to the sea Palestinians and Israelis should be freed of hatred and suffering by 'a two state for two peoples sharing of the land peacefully solution.'' But the Hamas' 2017 charter states that in principle, it 'rejects any alternative to the full and complete liberation of Palestine, from the river to the sea.' Hamas opposes a two state solution, wants all the land between the Mediterranean Sea and the River Jordan, and violently opposed the Oslo peace accords negotiated by Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) in the mid-1990s. If the war ends with Hamas weakened, and with a new Israeli government elected; there is the hope that the miracle of the Yom Kippur War may be repeated. On October 27, 1978, only five years after Egypt started the Yom Kippur War with a surprise attack on Israel, Egyptian President Anwar Sadat and Israeli Prime Minister Menachem Begin were named winners of the Nobel Peace Prize for their progress toward achieving a Middle East accord. The Yom Kippur War was followed six years later by a Peace Treaty between Egypt and Israel. Could the same process follow the defeat of Hamas, and its opposition to a two state solution? The only possible chance for avoiding more wars is the two state solution. To establish a Palestinian state alongside Israel. That will not be possible with the current leaders on either side. Extremists, both Israeli and Palestinian, will do all they can to sink the idea, as they have done since the 1990s. If 14 months of war does not deliver enough shock to break deeply-held prejudices and to make the idea of two states viable, nothing will. And without a mutually-acceptable way of ending the conflict, more generations of Palestinians and Israelis will be sentenced to more wars. Although it might seem impossible now, I do believe that within a decade or two Muslims will visit Jerusalem and pray together with Jews as Prophet Zechariah predicts: 'Then everyone who survives from all the nations that came against Jerusalem shall go up year after year to worship the King, the LORD of hosts, and to celebrate the Feast of Booths.' (Zechariah 14:16) For more than eight decades political nationalist leaders in Israel and Palestine have failed to find a way to end the conflict between their two peoples. Perhaps it is time for religious leaders who understand the religious importance of repentance, humility, forgiveness, compromise and hope for peace in overcoming more than seven decades of pain and anger. As the Qur'an states: 'Perhaps Allah will put, between you and those to whom you have been enemies among them, affection. And Allah is competent, and Allah is Forgiving and Merciful.' (60:7) Then the words of the Qur'an will be full-filled 'From the depths of Darkness into the Light; for Allah is very kind and merciful to you.' (Qur'an 57:9) There is much about the Gaza war that we still don't know: how long it will last, what the death toll will be, how many hostages will be returned, and how successful Israel will be in its objective of weakening Hamas. Dr. Mohamed Chtatou, a Professor at a university in Rabat, Morocco writes: 'After the current (Hamas-Israel) war, Israel's ultra-nationalist coalition will undoubtedly be undermined by public opinion, and probably by a commission of inquiry. If the Palestinian Authority were to agree to take over Gaza – backed by the international reconstruction aid that would inevitably arrive – and if a centrist coalition government were to emerge in Israel, everything would once again be possible. Two difficult 'ifs'? Perhaps, but there is no serious alternative.' The Qur'an refers to Prophet Abraham as a community or a nation: 'Abraham was a nation-community [Ummah]; dutiful to God, a monotheist [hanif], not one of the polytheists.' (16:120) If Prophet Abraham is an Ummah; then fighting between the descendants of Prophets Ishmael and Isaac is a civil war and should always be avoided. Even the surprise attack by Egypt and Syria of the Yom Kippur War was followed six years later by a Peace Treaty between Egypt and Israel. Could the same process follow the weakening of Hamas? Prophet Muhammad said: 'Should I not tell you what is better in degree than prayer, fasting, and charity.' They (the companions) said: 'Yes.' He said: 'Reconciling people, because grudges and disputes are a razor (that shaves off faith).' (Ahmad, Abu Dawood, and At-Tirmithi) This is an excellent guide to dealing with the three-generation old Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Rather than focusing mostly on what the other side did to us, we all should focus on how the conflict has hurt all of us, and how much better our future would be if we could live next to each other in peace. If the descendants of Prophet Isaac and Prophet Ishmael negotiate a settlement that reflects the religious policy that '...there is no sin upon them if they make terms of settlement between them – and settlement [reconciliation and peace] is best.' (Quran 4:128) The Nakba (catastrophe), the displacement of Palestinians during the 1948 establishment of the State of Israel and the War of Independence, could have been totally avoided if the Palestinian leadership had accepted the UN two state solution. Indeed, if the Palestinian leadership had accepted the British 1937 two state solution; millions of Jews would have been able to avoid the Holocaust (catastrophe). Hopefully, the Palestinians will not make an all or nothing mistake again. If we all can live up to the ideal of following the will of God we will help fulfill the 2700 year old vision of Prophet Isaiah: 'On that day there will be a highway from Egypt to Assyria. The Assyrians will go to Egypt, and the Egyptians to Assyria. The Egyptians and Assyrians will worship together. On that day Israel will join a three-party alliance with Egypt and Assyria, a blessing upon the heart. The LORD of Hosts will bless them saying, 'Blessed be Egypt My people, Assyria My handiwork, and Israel My inheritance.'...(Isaiah 19:23-5)	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfc3lA2i2_35dRB809r9qnu	2024-12-11T09:24:49-08:00	
The Future Of Syria: Assad’s Asylum In Moscow And Possible Scenar...	It has been announced that Syrian President Bashar al-Assad fled the country and sought asylum in Moscow, where he has obtained a residence permit. Reports suggest that Assad owns 18 luxury apartments in Moscow, purchased beforehand. While Western sources estimate his wealth to be between $1–2 billion, a Syrian intelligence source claims it is as high as $135 billion. However, it seems unlikely that such a large sum could have been transferred in cash. It was likely moved abroad earlier via electronic banking and later converted to rubles in Moscow. The Future of Assad's Wealth and the Global Banking System.... If such transactions are detected in the international banking system, the wealth could be immediately frozen and rendered unusable. In the past, there were rumors of leaders from other countries transporting suitcases full of foreign currency to offshore banks using private planes. Nowadays, such vast amounts are typically transferred electronically. It is expected that Assad and his family will live in Moscow under special protection. Chaos and Prospects for Governance in Post-Assad Syria.... The future of Syria remains uncertain in the aftermath of Assad's departure. There is speculation about the possible establishment of a Taliban-like regime. Reports indicate that some regions have already seen calls for mandatory veiling for women. However, Syria's diverse religious and linguistic composition suggests that such a regime may struggle to maintain long-term stability. The country is currently under heavy Israeli airstrikes, with Israel occupying the strategically significant Mount Hermon. For Syria to recover from this situation, rapid reconstruction and stabilization are needed. However, the country is in dire straits, with almost no access to electricity, water, food, or basic infrastructure. One possible scenario involves Russia strengthening its influence in Syria by expanding its naval and air bases, potentially bringing the country under its full protection. Social Conditions and Refugees.... Reports indicate an increase in executions targeting Assad loyalists and growing pressure on members of the Alawite sect. The duration of this chaos remains uncertain. Syrian refugees abroad are hesitant to return until conditions improve. However, some young men are reportedly entering the country to check on family properties or visit relatives. Syria's future will depend on a combination of international intervention and internal dynamics. Under current conditions, achieving stability and recovery is likely to take a long time. During this period, the roles of the international community and regional powers will be crucial in shaping the nation's trajectory.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfc3lA2i2_35ZudE0KpbDHJ	2024-12-11T09:23:23-08:00	
Human Rights Situation In Afghanistan: Insight From UNAMA Report ...	The United Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan (UNAMA) recently released a comprehensive report detailing the human rights situation in Afghanistan since the Taliban's takeover. The report highlights significant concerns regarding Afghanistan's human rights commitments, the erosion of democratic principles, and the undermining of accountability mechanisms. The UN report underscores the oppressive environment in Afghanistan, with 256 instances of arbitrary arrest and detention and 130 cases of torture, demonstrating the government's brutal crackdown on journalists for their perceived criticism. The UNAMA report documents numerous human rights violations, including extrajudicial killings, torture, arbitrary arrests, and detentions. Despite the Taliban's initial promises to respect human rights, the reality on the ground has been starkly different. The report reveals that women and girls have been particularly affected, facing severe restrictions on their rights to education, work, and participation in public life. One of the most alarming findings of the report is the systematic erosion of women's rights. The Taliban's policies have progressively restricted women's access to education and employment, effectively relegating them to the confines of their homes. The decision to bar girls from returning to secondary school has deprived a generation of their right to education, with long-term implications for the country's development. The report paints a grim picture of the shrinking space for freedom of expression in Afghanistan. Journalists and media outlets operate under constant threat, with many forced to self-censor or shut down entirely. UNAMA highlights numerous cases of intimidation, harassment, arbitrary detention, and even physical violence against journalists. Despite Afghanistan's obligations under the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, the de facto authorities have continuously violated these commitments by stifling freedom of expression and silencing independent media voices. The report also underscores the lack of accountability within the Taliban's administration. Despite some steps aimed at protecting human rights, such as amnesty for former government officials, the Taliban has been responsible for a broad range of violations. The absence of effective justice mechanisms and the dissolution of dedicated reporting pathways for gender-based violence have further exacerbated the situation. The civilian population has borne the brunt of the ongoing violence and instability. UNAMA recorded over 2,100 civilian casualties between mid-August 2021 and mid-June 2022, with many incidents attributed to targeted attacks by extremist groups. These attacks have disproportionately affected ethnic and religious minorities, compounding the challenges faced by vulnerable communities. According to UNAMA, over 28 million Afghans—more than two-thirds of the population—now require humanitarian assistance. Food insecurity is rampant, with families resorting to extreme measures such as selling children into marriage or labor to survive. The humanitarian crisis is further exacerbated by the Taliban’s restrictions on aid delivery, particularly where it involves women workers. The international community has expressed deep concern over the findings of the UNAMA report. There have been calls for increased humanitarian assistance and stronger diplomatic efforts to hold the Taliban accountable for their actions. The report also emphasizes the need for continued monitoring and reporting to ensure that human rights violations are documented and addressed. The international community's response is crucial in addressing these issues. Increased humanitarian assistance, diplomatic pressure, and continued monitoring are essential to ensure that human rights violations are documented and addressed. Supporting Afghan journalists and media workers is also vital, as they play a key role in exposing injustices and holding power to account. While the path forward is fraught with challenges, it is not without hope. With sustained international attention and targeted action, it is possible to alleviate the suffering of the Afghan people and support their aspirations for a more equitable and just society. The time to act is now, before the human rights crisis deepens further into a humanitarian catastrophe.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfc3lA2i2_35fhwhj6GpDnW	2024-12-11T09:21:36-08:00	
Oman: TotalEnergies And OQAE Sign Agreements To Develop 300 MW Of...	In line with its multi-energy strategy in the Sultanate of Oman, TotalEnergies announced Wednesday, together with its partner OQ Alternative Energy (OQAE), the National Renewable Energy Champion, the signing of landmark agreements to develop 300 MW of renewable energy projects in the country. The electricity will be delivered through long-term Power Purchase Agreements (PPA) to Petroleum Development Oman (PDO), the leading exploration and production company in the Sultanate. With respectively 49% and 51% shares, TotalEnergies and OQAE will lead in realizing three renewable projects: North Solar, a 100 MW solar project, located in Saih Nihaydah in northern Oman; Riyah-1 and Riyah-2, two 100 MW wind projects, located in Amin and West Nimr fields in southern Oman. The construction will start in early 2025, and the electricity production in late 2026. These solar and wind projects will generate over 1.4 TWh of renewable electricity annually. 'Following our recent successes in the Sultanate of Oman, notably with the launch of the Marsa LNG project in April, we are pleased to make a new step in the deployment of our integrated multi-energy strategy in Oman,' said Olivier Jouny, Senior Vice President Renewables at TotalEnergies. 'Together with our partner OQAE, we are eager to start the construction of these three projects which will provide long-term renewable electricity to PDO while supporting the Sultanate in its energy transition'. 'We are delighted to sign these agreements, which further reinforce our steadfast commitment to achieving Net Zero emissions by 2050 in line with the objectives of Oman Vision 2040, mainly the diversification of energy sources to ensure sustainable energy security. PDO’s journey towards sustainability was firmly established with previous groundbreaking initiatives, including the Amin Solar IPP Power Plant and the Rima Water Treatment Project. These projects, alongside the ones signed today, continue to reshape Oman’s energy landscape by blending technological innovation with environmental stewardship. They also support our aim of sourcing 30% of our power capacity from renewables by 2026, reflecting our dedication to a cleaner, sustainable future', said Dr Aflah Al Hadhrami, Managing Director of PDO. 'In partnership with PDO and TotalEnergies, OQAE is proud to advance Oman’s transition toward sustainable energy. As an energy transition enabler, we are delighted to lead the development of these projects supporting PDO to achieve their decarbonization plans.

With a focus on environmental stewardship and long-term prosperity, OQAE ensures the delivery of sustainable solutions to meet Oman’s evolving industrial energy needs', stated Ms. Najla Zuhair Al Jamali, Chief Executive of OQ Alternative Energy.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfc3lA2i2_35ebfkhDygXIg	2024-12-11T09:19:09-08:00	
A New Syria By Union Of Clashing Interests – OpEd	Like many people around the world, I rejoiced with the liberated Syrian people when the tyrannical dynasty of a father and son that oppressed them for more than half a century finally came to an end. There is no doubt that the revolutionary lightning that struck Syria and brought down the regime with speed of light would have enormous geopolitical implications and perhaps regional rippling effect. No one can deny the historic significance of December 8. Future generations will be discussing and debating how ill or how well it changed the Middle East. As in all victories, heroes emerged and some even gained instant notoriety for being part of those who toppled Bashar al-Assad. Abu-Mohammed al-Jolani who is the leader of Ha'yat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) is one of them. Already Qatar opened diplomatic communication with Mohamed al-Bashir as soon as he was appointed to lead Syria's transitional administration. Other regional states such as Saudi Arabia, Egypt, and Jordan are expected to follow suit. Too Good To Be True? It is important to note that HTS is the leading militia of the coalition of revolutionary rebels of all shades that liberated Syria. This coalition of Syrian and different foreign elements whose compatibility is untested—a coalition that I would call the Union of Clashing Interests (UCI), seem to be united only on one objective: deposing Bashar Al-Assad. This reminds me of the coalition of militias led by General Mohamed Farah Aidid that marched into Mogadishu, Somalia in 1991. The only thing they all agreed on was to get rid of President Mohamed Siyad Barre. They got their wish, but shortly after it became obvious that their unity had more holes than Swiss cheese and warlordism was their preferred power-sharing mechanism. In geopolitics, if something looks too convenient or too good to be true, follow your gut feeling. In this case, the timing—immediately after the Israel and Lebanon ceasefire was secured—and how al-Assad's grip on power was easily unclenched raise questions. Likewise, how the meticulously synchronized implementation process was successfully executed by UCI and its foreign partners in one of the most complex, oppressed, religiously and ethnically diverse countries in the Middle East without any resistance. The Doha Deal Though the master strategy, training, funding and mobilization was in the works for more than a decade, the implementation did not take place until the Foreign Ministers of Turkiye, Russia, and Iran met in Doha under the Qatari diplomatic facilitation. Russia and Iran realized the checkmate status they were facing ones they were told that Assad accepted a deal once he realized that resistance was futile. Qatar presumably delivered the U.S. commitment to honor the tripartite agreement or whatever privileges Russia and Iran were to get once they came on board. The meeting was by no means a smooth one, but in the end Russia and Iran had no choice but to accept the deal presented to them. Distribution of Spoils History will tell what deals and arrangements were finalized in Doha. We only know that some of Syria's friendly countries such as Russia and Iran have abruptly lost their strategic advantage while others more hostile stakeholders such as Israel, U.S. and Turkiye have gained. If the force driving this whole thing was a cooperative grand strategy, and it must've been, we now have the advantage of hindsight to reconstruct what it may've included. The UCI gets its main objective- ending the Assad tyrannic dynasty. UCI also accepts to only claim specifically designated geographical territories within Syria that is not already under foreign control, regardless of how existentially critical those territories might be for state-building. Assad gets an offer he could not refuse since his regime was already broken beyond repair and his economy was devastated to the point of being unable to pay his soldiers and civil servants' salaries, or even keep the lights on in Damascus. He and his immediate family would get safe exit to Russia via UAE. He would command his generals and cabinet ministers to avoid sabotaging the takeover process and to ensure smooth transitioning of power. Turkiye gets to keep the areas it already controls in Syria and gets to replace Russia as the most influential political actor. To be more specific, Turkiye will be the one running the new Syria. This, due to it's a decade-long investment and strategic allegiance with the HTS and other Syrian and Turkic rebel militias that are part of UCI. The U.S. gets to keep Syria's oil and gas fields and the agricultural territories that they have been exploiting for more than a decade. And Turkiye that is in a strategic partnership with U.S. (and Israel) will ignore this as it has been doing for a decade. This awkward but pragmatic position has labeled President Erdogan with hypocrisy in some circles. You can see in this 2019 clip, then President Trump reasserting U.S.' determination to keep Syria's oil and gas fields while President Erdogan was seated next to him in the White House. U.S. has the Syrian Kurds as a strategic leverage. Though losing its last loyal client in the Middle East is a major setback, Russia gets to host her most loyal friend in the Middle East indefinitely. But, despite losing Syria and some of its military bases, Russia gets reassurances to keep its sizeable airbase in north-west Syria and a naval facility at the Mediterranean port of Tartus. Iran gets to withdraw its special forces, military experts, intelligence, and diplomats safely. Iran gets reassurances that the Shia community will not be targeted for revenge. With previously telegraphed opportunity to get de-sanctioned which is also a green light to pursue its nuclear program, it was not a hard sell. Some policy and military experts advocate a Middle East version MAD (mutually assured destruction) strategy to deter Israel's four decade long threat. In exchange, Iran would cancel her planned retaliation attack against Israel. Exploitation By The Usual Suspect So, does this latest revolution in Syria lend a free hand to Israel to continue the genocide in Gaza and the annexation of the West Bank? The short but painful answer is, yes. However, this could also expedite the Zionist genocidal regime's demise. Despite Netanyahu's rhetoric of reengineering the Middle East to his preferred balance of power and making Israel the grand hegemon that totally dominates the region militarily, economically, and politically, such claim is nothing more than a pipedream. Of course, some may strongly disagree with this conclusion after seeing the military power that Israel has been projecting in its massive bombings of several countries at the same time and its total destruction of all of Syria's air and navy bases with all its fighter jets, navy ships as well as weapons factories and storage facilities since Assad's departure. Within 48 hours, Israel executed 350 major air strikes in Syria- an average of 7 strikes per hour. That is quite a shock and awe. But if military might alone could help Israel achieve its Zionist 'greater Israel' ambition, it would have happened 76 years ago. In the past 14 months of sadistic genocide against Palestinians of Gaza, people are still courageously insisting 'give me freedom or give me death.' During that period, Israel has become diplomatically more radioactive than ever before. Things have never been worse for Israel in terms of security, unity, economy and demography as a large number of its citizens have been fleeing the country to Europe and U.S. Like Ukraine, Israel is suffering shortage of soldiers. Yet it continues to start a new war across the region. Netanyahu and his extremist regime is yet to learn that hubris is evil, and evil boomerangs. Can the Second Revolution Last? The litmus test on the authenticity of this latest revolutionary movement is buried in the names of HTS and its leader, al-Golani.. If the movement's objective, as indicated in its Arabic name, is to liberate Sham. The historical Sham included modern day countries such as Syria, Palestine, Israel, Lebanon, Jordan, and parts of southern Türkiye. Al-Golani is a nickname to indicate HTS leader's ancestral roots- the Golan Heights which is illegally annexed by Israel. And since Al-Golani and the militias he leads took over Syria, Israel grabbed more Syrian land to keep as a 'buffer zone.' Though al-Golani and his militia group remain in the U.S. terrorist lists, they are being afforded platforms in Western media such as CNN and are being presented as reformed moderate rebels. This questionable relationship is explained by Jake Sullivan, the current National Security Advisor, in a declassified email he sent in 2012 to then Secretary of State Hillary Clinton: 'AQ is on our side in Syria.' Al-Qaida/ISIS is a pawn. Though his reconciliatory statements and promises to institute democratic process for legitimacy and guarantees of protection to all minority communities are greatly appreciated, whether al-Golani has the vision, strategic patience, leadership skills, and the competent team necessary to lead broken Syria to become a functional and a unified state again is to be seen. Once the euphoria subsides, there must be objective reassessment and accountability. Meanwhile, a Divine intervention aside, the reconstitution of a single Syrian state within the current geopolitical dynamics in the region is simply too idealistic. This would require a unified Syrian-owned master strategy to disentangle the geopolitical live wires encircling this traumatized nation. There is a lot to learn from the Somalia experience. It is an open lesson.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfc3lA2i2_35VNW_kmnPV4P	2024-12-11T09:18:15-08:00	
Ding Dong, Australia’s Misinformation-Disinformation Bill Is Dead...	Regulating speech at law is much like regulating breath. At what point is an intake of air deemed inappropriate to the body and worthy of rationing? When will exhalation be allowed? The very idea that speech requires ordering and control is the first step to preventing its exercise. Death, in this case to freedom of thought and political expression, is bound to follow. Unfortunately, the rationing of speech and its exercise is a favourite of governments the world over, even in liberal democratic countries. As it’s the only genuine way one can address the gross inequality between the power of the citizenry and the governing authorities exercising such a right is bound to strike terror in the hearts of those who shun accountability and criticism. Importantly, it also points to the possibility of losing control, be it over official narratives or myths deemed palatable to those in power. Much of this was evident in the recently ditched Communications Legislation Amendment (Combating Misinformation and Disinformation) Bill 2024 proposed by Australia’s Albanese government. It was a bill that had already made its debut in a previous iteration but had been revised and redressed for parliamentary consumption. The revision, and redressing, failed to impress. In Australian Senate hearings on the bill, the edifice began to crumble. Nationals Senator Ross Cadell, in a question to the Communications Department, wondered why there wasn’t a single witness not a member of the government agency who 'says this bill should pass as it is'. On November 22, the Greens demanded that the government pull the draft, arguing that it exempted such media titans as Rupert Murdoch while shifting the responsibility 'to tech companies and billionaires like Elon Musk to determine what is true or false under ambiguous definitions.' Facing certain defeat, the Albanese government revealed its position a few days later. 'Based on public statements and engagements with senators, it is clear that there is no pathway to legislate this proposal through the Senate,' conceded Communications Minister Michelle Rowland. On its demise, former deputy prime minister and Nationals MP Barnaby Joyce was characteristically colourful: 'This shabby, decrepit, blanket over democracy is not even going to make it to the Vinnies bin, […] it’s going straight to the tip where it will be burnt.' Why, then, was this bill so problematic? For one, it proposed adding schedule 9 to the Broadcasting Services Act 1992 (Cth), imposing core obligations on digital platforms to make their own risk assessments regarding misinformation and disinformation on their platforms, and publishing their findings on the matter; publish their policy or policy approach regarding how misinformation and disinformation is managed; and publish what an oddly named 'a media literacy plan' that would outline the measures that the platform will take to enable users to identify misinformation and disinformation. In first placing the onus on digital tech giants to effectively police content supposedly deemed by Australian government regulators to fall foul of the 'mis-disinformation' bar, the warning shot to information exchange was being made with a clamour. But just to add another layer of stifling, rough and ready regulation, the Australian Communications and Media Authority (ACMA) would have been empowered to do a number of things. Its powers would have included obtaining documents and information regarding such misinformation and disinformation from the platforms, make rules regarding their recording and retaining of records on the same, even if disallowable by Parliament; approve and register misinformation codes, even if disallowable by Parliament; and determine misinformation standards in cases where the misinformation codes supposedly did not protect the Australian community. When it comes to the relevant meanings, misinformation, for instance, is described in subclause 13(1) as content containing information 'reasonably verifiable as false, misleading or deceptive.' Expansively, and chillingly, this intended to include opinions, claims, commentary and invective. Indeed, the Explanatory Memorandum is damning in noting, with approval, such a provision, warning that 'experience from around the world suggests that misinformation and disinformation of this nature can influence public opinion and sway voter behaviour to such an extent that the outcome of an electoral process can no longer be said to represent the free will of the electorate.' Disinformation, subclause 13(2), shifts the focus to intention, namely, the 'grounds to suspect that the person disseminating, or causing the dissemination of, the content intends to deceive another person'. The concept of serious harm in the bill was critical. Not only would it cover such instances as information on public health, but also 'harm to the operation or integrity of a Commonwealth, State, Territory or local government electoral or referendum process'. Doing so would effectively vest ACMA with powers to comb through information shared during an electoral or referendum process, even if it was a mere opinion, true or false. Political speech becomes the object. The Bill was also not intended to cover the dissemination of 'professional news' – which more than suggests a threat to independent media outlets not officially approved as appropriate outlets for journalism. In the US, we can at least rely on constitutional protections that saw the sinking of the absurd Disinformation Government Board, established in 2022 to guide the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) in targeting the deliberate dissemination of false information. The advisory body, while lacking, according to the DHS, 'operational authority or capability', was advertised as a council of wise creatures, working 'in a way that protects Americans’ freedom of speech, civil rights, civil liberties, and privacy.' The Board was swiftly, to cite a word common in press coverage at the time, 'paused' after a mere three weeks on suspicions that it would be unworkable and unconstitutional. 'Legally, it is rarely permissible for the US government to be the arbiter of truth,' wrote Jill Goldenziel for Forbes in May 2022. 'The name suggested that it would do just that – despite DHS officials’ protests that it was designed to protect free speech.' Despite these failings, the Board’s former chair, Nina Jankowicz, has been busy promoting its ideas abroad, notably on the issue of electoral interference. Jankowicz, who markets herself as a disinformation expert, did her best in a visit to Australia to warn about malicious agents attempting to meddle in the Australian electoral system. On Radio National’s Saturday Extra, she was unequivocal that the triumph of the 'No' vote in the 2023 referendum held to decide whether an indigenous voice should be constitutionally enshrined, had been driven by some 9,000 digital accounts based in China. Never mind that the voters convincingly rejected the proposition. Despite admitting that one should still look 'at the data' to verify her case, breezy speculation abounded. An indigenous voice to parliament could have threatened Chinese mining rights. Joyce is only partly correct in assuming that this hideous bill perished in a fiery tip reserved for bad legislation. Its remains will be revived and reincarnated in due course, along with the justifications of danger, instability and chaos that arise when citizens traverse the World Wide Web unsupervised. And it is impossible to imagine a Coalition government, certainly one run by the paranoid Peter Dutton, resisting the temptations of restricting thought, content and communications expressed online.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfGUp7G19bqpHiqiiu3Ckk3	2024-12-10T17:32:30-08:00	
Lithuania’s Political Shift: Domestic And Foreign Policy – OpEd	By Linas Kojala (FPRI) -- In October 2024, Lithuania’s opposition Social Democratic Party (LSDP) emerged victorious in the parliamentary elections, defeating the center-right Homeland Union – Lithuanian Christian Democrats (HU-LCD), which had been in power since 2020. The Social Democrats secured 52 seats, while the HU-LCD won 28. Other parties included the nationalist-populist Dawn of Nemunas, with 20 seats, and the Democratic Union 'For Lithuania' (DVSL) with 14. The Social Democrats formed a coalition with DVSL and Dawn of Nemunas, achieving a commanding majority with 86 out of 141 seats. This outcome aligned with Lithuania’s political tradition of not reelecting the same government since independence in 1990. During the campaign, the Social Democrats emphasized their opposition to forming a grand coalition with the center-right, despite HU-LCD leaders expressing openness to such an arrangement. On November 21, Gintautas Paluckas was appointed Prime Minister after Vilija Blinkevičiūtė, the leader of the Social Democrats, chose to remain in her European Parliament role instead of pursuing the position of Prime Minister, despite previously pledging to assume full responsibility for the government if elected. Paluckas, who has served as a member of Parliament since 2020 and as Deputy Mayor of Vilnius, led the Social Democratic Party from 2017 to 2021. The Social Democrats’ campaign largely focused on domestic issues, including combating the rising cost of living, fighting poverty, improving healthcare access, and ensuring a dignified life for citizens. They also highlighted the importance of preparing for potential crises, strengthening national defenses, and reinforcing Lithuania’s European and transatlantic partnerships. Education, which has faced challenges in recent years, was also a major theme. The newly formed ruling coalition immediately faced criticism due to accusations of anti-Semitic statements against Remigijus Žemaitaitis, leader of the Dawn of the Nemunas party. Although Žemaitaitis denied the charges, the Lithuanian Constitutional Court ruled earlier this year that his comments about Jewish people incited hatred and violated the constitution, as well as breached his oath of office. In response, Paluckas assured the public that the government would not tolerate any anti-Semitic rhetoric or actions. Meanwhile, President Nausėda announced that members of Žemaitaitis’ party would not be appointed to the government, leaving the possibility for technocratic appointments only. Future of Foreign and Security Policy While national security and foreign affairs were not central issues during the election campaign, as major parties broadly agreed on supporting Lithuania’s NATO and EU membership, there is little expectation of change in Lithuania’s foreign and security policy. Public opinion strongly supports these alliances, and the government is expected to continue its robust stance in defense matters and international relations. The new government plans to allocate at least 3% of GDP to defense in 2025, with an aim of reaching 3.5% in the near future. Additional spending is needed to prepare the necessary infrastructure to host a full German brigade by 2027 and form a national division by 2030. Dovilė Šakalienė, the Social Democratic choice for defense minister, is strongly committed to these goals. Kęstutis Budrys, the designated foreign minister and current national security advisor to President Nausėda, will likely strengthen coordination between the presidency and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. One area of divergence between President Nausėda and outgoing foreign minister Gabrielius Landsbergis was their approach to China. In 2021, Lithuania’s decision to open a Taiwanese representative office resulted in a severe response from China, including recalling its ambassador and imposing trade sanctions. While President Nausėda has advocated for restoring diplomatic relations with China, he insists this must occur without yielding to Beijing’s demands. Prime Minister Paluckas shares this stance; although, a significant breakthrough in relations is unlikely without major concessions from Lithuania, especially given China’s firm position. According to Budrys, the ball is in China’s court to improve the bilateral relationship. Lithuanians have closely followed the US presidential election, with polls showing a strong preference for Kamala Harris over Donald Trump, likely due to Trump’s stance on Ukraine and NATO. While concerns remain about continued military support for Ukraine and NATO obligations under a potential second Trump administration, past experiences indicate that Lithuania’s strategic alignment with NATO and Ukraine will remain intact. To maintain good relations with Trump, Lithuania is emphasizing that it is surpassing NATO defense spending requirements, taking a strong stance on China, and continuing to import liquefied natural gas (LNG) from the US through its national LNG terminal. Lithuania is also in consideration to increase these imports. In a pre-election interview, Mike Waltz, Trump’s national security advisor, underscored Lithuania’s energy policy just before the presidential election, emphasizing the importance of closer energy ties. In conclusion, while domestic politics in Lithuania have shifted with the center-left forces now in power, foreign policy is expected to remain largely unchanged. Lithuania will continue to align with NATO and the EU, support Ukraine, and take a firm stance on China. However, challenges may emerge from a potential second Trump administration, particularly regarding military support for Ukraine and NATO obligations. A recent poll in the US offers some reassurance, as 54% of Americans say they support defending Lithuania, Latvia, and Estonia if Russia were to attack—a figure that has remained steady over the years. One major event on the horizon to address these challenges is the tenth Vilnius Foreign and Security Policy Conference on December 10, 2024, organized by the Geopolitics and Security Studies Center (previously known as Eastern Europe Studies Center) in Vilnius. The conference will focus on critical security and foreign policy issues, bringing together international leaders, newly appointed government officials, and experts to discuss the future of NATO, regional security, and the evolving geopolitical landscape. The Foreign Policy Research Institute will partner with the event, broadcasting the discussions via social media platforms. Register to attend virtually.

Indonesian Armed Forces May Resist Anti-Graft Agency Probing Mili...	By Nazarudin Latif and Pizaro Gozali Idrus The Indonesian armed forces may resist a landmark court ruling last month that gave the national anti-graft agency a greenlight to investigate corruption in the military, analysts are warning. The military has long enjoyed autonomy in handling criminal cases involving its members, but that has contributed to a perception that it protects the armed forces from accountability, according to political observers. Potential pushback from the Indonesian Armed Forces (TNI) to the newly expanded powers of the Corruption Eradication Commission(KPK) could manifest in a non-formal way, said Khairul Fahmi, a military analyst. 'The military may delay access to documents or witnesses, citing national security concerns,' Fahmi, with the Institute for Security and Strategic Studies (ISESS) in Jakarta, told BenarNews. 'Additionally, internal regulations within the TNI might not align with the KPK’s procedures, which could slow down investigations.' On Nov. 29, the Constitutional Court ruled that the commission could pursue cases involving military personnel if the investigation began under the KPK’s jurisdiction. The ruling took immediate effect. Cases initiated by other law enforcement agencies or within the military justice system would remain outside the KPK’s purview, the ruling said. Previously, military courts mostly maintained jurisdiction over cases related to the armed forces. Indonesia’s military has maintained a judicial system that operates separately from civilian courts, with proceedings often shielded from public scrutiny, Fahmi noted. 'The military’s strong hierarchical culture often creates reluctance to involve external parties in internal matters, including corruption cases, as such involvement is perceived as a threat to its autonomy,' Fahmi said. TNI spokesperson Maj. Gen. Haryanto said the military was studying the ruling. 'We will ensure that the enforcement of this decision adheres to principles of justice and transparency, without compromising our core duties of safeguarding the nation’s sovereignty,' he said. The ruling also highlights the military’s entrenched power within Indonesian society and its dominance in the country’s political landscape, especially during the 32-year rule of President Suharto, the late dictator, analysts have said. Any potential resistance to a shift in this power could also be shaped by the military’s internal culture, which prizes loyalty and hierarchy, they said. These attributes may discourage whistleblowing or external oversight, as subordinates are unlikely to challenge superiors. This can, in turn, foster a culture of impunity, where corrupt practices are tolerated to maintain internal solidarity. Such a situation has often led to the protection of officers involved in corruption, which creates a culture of impunity that is difficult to break, said Jaleswari Pramodhawardani, the head of Lab45, a political and security policy think-tank. 'Defense and security sectors are prone to corruption, but tackling these issues requires navigating intricate political dynamics and national security concerns,' Jaleswari told BenarNews. She pointed out that the Ministry of Defense’s budget has often been criticized for its lack of transparency, further complicating efforts to monitor military spending effectively by adding another layer of difficulty in effective monitoring. Alexander Marwata, a KPK deputy chairman, said the court’s ruling would lead to fair probes, the state news agency Antara reported. 'This decision reaffirms the KPK’s authority to investigate corruption cases, ensuring that those who were previously above the law, can be investigated fairly,' Marwata said. KPK often has to halt inquiry The Constitutional Court’s ruling marks an opportunity to address longstanding cases of military corruption that have been sidelined because of the secrecy of military courts, according to Julius Ibrani, director of the Indonesian Legal Aid Foundation (PBHI). 'Many corruption cases have faced difficulties due to national security concerns and the exclusive military court system,' Julius told BenarNews. He cited past cases, such as an investigation into then-Vice Marshal Henri Alfiandi, the former head of the National Search and Rescue Agency (Basarnas), where the KPK was forced to halt its inquiry after military police took over the case. Henri was accused of accepting bribes totaling 8.65 billion rupiah (U.S. $546,474) related to procurement projects at Basarnas between 2021 and 2023. He went on trial in March, but the verdict has not been made public. Diky Anandya, a researcher at Indonesia Corruption Watch (ICW), said the KPK needed to map potential corruption hotspots within the military and the Ministry of Defense. 'Any investigations involving active-duty personnel should fall under the KPK’s jurisdiction to ensure impartiality,' he said.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfGUp7G19bqpAGw1tYKtDyr	2024-12-10T16:49:18-08:00	
Georgia On The Brink: What The US Should Do Next – Analysis	By Luke Coffey Current Situation For the past week, hundreds of thousands of Georgians have taken to the streets to protest the Georgian Dream government. While the protests have been centered in Tbilisi, large-scale demonstrations are taking place across the country, including in Batumi, Kutaisi, Zugdidi, and Gori. Large rallies (by local standards) have also been taking place in smaller towns that have no track record of such activity, like Khashuri, Kareli, and Zestaphoni. These protests are driven by several grievances: (1) the Georgian Dream government’s recent announcement that it will suspend European Union membership talks until 2028, (2) the questionable administration of the October parliamentary elections, (3) mounting controversy surrounding the government’s current nominee for the presidency, and (4) the government’s heavy-handed treatment of protesters, which has included beating, detaining, and arresting protesters and the reckless use of tear gas and water cannons in freezing temperatures. Why the US Should Care about Georgia Georgia’s struggle is part of the wider geopolitical struggle between Russia and the West. In recent years, Georgian Dream has adopted a decidedly pro-Kremlin worldview, denounced Western sanctions against Moscow, increased Georgia’s economic relations with Russia, and blamed the war in Ukraine on the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. The party has remained in control thanks to power consolidation efforts that seek to undermine legitimate political opposition, civil society, and the media. Georgians are standing up to Russia, a noble cause that aligns with the United States’ national interest. Georgia’s strategic location makes it important for US objectives in Eurasia. Georgia sits at a crucial geographical and cultural crossroads in the South Caucasus and has remained militarily and economically vital for centuries. Oil and gas pipelines that pass through the country are particularly important to Europe’s energy security and therefore to US interests as well. Georgia demonstrates the importance of national sovereignty.Georgia represents the idea that sovereign nations should determine their own paths. Georgians should decide who their country’s allies are, who their leaders are, and how they are governed. No outside actor (in this case, Russia) can veto another country’s participation in organizations like the EU or NATO. The US needs to restore its respect in Georgia. Georgian Dream officials have publicly attacked or mocked multiple US ambassadors, members of Congress, and other senior US officials who support the Georgian people. The Georgian people have stood with the US in the past. Before Russia’s 2008 invasion of Georgia, it had the second most troops in Iraq after the US. And on a per capita basis, Georgia lost more soldiers in Afghanistan than any other nation. At the height of Georgia’s participation in that war, the country had more than 2,000 troops deployed to some of the deadliest places in the country, if not the world, in the Helmand and Kandahar Provinces. Time for Action In coordination with the European Union and the United Kingdom, the US should: Encourage snap elections in spring 2025 under international supervision. The US should not recognize the legitimacy of the Georgian parliament and should support President Salome Zourabichvili’s efforts to hold new elections and create a new central election commission. Target Georgian Dream leaders and pro-regime security forces with sanctions and travel bans. At a minimum, the US should implement the same sanctions that Estonia, Lithuania, and Latvia recently levied against Georgian officials. All sanctioned officials should be named publicly. The US should also consider the use of the Magnitsky Act. To go further, Congress could bring the MEGOBARI Act and the Georgian People’s Act to a vote before the legislative session adjourns. Downgrade the US diplomatic presence in Georgia until there is a legitimate government in Tbilisi. The US should replace its ambassador to Tbilisi with a chargé d’affaires. And Washington should not accept the credentials for a new Georgian ambassador after the previous one courageously resigned in protest against Georgian Dream’s actions. Suspend all US-Georgia military cooperation until there is a legitimate government in place. This should include joint training exercises, military education programs, and the National Guard State Partnership Program between Tbilisi and the US state of Georgia. Block NATO-Georgia engagement until there is a legitimate government in place. This should include (1) meetings of the NATO-Georgia Commission, (2) the Substantial NATO-Georgia Package, (3) the Defence Institution Building School, and (4) Georgia’s participation in the NATO Response Force. Collect and collate information about Georgian security service personnel involved in the unlawful crackdown on peaceful protesters. The US State Department and the Department of Homeland Security should allow social media users to submit evidence anonymously through a secure website to identify security personnel involved in the repression. The US, UK, and EU should use this information to vet future applications for entry. Ensure that US Agency for International Development (USAID) funds allocated for Georgia support America’s national interest. The US has already paused $95 million in foreign aid programs that directly support the Georgian Dream government. In addition, the US should use USAID’s Office of Transition Initiatives to rapidly increase aid to pro-democracy civil society groups and independent media organizations.

China Balances Cautiously Between Russia And North Korea – Analys...	By Yao Bowen The recent strengthening of the alliance between Russia and North Korea marks an unusual convergence of military and political interests. With reports of North Korean soldiers supporting Russia in the Ukraine war, the alliance has significant implications for regional and global geopolitical dynamics. For China, the Russia–North Korea alignment has some advantages but also presents has risks, reminiscent of its experience in the Cold War. China remains cautious about alliances, a stance it has maintained throughout the post-Cold War era. North Korea is China’s only treaty ally, though senior Chinese officials have declared the relationship between Beijing and Moscow as one that has ‘no limits’ in the lead up to the Russia-Ukraine war. Historical parallels, particularly with the Korean War, reveal much about China’s current strategy. In the 1950s, the Soviet Union and North Korea initiated the Korean War without consulting China, drawing Beijing into a costly conflict to defend its borders and strategic interests. Two key differences define the present situation. First, the Korean War unfolded on China’s doorstep and necessitated its direct intervention, while the geographical distance of the Ukraine war reduces the urgency of Chinese involvement. Second, China no longer relies economically or militarily on Russia. Instead, Moscow seeks Beijing’s support, giving China greater manoeuvring room to prioritise its national interests without being ensnared in conflicts that could jeopardise its global interests. China’s relationship with North Korea remains a complex and often fraught issue. While state media typically steers clear of criticising Pyongyang, academic circles in China openly discuss the country’s policy towards its unpredictable neighbour. Some scholars have advocated for a reassessment of Beijing’s stance on Pyongyang, warning against the risks of close alignmentwith North Korea. These debates highlight the ongoing tension between China’s historical and ideological connections to Pyongyang and its pragmatic focus on national interests. This delicate balancing act is evident in China’s restrained response to the deepening Russia–North Korea alliance, with Beijing carefully avoiding moves that might provoke Western retaliation or disrupt vital economic ties. The Russia–North Korea partnership presents both opportunities and challenges for China. On the one hand, it could divert US attention and resources from regions like the South China Sea and Taiwan. On the other hand, deeper entanglement in the Russia–North Korea alliance risks destabilising regional stability and damaging China’s international image, especially if the West intensifies scrutiny or escalates military its posture towards Russia. Lessons from the Korean War continue to shape China’s diplomatic strategy. Stalin’s unilateral decision to support North Korea in the 1950s showcased the dangers of asymmetrical alliances, where China bore disproportionate costs. Today’s alliance dynamics underscore the importance Beijing places on maintaining agency in decision-making. Transparent and reciprocal partnerships are essential to avoid being dragged into conflicts that do not serve China’s strategic goals. China’s historical experience with Taiwan also informs Beijing’s restrained stance. The outbreak of the Korean War prompted the United States to include Taiwan under its defence umbrella, thwarting China’s ambitions to reunify the island. This historical episode heightens Beijing’s aversion to direct confrontation with the United States and its preference for maintaining stability to focus on long-term economic growth. Despite its wariness, China’s tacit support for North Korea and Russia stems from shared opposition to Western hegemony although Beijing’s involvement remains carefully calibrated to align with its economic and political priorities. This pragmatic approach helps China navigate the complexities of its relationships without succumbing to ideological pressure. Growing Russia–North Korea ties could, however, destabilise Northeast Asia, a region where China has a most significant stake. An emboldened North Korea, backed by Russia, could provoke regional tensions, undermining China’s efforts to maintain a stable environment for economic development. And aligning too closely with international pariahs risks alienating China’s partners in Europe and Southeast Asia, complicating its bid to position itself as a global leader. Recent diplomatic engagements illustrate China’s nuanced stance. During the November 2024 G20 sideline meeting with US President Joe Biden, Chinese President Xi Jinping stated that China will not tolerate conflict on the Korean Peninsula and will not remain idle if its strategic security and core interests are under threat. This assertion underscores China’s view of the Korean Peninsula as a core interest, and explains its cautious approach to the Russia–North Korea alliance. China’s delicate balancing act highlights the challenges of managing historical alliances in a modern context. By drawing on lessons learnt from the Korean War, China seeks to avoid the pitfalls of asymmetric dependence while prioritising its long-term ambitions. Its careful diplomacy aims to harness the strategic advantages of its partnerships without being drawn into a costly confrontation. Historical experience during the Cold War reminds China of the risks inherent in ideological alliances and the need for a pragmatic approach to secure its future on the global stage.

America’s Disastrous And Endless Meddling In Asia – OpEd	The 'loss of China' to communism in 1949 was a pivotal moment in American foreign policy, for the fall of the Nationalist government (Kuomintang, KMT) led by Chiang Kai-shek to the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) under Mao Zedong marked a significant shift in the geopolitical landscape of Asia. It was quickly followed by the outbreak of war in Korea, and indeed Washington’s calculations regarding the peninsula became closely entangled with their calculations regarding the new regime in Beijing. This article examines the Truman administration’s policies regarding China and Taiwan before the outbreak of the Korean War, the strategic calculations involved, the impact of domestic political pressures, particularly McCarthyism, on U.S. foreign policy, and their relevance to today. Following World War II, the civil war in China between the Nationalists and the Communists, interrupted by the Second Sino-Japanese War, reignited. Despite substantial American support, the Nationalists were unable to maintain control. Dean Acheson, Secretary of State under President Harry S. Truman, detailed the reasons for this failure in his statement on August 5, 1949. In it, Acheson pointed out that the Nationalist government’s collapse was due to internal decay, lack of popular support, and military ineptitude, not the inadequacy of American aid, writing: 'The reasons for the failures of the Chinese National Government […] do not stem from any inadequacy of American aid […] The fact was that the decay which our observers had detected […] had fatally sapped the powers of resistance of the Kuomintang.' Indeed. The United States had provided nearly $2 billion in grants and credits to the Nationalist government post-V-J Day, and this his aid was aimed at stabilizing China and curbing the spread of communism; however, the Nationalist forces were plagued by corruption and a lack of will to fight, resulting in large quantities of U.S.-supplied military equipment falling into Communist hands. In the face of this early failure of what would become standard operating procedure, propping up an unpopular, corrupt, inefficient government that ultimately collapses, Acheson argued against American military intervention, which would have required commanding Nationalist armies and possibly deploying U.S. troops, stating: 'A realistic appraisal of conditions in China [...] leads to the conclusion that the only alternative open to the United States was full-scale intervention […] Such intervention […] would have been condemned by the American people.' Here it is important to note that Acheson’s objection was not based on a geopolitical calculus but a domestic one: more on this familiar theme in a moment. However, given the constraints in play Acheson saw another possibility: Mao Zedong as an Asian Tito. That is, similar to Josip Broz Tito of Yugoslavia, who had shunned Stalin and so already fractured the supposedly monolithic communist bloc, Acheson believed that Mao might pursue a path of relative independence from the Soviet Union. Hence, Dean’s memo from December 30, 1949: 'The United States should exploit, through appropriate political, psychological, and economic means, any rifts between the Chinese Communists and the USSR and between the Stalinists and other elements in China.' This idea, too, was stymied by domestic political considerations: the rise of the New Right in the United States, fueled in part by Senator Joseph McCarthy’s domestic anti-communist campaign, reshaped the political climate and transformed the American right. As Murray Rothbard observed, McCarthyism served as a pivotal catalyst for shifting the right-wing mass base from its earlier isolationist and quasi-libertarian stance to one centered on anti-communism and international intervention. While McCarthy initially targeted government officials and bureaucrats, this movement’s broader impact laid the groundwork for an increasingly hawkish foreign policy agenda. The New Right forces behind McCarthy soon turned their focus from domestic anti-communism to promoting military interventions abroad, particularly in Asia. This shift stymied any potential diplomatic openings with the People’s Republic of China (PRC) and entrenched a confrontational approach. It also set the stage for U.S. commitments in Korea, Vietnam, and continued support for the Nationalists in the Chinese Civil War, as domestic red-baiting transformed into international red-baiting. The political environment made even pragmatic approaches, such as Acheson’s notion of exploiting rifts between Mao and Stalin, politically untenable. The New Right’s influence thus locked U.S. foreign policy into a rigidly anti-communist framework, with disastrous consequences both domestically and abroad. Indeed, fearing further recriminations for additional communist gains in east Asia, Truman plunged the country into Korea, just as, fearing the prospect of further gains, Truman and then Eisenhower would commit and then recommit to safeguarding the independence of the Republic of China based on Formosa (Taiwan). The result of all this was disastrous: apart from the human toll, which is in the unknown millions, the Korean War led to military ties to states across east Asia, including Japan, South Korea, and the Philippines – and despite the Cold War’s end it is important to note that these treaties are still active and commit the United States to fighting conflicts on their behalf! So, too, in Taiwan, where red baiting combined with intense pressure from the China lobby to prevent the conclusion of the Chinese Civil War with a mutual defense treaty – and despite the treaty having been ripped up when relations between Washington and Beijing were normalized in 1979, a de facto commitment to fight a war with mainland China on the Taipei’s behalf if it comes down to it is still a clear and present danger to Americans and America! In the words of the late, great Justin Raimondo: 'All foreign policy is domestic policy,' and this was never truer than of the events surrounding the 'loss of China' and the plunging of the United States into war – I mean, uh, 'police action' – in Korea. The applicable lessons for today are obvious, and perhaps nowhere more obvious than the failure of the Biden administration to reenter the Iran nuclear deal: fearing the political consequences at home, they stuck with Trump’s policy. The same could probably be argued about Trump’s economic war with China or his administration’s decision to rip up important treaties with the Russians. Beyond this, Americans should be constantly reminded that their government has enlisted them to fight a war with China over some rocks and piles of sand in the South and East China Seas whenever anyone in Tokyo or Manila happens to push the line too far with their larger neighbor.

Trump’s Return To Power And The Future Of Climate Action – Analys...	By Krishna Vohra While the world anxiously awaits to learn what Donald Trump’s second term in office might look like, climate experts seem to have accepted that his win is a 'major threat to the planet'. This is unsurprising given that, in his first term, Trump withdrew the United States (US) from the 2015 Paris Climate Accords and has made it a promise to do so again. During his campaign, Trump emphasised the importance of oil and claimed that his first term achieved the best environmental numbers, 'the cleanest air … [and] … the cleanest water.' Trump’s opinions are a stale reprise of the period in history when climate action was considered to be nothing more than an expensive inconvenience that slows down economic growth. His scepticism towards climate change is well-known; Trump has never been reluctant to make his explicit thoughts on social media being a platform for his candid thoughts explicit on social media. While the language around his position has evolved, his position remains unchanged. In September earlier this year, he claimed that the effects of climate change in America are exaggerated and 'not our problem', promising a swift return to fossil fuels. At a recent rally, Trump was asked about how he plans to tackle inflation. He replied that once energy costs are brought down, everything else will naturally follow. In another interview, Trump remarked: 'There’s never been [a] mess like this and it’s all because of what they [the Biden administration] did with energy.' The fix to rising energy costs, for Trump, is restoring the predominance of oil and burning fossil fuels. Chris Wright, Trump’s newly appointed energy secretary has made this solution quite clear: to move away from 'very expensive' green energy and back to old-school high-emission energy. A strong critic of the Democratic Party’s recent decarbonisation policies, one of Wright’s first points of action may be to end the pause on natural gas export permits that were put in place a year ago by President Biden's administration. The energy secretary appointee has previously denied the existence of the climate crisis, reiterating that environmental regulations need to be lifted to decrease costs. Wright also claimed that burning fossil fuels is the answer to rising costs, inflation, and poverty. Repealing the IRA— 'green new scam' The Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) has been a frequent point of discussion during the Trump campaign, but the name is by no means self-explanatory. The IRA was enacted by the Biden administration in 2022, though it has little to do with inflation reduction, at least in the short term. It’s a significant piece of legislation that is more concerned with climate policy, manufacturing, and trade. The act proposes a US$1.2 trillion investment package in clean technology, including EVs, wind turbines, and solar panels. It was regarded as Biden’s most successful action as president, which has proven to be an accelerating factor towards achieving emission reductions while also building a more resilient supply chain for clean energy. Trump has vowed to repeal the IRA, or the 'green new scam', as he refers to it. Repealing the act could cost the US billions and would require approval from the United States Congress. Trump might face resistance from Republican members of Congress, as 80 percent of the act’s manufacturing investments have already flown to Republican districts. For instance, manufacturing plants for solar panels and electric vehicle (EV) components in Georgia and battery factories in South Carolina have received significant funding and generated thousands of clean jobs. Many of Trump’s allies like Elon Musk and his company Tesla have also already benefited from tax credits provided by the IRA. The Biden administration’s infrastructure and clean energy investments by state: Map Deregulating drilling and fracking 'We will drill baby drill, expand all forms of Energy production to grow our economy, and create good-paying jobs,' wrote Trump in a recent statement, naming Doug Burgum as the new head of the White House Council on Energy. Burgum will work alongside Wright in making key energy-related decisions and shaping policies. Trump’s new slogan can be viewed as an explicit promise to further increase US emissions. The President-elect has also made clear his commitment to achieving 'energy dominance', by reinstating oil and gas leases for American corporations that were previously removed by the Biden administration. Some experts believe that Trump’s strategy may not actually lower energy prices as promised; as merely pumping more oil may not decrease energy costs for several reasons. With investment facilitated by the Biden administration’s IRA, many Republican states have been given an 'inconvenient gift,', as one report describes it. It will prove costly and difficult to backtrack on climate finance that has already flown into red states like Georgia and South Carolina that benefited from the IRA. It would also cause thousands of jobs that were created as a result of the new legislation, to essentially disappear in these states. US$250 million was pumped into Republican states; it will not be simple convincing a Republican Congress to repeal it. Some believe that the world will survive another American withdrawal from the 2015 Paris Climate Accords. Contrary to expectations, other countries did not follow suit and pull out from the agreement, and they may show their resilience once again. Trump’s decisions and new policies essentially absolves the US of its responsibilities, like multilateral cooperation and to even report on emissions, which are expected to further increase dramatically after the swearing-in of the 47th President. Furthermore, this also removes any obligation for America to provide billions of dollars in international climate finance, which would have been invaluable in the global climate effort. Whatever the outcome, Trump 2.0 is going to be inherently unpredictable - just as his recent creation of the new governmental entity, the 'Department of Governmental Efficiency' (DOGE). DOGE is a non-governmental task force, created to fire federal employees, reduce government programs, and eliminate federal regulations. This is part of Trump’s 'Save America' initiative and he has appointed Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy to head the department. In a domestic context, Trump’s first term in office showed that progress was made in clean energy initiatives despite his rhetoric because companies and American states continued to proceed with renewables, even Republican states. In California, the private sector kept greening its energy choices in response to consumer demand. Despite Biden’s nominal acceptance of climate change as a serious threat, however, little changed in practice. Biden promised 'no more drilling' in the run-up to the 2020 election. In reality, the Biden administration did not live up to this promise. The US also did not deliver on its commitments to global climate action and finance. The time for a paradigm shift is now For climate-vulnerable countries, inadequate climate finance is hardly surprising. Even with more progressive policies during Joe Biden’s four years, the deficiency of climate finance in the Global South remains severe. Less than 3 percent of all climate finance flows to ‘developing’ countries, already a pitiable figure. Emerging economies should already realise that it is time to stop relying on an insular America. The walkout by climate-vulnerable nations from COP29 in Baku is the culmination of growing frustration with the current paradigm. The rest of the world must move forward and persist with climate action while holding space for the US to rejoin whenever that time may come. Countries in the Indo-Pacific region are the primary drivers of the world’s economic growth, and emerging powers must take the lead. This needs to be achieved with South-led action through bilateral and trilateral cooperation that reimagines the existing notions of multilateral cooperation. This is not to say that the Global South should insulate itself. Quite contrarily, it should prepare for scenarios where America’s absence will be less pronounced. An important component of a more multi-centric world must involve renewed and strengthened leadership within the Indo-Pacific. In light of growing uncertainties with the shifting balance of power, key regional players in the Indo-Pacific—such as India, Japan, and the Republic of Korea, are already taking proactive measures aimed at ensuring a just transition in the region. It is becoming increasingly clear that these nations must collaborate towards common goals without direct American involvement. To begin with, India, Japan, and Korea should scale up efforts to generate renewable energy through sources like solar power, wind turbines, biomass, and hydroelectricity. Moreover, these nations must also lead the way and take a step further in addressing hard-to-abate industries, namely steel, iron, and cement. The use of new alternative fuels like green hydrogen will be indispensable in the transition of these industries to greener pathways. While the outcome of this election may feel like a palpable loss for the planet as a whole, other nations must seize the opportunity to fill in the vacuum that America may leave and provide strong leadership.

What Does Assad’s Downfall Mean For The Millions Of Syrians Displ...	By Anan Tello Although Syria remains in a precarious state just days after the fall of the regime of Bashar Assad, hundreds of displaced Syrians have flocked to border crossings in Lebanon and Turkiye, eager to return to their homeland after more than 13 grueling years of civil war. At daybreak on Monday, scores of people gathered at the Cilvegozu and Oncupinar border gates in southern Turkiye and the Masnaa crossing in Lebanon, confident for the first time in years that they would not face arrest or conscription when they reached the other side. On Sunday, in a historic moment for the Middle East, a coalition of armed opposition groups led by Hay’at Tahrir Al-Sham seized Damascus. Now a refugee himself, Assad fled the country and sought asylum in Russia, marking an inglorious end of his family’s brutal 54-year rule. Syrians displaced across the Middle East, North Africa, Europe, and further afield by the years of fighting and persecution in their home country poured into the streets in celebration, jubilant that the uprising that began in 2011 had finally succeeded in dislodging Assad. Syria remains the world’s largest refugee crisis. Since the outbreak of civil war in 2011 following the regime’s brutal suppression of anti-government protests, the UN says more than 14 million Syrians have been forced to flee their homes. While the majority sought refuge in other parts of Syria, including areas outside the regime’s control, others fled to neighboring countries — primarily Turkiye and Lebanon, but also Jordan, Egypt, and Iraq. Many more risked the perilous Mediterranean crossing to Europe. Some 7.2 million Syrians remain internally displaced, where 70 percent of the population is deemed to require humanitarian assistance and where 90 percent live below the poverty line, according to the UN refugee agency, UNHCR. More than 5 million Syrian refugees live in the five neighboring countries — Turkiye, Lebanon, Jordan, Iraq, and Egypt. Turkiye alone hosts around 3.2 million registered with the UNHCR, while Lebanon hosts at least 830,000. Karam Shaar, a senior fellow at the Newlines Institute for Strategy and Policy, a nonpartisan Washington think tank, believes the first Syrians to return are likely 'the most vulnerable,' such as those in Lebanon and in Turkiye, who have endured poverty and mounting hostility. 'In general, because of the situation in Lebanon and Turkiye being so bad, I think these people would be the most likely to come back,' Shaar told Arab News. 'Many of them would be willing to go back to the rubble of their houses as long as Assad is not there because it just can’t get any worse.' In Lebanon, anti-Syrian sentiment has grown significantly since the country was plunged into a debilitating economic crisis in 2019. There have even been cases of violence against members of the community and their property. In April, Syrians were attacked and publicly humiliated in the streets of Byblos after a senior Lebanese Forces official, Pascal Suleiman, was reportedly killed by a Syrian gang during a botched carjacking. Compounding the plight of Syrians, the recent Israeli assault on Lebanon has displaced many families already struggling to survive, forcing them to live on the streets amid reports they have been denied access to municipal shelters. Even before the outbreak of fighting between Israel and Hezbollah, displaced Syrians were subjected to restrictions on work and access to public services. Some 90 percent of them lived in extreme poverty, according to the UN. Returning to Syria while Assad remained in power was out of the question for many. Before the regime’s downfall on Sunday, Human Rights Watch warned that Syrians fleeing Lebanon risked repression and persecution upon their return, including 'enforced disappearance, torture, and death in detention.' Indeed, the Syrian Network for Human Rights documented at least nine arrests of returnees prior to Oct. 2, most of which were reportedly linked to 'mandatory and reserve' military conscription. In Turkiye, Syrians have frequently been scapegoated by politicians. In July, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan accused opposition parties of fueling xenophobia and racism. His remarks came a day after anti-Syrian riots broke out in the Kayseri province after a Syrian refugee there was alleged to have sexually assaulted a 7-year-old Syrian girl. A similar wave of violence erupted in an Ankara neighborhood in 2021 after a Turkish teenager was stabbed to death by a group of young Syrians. Hundreds of people took to the streets, vandalizing Syrian owned businesses. Erdogan announced on Monday that Turkiye was opening its Yayladagi border gate with Syria to facilitate the safe and voluntary return of refugees, Reuters reported. Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan said his country would support the return of Syrians to contribute to the reconstruction of the conflict-ravaged country. 'Those with families in Syria are eager to at least pay them a visit,' Marwah Morhly, a Turkiye-based media professional, told Arab News. 'Many are making plans to visit their hometowns with their children, who were born in Turkiye and have never been to Syria or met their relatives in person.' However, given the ongoing insecurity and political uncertainty in Syria, and the fact that many Syrians have built lives in Turkiye, the decision to return is not an easy one to make. Morhly herself is hesitant about visiting, despite longing for her hometown of Damascus. 'I can’t take a risk with a young child,' she said, referring to her son. Such a decision would depend on a Syrian-Turkish agreement on the refugee issue, she added. UN High Commissioner for Refugees Filippo Grandi said 'there is a remarkable opportunity' for Syrians 'to begin returning home.' 'But with the situation still uncertain, millions of refugees are carefully assessing how safe it is to do so. Some are eager, while others are hesitant,' he added in a statement on Monday. Urging 'patience and vigilance,' he expressed hope that refugees would be able to 'make informed decisions' based on developments on the ground. Those decisions, he added, would depend on 'whether the parties in Syria prioritize law and order.' He stressed that 'a transition that respects the rights, lives, and aspirations of all Syrians — regardless of ethnicity, religion, or political beliefs — is crucial for people to feel safe.' UNHCR 'will monitor developments, engage with refugee communities, and support states in any organized voluntary returns,' he added, pledging to 'support Syrians wherever they are.' Grandi also highlighted that 'the needs within Syria remain immense,' as more than 13 years of war and economic sanctions had 'shattered infrastructure.' In Europe, home to at least 4.5 million Syrian refugees, several countries — including Austria, France, The Netherlands, Germany, Belgium, Greece, and the UK — announced they had halted Syrian asylum applications just hours after Assad’s fall. Germany, which is home to the continent’s largest Syrian diaspora, was one of the first European countries to respond. Nancy Faeser, Germany’s interior minister, said in a statement on Monday that the current 'volatile situation' in Syria is the reason her country’s migration authority has paused asylum decisions, leaving thousands of Syrian applicants in limbo. Austria has gone a step further, announcing plans to deport Syrian migrants. Interior Minister Gerhard Karner told Austrian media he has 'instructed the ministry to prepare an orderly return and deportation program to Syria. In The Netherlands, the government said it would stop assessing applications for six months. However, many are concerned it may also begin deportations. Discussions about sending refugees back to Syria amid such uncertainty have left many Syrians anxious about their future. This is particularly concerning for those who have built lives and established roots in their host countries. Anti-refugee discourse has become increasingly common since the height of the European refugee crisis in 2015, when around 5.2 million people from conflict zones across Africa, Asia, and the Middle East arrived on European shores. For many governments in Europe, the fall of the Assad regime could offer just the opportunity they were waiting for to show they are addressing public concerns about migration by removing thousands of Syrians. But until Syria’s security situation stabilizes and its political future under its new de facto leadership becomes clearer, forced returns may be premature — or could even break international laws against refoulement should returnees come to harm. Indeed, with the country still divided among rival factions, extremist groups like Daesh still at large, infrastructure in ruins, an economy crippled by sanctions, and uncertainty over the political agenda of the victorious HTS, Syria is by no means guaranteed peace and security.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfGUp7G19bqpMBbxmj5gdmq	2024-12-10T16:37:42-08:00	
The Golden State Unleashes The Anonymous Snoop Dogs – OpEd	In their quest to 'Trump proof' California, Gov. Gavin Newsom and state Attorney General Rob Bonta invoke 'California values.' If people across the country wonder what exactly these values might be, state politicians have provided clues. As they gear up for the holiday season, California retailers stock items they think people will want to buy. California politicians want the state to determine what stores must offer to their customers. Assembly Bill 1084, signed by Newsom in 2021 and effective Jan. 1, 2024, mandates that large retail department stores that sell childcare items or toys must maintain a 'gender-neutral' section for these items or face fines. 'By requiring large retailers to maintain a gender-neutral section,' Bonta’s office explains, 'AB 1084 makes it more difficult for these retailers to engage in gender-based pricing discrimination and reduces the imposition of gender stereotypes on children.' In support of this cause, the attorney general recruits shoppers as informants. 'If you do not see an adequate gender-neutral product section in a large retail department store in California that you believe is covered by this law, you may take pictures, document, and file a complaint with our office at oag.ca.gov/report.' As Californians and people across the country should know, deploying citizens to inform on each other was a value of East Germany, a Stalinist dictatorship. Other similarities may also be apparent. California workers value their independence and many strive to be their own boss. Newsom doesn’t value that effort. In 2019, the governor signed Assembly Bill 5, by San Diego Democrat Lorena Gonzalez, a veritable declaration against workers’ independence and their ability to earn a living. The measure primarily targeted truck owner-operators and ride-share drivers, but in its original form, it was more far-reaching. Assembly Bill 5 targeted all kinds of independent contractors including freelance writers who did not provide more than 35 submissions per publication, per year. Musicians became de-facto employees of the venues where they played, effectively reducing their already meager pay. During the pandemic, a group of 151 prominent economists and political scientists from 40 universities and think tanks, called for the suspension of Assembly Bill 5 to permit independent medical contractors to fill key positions in understaffed hospitals and clinics. Newsom kept the measure in place so he must value what may be the most repressive legislation in California history. A prime mover of the measure was Julie Su, the Biden–Harris administration’s 'acting' labor secretary, and overseer of California’s $30 billion unemployment scandal during the pandemic. Strictly speaking, accountability is not a California value. On the other hand, Golden State politicians always support their pillage of people. California imposes one of the heaviest tax burdens of any state, and Californians are now fleeing in droves. When he was a member of the California Assembly, Rob Bonta promoted Assembly Bill 2088, the California Wealth Tax that would have slapped a 0.4 percent tax on the portion of a taxpayer’s net worth that exceeded $30 million. Assemblyman Bonta also wanted to keep taxing people for 10 years after they left California. The Yale law alum should know the state can’t do that. Government greed is a value for politicians but not for California’s working people. In 1978, when seniors were being taxed out of their homes, voters passed Proposition 13, the People’s Initiative to Limit Property Taxation. Californians also thought it was wrong to exclude people from state colleges on the basis of their race, so they passed the California Civil Rights Initiative, Proposition 209, on the November 1996 ballot. The measure banned racial and ethnic preferences in state education, employment, and contracting. California politicians have defied state law by establishing a vast DEI bureaucracy that serves no educational purpose but does help to bulk up the University of California’s $500 million budget deficit. Safe to say, California’s woke politburo does not value merit and fiscal responsibility. When Gov. Gavin Newsom and Attorney General Rob Bonta tout 'California values,' they mean high taxes, quashing workers’ independence, dictating what stores can sell, and transforming shoppers into informers for the state. Happy holidays everybody. This article was also published in The American Spectator	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfGUp7G19bqpGtTB3uCJS-k	2024-12-10T16:36:20-08:00	
Syria After 13 Years Of US State Terrorism… What Do You Expect? –...	In less than 13 days, a coalition of U.S.-backed jihadist militant groups took over Syria. The offensive, which began on November 27, culminated in Syrian President Bashar al-Assad hastily stepping down and fleeing to Russia. Assad and his wife were confirmed to be in Moscow by December 9. Assad said he made his decision to preserve the peace in Syria. Russia said it was not involved in his decision-making. The gloating by American and European politicians reflects the years of investment by the Western powers for regime change in Syria. An investment that seems to have paid off, finally. It is misplaced to speculate that there may have been some kind of betrayal or 'deal' by Assad and his allies in Russia and Iran to let the country go. Yes, the Syrian army and authorities capitulated in breath-taking short order. But it is callow to conjecture about a more devious move behind the scenes, such as Russia or Iran leaving its Syrian ally to the mercy of insurgents. Syria was simply broken and exhausted by years of Western aggression and attrition. There was little that Russia or Iran could do to salvage an allied country. The final collapse of Syria did not come after a 13-day blitzkrieg. It came after 13 years of non-stop state terrorism by the United States and its European NATO allies. The earlier phase of U.S.-sponsored proxy terrorism (2011 to 2020) was checked by the intervention of Russia, Iran, and Hezbollah. But the West’s proxies weren’t defeated definitively. In retrospect, that may be seen as a fateful strategic blunder. The continuation of the proxy war after 2020 relied on the imposition of crippling economic and trade sanctions on Syria by the U.S. and the European Union. War by other means also involved the American and Turkish military forces illegally occupying Syrian territory in the north, east, and south, which enabled the theft of Syria’s oil and wheat exports. During Trump’s previous presidency, he openly bragged about 'stealing Syria’s oil.' So, from 2011, when the Obama administration targeted Syria for regime change, until the fall of Damascus at the weekend, the nation has endured a 13-year war of attrition. Even after the relative peace obtained due to Russia and Iran’s intervention from around 2020 onwards, Syrians have been starved of food, medicines and fuel. Over half its population suffered displacement from their homes. The Syrian economy was in ruins. Its currency had become worthless, adjusting for inflation by the hour. When the Western-backed insurgents launched their offensive on November 27 from the northern Idlib enclave, there was nothing left of the Syrian state to put up resistance. Aleppo, Hama, Homs and the capital fell like dominoes. The main insurgent faction is Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), led by Mohammed al-Jawlani. HTS is an internationally proscribed terrorist organization that even the U.S. officially designates as an outlawed group. Its leader has a bounty of $10 million on his head offered by the State Department. But in the shell game of U.S. proxy war, HTS and its leader are Washington’s assets. From 2011, the Americans and their NATO partners used Al Qaeda, ISIS, Jabhat al Nusra Front (later HTS) with ratlines of weapons and fighters from Libya, Turkey and all over the world to descend on Syria to inflict horrors. The Western media propagated the charade by cynically referring to the terrorist proxies as 'moderate rebels.' The Pentagon-run military base at Al Tanf in southern Syria is said to be for training 'moderate rebels' when, in reality, it is jihadist extremists who are weaponized. Only last week before the final push on the Syria capital, Damascus, Al-Jawlani, the HTS commander, was given a primetime interview/platform by CNN, the U.S. news channel, to rehabilitate his image as a statesman-like leader instead of being a wanted terrorist. Al-Jawlani says the days when he and his organization were associates of ISIS and Al Qaeda are long gone. And CNN and other Western media do their best to make the claim sound plausible. Ah, such a happy ending! It’s not clear at this early stage if Syria will now be plunged into sectarian bloodletting, reprisals, and murderous mayhem that characterized the earlier phase of U.S.-sponsored proxy war in Syria when Shia, Alawites, and Christians were beheaded for being 'apostates and infidels.' Ominously, the United States and Israel immediately started bombing the country, cynically claiming that they were trying to stabilize the situation. The rapid events in Syria have taken aback the whole world. Who would have thought only two weeks ago that Assad would end up exiled in Moscow? The reaction of the U.S., Israel and other Western leaders is almost disbelief in what they see as their great luck. Russia and Iran seem to have been genuinely blindsided. The NATO proxy war in Ukraine on Russia’s doorstep has no doubt taken a toll on Russian military resources. Iran is preoccupied with securing its own country from Israeli aggression. American President Joe Biden and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu spoke excitedly about the new 'opportunity' in Syria. Both claimed to have had a hand in the triumph of a terrorist insurgency. Netanyahu took credit for his genocidal war on Gaza and Lebanon for weakening Syria’s allies in Hezbollah and Iran. Biden was even more shameless in spelling out how U.S. state terrorism destroyed Syria and paved the way for its takeover by terrorist proxies. He said: 'Our approach has shifted the balance of power in the Middle East through a combination of support for our partners, sanctions, diplomacy [sic], and targeted military force.' In Washington’s double-speak, 'support for partners, sanctions and targeted military force' translates as sponsoring terrorists to traumatize a nation, economic warfare to grind it down, and illegal aggression to force final submission. The destruction of Syria is another vast crime by the U.S.-led imperialist West.

Canada Considers Financing For Polish Nuclear Power Plant	Polskie Elektrownie Jądrowe announced it has received a letter of intent from Export Development Canada, for up to CAD2.02 billion (USD1.45 billion) to potentially support Poland's first nuclear power plant project. The letter of intent with Export Development Canada (EDC) - a Canadian Crown corporation - is in support of the sale of goods and services by Canadian suppliers. EDC support is subject to the successful completion of its detailed due diligence process and credit approval. Westinghouse - jointly owned by Canadian firms Brookfield and Cameco - welcomed the signing of the letter of intent, which it said it helped facilitate. 'Not only does this financing agreement underscore the important role Canada will play in helping Europe secure and diversify its energy future, but it will also help prepare the nation's nuclear supply chain to support the next AP1000 plant in North America,' said Westinghouse Energy Systems President Dan Lipman. 'We appreciate the close cooperation of the EDC in helping Westinghouse make AP1000 projects a reality for its customers while bringing home economic benefits to Canada.' Westinghouse said the announcement demonstrates its 'deep commitment to Canada's economy by securing work for Canadian firms and trade unions supporting Westinghouse's global fleet of advanced reactors'. For each AP1000 unit that is built outside of Canada, Westinghouse says it could generate almost CAD1 billion in gross domestic product through local suppliers. Last month, the US International Development Finance Corporation - the USA's development bank - signed a letter of interest with Polskie Elektrownie Jądrowe (PEJ) to provide more than USD980 million in financing for Poland's first nuclear power plant. A similar declaration, for the equivalent of about PLN70 billion (USD17.3 billion), was made earlier by the US Export-Import Bank. Westinghouse and Bechtel jointly form a consortium that implements the PEJ investment project in Pomerania. 'We are pleased to see strong interest in our investment project from leading players in the global financial market, with whom we are in constant contact. The letter of intent from Export Development Canada is another confirmation of this fact, and at the same time our next step towards implementation of the strategy for obtaining financing for the entire project,' said PEJ Vice President Piotr Piela. PEJ said: 'Cooperation with export credit agencies is an important part of the strategy for securing financing for the nuclear power plant in Pomerania – it involves continuing discussions with, among others, entities from countries with extensive nuclear supply chains, in order to maximise and optimise financing opportunities for this key investment project for Poland.' In November 2022, the then Polish government selected the Westinghouse AP1000 reactor technology for construction at the Lubiatowo-Kopalino site in the Choczewo municipality in Pomerania in northern Poland. An agreement setting a plan for the delivery of the plant was signed in May last year by Westinghouse, Bechtel and PEJ - a special-purpose vehicle 100% owned by Poland's State Treasury. The Ministry of Climate and Environment in July issued a decision-in-principle for PEJ to construct the plant. The aim is for Poland's first AP1000 reactor to enter commercial operation in 2033. Under an engineering services signed in September last year, in cooperation with PEJ, Westinghouse and Bechtel will finalise a site-specific design for a plant featuring three AP1000 reactors. The design/engineering documentation includes the main components of the power plant: the nuclear island, the turbine island and the associated installations and auxiliary equipment, as well as administrative buildings and infrastructure related to the safety of the facility. The contract also involves supporting the investment process and bringing it in line with current legal regulations in cooperation with the National Atomic Energy Agency and the Office of Technical Inspection. In September, the Polish government announced its intention to allocate PLN60 billion to fund the country's first nuclear power plant.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfGUp7G19bqpHu8trs9uD2V	2024-12-10T16:26:16-08:00	
Brazil: Lula’s Brain Functions Not Affected By Bleeding, Doctor S...	By Pedro Peduzzi The brain bleed detected in President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva has not compromised any of his cerebral functions. The medical team, led by Dr. Roberto Kalil, expects President Lula to resume his activities next week. As a precaution, he should remain in intensive care at the Sírio-Libanês Hospital in São Paulo for 48 hours. The procedure undergone by the president includes a small perforation in the skull, between two meningeal blades, followed by the insertion of a drain to remove the accumulated blood, the doctors explained. Dr. Roberto Kalil also pointed out that the holes made in the skull are small and should heal spontaneously, with no need for future intervention. President Lula is lucid and awake, accompanied only by First Lady Janja da Silva. The procedure is known as trepanation. Dr. Kalil reported the patient reacted well to the procedure and is now eating and communicating well. No complications 'The president will have no sequelae and there is no risk of complications, because the bruise was located between the skull bone and the brain. There is no damage to his brain. This procedure aims to prevent the bruise from compressing the brain. The bruise, located between two meningeal layers, has been completely drained. The most important thing is that there was no trauma to his brain,' the doctor said during a press conference at the Sírio-Libanês Hospital. According to the medical team, the president had a flu-like illness in the early hours of the morning, followed by a headache. He was sent to hospital in Brasília. 'Since he fell, we immediately carried out all the tests [CT and MRI scans],' Dr. Kalil said. President Lula was then sent to intensive care at the same hospital in São Paulo.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfGUp7G19bqpMgPXZujybuV	2024-12-10T16:21:50-08:00	
Ralph Nader: The ‘Silent Violence’ Of Corporate Greed And Power –...	For decades consumer groups have been sounding clarion calls for action against the 'silent violence' causing massive casualties that arise from the unbridled power of corporate greed, criminal negligence or indifference. They cite statistical and case studies that the media and lawmakers mostly ignored or relegated to low levels of enforcement. Corporate bosses just have their corporate lawyers and public relations hacks brush away such warnings and pleas. One day stories they knew would not have legs if they just kept quiet or mumbled some general words of regret, promising some vague improvements to their products and services. But year after year, the deadly toll goes up, not down, and the horrors continue. For example, at least 5000 people A WEEK die in hospitals in the U.S. due to 'preventable problems,' concluded a peer-reviewed study by Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine physicians in 2016. This is just one of numerous such studies of hospital-induced infections, overuse of antibiotics, medical malpractice or what is called 'medical error,' prescribing bundles of drugs that backfire, 'accidents,' deskilling and understaffing. There has been no mass mobilization by either government officials or industry executives to address this staggering toll of at least 250,000 fatalities a year! Behind these figures are real people with families, friends and coworkers shocked, incensed or despondent over avoidable losses of life and preventable harms. Some of them undoubtedly knew the specific causes and demanded correction and compensation, to no avail. Avoidable casualties also arise from the sweeping denial of insurance coverage for ill or injured patients by greedy unregulated or underregulated health insurance companies maximizing profits and bonuses for CEOs. Many insurance companies are now using AI to help wear down consumers. About two thousand Americans a week lose their lives because they cannot afford health insurance to cover prompt diagnosis and treatment costs. System-driven patterns of denial of benefits by health insurers also cause deaths and injuries. The companies have algorithms that automatically delay or deny needed procedures without even seeing a patient’s medical records or speaking with the patient’s physician. Insurance policies are full of fine print deductibles, co-pays, waivers and exclusions that drive consumers and their doctors up the wall. Insurance premiums are paid by patients or employers ahead of time with advertised assurances. In the past two months, consumers have been overwhelmed by a blizzard of television ads by giant insurers e.g., Aetna, Cigna, and Humana for their Medicare (dis)Advantage plans aimed at elderly beneficiaries. The ads are loaded with 'freebies' that paint the companies as charities instead of cunning commercial marketers. In reality, denial of benefits is higher for these plans than for traditional Medicare. Moreover, these plans push patients into narrow networks of physicians and hospitals and subject them to dreadful over-use of 'prior authorization.' The latter means some remote company doctor or medical professional decides whether a physician with a patient can be reimbursed for a specific treatment. This results in overwhelming paperwork for the doctors, immense profits for the companies and degraded treatment for patients. An October 31, 2023 NBC investigation titled '‘Deny, deny, deny’: By rejecting claims, Medicare Advantage plans threaten rural hospitals and patients,' by star reporter Gretchen Morgenson exposed another deadly impact of Medicare (dis)Advantage programs on rural hospitals in America. These companies are so entrenched that they have become largely immune to exposés. They have gamed the system to straitjacket both patients and healthcare workers. The healthcare industry gets away with about $360 billion in computerized billing fraud and abuses every year. ( Prosecutions are minimal, and lawmakers are mostly indifferent as they count their campaign cash donations. Did you see any of the major party politicians in this year’s election campaigns even mention the devastating impact of the medical industry’s greed on innocent people or the taxpayers? Just under the surface is a seething whirlpool of resentment, anger, frustration and bitterness about corporate abuses. Such reactions are often most pronounced in poor areas or workplaces, where people are subjected to choking pollution or exposure to carcinogenic toxins leading to cancer, heart disease and other organ ailments. The corporate perpetrators, however, are remote from the impacts of their operations and policies. Their hugely overpaid bosses rule from elaborate suites and enjoy unimaginable luxuries. Very few people know the names, even of the CEOs of Fortune 500 companies like ExxonMobil, Aetna, Humana, Duke Energy, Bank of America, and so on. The lethality, the theft, the domination, and the escape from the rule of law are rendered impersonally by the corporatists who are now investing huge sums to go even more abstract and remote with tyrannical generative AI algorithms. This week, a man, still on the run, made his anger very personal. Around 7:00 AM he singled out, in front of a busy midtown Manhattan hotel, the chief executive of the giant UnitedHealthcare, Brian Thompson, and shot him. The assassin fled on an electric bike. Police collected the bullet casings from his pistol. On these casings were the words, 'deny,' 'delay' and 'depose.' As news of this fatal shooting spread over social media, a torrent of angry or morbid comments flooded the Internet. The New York Times reported a few, to wit: 'I’m an ER nurse and the things I’ve seen dying patients get denied for by insurance makes me physically sick. I just can’t feel sympathy for him because of all of those patients and their families.' 'Thoughts and deductibles to the family,' read one observer underneath a video of a CNN picture. 'Unfortunately, my condolences are out of network.' Tragically, Mr. Thompson, according to a company employee, was one of the few executives who spoke of changing the culture of the company. But corporate culture, marinated to the core with endless cravings for ever-growing easy profits, is very hard to change – especially when it is so easy to extract more and more premium dollars from powerless consumers who lack adequate regulatory protections. And so, the social media explosion included this typical comment on TikTok: 'I pay $1,300 a month for health insurance with an $8,000 deductible. ($23,000 yearly) When I finally reached that deductible, they denied my claims. He was making a million dollars a month.' The New York Times described a 'wrenching outpouring from patients and family members who posted horror stories of insurance claim reimbursement stagnation and denials.' The ugly reality will continue to exponentially pour out with volcanic fury as the media receives more public reactions. One wonders about the reaction if this were to have happened four months before the November election. Could the uproar have transformed the slimy rhythms of the Harris campaign, orchestrated by the Democrats’ corporate-conflicted political consultants who manage the candidate messages and who definitely don’t listen to the warnings and popular proposals by Senator Bernie Sanders?	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfGUp7G19bqpDAvgYX1QWNu	2024-12-10T16:15:23-08:00	
China ‘Made Wrong Bet’ On Assad Regime In Syria – Analysis	By Kitty Wang The collapse of the Assad regime in Syria on Dec. 8 will likely hamper Beijing’s diplomatic ambitions in the Middle East and prompt a reevaluation of its support for Iran and Russia in the region, experts told Radio Free Asia in recent interviews. Back in September 2023, President Xi Jinping rolled out the red carpet for former Syrian leader Bashar al-Assad and his wife Asma, who made a six-day visit to the country amid great fanfare in the ruling Chinese Communist Party’s state media. The Assads were Xi’s guests at the opening ceremony of the 19th Asian Games in Hangzhou, which was hailed by the Global Times newspaper as an opportunity to strengthen trade and economic ties with the isolated regime. China was only the sixth country visited by Assad since the start of the Syrian conflict in 2011, and Beijing saw opportunities for Chinese companies in post-war economic reconstruction as part of Xi’s Belt and Road supply chain and global infrastructure program. China’s top envoy Wang Yi has pledged to play a key role in bringing peace to troubled global 'hotspots,' and has repeatedly sent diplomats to the Middle East in recent years. Beijing has also called for an end to the 'collective punishment' of Palestinian civilians by Israel. Beijing likely reevaluating Chinese diplomats brokered a truce between Fatah, Hamas and other rival Palestinian factions earlier this year, but has yet to succeed in helping to facilitate the emergence of a unity government, despite repeated rounds of diplomatic efforts, Reuters reported. Its support for Assad, however, was largely based on its view of the Syrian resistance as being instigated by the United States and its allies, and its alignment with Iran and Russia, something that Beijing may now be reevaluating, analysts said. 'Beijing wants to expand its influence in the Middle East, and Syria was an important foothold for it to do that,' U.S.-based current affairs commentator Heng He told RFA Mandarin in a recent interview. 'This is at the very least a huge setback for the Chinese Communist Party’s desire to boost its influence ... by winning allies or supporting certain forces in the Middle East,' he said. But as Assad and his family arrive in Moscow, where they will reportedly be granted political asylum, China’s bet doesn’t appear to have paid off, according to Hudson Institute researcher Zineb Riboua. 'I think China is realizing that the costs of its of its alignment with Iran and Russia in the Middle East are high because they really relied on Iran to to expand their influence,' Riboua said. 'It is by being Iran’s closest friend that China was able to broker a deal, a normalization deal, with Saudi Arabia.' 'It is really by being close to Iran that China was able to say to everyone that it can handle the Yemen question. This is why they try to do some mediation and diplomatic missions in Yemen,' she said. 'But it seems that now that Assad fell, that all that everything that Iran has tried to achieve in terms of influence and also in terms of nourishing its proxies across the Middle East is vanishing.' She said she expects Beijing to distance itself from Tehran in the future, and adjust its Middle East strategy to reflect Turkey’s status as 'a real regional power.' China seeks to build ties with anti-Western authoritarian and totalitarian regimes including Iran and the Assad regime in Syria, Riboua said. 'I would say that China made the wrong bet, and it’s going to pay a certain price for it,' she said. Beijing has said it remains open-minded about recognition for a future Syrian government. 'The future and destiny of Syria should be decided by the Syrian people,' foreign ministry spokesperson Mao Ning told journalist on Dec. 9. 'We hope that all parties concerned will find a political solution to restore stability and order as soon as possible.' Social media takes Meanwhile, social media comments about the issue focused on expectations of Israel’s further expansion into Syria and satirical comments about the failure of China’s foreign policy experts to predict the fall of Assad. 'Hehe, the freedom of the Syrian people is over, for the next few decades at least,' commented @qinyuehanguan1900 from Chongqing. 'Israel is far worse than any terrorist.' 'We hereby announce to the world that, from now on, Jerusalem will be our southern capital, Damascus the capital and Tel Aviv our temporary residence,' @pingwaqingsheng from Beijing quoted an imaginary Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu as saying. 'Do you all think this is over?' commented @tianyahuiguke from Beijing. 'It’s only just getting started.' Comments also took aim at Li Shaoxian, dean of the China-Arab States Research Institute at Ningxia University, who said in a Dec. 4 interview with Phoenix TV that it was highly unlikely that anti-government forces would succeed in overthrowing the government. 'How embarrassing!' said one comment on the story. 'I could be an expert like him,' scoffed another. Heng said China’s international relations experts are typically hampered by their need to repeat the ruling Chinese Communist Party’s official line on everything, rather than taking a coldly analytical view of international developments. 'Some experts ... basically go along with the Chinese Communist Party line when commenting, rather than analyzing and judging based on the international situation,' he said, adding that many commentators are wary of being accused of bad-mouthing Beijing’s allies. 'These misjudgments are political, based on their political position,' Heng said. While news coverage of the unfolding situation in Syria was widely available on Chinese social media on Tuesday, not everyone is being allowed to post anything they like about the situation in the Middle East, according to current affairs commentator Ji Feng, who has a background in the pro-democracy movement. 'I [tried to] make a few posts about Assad today on WeChat,' Ji told RFA Mandarin. 'Others can post about it, but I can’t.' He said plenty of people in his circle have opinions about the situation in Syria, which he saw as a displacement of their dissatisfaction with their own government, sentiments that are banned under strict online censorship. 'The Assad issue is definitely an outlet for a lot of people,' he said.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfGUp7G19bqpG6xRNJzdXYn	2024-12-10T16:09:09-08:00	
Child Soldiers’ Numbers Swelling In Eastern DRC	Constance was 13 years old when she left her home in North Kivu province in the east of the Democratic Republic of the Congo to join a militia called the Alliance of Patriots for a Free and Sovereign Congo. Child soldiers are known as kadogos, which means 'little ones' in Swahili. Despite her small stature, she carried rocket-propelled grenades and supported fighters on the battlefront against M23 rebels. 'I went to war,' she told The Guardian from a displacement camp near the provincial capital, Goma. 'It was a nightmare.' Experts say the recruitment of children has surged since the Rwanda-backed M23 rebellion resurfaced in 2022. In the case of Constance, who requested the use of a pseudonym, poverty drove her to this path. But countless other children have been abducted by or coerced into the militias on both sides of the fighting. 'The militias, collectively known as Wazalendo (‘patriots’ in Swahili), are being used because of poor motivation and dysfunction within the ranks of DRC’s army, which has seen dozens of Soldiers and officers prosecuted for deserting the battlefield,' South Africa-based journalist Patricia Huon wrote in The New Humanitarian magazine in August. 'Yet the Wazalendo groups, some of which have previously fought each other, are committing serious human rights abuses and bringing large numbers of child soldiers to the frontlines, thwarting long-running efforts to prevent their recruitment.' Marie Soudnie Rivette, DRC director of the international charity War Child, said it is impossible to estimate how many children are caught up in the fighting, but she believes the actual number is much higher than is reported. 'It’s clearly rising,' she told The Guardian for a November 11 article. 'Children are cannon fodder today.' Most of the 14 children The Guardian interviewed in a displacement camp in Goma had recently escaped armed groups. Most said the only way to leave is to desert, and some said they were shot at as they fled. Onesphore Sematumba, an analyst in the DRC with the Crisis Group, said militias that forcibly enlist minors into their ranks often have hazy ideas about what a child is. 'They determine it by size or the ability to carry heavy weights,' he told The Guardian. A United Nations panel of experts detailed the extent of child recruitment in a July report, stating that 'all armed actors recruited and used children in hostilities on an unprecedented scale.' The experts wrote that the M23 'systematically' abducted children as young as 10 'in rural areas while working in the fields, individually or in large groups, as confirmed by several ex-M23 combatants who were recruited in such circumstances.' M23 also targeted children among other Congolese for recruitment from refugee camps in Rwanda and Uganda. At one M23 training camp, at least 20% of the estimated 1,000 recruits were children. 'Those who did not consent were taken forcefully,' the report stated. 'Recruits who attempted to escape faced execution.' Recruits who were 15 and above were trained for combat, including at some sites in Rwanda, before being deployed to the front lines to fight. They also were subjected to heavy labor, including digging tunnels and trenches. 'The youngest children, usually under 15 years old, did not receive full tactical training but carried out chores and acted as escorts or servants to commanders until they became ‘ripe’ for combat duty,' the report said. A number of sources told the U.N. experts that nearly all of the Wazalendo militias utilize children, and the sight of armed children has been widely reported around Goma, at or near military positions and camps for internally displaced people. 'One of the biggest concerns around the Wazalendo is their massive use of child soldiers, which has set back efforts to prevent their recruitment by many years,' Huon wrote.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfGUp7G19bqpG9_Fm5zcskI	2024-12-10T16:05:53-08:00	
Macron To Head To Warsaw To Brief Tusk, Duda On US-Ukraine Talks	By Théo Bourgery-Gonse (EurActiv) -- French President Emmanuel Macron is expected in Warsaw on Thursday (12 December) to debrief on conversations he has had with US President-elect Donald Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy over the weekend, Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk announced. The visit comes as a set of European leaders, including France, Poland, Germany and Italy, as well as the UK, look to act together as one in the face of a second Trump presidency and ensure unwavering support for Ukraine. Macron, who will be meeting Tusk and Polish President Andrzej Duda, is expected to share insights on the diplomatic exchange he had with Trump and Zelenskyy on the sidelines of the Notre Dame reopening ceremony on Saturday (7 December). Trump has always been a fierce NATO critic, and claimed to be able to end Russia’s invasion of Ukraine 'in 24 hours,' without elaborating on his strategy. The President-elect’s recently-nominated Ukraine-Russia envoy, Keith Kellogg, who was not in Paris, vowed to enter 'tough negotiations' with both parties to agree a ceasefire. Kiyv-Moscow peace negotiations could start as early as this winter, Tusk said on Tuesday (10 December). Both the French president and the Polish prime minister agreed to the trip at the European Political Community summit in Budapest in early November, Gazeta Wyborcza, which first broke the news of Macron’s visit, reports. Macron's last official visit in Poland was in February 2020. Poland is becoming an ever-more powerful European member state, as Weimar Triangle allies France and Germany are embroiled in an unprecedented political crisis and a tense run-in to federal elections, respectively. Poland's defence spending is over 4% of GDP, making it an audible interlocutor to the Trump administration – and both men know each other from the time Tusk was President of the European Council and Trump held office for a first term. Paris also has its eyes set on Warsaw as a key ally in its fight against a EU-Mercosur trade deal, as European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen announced last week a technical deal had been struck. Poland, along with France, said it would not vote to approve the deal as is. The trip risks delaying the nomination of a new French prime minister, after the government collapse over a no-confidence vote. Contacted by Euractiv, the Elysée had not confirmed Macron’s trip by the time of publication.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfGUp7G19bqpA_iMPSw8ApS	2024-12-10T16:03:32-08:00	
US Blacklists North Macedonia Ex-Deputy PM For Bribery, Corruptio...	By Sinisa Jakov Marusic The US State Department on Monday said it was adding Artan Grubi and Enver Behxheti to its blacklist 'for their involvement in significant corruption by accepting bribes to undermine judicial processes tied to the criminal conviction of Saso Mijalkov', the former head of North Macedonia’s secret police. Mijalkov, who faced trial in several big court cases over the past years but is now free, was put on the US blacklist in 2022, also for involvement in significant corruption. Members of Grubi’s immediate family have also been blacklisted, the US State Department said. Grubi, a top official of the main ethnic Albanian opposition party, the Democratic Union for Integration, DUI, has been one of the most prominent politicians in North Macedonia over the past decade. On social media on Tuesday, Grubi said he found out about his blacklisting from the media. 'As someone who dedicated his public life to the protection of Western democratic values, and who always worked hard for the country’s membership of NATO and the EU, this decision concerns me personally,' Grubi wrote. He added that 'transparency and dedication to democratic values will remain a main pillar of all of my actions'. A close associate of the long-standing DUI leader, Ali Ahmeti, and the party’s main mouthpiece, Grubi was First Deputy PM in the previous government led by the Social Democrats from 2020 until elections earlier this year, when the government lost power. During that time, he was also Minister for the Political System and for Relations Between [ethnic] Communities. On Tuesday, the DUI said it would respect the US decision. 'As a party, we remain focused on strategic cooperation with the US and on strengthening democratic values and transparency,' it stated. Links to biggest court case in years In the biggest court case in North Macedonia’s recent history, the Criminal Court in Skopje in February 2021 sentenced Mijalkov to 12 years in prison for 'criminal association', 'illegal wiretapping' and 'destruction of wiretapping equipment'. The case, codenamed 'Target–Fortress', found him guilty of masterminding the illegal wiretapping of thousands of people between 2008 and 2015 under the authoritarian regime of his cousin, former PM Nikola Gruevski, who, after losing power in 2017, fled to Hungary. Gruevski is also on the US blacklist. However, the first-instance verdict was appealed successfully, forcing a retrial. In January 2023, the Judicial Council, the judiciary’s top body, determined that Appeals Court Judge Enver Behxheti, the judge in the 'Target–Fortress' case, had effectively kept the case in a drawer for nine months 'without any justification', rendering it expired. Behxheti was fined with a reduction of his salary. In October, 2023, the Criminal Court in Skopje duly discontinued charges in the illegal wiretapping case, citing the statute of limitations, effectively ending the retrial of Mijalkov and co-defendants. In July 2022, in a separate case, codenamed 'Empire', Mijalkov received a three-year prison sentence and assets worth some 30 million euros were confiscated after admitting guilt and striking a plea deal with the court. He was charged with criminal association and unlawful acquisition and concealment of property. But instead of serving his jail sentence in the main Idrizovo prison near Skopje, he served it at an open prison in the town of Struga, after changing his residential address from Skopje to Ohrid, which is near Struga. In May this year, he was granted early release for good conduct. The number of prominent figures from North Macedonia blacklisted by the US has increased in recent years to include prominent politicians, business people as well judicial officials. In March, the former chief of North Macedonia’s now defuncts Special Prosecution, Katica Janeva, was added to the list.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfGUp7G19bqpI_Q45W_AtSU	2024-12-10T16:00:31-08:00	
Syrian Rebels Who Overthrew Assad Name Interim Government Leader	The Syrian rebels who overthrew longtime iron-fisted ruler Bashar al-Assad on Tuesday appointed a transitional head of government to run the country until March 1. After a cabinet meeting in Damascus of rebel leaders and ousted officials from Assad’s government, Mohammed al-Bashir, a figure little known across most of Syria who previously ran an administration in a small pocket of the northwest controlled by rebels, said he was picked to lead the interim government. 'The meeting was under the headline of transferring the files and institutions to caretake the government,' Bashir said. He stood in front of two flags: the green, black and white flag flown by opponents of Assad throughout the civil war, and a white flag with the Islamic oath of faith in black writing, typically flown in Syria by Sunni Islamist fighters. There was some sense of normalcy returning to the Syrian capital, with a notable decrease in the number of armed people on the streets. Sources close to the rebels said commanders had ordered fighters to withdraw from cities and for police and internal security forces affiliated with the main rebel group, Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, to deploy instead. Banks and shops reopened for the first time since Assad's overthrow on Sunday and his flight to asylum in Russia. Traffic returned to the roads, construction workers were back fixing a roundabout in the Damascus city center and street cleaners swept roadways. The signs of Middle East conflict remained, however. Israel launched airstrikes against Syrian army bases, whose forces had melted away in the face of the lightning rebel advance that ousted Assad over a two-week period. Israel sent forces across the border into a demilitarized zone inside Syria, saying its airstrikes were aimed at keeping weapons from falling into hostile hands. It denied reports that its forces had advanced beyond the buffer zone into the countryside southwest of Damascus. Abu Mohammed al-Golani, the Islamist leader who headed the offensive that forced Assad out, vowed to pursue former senior government officials responsible for torture and war crimes. 'Rewards will be offered to those who will provide information about senior army and security officers involved in war crimes,' Golani said in a statement. The Hayat Tahrir al-Sham he leads is rooted in Syria's al-Qaida branch and is designated by many Western governments as a terrorist organization, though it has sought to moderate its rhetoric. Geir Pedersen, the United Nations envoy for Syria, said in Geneva that the groups that forced Assad to flee must transform their 'good messages' into actions on the ground. 'They have been sending messages of unity, of inclusiveness,' Pedersen said, adding that in Aleppo and Hama, 'we have also seen ... reassuring things on the ground.' But 'what we need not to see is of course that the good statements and what we are seeing on the ground at the beginning, that this is not followed up in practice in the days and the weeks ahead of us.' U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said in a statement, 'The United States reaffirms its full support for a Syrian-led and Syrian-owned political transition. This transition process should lead to credible, inclusive, and non-sectarian governance that meets international standards of transparency and accountability.' 'The Syrian people will decide the future of Syria,' the top U.S. diplomat said. 'All nations should pledge to support an inclusive and transparent process and refrain from external interference.' A German government statement late Monday said German Chancellor Olaf Scholz and French President Emmanuel Macron welcomed the end of the Assad regime, and said they are 'prepared to work together with the new rulers on the basis of fundamental human rights and the protection of ethnic and religious minorities.' Scholz and Macron emphasized the importance of maintaining Syria’s sovereignty and territorial integrity, the statement said. The United Nations has expressed concerns about Israel’s deployment of troops across a demilitarized buffer zone in the Golan Heights, which Israel says is necessary to protect its own security. U.N. envoy Pederson said Tuesday that the world body is continuing to see Israeli movements and bombardments into Syrian territory. 'This needs to stop,' Pederson said. Israeli troops were on the Syrian side of the buffer zone Tuesday, about 25 kilometers southwest of Damascus, according to several security sources cited by Reuters and the British-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights. Israel Defense Forces spokesman Avichay Adraee said reports that Israeli forces were approaching Damascus were incorrect. He said Israeli troops were located inside the buffer zone and at defensive points close to the border. Israeli Foreign Minister Gideon Saar said Monday that Israeli forces had struck suspected chemical weapons sites as well as long-range rockets as part of an effort to prevent them from ending up in the possession of hostile actors. Saudi Arabia condemned Israel’s actions in Syria, saying in a statement Tuesday that they violate international law and 'sabotage Syria’s chances of restoring its security, stability and territorial integrity.'	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfGUp7G19bqpKDlCik7Jqnc	2024-12-10T15:56:40-08:00	
Starmer Must View Saudi Ties As Personal, Not Just Business – OpE...	By Chris Doyle British Prime Minister Keir Starmer’s visit to Saudi Arabia should herald a step forward in the trading and business relationship between the two countries. Even historic relationships need renewal and updating. Fresh commercial ties will be welcomed by both governments, which will no doubt look to build on them. Bilateral trade has reached record levels, topping £17.3 billion ($22 billion). The UK’s Labour government has a tough economic horizon. Even though the British economy is still strong, the sixth-largest in the world, like others it is struggling. Yet, even post-Brexit, it has much going for it and the country remains attractive for foreign direct investment. But Starmer and Rachel Reeves, his chancellor of the exchequer — what we in Britain call our finance minister — have staked their political futures on growth because, given the tight finances, growing the economy will be the only way the government will be able to escape the tight constraints it has imposed on itself. It is why the UK is keen to close a free trade agreement with the Gulf Cooperation Council. Boosting economic ties with the Arab world’s largest economy will be appealing. The two governments have agreed a target of boosting bilateral trade to £30 billion by 2030, a significant but achievable challenge. This is why Starmer, who was elected in July, made this visit so early in his tenure. His government needs some positive outcomes. It has not found its first five months in power easy. The UK is continuing a year-long drive to boost trade that started in the spring, with a special focus on the sectors essential to Saudi Arabia’s Vision 2030. One aspect is the British attempt to engage Saudi business in artificial intelligence. For example, Northumbria University and King Fahd University of Petroleum and Minerals in Saudi Arabia are working together on how to deploy AI to help make the construction industry greener. Both countries need to reduce the impact of this sector on the environment. Saudi Arabia’s direct investment in the UK since 2017 stands at about $21 billion. Already, the Kingdom’s investments in the northeast of England have been heralded as a major boost to the economy in an area long seen as deprived. This was announced close to the end of the last British government during the two-day UK-Saudi summit in May. The £3 billion Saudi Arabian investment should create about 2,000 jobs. This is centered on Newcastle, a city whose football club is now owned by the Public Investment Fund. The city is being billed as the 'the gateway to Saudi.' There are also Saudi Arabian investments in chemical plants in the northeast. Other major Saudi investments in the UK include a 40 percent stake in the famous central London department store Selfridges. The UK has some strong, secure brands that states like Saudi Arabia like to invest in. Starmer will be hoping to encourage further Saudi investment in both the renewable and nuclear energy sectors in the UK. But the UK is also the second-largest foreign investor in Saudi Arabia. It has £16 billion in share investment. Some 52 UK companies have set up regional headquarters in Riyadh alone. Many companies will be attracted by a host of sectors in Saudi Arabia, not least energy, the environment and tourism. Could this relationship flourish? Yes, but, as with any relationship, it needs nurturing and requires genuine input. Mutual respect is vital. Starmer will have to listen to his hosts’ concerns as well as their ambitions. He would do well to explore the changes in Saudi Arabia and consider that it is no longer a case of UK-Saudi relations being restricted to oil and defense interests, with a much wider array of opportunities. He should look at how women have become a greater part of the workforce, how the country is opening up and how tourism and cultural projects have boomed. In the education sector, five British independent schools have established branches in Saudi Arabia. The University of Strathclyde is set to become the first British higher education institution to have a presence in the Kingdom. Yet perhaps one of the most telling features is the fact that there are more than 14,000 Saudi students studying at UK universities. If Starmer truly wishes to boost the trading part of the UK-Saudi relationship, then he and his colleagues have to establish closer personal ties. It is something that British businesspeople over the years have had to learn: that long-term ties built on personal dynamics make progress. The prime minister will have to cast aside the domestic carping that he has been traveling too much since taking office. This matters if he wishes to promote UK business interests. Starmer has not had great exposure to the Arab world, so any visit like this will be a huge learning curve. British politicians and others can come across as distant in contrast to their Arab counterparts. If they are to flourish in this market, Starmer and his team must see things through a long-term lens and as a relationship that is personal, not just commercial.

US Loans Ukraine $20 Billion Before Biden’s Departure	(RFE/RL) -- The United States on December 10 said it has loaned Ukraine $20 billion backed by the interest earned on frozen Russian assets, part of a $50 billion G7 support package agreed to this summer. The Biden administration had promised to distribute the loan before the end of the year amid concern over whether President-elect Donald Trump would continue U.S. support for Ukraine. Trump, who enters office on January 20, has repeatedly criticized the amount of U.S. aid to Ukraine but also said he would support a lend-lease program. Ukraine is heavily dependent on U.S. and European military and financial aid as it seeks to stop Russia's invasion, now in its third year. The $61 billion U.S. aid package for Ukraine passed in April -- the fifth since the war started in February 2022 -- but will likely run out by early next year. That means the $50 billion G7 loan is crucial to ensuring Ukraine has enough funds and weapons to defend itself through the first part of 2025 should Trump halt further support. 'These funds -- paid for by the windfall proceeds earned from Russia's own immobilized assets -- will provide Ukraine a critical infusion of support as it defends its country against an unprovoked war of aggression,' U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said in a December 10 statement. The G7's loans 'will help ensure Ukraine has the resources it needs to sustain emergency services, hospitals, and other foundations of its brave resistance,' Yellen said, adding that Washington's support would help Kyiv 'defend its sovereignty and achieve a just peace.' The loan announcement follows many months of talks between the United States and its allies -- including the European Union -- about the best way to use frozen Russian assets, worth hundreds of billions of dollars, to help Ukraine without breaking international law. The treasury said Washington had transferred $20 billion to a World Bank fund, which will make the money available to Ukraine.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfGUp7G19bqpFhdwK0ORpRD	2024-12-10T15:47:36-08:00	
The Fall Of Bashar Al-Assad In Syria And Implications For Interna...	The fall of Bashar al-Assad, Syria’s authoritarian leader since 2000, would represent a pivotal moment for both the Middle East and international security. As a centre of geopolitical rivalry, ousting Assad could trigger widespread instability, intensify terrorism, and challenge the international community's ability to manage post-conflict governance and reconstruction. The intricacies of Syria’s sectarian landscape, compounded by conflicting foreign interests, highlight the significance of such a transition. This essay argues that while Assad’s removal could end decades of oppressive rule, it is likely to result in severe regional fragmentation, increased global insecurity, and widespread humanitarian and economic challenges that will require robust international cooperation to mitigate cascading consequences. Assad's fall could create a power vacuum that destabilises the already fragile Middle East. Without his central authority, Syria risks splitting along sectarian lines, with Sunni opposition groups, Kurdish factions, and Alawite loyalists competing for control. Historical precedents in Libya and Iraq show that such power vacuums often lead to prolonged chaos rather than stability. In this scenario, regional actors like Iran, Turkey, and Saudi Arabia may seek to expand their influence through proxies. Iran's loss of a key ally in Assad would likely provoke more aggressive efforts to maintain its presence in the region, further escalating tensions with Israel and the Gulf states. Similarly, Turkey, concerned about Kurdish autonomy, might increase military actions in northern Syria, heightening conflict dynamics and straining relations with NATO allies.The security ramifications of Assad’s fall extend well beyond Syria’s borders. Extremist groups like ISIS, although weakened in recent years, could take advantage of the ensuing instability to regain influence. Uncontrolled territories in post-Assad Syria would likely become breeding grounds for jihadist networks, allowing them to regroup, coordinate, and plan transnational attacks. Furthermore, the dispersal of foreign fighters who once operated in Syria poses a significant threat to global security, as they may return to their home countries with enhanced combat experience and radicalised beliefs. The international community's past failures to effectively address similar risks, such as after the collapse of ISIS's territorial caliphate, highlight the challenges of combating terrorism in post-conflict environments. The humanitarian impact of Assad’s departure would be immense. Syria’s civil war has already displaced over 14 million people, and millions more may flee in the wake of renewed violence. This refugee crisis would strain neighbouring countries like Lebanon, Jordan, and Turkey while reigniting political tensions in Europe over immigration. Internally, the lack of cohesive governance would impede the delivery of humanitarian aid and essential services, worsening the plight of civilians in conflict zones. Syria’s deteriorating infrastructure, combined with ongoing international sanctions, would further complicate efforts to rebuild the country and stabilize its economy.Geopolitically, the fall of Assad would alter the roles of global powers in the Middle East. For Russia, Syria has been central to its regional strategy, with Assad’s government providing Moscow access to naval and air bases. His removal would diminish Russia’s influence, forcing a recalibration of its foreign policy and risking confrontations with the United States over Syria's future. Meanwhile, China, although less militarily involved, might see an opportunity to exert influence through post-conflict reconstruction initiatives, aligning with its broader Belt and Road Initiative goals. The United States, having supported opposition factions but avoided full-scale intervention, would face pressure to spearhead stabilization efforts, necessitating a balance between counterterrorism priorities and limiting Iranian and Russian influence in the region.The economic repercussions of Assad’s fall would resonate globally. Syria’s destabilization could disrupt trade routes and energy supplies in the region, potentially driving up oil prices and impacting global markets. Reconstructing Syria—estimated to cost over $250 billion—would demand significant international investment; however, the absence of a credible and unified governing body would likely deter potential donors. The burden of reconstruction would probably fall disproportionately on Western countries and international organizations, leading to contentious debates over resource allocation and burden-sharing. On a normative level, Assad’s ousting would reignite discussions surrounding sovereignty, intervention, and justice. The international community's failure to prevent atrocities in Syria, including chemical weapon attacks, has eroded trust in global institutions such as the United Nations. Post-Assad Syria would represent a critical test for international law, as calls for accountability over war crimes and human rights abuses grow louder. However, the pursuit of justice—while maintaining stability—poses a dilemma, as prioritizing one can undermine the other. The lessons learned—or overlooked—in Syria will shape future interventions in similar conflicts.To effectively tackle these multifaceted challenges, the international community must adopt a coordinated, forward-looking approach. This includes establishing an inclusive transitional government, prioritizing humanitarian aid, and integrating counterterrorism strategies into long-term reconstruction plans. A comprehensive framework backed by major powers and regional stakeholders is essential to prevent Syria from descending into a failed state. Efforts to rebuild Syria’s institutions must strike a balance between accountability for past atrocities and pragmatic measures to ensure stability and reconciliation. In conclusion, the fall of Bashar al-Assad would represent a turning point for Syria and the broader Middle East, offering both opportunities and threats. While removing a repressive regime may inspire hope for a more democratic future, the immediate aftermath would likely be marked by instability, humanitarian crises, and increased global security risks. Successfully managing this transition requires unprecedented international cooperation, balancing geopolitical interests with the urgent need to alleviate human suffering. As the world reflects on the lessons of Syria, the question remains whether it can unite to address one of the most complex crises of the twenty-first century.

China Compels Myanmar Rebel Groups To Negotiate With Junta – OpEd	China has forced two powerful armed rebel groups in north Myanmar to start negotiations with the Burmese military junta and call off the 1027 offensive they started October last year. Experts say this might well be the most decisive Chinese intervention to stop a conflict in its neighborhood and might well set the tenor for a more proactive future policy on such issues. The Myanmar National Democratic Alliance Army (MNDDA), which represents ethnic Kokangs, recently agreed to engage in talks with the State Administrative Council (SAC) under Chinese mediation. This is the second Three Brotherhood Alliance member to offer to negotiate to the junta after the Ta'ang National Liberation Army made a similar move last week. The MNDAA, the TNLA and the Arakan Army are part of the three-group Brotherhood Alliance which started the 1027 offensive in October last year. But the Arakan Army which has liberated much of the coastal province of Rakhine (formerly Arakans) has refused to stop fighting and this week captured a key border outpost in Maungdaw district bordering Bangladesh. That may worry China because the deep-sea port of Kyaukphyu it funded on the Rakhine coast may come under attack. Kyaukphyu sits at one end of the China-Myanmar Economic Corridor that connect its southwestern province of Yunnan with the Rakhine province on the Bay of Bengal . Other ethnic rebel groups like the powerful Kachin Independence Army have also continued their armed offensive against the junta alongwith by majority Bamar armed groups like People's Defense Forces owing allegiance to the National Unity Government (NUG). The Burmese army has suffered huge loss of territory to the rebels. The Kachin state borders on China and is hub of the burgeoning rare earth's mining hub of Pang War, which is now in the hands of the KIA. The devout Christians that the Kachins are, their rebel group has been uncomfortable with China's expanding economic and strategic footprint in Myanmar. Fifteen years ago, the KIA and other Kachin organisations forced the Myanmar military junta to stop work on the 6000MW Myitsone hydroelectric project on the upstream of Irrawaddy River in the Kachin state. The huge 6 billion US dollar project, the Kachin feared, would submerge huge swathes of fertile lands and the electricity generated would be totally exported to China without any benefit for the local economy. MNDAA, TNLA Announce Ceasefire 'We will cease fire immediately and will not actively attack the Myanmar army from today onwards,' the MNDAA said in a statement last week. It also promised to 'firmly safeguard Myanmar's sovereignty and territorial integrity as a unified country and will not split the country or seek independence'. 'Under the mediation of China, we are willing to engage in peace talks with the Myanmar army on issues such as Lashio,' the MNDAA statement said, referring to the town in northern Shan State it seized in August along with the military's North Eastern Command. Reports from Lashio say that Myanmar national flags were hoisted along with MNDAA flags in several places in the city. The MNDAA also said it's 'willing to send a high-level delegation' to hold talks with the regime aimed at 'resolving conflicts and differences through political means'. However, the group also called on the regime to stop its 'aerial attacks and ground offensives across the country', and claimed that it's preserving its right to self-defense. The MNDAA decision to start negotiations comes amid reports that Chinese intelligence had placed one of its top commander under house arrest in Yunnan capital Kunming to pressure his troops to withdraw from Lashio. MNDAA's Commander Detained MNDAA's top commander Peng Daxun (aka Peng Daren) has been in China since his meeting with Chinese special envoy to Myanmar Deng Xijun in Yunnan Province's Kunming city in late October. The Chinese said he was undergoing medical treatment but a senior member of the Federal Political Negotiation and Consultative Committee (FPNCC) claimed that Peng Daxun had not been allowed to return to Myanmar because he had resisted Chinese pressure to withdraw his fighters from Lashio. The FPNCC is an alliance of seven ethnic armed groups including the MNDAA. 'I can confirm that he has been detained, but I can't provide details. We're facing challenges and pressures,' the FPNCC member said last month, insisting on anonymity. Other sources in the resistance say China was alarmed when the National Unity Government ( NUG), which claims to be the 'real government' of Myanmar, offered to make Peng Daxun its vice-president in an attempt to integrate the ethnic armed groups including a broader national coalition against the junta. China sees the NUG as pro-western and inimical to its extensive interests in Myanmar. Junta's Lashio Loss Rattled China The seizure of Lashio marked the loss of a capital city and a regional command headquarters by the Burmese military to anti-regime forces, which dented the junta's image and raised serious questions over its ability to defeat the rebel offensive 1027. It emboldened the anti-junta resistance forces to encircle Myanmar's second biggest city Mandalay where the army's Central Command is headquartered. China was rattled by the fall of Lashio and the encirclement of Mandalay because it put at grave risk most of its mega projects on the China-Myanmar Economic Corridor ( CMEC) funded under President Xi Jinping's ambitious Belt & Road Initiative ( BRI). That included the oil-gas pipeline and the railroad connecting Yunnan with the China-funded deep seaport of Kyaukphyu on the Rakhine coast in the Bay of Bengal, where rebels of the Arakan Army has notched major success in recent months. Mandalay is not only the hub of the lucrative Burmese gems and precious stones that is largely controlled by Chinese traders but also sits on the Kunming-Kyaukphyu oil-gas pipeline. Two years ago, the PDF rebels had set off explosions on an offtake station of the pipeline in Natogyi township of Mandalay and caused considerable damage. China's Multi-Pronged Myanmar Strategy China has for long played all sides in Myanmar, cultivating both the military junta and the ethnic armed groups active near the its border with Myanma , including the MNDAA. Realising the threat to its economic and strategic interests, Beijing lost no time in decisively intervening in the Myanmar conflict. It not only pressurised the MNDAA and the TNLA to withdraw from Lashio but also forced the United Wa State Army (UWSA) to cut off the supply of food, fuel, medicines and other resources to the two ethnic armies, driving a wedge between it and the other two groups. The UWSA is Myanmar's most powerful ethnic rebel army with nearly 30000 fighters heavily armed by the Chinese and its coffers bolstered by the synthetic drug trade. The Wa tribe formed the bulk of the combat elements of the once-powerful but now-defunct Burmese Communist Party before their leaders broke away to form the UWSA, which has been in effective control of the Wa Autonomous Region in the northern Shan State. The junta has practised live-and-let-live with UWSA, which has been supplied. Beijing Hosts Junta Supremo Following the fall of Lashio, the Chinese not only hosted junta supremo Senior General Min Aung Hlaing in Beijing to boost his legitimacy, the first time since the Feb 2021 coup, but also backed his plans to organise nationsl elections in late 2025. According to latest reports, Chinese intelligence is trying to coax another powerful ethnic armed rebel group in the north to announce a ceasefire and stop fighting the Burmese army. Sources in the powerful Kachin Independence Army (KIA) have confirmed the Chinese push for a stop to its offensive which has led to loss of much territory by the junta in the Kachin state. The KIA in late October overran the Pang War township and huge areas around it that is considered the hub of Myanmar's rare earth mining industry which almost wholly supplies China. Despite Chinese pressure, the KIA has so far not only refused to stop its offensive against the Burmese army but it has also shut down the most important border crossing with China, sending its rare earth companies in a tizzy and shares of its companies in a free fall in the country's stock markets. 'While China continues to pay lip service to ASEAN centrality and leadership on the Myanmar issue, it has emerged as the dominant external actor pushing to shape developments to its advantage,' says Myanmar expert Jason Tower in one of his recent publication . 'In many respects,' writes Tower, 'Myanmar is emerging as a test case for more robust Chinese security involvement overseas. Everything is on the table, from deploying Chinese police, to using technology to monitor and surveil activities beyond China's border, to rolling out new approaches for overseas security on Belt and Road Initiative projects, to gaining a strategic advantage in platforms such as ASEAN.' In stark contrast, India has broadly followed a policy of 'wait-and- watch', reposing its hope on the ASEAN to break the deadlock with its Five-Point Consensus in Myanmar. It is now waking up to the need to deal with other non-state actors to address its connectivity and security concerns, but its actions have been limited to covert exploratory contacts.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWewDwp8ulC5cf_IMdCVDzTh	2024-12-10T09:43:34-08:00	
Malaysia: TotalEnergies Completes Acquisition Of Upstream Gas Ass...	TotalEnergies finalized Tuesday the acquisition of the interests of OMV (50%) and Sapura Upstream Assets (50%) in SapuraOMV Upstream (SapuraOMV), an independent gas producer in Malaysia. SapuraOMV’s main assets are its 40% operated interest in block SK408 and 30% operated interest in block SK310, both located offshore Sarawak in Malaysia. In 2024, SapuraOMV’s operated production (100%), supported by the start-up of the Jerun gas field in July, is expected to reach approximately 590 Mcf/d of natural gas, feeding the Bintulu LNG plant operated by Petronas, as well as 10 kb/d of condensates. The assets have production costs (ASC932) below 5 $/boe and an overall emission intensity below 10 kg CO2e/boe. TotalEnergies has been operating in Malaysia since 1985, and is a long-standing partner of the national oil company Petronas. Following the completion of the acquisition of SapuraOMV Upstream, TotalEnergies employs about 300 people in the country, and holds operated interests of 40% in block SK408 and 30% in block SK310, as well as a 40% interest in block SB412. These interests round out its existing portfolio of 34.9% in both blocks SB-2K and SB-N and 85% in block DW2E. Via its affiliate TotalEnergies Marketing Malaysia, TotalEnergies also markets petroleum products. The Company also signed a deal with Petronas and Mitsui in 2023 to develop a CO2 storage project in Southeast Asia and assess several potential sites in the Malay Basin.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWewDwp8ulC5cfgrEGZ28LHm	2024-12-10T09:40:57-08:00	
Nuclear War: How Western Media Preps The World – OpEd	Recent modification by the Russian government of its nuclear doctrine has given rise to a wave of news reports and analysis by western media that appears less concerned about the application of the updated doctrine than to tell the world that anything the Russians may want to do in its militarism, the West can do better. In a 2020 decree, well before its invasion of Ukraine in 2022, Russia had warned that it may use nuclear weapons in case of a nuclear attack by an enemy or conventional attack that threatened the existence of the Russian state. This doctrine - enacted well before the war with Ukraine in 2022 - did not cause concern as it mirrored a similar if unpublicised doctrine of the United States and its western allies. A later version of this decree proposed in September 2024 for a broadening of the threats under which Russia would consider a nuclear strike. It also included Belarus, an ally, under Russia’s nuclear umbrella and the warning that a rival nuclear power supporting a conventional strike on Russia or its ally would also be considered to be attacking it. Since then there has been a worsening of the war situation in Ukraine with President Biden’s approval of the use of US long range missiles to strike targets within Russia. This was responded to by President Putin signing into law the earlier proposed September changes. To remind the West of the new red lines, Putin approved the launching of a potentially nuclear warhead carrying missile into Ukraine. Nicknamed ‘Oreshnik’, the hypersonic missile is capable of carrying six nuclear warheads and reaching its targets in Europe in 15-30 minutes. Western Media Response to Oreshnik Much of the reaction in western media circles, war analysts and think tanks has been not only to pour cold water on Russia's capacity to begin a qualitatively new and more destructive phase of military combat. The Ukrainian newspaper. The Kyiv Independent, argued that Russia is engaged in a psych and propaganda offensive to create a climate of fear and scare Ukrainians and the West into submission ( Quoting The Moscow Times, a pro-west paper, the paper claimed that the propaganda offensive was coordinated between government, military, and intelligence officials, as well as PR experts as a response to the West's decision to permit Ukraine to strike inside Russia with US and ally ATACM missiles (Army Tactical Missile System). Although the US has said that it will not change its nuclear posture despite the lowering of the Russian threshold, western media have begun a counter propaganda offensive aimed at heightening condemnation of the Russian measures. At the same time a more intensive propaganda campaign is now ongoing amongst the wolf warrior forces of the west to impress western public on the ability of the US to successfully conduct a nuclear war. Engaged are also more reputed western media channels intent on increasing their readership by putting up the nuclear war subject in their front page whilst assigning the blame for the start of any nuclear war to the enemies of the West. For the ‘benefit’ of its Asian readership, the latest report by American weekly, Newsweek, which claims a large multicultural audience and ‘fair and independent’ journalism, provides detailed maps of the impact of a US initiated nuclear war in Asia. The report starts off with the following lead statement which is intended to absolve the US from responsibility in any of the wars taking place. 'The U.S. is inadvertently involved in multiple conflicts around the world in backing its allies, while also facing tensions with China over several issues including trade.' According to the report casualties, in an US initiated first nuclear strike, would be of the following magnitude: See: What is especially noteworthy in the report is that it is a follow up to initial modelling of the casualties likely from a Russian nuclear strike against the US and NATO capitals. This appears to give the impression that the magazine is fair in its reportage although the emphasis on the American ‘inadvertent involvement’ in multiple conflicts clearly exposes the paper's real intentions. The impact of such obviously slanted and clearly mischievous journalism is not only to play up the war fantasies of the forces and lobbies of war in the US and NATO. It is also to desensitize and harden the public into acceptance of the lives to be paid for in any nuclear conflict; and to justify this by assigning blame and responsibility to Russia, China and North Korea. Policy of NFU on Nuclear Weapons Most important and crucially missing from the current news reports and analysis on the possibility of a nuclear war taking place is discussion on the policy of first use of nuclear weapons (NFU). For now, China and India are the only two nuclear power countries that have formally committed to a no first use policy. In 1964, following the detonation of its first atomic bomb, China declared that it would never be the first to use nuclear weapons. Today it is the only nuclear-armed nation with an unconditional policy of NFU of nuclear weapons. In contrast the US and NATO, and its member states of France and the United Kingdom, have repeatedly spurned demands from their public to commit to a NFU policy, thus showing a policy intent not only aimed at deterrence but also to warfighting and first strike. Media and other stake players committed to preventing a nuclear conflict would do well to highlight the importance of all nations in subscribing to NFU. This would be a more constructive and worthwhile subject for their front pages than what they are now focusing on to prevent a nuclear holocaust.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWewDwp8ulC5cT9FIVIytyu3	2024-12-10T09:39:50-08:00	
Adversarial Convergence Raises Alarm, Warns Socom General At Reag...	By Army Maj. Wes Shinego U.S. Army Gen. Bryan P. Fenton, commander of U.S. Special Operations Command, highlighted the cooperation among adversarial nations and nonstate actors, and called for decisive action in the face of increasing complex global security threats at the Reagan National Defense Forum in Simi Valley, California on Saturday. Fenton detailed how partnerships between Russia, Iran, North Korea and China are reshaping the international security landscape — specifically with regard to the present conflict in Ukraine. Fenton explained how these alliances provide adversaries with a dangerous synergy. 'This is not just Russia fighting Ukraine,' Fenton said. 'It's Russia, backed by Iranian drones, North Korean personnel and indirect Chinese contributions.' The general cited Iran's transfer of 'material solutions' — like its Shahed 136 drones and Fath 360 ballistic missiles — to Russia as a prime example. The Fath 360 missiles, which can strike targets up to 75 miles away, enhance Russia's ability to sustain its war effort while preserving its long-range arsenal. Fenton's example echoed similar concerns voiced by the Defense Department in recent months. In October, Pentagon Press Secretary Air Force Maj. Gen. Pat Ryder confirmed that Iran has trained Russian personnel to operate its munitions, solidifying the growing military ties between the two nations. 'The concerning aspect of this,' Ryder said, 'is the developing relationship between Russia and Iran. It's reasonable to expect that this missile delivery will not be a one-time event.' He continued, noting that Russia's partnerships with nations like Iran and North Korea often involve exchanges of intelligence and technology, further deepening their strategic alignment. North Korea's increasing role in the conflict adds another dimension to this adversarial convergence. During a Nov. 4 press briefing, Ryder reported that more than 12,000 North Korean troops deployed to Russia's Kursk Oblast, to train in combat tactics alongside Russian forces. These troops replaced Russian personnel depleted by heavy casualties in Ukraine. Fenton expanded on the implications of these alliances, stressing that the convergence of state and nonstate actors represents a fundamental shift in the character of warfare. He noted that Ukraine's innovative use of drones and artificial intelligence to counter these threats represents a 'revolutionary' approach worth emulating. The general urged the department to scale similar technologies, emphasizing the need for affordable and scalable solutions. 'We need tools that impose costs on adversaries without draining our resources,' Fenton said, pointing to Ukraine's production of millions of drones as a model for how smaller systems can effectively challenge larger forces. Fenton also called for stronger collaboration between the military and private industry. He praised Socom's ability to quickly adapt to battlefield needs through partnerships with defense companies but emphasized the need to expand these efforts across the department. 'Our modernization priorities must be clear, and we need to bring industry closer to the problem,' he said. Despite these challenges, the general expressed optimism in America's ability to counter these emerging threats through its own global partnerships. He highlighted multinational military exercises like the Rim of the Pacific Exercise, which integrates allied forces to enhance readiness and interoperability. 'Our allies bring unique capabilities that, combined with ours, create a powerful force multiplier,' he noted. In his closing remarks, Fenton urged policymakers to adopt a whole-of-nation approach to security. He emphasized the importance of innovation, bipartisan support and public understanding of the threats posed by adversarial blocs. 'We're in a decisive decade,' he said. 'The convergence of threats demands a convergence of our own capabilities.'	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWewDwp8ulC5cSCbvh2Vx6BW	2024-12-10T09:37:29-08:00	
Failure To Find All TB Cases Defeats Us In #endTB Efforts – OpEd	If we fail to find all cases of an infectious disease (and put them on care), then it will keep spreading. 'We are not able to find all TB cases as of now. We had an estimated 1.1 million new TB cases in 2023 in Indonesia as per the latest WHO Global TB Report 2024. But the highest we could reach with TB services was around 804,800. So, we still missed a few hundred thousands. If we do not find these missing cases, and put them on treatment, they will remain there as a source of infection to the rest of the community,' rightly said Dr Erlina Burhan, a widely acclaimed TB and lung disease medical expert. Breaking the chain of infection transmission is central to disease prevention and control 'So, while we cure people who we find, it is also critically important to note that those who we miss are still transmitting the disease to others - and going through avoidable suffering because treatment, care and support is free in public sector. So, I am very supportive of the global call to #FindAllTB, #TreatAllTB and #PreventAllTB - so that we can #endTB. If we miss even one of these pillars, we will not be able to achieve TB elimination,' added Dr Burhan. And we have to find, treat and prevent TB in a people-centred, rights-based and gender transformative manner. Dr Erlina Burhan, is a leading lung infection specialist at the Persahabatan Hospital, Jakarta, Indonesia, and Professor of Pulmonology at the University of Indonesia. She is on the Board of Directors of the International Union Against Tuberculosis and Lung Disease (The Union) and is also a member of the WHO TB Guideline Development Board. Dr Burhan was in conversation with CNS at the Union World Lung Health Conference (largest world conference on TB and lung diseases) held recently in Bali. As per the WHO Global TB Report 2024, 30 high TB burden countries accounted for 87% of the global TB burden in 2023. Eight countries accounted for more than two thirds of the worldwide total: India (26%), Indonesia (10%), China (6.8%), the Philippines (6.8%) and Pakistan (6.3%), Nigeria (4.6%), Bangladesh (3.5%) and the Democratic Republic of Congo (3.1%). Failure to prevent TB It is ironical that on one hand governments have promised to end TB by 2030 but on the other hand they are not addressing the risk factors that put people at heightened TB risk. 'We have not fully addressed the poor socio-economic problems of the people that lead to malnutrition. TB is a transmissible disease and unless all infection prevention and control measures are in place it will spread to others,' said Dr Erlina Burhan. As per the WHO Global TB Report 2024, malnutrition, tobacco use, alcohol use, diabetes and HIV continue to be the top five TB risk factors worldwide. Malnutrition is usually the biggest risk TB factor in most high TB burden nations but in Indonesia, tobacco use is the biggest TB risk factor as it caused TB in 147,000 people in 2023. Undernutrition was the close second TB risk factor in Indonesia in 2023 with 84,000 people developing TB disease because of it, followed by diabetes (32,000 people got TB because of it), HIV (23,000 people got TB because of HIV), and alcohol use (16,000 people got TB because of it). What is preventing us from finding the missing cases? 'TB can never be eliminated by merely a medical response. We surely need a robust medical and health component but we also need to pay attention to all other necessary non-medical partners who can help end TB. This is where the problem lies. We have all the latest technology for diagnosis and treatment. Sputum microscopy is already being replaced by molecular testing [globally over half of TB cases are found using an upfront molecular testing]. And we have got all the different treatment regimens- even the new shorter regimens are being rolled out,' said Dr Burhan. 'The tools are there but there is very weak implementation on the ground. Indonesia has more than 2500 WHO recommended rapid molecular diagnostic devices. It also has the point-of-care and decentralised molecular testing machines - Truenat. There is also an incredibly strong political will and commitment, led by the new President. But Indonesia consists of 17,000 islands and many of them are in remote and hard to reach geographical locations. We have to make extra efforts to deploy the tools more efficiently in remote areas of the archipelago- especially the point-of-care tools/devices that are user-friendly and can be deployed in low infrastructure situations,' she added. 'Ideally we should screen everyone through artificial intelligence (AI) supported ultraportable handheld x-ray devices, and diagnose presumptive TB cases with upfront molecular testing,' rightly says Dr Burhan. What should change if we have to end TB? 'We cannot do business as usual anymore. We need to take aggressive transformative actions. National TB programmes will have to do 'business unusual' in order to find all the TB cases, including drug-resistant TB cases, to end TB. Also we have to do something more than just to diagnose and to cure. We have to go back to the basics - do infection control and prevention. And not only talk about TB preventive therapy but also the TB vaccine (which is currently under research). There are now 6 new TB vaccine candidates in Phase 3 clinical studies. Indonesia is one of the countries that is taking part in the study of M72. I am very hopeful that this new vaccine will have a good efficacy and safety profile. If this is achieved hopefully in two years, then we will have to move fast to get approvals from various authorities for its registration, licensing, marketing and use it rapidly for the community. No business as usual procedure,' asserts Dr Burhan. [CNS Editor's note: If shown to be well-tolerated and effective, M72 could potentially become the first vaccine to help prevent pulmonary TB in adolescents and adults, and the first new TB vaccine in over a century]. But having new health technologies is not enough. We have to ensure these are rolled out equitably where they are needed the most. 'We also have to learn from our experiences of the inequitable distribution of the COVID-19 vaccine- and put in place beforehand all measures for the accessibility, affordability, and availability in all countries- especially high TB burden countries,' says Dr Burhan. Also engaging with other stakeholders is lacking. If we can engage with and collaborate with different sectors (as had happened during COVID-19 pandemic where almost whole of society and whole of government approach became a reality)- public and private sector, the community, opinion leaders, influencers, religious leaders- I am sure we can end TB, she said. Science has given us evidence-based tools, which can help prevent TB infection, diagnose TB early on and put those diagnosed with TB on treatment without delay. So early and accurate diagnosis followed by treatment without any delay and its completion is crucial to end TB. But one also has to take a nutritious diet, quit smoking and alcohol, do physical exercise, protect oneself from HIV or diabetes and those with HIV and diabetes need to ensure standard management, and all of us should lead a healthy lifestyle. The Global TB Report 2024 lists undernutrition as the top risk factor for developing TB. A study conducted in India has also proven beyond doubt that giving good nutrition to the community can reduce TB incidence substantially. [CNS Editor's Note: The RATIONS (Reducing Activation of Tuberculosis by Improvement of Nutritional Status) study done in India found that providing nutritional support to TB patients and their household members reduced TB incidence and mortality substantially. It was conducted in a population with high rates of malnutrition in contacts and very severe undernutrition in patients. It was the first study globally to aim for a reduction of TB incidence by improving the nutritional status of those at risk, and it was the largest cohort study of patients with TB who were given nutritional support to improve TB treatment outcomes. TB incidence was reduced by nearly 40-50% in household contacts of TB patients, while in the case of patients with TB, there was 35-50% lower mortality, better weight gain, low rates of loss to follow up and high rates of return to normal work]. Dr Burhan's message for all is that we should not wholly rely on the government- it has its own budgetary constraints. It is time for the community also to help each other. Be kind to your neighbour. In all religions we spare some money to help people in need. We should use this religious activity to help others in need- especially in the form of providing them with good nutrition. As a human being, please be kind to other human beings. Ani Herna Sari, a TB survivor and Chairperson, Rekat Peduli Foundation Indonesia, reiterated Dr Burhan's appeal for diagnosing and treating TB early on. Sharing her personal experience of surviving drug-resistant TB (and again surviving drug-sensitive TB along with her son), in a webinar organised by WHO during the World AMR Awareness Week this year, she said that, 'There is a very clear link between test and treatment. Genetic sequencing enables rapid and comprehensive testing of drug-resistant TB directly from clinical samples. The comprehensive drug resistance profiling provided by sequencing will ensure that affected people get the right treatment. Reaching out to the missing millions is crucial- they are the ones who remain undiagnosed due to diagnostic barriers, and/or get delayed treatment. To find the missing millions we need to innovate. But innovations are useful only when all those in need of them can access them. We need to ensure that the existing rapid molecular diagnostics and drug sensitivity testing are available for all.'	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWewDwp8ulC5ce1y71TFsyma	2024-12-10T09:36:10-08:00	
NATO Allies Join Forces To Enhance Security Of Critical Undersea ...	Military and civilian experts from across NATO met at NATO Headquarters on Tuesday (10 December 2024) to ramp up further cooperation to counter threats to critical undersea infrastructure. They were joined by industry representatives, including telecommunications operators. Participants at the meeting reviewed mechanisms to boost situational awareness, to enhance information sharing and preparedness, and to deter and defend against attacks to undersea infrastructure. 'Leveraging innovation and technology, including through increased sensing and monitoring to detect suspicious activity near critical undersea infrastructure, is a key focus,' said Ambassador Jean-Charles Ellermann-Kingombe, NATO’s Assistant Secretary General for Innovation, Hybrid and Cyber. 'This is not a new problem set for NATO, but it is one that requires even closer cooperation between civilian and military actors in the face of intensifying hostile campaigns, including by Russia.' In May, NATO launched a new Maritime Centre for the Security of Critical Undersea Infrastructure within the Alliance’s Maritime Command in the United Kingdom. With growing threats to subsea infrastructure, NATO created earlier this year a Critical Undersea Network to improve information sharing and coordination for the security of undersea cables and pipelines. The Network brings together stakeholders from Allies’ governments, industries, NATO’s civilian and military headquarters as well as other relevant actors.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWewDwp8ulC5cY83ZgXm-4UF	2024-12-10T09:34:51-08:00	
Peace Plans, Schmese Plans: Key Path To Ukraine Peace Long Ignore...	Politico ran the headline, 'Ukraine Peace Plans Galore.' Ukraine, Russia, and China each have a peace plan. Trump is developing one. The Alliance of Democracies has one. It looks a lot like Ukraine's plan at first glance. There's talk of a Demilitarized Zone between Ukraine and Russia. There's also the suggestion of imposing a frozen conflict. They seem like an open invitation for continued stress between the countries, not real peace. So, what's the ignored key path to peace I'm talking about? The first step along that path involves adopting a strategy of honesty. That requires sharp awareness of a troubling situation. It is that the mainstream Ukraine narrative expressed by most of our politicians is fabricated. Likewise are the stories reported by our media. Instead of debunking all the falsehoods one by one I'll describe the truths that the false narratives ignore. They became apparent to me by closely following what actually happened during and after the revolution. Here's what I saw: When in 2014 the Maidan revolutionaries took over by force, they cancelled Ukraine's democracy. --They illegally chased the democratically elected president out of the country, falsely claiming he was impeached. But on close examination he wasn't. The United States has admitted that. A Ukrainian official also confirmed it to me personally. No impeachment. No resignation, either. --The revolutionaries threw out the democratically promulgated constitution and replaced it with an old one that the legitimate Supreme Court had previously declared unconstitutional. --They began to rule as militant, self-appointed, unelected leaders of a new, non-democratic state. --They showed early intentions of drastically altering what had been successfully a Ukrainian-Russian multilingual state. That actually played out in later overt initiatives to linguistically and culturally cleanse things Russian from the new Ukrainian state. That brought about the oppression of Ukraine's significant Russian minority population. Most areas of Ukraine accepted all that as a fait accompli. Two did not: Crimea and Donbas. (Donbas consists of the areas known as Donetsk and Luhansk.) Both Crimea and Donbas rejected the loss of democracy and also the unelected revolutionary leaders that caused it. Crimea and Donbas each declared their respective independence. In response, the revolutionaries launched a hostile attack. They waged war on what was by then the independent area of Donbas. The intent was apparently to capture it by force. They didn't attack Crimea, however. You see, a treaty that Russia had with Ukraine gave Russia control over its historical naval base at Sevastopol, Crimea. It also allowed for up to 25,000 Russian troops to be stationed there. According to the March 18, 2014 Washington Post, Russia was believed to have had about 15,000 on-base at the time of the revolution. That may have deterred an attack by the revolutionaries. The net effect of the revolution was to create in a very real sense a different country, a different Ukraine. Look at the chain of events I described above. Pre revolution -- democracy. Post revolution -- unelected rule by force. There was a complete break from the earlier government. There was no continuity. Pre revolution -- control over Donbas and Crimea. Post revolution -- no such control. They both had achieved independence. In a de facto sense, pre-revolution Ukraine and post-revolution Ukraine aren't the same country when it comes to statehood. The post-revolution Ukrainian state was given some semblance of democracy in June 2014. That's when it installed its first democratically elected president, Petro Poroshenko. This was about two months after the revolutionaries had already attacked Donbas. Upon taking office Poroshenko continued to attack Donbas as did Volodymyr Zelensky who followed as president. To appreciate the concept of post-revolution Ukraine as a 'different country' think of China in the 1900s. It had a revolution, too. Pre revolution it was the Republic of China. Post revolution it was the communist People's Republic of China. Again, a complete break. Who would argue that they were the same country? This perspective is consistent with a multinational treaty. It is the Montevideo Convention of 1933. It was signed on behalf of the United States by Cordell Hull, President Franklin Roosevelt's secretary of state. In international law this treaty is widely regarded as definitional regarding statehood and country status. Two essential qualifications are government and territory. Pre- and post-revolution Ukraine were discontinuous on both qualifications. Why have the politicians and media gone for the false narrative? The full answer is beyond the scope of this article. But suffice to say, the extended war has been very lucrative and beneficial for many investors/financiers, defense industry companies, and politicians. The impact of this on a potentially successful peace plan is a misalignment of interests. The interests of the war beneficiaries are served by prolonged war and tensions, not by sustainable peace. That's exactly why a sustainable peace agreement must be based on an honest perspective. The so-called peace plans that I've seen in the news all are accommodations of the false narrative. An honest accounting of the etiology of war in Ukraine will serve as a sounder basis. I'm not suggesting that this be used to place blame. That would not be a wise approach. Rick Staggenborg, MD has followed this situation and explains: 'To move toward peace in Ukraine we don't have to agree on who is at fault. Unfortunately too many make that a big issue -- but that's gotten us nowhere. As a psychotherapist with training in family therapy, I know from experience that focusing on who is responsible for a problem almost never leads to a satisfactory solution; indeed it can be counterproductive.' The key principals in negotiating a genuine peace plan must be the presidents of Ukraine, Russia, and the United States. I fail to see how they can bring about sustainable peace if the pretense of the false narrative is not broken, regardless of how entrenched it has become. An approach based on honesty will have a better chance. Here's an example of an honest approach on a related matter: In mapping Ukraine, the National Geographic Society in 2014 chose not to include Crimea as part of it. U.S. News quoted the Society's geographer and director of editorial and research, 'We map de facto, in other words we map the world as it is, not as people would like it to be.' That's honesty on display. In contrast, a spokesperson for Rand McNally said, 'We take our direction from the State Department.' At that time the State Department was headed by politician John Kerry. But fighting the false mainstream narrative will be difficult. There is a lot of dishonest narrative to discard. Many countries have recognized the bogus territorial claims of the revolutionaries as factual. They've accepted the false narrative as being true. They side with the war beneficiaries. Those countries do so in disregard of the actual facts that are at hand. However, in traditional diplomacy the concept of 'recognition' is very powerful. Many judgments are based on that concept. Negotiators will need strength to oppose that. 'Recognition' is a political contrivance, though. It does not necessarily comport with the honest truth. Frankly, recognition sounds to me like a genteel euphemism for mob rule. The negotiators will have a lot of controversial issues to deal with: Russia's sudden 2022 invasion of Ukraine, the disposition of post-Ukraine territories now claimed by Russia, the main water supply for Crimea that the revolutionaries cut off, just to start with. Then there are Russia's security concerns over NATO advancement. History tells that President John F. Kennedy brought the world to the brink of nuclear war in 1962 over a Soviet missile threat far smaller than the NATO threat now perceived by Russia. In due fairness, Russia deserves having NATO threats considered with a comparable level of seriousness. The peace negotiators will need the courage and integrity to resist pressure from the war beneficiaries and their allies, and reject the entrenched false narrative about Ukraine. I hope that an honest view of the real circumstances will prevail if and when the three presidents meet to negotiate peace. That in effect is the 'key path to Ukraine peace that has been long ignored by all.'	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWewDwp8ulC5cR6KlferGs33	2024-12-10T09:32:05-08:00	
Are Young Ukrainians Volunteers Now? – OpEd	The US Department of Defense (DoD) announced (Dec. 7, 2024) a significant new security assistance package an additional $988 million to prevail in its fight against Russian aggression. This package also includes programs to help Ukraine reconstitute its forces and build and sustain combat power along with Ammunition for High Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems (HIMARS), Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS) and Equipment, components, and spare parts to maintain, repair, and overhaul artillery systems, tanks, and armored vehicles. This is the Biden Administration's twenty-second package as part of the surge of aid for Ukraine and may be the last from the Biden Administration. This aid actually aims to counter the incoming Donald Trump administration's plan on Ukraine, which has been taking the opposite position of reducing aid to Kiev. As the Trump administration is to push for an immediate cease-fire after taking office, could be on the horns of a dilemma and accused of being too oblivious to Ukrainian interests as well as letting its guard down against Russia. In other words, instead of calling for peace, US seeks 'Input to Output' results.US politicians don't care how many people die in Ukraine. Ukrainians have eventually turned out to be cannon fodder for the US. According to a Washington Post report on Dec. 7, 2024, a senior US official stated, 'Even with the money, even with the munitions, there have to be people on the front lines to deal with the Russian aggression.' Clearly, meaning Washington has emphasized the need for Ukraine to mobilize more of its population to maintain the status quo on the frontline and deal with the possibility of a prolonged war. The report reveals a harsh truth for the Ukrainian people, especially the youth. The Ukrainian government is worried about the public opposition that lowering the conscription age might generate in Ukraine and what challenges such a decision might pose. Contradictory Signals President Zelensky made the case for a diplomatic settlement to Russia’s 33-month-old war in Ukraine and raised the idea of foreign troops being deployed in his country until it could join the NATO military alliance. The remarks at a joint press conference (Dec. 7, 2024) with German opposition leader Friedrich Merz were the latest to signal Kyiv’s increasing openness to war negotiations, with Donald Trump preparing to return to the White House on Jan 20. The US president-elect Donald Trump, who has said he wants to end the war quickly, called on Sunday for an immediate ceasefire and negotiations to end the 'madness', after he met Zelensky and French President Emmanuel Macron for talks in Paris. 'Ukraine wants this war to end more than anyone else. No doubt, a diplomatic resolution would save more lives. We do seek it,' Zelensky told reporters in Kyiv on Dec. 9, 2024. Are Young Ukrainians Volunteers? An unnamed senior US official said that Ukraine should consider lowering the age of military service from 25 to 18 years, as the country was not mobilising or training enough new soldiers to replace those killed in action. 'The need right now is manpower.' The Russians are in fact making steady progress and Ukrainian are being pushed back on all battlefield fronts including in Kursk. However, the Ukrainian’s counter by stating that 'Right now, with our current mobilisation efforts, we don’t have enough equipment, for example, armoured vehicles, to support all the troops we are calling up.' Analysts and war bloggers have said Russian forces are advancing in Ukraine at the fastest rate since the early days of the invasion, capturing an area half the size of London over the past month. Ukraine is actively recruiting volunteers, including foreign citizens between 18 and 60 years old without criminal records. Applicants must be physically sound and able to enter Ukraine. The Ukraine volunteer unit provides brief training before deploying volunteers alongside Ukrainian soldiers. This just means that young Ukrainian volunteers are not coming forward to join the Ukrainian Armed Forces and the Government is seeking foreign citizens between 18 and 60 years old. What an anomaly! 'Ukraine by now should have lowered the conscription age to 18 on its own to defend the country against the major Russian advances in Ukraine to make up for the losses.' The Truth A Ukrainian serviceman stressed that despite Russians’ advantage in personnel and equipment, they couldn’t make significant progress over a large area. 'We’re facing a huge shortage of personnel, and that’s the biggest challenge for Ukrainian forces right now. If this shortage continues, and the Russian army keeps increasing its numbers, we’ll be facing very tough times ahead. Russia knows about our manpower shortage, which is why they're launching heavy assaults. When they see they outnumber us, they try to push forward.' The initial euphoria of February 2022 of joining the forces to protect their motherland has evaporated, owing to an astronomical number of deaths. Ukraine’s military is now ‘Outgunned and Outnumbered’, struggling with low morale and high rate of desertions. As the battlefield situation deteriorated, an increasing number of troops have started to desert. In just the first four months of 2024, prosecutors launched criminal proceedings against almost 19,000 soldiers who either abandoned their posts or deserted, according to the Ukrainian parliament. This prolonged war nearing three years have near decimated many Ukrainian infantry battalions making the situation grim on the battle fronts. Reinforcements are few and difficult to be created-leaving soldiers exhausted, demoralized to desert. Despite Ukrainian President Zelensky determined to continue fighting the war, young Ukrainians are fiercely opposing conscription and refusing to go to the warfront to get killed.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWewDwp8ulC5cby51QE7HLhO	2024-12-10T09:29:38-08:00	
Journalistic View Of India-Bangladesh Tensions – OpEd	The role of media in shaping public perception is undeniably critical, particularly in fostering understanding between nations. However, when it is used as a tool for disinformation, the consequences can be severe, exacerbating mistrust and undermining diplomatic relations. A case in point is the recent interviews conducted by prominent Indian media outlets with Shafiqul Alam, press secretary to the chief adviser of Bangladesh. These interactions provide a revealing glimpse into how disinformation tactics are employed to construct a biased narrative against Bangladesh, particularly regarding its treatment of minorities. The India Today interview, aired on December 3, exemplifies how narratives are shaped to fit a preconceived agenda. From the outset, Shafiqul was introduced as someone denying 'Hindu hate,' framing the discussion as if this claim were already established fact. Such introductions create a charged atmosphere, placing the interviewee on the defensive and limiting their ability to present a balanced perspective. The opening question further reinforces this bias. Gaurav Sawant, the interviewer, described the situation in Bangladesh as 'grim' for minorities, citing a 'sharp rise' in attacks on Hindus and other groups. However, no evidence was provided to substantiate these claims, presenting them as universal truths rather than allegations needing verification. This tactic sets a premise that is hard to dismantle within the constraints of a live interview. Visual elements are a potent tool in reinforcing disinformation. During Shafiqul's response, India Today displayed images and captions alleging religiously motivated violence, such as the attack on Ramen Roy, a Supreme Court lawyer. The captions misleadingly described Roy as the lawyer for Chinmoy Krishna Das, an ex-ISKCON monk. In reality, Roy’s attack occurred during a protest and was unrelated to religious tensions. The deliberate misrepresentation of events, paired with emotionally charged visuals, amplifies the perception of widespread unrest targeting minorities. By omitting the broader context, such as Roy’s presence at a politically charged protest, these reports manipulate viewer sentiment and paint an inaccurate picture of Bangladesh. Misinformation thrives on selective storytelling. Sawant's claims about Hindu temples being burned and Hindu teachers resigning en masse distort the reality on the ground. While incidents of vandalism have occurred, they are isolated and not indicative of systemic targeting of Hindus. Similarly, resignations among teachers and police officers were linked to political retribution, not religious discrimination. The NDTV interview aired the following day mirrored these tactics. It showcased unrelated footage of violence during earlier protests, misleading viewers to believe they were witnessing recent minority-targeted unrest. Such selective presentation of facts undermines the credibility of the interviewee and perpetuates a distorted narrative. These disinformation campaigns are not random. They align with a broader ideological and political agenda. Branding Bangladesh as a hostile state for minorities serves to bolster India’s self-image as a protector of Hindus globally. This narrative aligns with the Indian government’s domestic policies, which emphasize Hindu nationalism under the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). However, this approach is counterproductive. By fostering mistrust between nations, it undermines regional cooperation and stability. Bangladesh, which has consistently refuted such allegations, finds its international image tarnished by these campaigns. Furthermore, the focus on external narratives diverts attention from pressing domestic issues in India, including rising communal violence and systemic discrimination against minorities. The decline in ethical journalism in India has been widely acknowledged. While credible voices like Karan Thapar and Rajdeep Sardesai continue to uphold journalistic integrity, they are increasingly overshadowed by sensationalism. Sardesai’s recent interview with Karan Thapar for The Wire highlighted his disillusionment with the state of Indian media, describing its transformation into a vehicle for propaganda rather than a platform for truth. Such practices erode public trust in the media and contribute to the polarization of society. When media outlets prioritize sensationalism over accuracy, they not only fail their audience but also harm their nation’s standing on the global stage. Addressing disinformation requires a collective effort. Indian media must prioritize evidence-based reporting and uphold the principles of journalistic integrity. Governments and regulatory bodies should also play a role in combating the spread of false narratives. For Bangladesh and India, maintaining open channels of communication is vital to counter the effects of disinformation. Diplomatic initiatives should focus on fostering mutual understanding and addressing grievances constructively. The manipulation of media narratives to serve political agendas is a disservice to journalism and diplomacy. Indian media’s portrayal of Bangladesh as an intolerant state for minorities is not only inaccurate but also detrimental to bilateral relations. By embracing ethical journalism and fostering truthful narratives, both nations can work towards a future of cooperation and mutual respect.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWewDwp8ulC5cdZq1YHa6Gi2	2024-12-10T09:28:00-08:00	
The Renovated Notre Dame Cathedral: History, Faith, And Diplomacy...	Notre Dame de Paris, located on the Île de la Cité island in the 4th district of Paris, is a medieval Catholic cathedral considered one of the most impressive examples of French Gothic architecture. Dedicated to the Virgin Mary, this structure represents the pinnacle of the Gothic style with its architectural innovations, flying buttresses, massive rose windows, and sculptures adorned with natural elements. It also draws attention with its three great pipe organs and enormous bells. Construction of the cathedral began in 1163 under Archbishop Maurice de Sully, and it was largely completed by 1260, undergoing various modifications in the centuries that followed. However, the great fire of 2019 led to its restoration. Finally, in 2024, Notre Dame reopened its doors, reclaiming its place on the world stage as a center where history, faith, and culture meet. Visitors from Different Faiths and Reservations Notre Dame is not only a fascinating site for Catholics but also for people of different faiths and cultural tourists. However, some non-Catholic Christians may have reservations about entering such religious buildings, either due to concerns about their faith being influenced or fears of questioning their own denomination in the face of the cathedral's grandeur. Nevertheless, these structures should not be viewed solely as places of worship but also as cultural treasures. An example of this perspective is seen in the participation of Jewish-Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and Protestant U.S. President Donald Trump in the cathedral's reopening ceremony, highlighting the cultural and diplomatic significance of Notre Dame. In addition to Trump, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, German President Frank-Walter Steinmeier, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, and Prince William of the United Kingdom also attended the opening. The Importance of Cultural Experiences Notre Dame, one of the essential stops for any visit to Paris, has also been a cultural discovery point for me. While attending an energy fair in Paris, I was struck by the deep admiration I felt when I saw the cathedral still in its restoration phase. Religious structures are not limited to worship; they are places that enrich the human experience culturally and historically. Diplomacy and Reunion The reopening of Notre Dame is not only a success in restoration but also a significant diplomatic event. World leaders gathered at the opening ceremony, finding an opportunity to strengthen ties between countries through art and culture. Such events once again demonstrate how art and history serve as bridges for international dialogue and cooperation. The Rebirth of a Cultural Heritage The renovation and reopening of Notre Dame Cathedral is not only a great achievement for France but also a significant development for global cultural heritage. These structures carry the marks of the past into the present, offering a common ground for people of different faiths and cultures to come together. The renovated Notre Dame continues to offer humanity an unforgettable legacy as a platform of diplomacy intertwined with history and faith. In a place like Büyükada, where people of every faith and denomination live together, it is perfectly natural and beautiful to witness the peaceful coexistence of Armenian Orthodox, Catholic, Jewish, Sunni, and Alevi beliefs.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWewDwp8ulC5cTXUzSm7OO-v	2024-12-10T09:25:45-08:00	
The Machinery Of Occupation: Israel’s Military-Industrial Complex...	Israel’s military-industrial complex is no mere appendage to its statehood—it is the central artery through which its economy, diplomacy, and national identity flow. From its inception in 1948, the state of Israel has fused militarism with statecraft, creating a war economy that wields influence far beyond its Middle Eastern borders. This machinery thrives on the confluence of four interlocking components: a deeply ingrained militaristic ethos, unparalleled U.S. patronage, the weaponization of occupied Palestinian territories, and a commanding role in the global arms trade. Each element sustains Israel’s militarized identity while projecting its impact onto the wider world. Militarism as a National Creed In Israel, militarism transcends the realm of defense to become a defining feature of society. Conscription is not merely a civic duty but a rite of passage, ensuring that nearly every Jewish Israeli has a direct connection to the armed forces. This bond extends well beyond service; it infiltrates academia, industry, and politics, creating a seamless integration of military priorities into civilian life. Universities and defense sectors collaborate in a synergy that blurs the line between innovation and weaponization. Programs like Talpiot and Havatzalot epitomize this fusion, churning out a steady stream of technocrats and entrepreneurs who fuel Israel’s defense startups. These enterprises, lauded as paragons of innovation, mask an uncomfortable truth: they are underpinned by a narrative of existential insecurity that both justifies and perpetuates a militarized society. The result is a populace conditioned to view military supremacy as synonymous with national survival—a self-reinforcing ideology that sustains the cycle of conflict. America’s Strategic Stake Israel’s war economy would be unrecognizable without the robust scaffolding provided by the United States. Since 1949, American military aid to Israel has exceeded $158 billion, a sum that underscores the strategic partnership between the two nations. This relationship is not one of mere benefactor and beneficiary; it is a mutually reinforcing alliance rooted in shared geopolitical goals. Unique among U.S. allies, Israel is permitted to channel a portion of this aid into its domestic arms industry, bolstering its technological edge while entrenching its dependence on American support. Successive U.S. administrations have embraced Israel as a cornerstone of their Middle Eastern strategy, whether countering Soviet influence during the Cold War or shaping the post-9/11 security landscape. This alignment allows Israel a degree of impunity that complicates Washington’s professed commitment to human rights, particularly in its dealings with Palestinians. Occupation as Innovation The Palestinian territories, occupied and heavily surveilled, function as a grim testing ground for Israel’s military-industrial complex. The phrase 'combat-tested' is not just a marketing tool; it is a chilling descriptor of the methods and technologies honed in real-time against Palestinian populations. From drones and surveillance systems to advanced counterinsurgency tactics, Israel’s arsenal carries the mark of its occupation—a fact that amplifies its global appeal. This export of militarized expertise extends far beyond the region. From the streets of Ferguson, Missouri, to the contentious borders of Kashmir, Israeli-developed tools and tactics are deployed in ways that often replicate the oppressive dynamics of their origin. This commodification of conflict creates a feedback loop in which occupation begets innovation, and innovation fuels occupation—a cycle that places profits above the human cost. Arms Trade as Diplomacy Israel’s role in the global arms trade extends its influence into unexpected quarters. Ranking among the world’s top arms exporters, it supplies advanced weaponry to regimes with questionable human rights records, from Myanmar to Azerbaijan. These transactions are not purely economic; they serve as instruments of geopolitical strategy, forging alliances and cementing Israel’s standing in an increasingly militarized international order. This trade is emblematic of a broader phenomenon: the normalization of militarized governance as a global standard. Nations eager to acquire Israeli expertise become unwitting participants in legitimizing its policies, particularly those concerning Palestinians. The arms trade thus operates as both an economic lifeline and a diplomatic lever, perpetuating a cycle in which military dominance is both the means and the end The Cost of Conflict The consequences of this militarized paradigm are profound and far-reaching. For Palestinians, it manifests as a relentless siege that reduces lives to mere metrics in a system driven by profit and control. For Israelis, it comes at the expense of civil society, as the imperatives of war erode democratic principles and entrench a national identity centered on conflict. Nevertheless, the consequences have a wider impact. 'l’s model of securitized governance resonates globally, influencing how states manage dissent, secure borders, and engage with perceived threats. This militarized template risks undermining international norms, replacing diplomacy and cooperation with surveillance and coercion as the default tools of statecraft. A Reckoning on the Horizon Can Israel, a state so deeply entrenched in the mechanics of war, envision a future anchored in peace? The answer lies not in superficial policy adjustments but in a profound reimagining of its ideological and economic underpinnings. Such a pivot demands an acknowledgment of the human and moral costs of its militarized identity—a reckoning with the structures that have normalized conflict as a national necessity. This transformation is not Israel’s challenge alone. The international community bears a collective responsibility to confront its complicity in sustaining this system, whether through arms purchases, diplomatic indulgence, or uncritical alliances. A global reckoning is imperative, one that prioritizes justice over expedience and human dignity over profit. Navigating the Path Forward The road to peace, fraught with obstacles, begins with dismantling the ideological constructs that equate security with militarism. It requires both Israelis and Palestinians to envision a future not defined by walls and checkpoints but by coexistence and mutual recognition. For the international community, it demands a recalibration of priorities, placing human rights and justice above the entrenched interests of the military-industrial complex. Only by addressing these interlocking challenges can the machinery of occupation be disassembled. The stakes are global, and the cost of inaction is clear: a world increasingly defined by securitization, division, and perpetual conflict. The time for change is not merely urgent—it is long overdue.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWewDwp8ulC5cfa6spQ9QuM1	2024-12-10T09:24:13-08:00	
Fall of Dhaka – December 16, 1971: Context, Allegations, And Rebu...	The fall of Dhaka on December 16, 1971, marked a pivotal and tragic moment in the history of South Asia. This event, culminating in the secession of East Pakistan and the birth of Bangladesh, remains one of the most controversial and emotionally charged chapters in the region's history. The discourse surrounding it is mired in myths, distortions, and conflicting narratives from Pakistan, Bangladesh, and India. To understand this event, it is essential to address the major allegations against Pakistan and provide a nuanced rebuttal to establish a clearer picture. The dismemberment of East Pakistan has often been attributed to several factors that allegedly highlighted the marginalization and mistreatment of Bengalis by the then West Pakistan. The scars of the partition of 1947, which witnessed mass displacement and violence, continued to affect India-Pakistan relations. India’s consistent aim to weaken Pakistan is argued to have fueled its support for the Bengali insurgency in East Pakistan, which exacerbated internal tensions within the nascent state. Critics claim that East Pakistan, constituting 55% of Pakistan’s population, should have had Dhaka as the capital. The decision to choose Karachi, and later Islamabad, as the capital was perceived by some as a deliberate exclusion of Bengalis from the nation’s political center. The choice of Urdu as Pakistan’s national language was another flashpoint. Bengalis felt their mother tongue was being disregarded, deepening the rift between the two wings. The allocation of resources, particularly foreign exchange earned from East Pakistan's jute exports, was seen as disproportionately benefiting West Pakistan. These fostered economic grievances among Bengalis. Bengalis were perceived as being systematically excluded from influential positions in civil and military institutions, where West Pakistanis dominated. The failure to hand over the premiership to Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, leader of the Awami League, after its landslide victory in the 1970 elections was the final straw that pushed East Pakistan toward rebellion. While these allegations form the basis of much discourse, a closer examination reveals counterpoints and mitigating factors that challenge the prevailing narratives. The decision to promote Urdu as a national language was driven by the need for a unifying lingua franca for a diverse and newly formed state. Urdu’s widespread use in northern India and West Pakistan made it a logical choice. Similarly, Karachi, with its developed infrastructure, was a more practical choice for the capital than Dhaka at the time. Contrary to claims of exclusion, several prominent politicians from Bengal, such as Khwaja Nazimuddin, Mohammad Ali Bogra, and Hussain Shaheed Suhrawardy, held high offices in Pakistan. In the military, the number of Bengali officers had steadily grown by 1970, with notable figures like MM Alam and Sarfaraz Ahmed Rafiqui emerging as heroes. The claim that three million Bengalis were killed by the Pakistani Army has been challenged as a gross exaggeration. Scholars like Sarmila Bose estimate the death toll to be between 50,000 and 100,000, emphasizing that numbers were politically manipulated. Bose also debunks the notion of widespread support for Mujibur Rahman’s separatist agenda, noting that 40% of the population did not vote for the Awami League. India’s role in training, arming, and sheltering Mukti Bahini insurgents was a significant factor in the conflict. American diplomat Archer Blood documented how Indian territory served as a base for Mukti Bahini operations. India’s active support for the insurgency and its eventual military intervention highlight its geopolitical motivations rather than purely humanitarian concerns. While the Pakistani Army faced accusations of atrocities, the brutalities committed by Mukti Bahini and their targeting of the Bihari community often go unacknowledged. More than 500,000 Biharis were massacred, with their deaths misattributed to Pakistani forces. The plight of stateless Biharis in Bangladesh remains a testament to this overlooked tragedy. India’s use of media to internationalize the conflict and portray Pakistan as a brutal aggressor was strategic. Indira Gandhi skillfully leveraged democratic and humanitarian rhetoric to gain Western support while masking her country’s active aggression. The twisted portrayal of events isolated Pakistan diplomatically. The dismemberment of Pakistan was not solely the result of internal mismanagement but also a calculated effort by India to exploit existing fault lines. RAW’s involvement, as revealed by Indian insiders, underscores the external orchestration of the crisis. Furthermore, the language controversy and political alienation of East Pakistan did not necessarily signify a desire for secession but reflected grievances that could have been addressed through dialogue and reform. The fall of Dhaka offers important lessons for Pakistan. It underscores the importance of addressing regional disparities, promoting inclusivity, and fostering national cohesion. It also highlights the need to counter external propaganda and safeguard national interests. The sacrifices of Pakistani soldiers in 1971, who fought valiantly under dire circumstances, deserve recognition as a testament to their commitment to the nation. While the wounds of 1971 remain deep, understanding the multifaceted causes of the conflict is essential to preventing similar tragedies in the future. The narrative of the fall of Dhaka must be revisited with a balanced perspective to honor the truth and move forward as a resilient nation.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWewDwp8ulC5cSVKazl6QtDd	2024-12-10T09:22:35-08:00	
Human Rights Day: A Call For Global Responsibility And Justice – ...	Human Rights Day, observed annually on December 10, commemorates the adoption of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR) by the United Nations General Assembly in 1948. This milestone document in human history declares the inalienable rights to which all humans are entitled, regardless of race, religion, gender, nationality, or any other status. Despite its profound significance, 76 years later, millions worldwide remain deprived of basic human rights. Among the most glaring examples of such violations is the plight of Kashmiris under Indian illegal occupation, where systematic oppression and abuses continue unabated. The UDHR is a guiding beacon for equality and justice, enshrining fundamental rights such as life and liberty, freedom from slavery and torture, the right to work and education, and freedom of opinion and expression. Available in over 500 languages, it is the most translated document globally, symbolizing its universal relevance and importance. The 2024 Human Rights Day theme, 'Our Rights, Our Future, Right Now,' underscores the urgency of securing these rights for all, as they form the foundation of a just and equitable future. Kashmir, under Indian illegal occupation, presents a stark contrast to the ideals proclaimed in the UDHR. Since 1989, Indian security forces have reportedly committed widespread human rights violations in Indian Illegally Occupied Jammu and Kashmir (IIOJ&K). According to the Kashmir Media Service, these atrocities include the killing of 96,382 individuals, 7,369 custodial deaths, and the arrest of 172,464 civilians. Moreover, the destruction of over 110,521 structures, the widowing of 22,980 women, the orphaning of 107,974 children, and the gang-rape or molestation of 11,265 women illustrate the depth of the suffering endured by Kashmiris. Indian forces have used pellet guns, resulting in injuries to 3,800 individuals, symbolizing a regime of state-sponsored violence. The draconian security laws, including the Jammu and Kashmir Public Safety Act (1978), the Armed Forces Special Powers Act (1990), and the Prevention of Terrorism Act (2002), grant Indian security personnel unchecked powers to detain, torture, or even kill unarmed civilians with impunity. These laws embolden the perpetrators, ensuring that accountability remains a distant dream for the victims of IIOJ&K. The United Nations Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) released reports in 2018 and 2019 documenting grave human rights violations in Kashmir and recommending the establishment of a commission of inquiry. However, these calls have largely gone unheeded, as geopolitical and economic considerations overshadow the pursuit of justice. The systematic suppression of human rights in Kashmir is part of a broader pattern of abuses within India. Religious minorities, including Muslims, Christians, and Dalits, face increasing marginalization and violence. Under the guise of nationalism, discriminatory laws and policies perpetuate an apartheid-like state where equality and justice are elusive. This stark contradiction between India’s democratic ideals and its ground realities highlights its failure to uphold the principles enshrined in the UDHR. India’s actions reflect a troubling trend where economic and strategic interests of global powers, particularly the United States and the European Union, often overshadow their commitment to human rights. The deafening silence in international policymaking circles regarding India’s human rights abuses raises questions about the moral compass of major powers. Human rights, a cornerstone of Western advocacy, seem to falter when confronted with monetary or geopolitical considerations. Human Rights Day serves as a reminder that protecting human dignity is a shared global responsibility. The international community, particularly influential powers like the U.S. and the EU, must prioritize human rights over economic and strategic alliances. Advocacy for the protection of minorities in India and the oppressed Kashmiris in IIOJ&K must move beyond mere rhetoric to tangible actions. Failure to do so risks eroding the credibility of the global human rights framework and emboldening violators. The silence of major powers in the face of gross human rights violations undermines the universality of the UDHR. By turning a blind eye to these atrocities, the world inadvertently sends a message that economic gains and strategic alignments take precedence over human dignity. This contradiction not only weakens the moral authority of these nations but also emboldens regimes to continue their oppressive practices without fear of reprisal. On this Human Rights Day, the world must reflect on the values that bind humanity together and act decisively to uphold them. Advocacy groups, civil society, and individual citizens must amplify their voices to demand accountability for human rights abuses. The plight of Kashmiris and other oppressed communities must not be relegated to the periphery of global discourse. Instead, it should serve as a rallying point for collective action. The UDHR was a visionary document that promised dignity, equality, and justice for all. To honor its legacy, the global community must confront the challenges that hinder its realization. This requires transcending economic interests and geopolitical calculations to prioritize humanity and justice. Human Rights Day is more than a commemoration; it is a call to action for individuals, communities, and nations. As the world marks this significant day, it must confront the stark reality that millions, like the Kashmiris in IIOJ&K, are denied the rights proclaimed in the UDHR. Upholding these rights requires unwavering commitment from all stakeholders. Only by ensuring justice, equality, and freedom for all can we truly honor the spirit of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and secure a future where humanity thrives in dignity and peace.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWewDwp8ulC5cSYmEnCHkSAu	2024-12-10T09:19:14-08:00	
Africa Must Prepare For Trump’s Comeback – Analysis	By Emmaculate A Liaga and Zenge Simakoloyi President Joe Biden’s recent trip to Angola – the first state visit by a United States (US) president in nine years – has highlighted America’s renewed engagement with Africa. But as Donald Trump prepares for his second term in office, questions arise about the future of US-Africa relations, and whether this engagement will continue. Trump’s first term, characterised by an inward-focused ‘America First’ agenda, showed the need for Africa to recalibrate its strategies – particularly in key geopolitical and security engagements. Several critical issues at bilateral, regional and continental levels will be impacted by his second-term policies and the priorities of his inner circle. Trump’s return presents African countries with an opportunity to take a proactive stance in shaping their political and economic relations with the US and developing resilient strategies instead of reacting to shifting US policies. Key bilateral relationships, particularly between the US and South Africa, are expected to shift – stemming from US opposition to South Africa’s International Court of Justice (ICJ) case against Israel over Gaza, and the country’s close ties with China and Russia. Trump’s first term showed the need for Africa to recalibrate its geopolitical and security strategies In particular, South Africa’s neutral position on the Russia-Ukraine war will be a point of tension in a second Trump presidency. The president is also opposed to South Africa’s growing partnership with China, which is amplified by China’s efforts to direct global trade away from the US and BRICS’ attempt at de-dollarisation, a move criticised by Trump. Notable figures in Trump’s camp will also likely affect US-South Africa relations. For example, Senator Marco Rubio, the presumptive Secretary of State and a strong critic of China condemned South Africa’s decision to downgrade Taiwan’s embassy. Trump’s pick for UN Ambassador, Elise Stefanik, was part of a petition condemning South Africa’s ICJ case against Israel, calling it an attempt to ‘demonize’ Israel. Michael Waltz led a push to reviewUS-South Africa ties, a move Biden resisted, but with Waltz as Trump’s pick for National Security Advisor, it could gain momentum. South Africa assumed the G20 chair on 1 December and will host the 2025 Johannesburg summit. The country now faces a dual challenge of maintaining neutrality while addressing growing geopolitical divisions – seeking to build consensus among G20 members and an expanded BRICS group while managing a more isolationist US under Trump’s leadership. This also presents an opportunity for Pretoria to spotlight African priorities on the global stage, especially with the African Union (AU), now a full member of the G20. With the US succeeding South Africa as chair, this transition could pave the way for a possible Cyril Ramaphosa-Trump engagement within the year, offering a critical window for dialogue and potential recalibration of relations. In East Africa, Kenya’s newly elevated status as a major non-North Atlantic Treaty Organization (MN-NATO) ally could offer Nairobi some bargaining chips in the international space. Despite Trump’s America First policy and negative views on NATO, he may temper his approach by focusing on strategic bilateral partnerships with MN-NATO allies, like Kenya. Key bilateral relations in Africa, particularly between the US and South Africa, are expected to shift The new US administration will probably continue its security relations in East Africa and the Horn – largely due to Rubio’s visit to Kenya and Somalia in 2019, part of a bipartisan oversight mission for the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence. Furthermore, because of the declining US security influence in West Africa, resulting from successive coups and the subsequent expulsion of US troops from Niger, maintaining the security partnership with Kenya is expected to remain a priority. And given the Kenya-led Multinational Security Support (MSS) mission in Haiti, US-Kenya bilateral engagements might move the needle towards securing commitment to America’s over US$300 million funding pledge to the mission. Although this would be a tall order given the Trump camp’s reluctance to fund the UN, and peacekeeping in particular – despite the US proposing the resolution to replace the Kenyan-led MSS with a UN mission. Trump’s preference is for strategic partners to take up more of the burden without the US overextending its resources – so Kenya must look beyond the US for support. On the regional front, perhaps the most contentious area is the Horn of Africa. The controversial Project 2025 document of proposals produced by the conservative Heritage Foundation chapter on the State Department includes the recognition of Somaliland as a hedge against China’s growing influence in Djibouti. This aligns with former Assistant Secretary for African Affairs Tibor Nagy, who served in Trump’s first term and advocated for its recognition. Although denied by Trump, Project 2025 is predominantly written by key former Trump officials, including the State Department chapter author, Kiron K Skinner. Supporting this are optimistic statements of Somaliland recognition from former UK defence secretary Gavin Williamson after discussions with Trump’s policy leads. This could complicate US-Somalia and US-Ethiopia relations, as it will intensify brewing tensions over Ethiopia’s Red Sea access deal with Somaliland, much to the chagrin of Somalia, which has sought alliances with Egypt and Eritrea to counter them. Whether this is followed through will be crucial in determining the success of the AU’s Ethiopia-Somalia mediation efforts. Momentum for UNSC reform in Africa’s favour will unlikely increase under Trump’s second term On a continental level, how the US responds to United Nations Security Council (UNSC) reform proposals will matter to Africa. Current UN Ambassador Linda Thomas-Greenfield has expressed support for Africa securing a permanent seat (albeit without veto) on the UNSC. Will the Trump administration continue this momentum? Given Trump’s first-term attempts at defunding the UN and preference for bilateral over multilateral relations, momentum for UNSC reform in Africa’s favour will unlikely increase under Trump’s second term. Regardless, Africa must address its internal divisions on how the two seats outlined in the Ezulwini Consensus will be allocated. A more consequential area facing US-Africa relations would be the US’s position and contribution to UNSC Resolution 2719, a mechanism designed to fund AU-led peace support operations (PSOs). America is the largest contributor to UN PSOs, at 27% of the 2023-24 US$6.1-billion budget. Within months of Trump’s first term, the US successfully lobbied to reduce the UN peacekeeping budget by US$600million, although they aimed for an initial US$1billion reduction. Although the resolution will be maintained, the case-by-case basis on which authorisation must be supported might present a significant challenge for Africa. UNSC discussions on implementation of 2719 in Somalia, for example, attract a strong negative US pushback. Whether Trump maintains America’s renewed focus on Africa will depend on aligning US and African interests – despite their diversity – and Washington’s push to counter Russia and China’s growing influence. Regardless of the US’s policy trajectory, Africa must be prepared.

The Rise Of The ‘Gators’ And Its Implications For The Indo-Pacifi...	By Jaehan Park (FPRI) -- The American people chose former president Donald J. Trump once again. For the rest of the world, the most important question is what Trump’s foreign policy will be like in his second term. Often described as 'isolationist' by pundits, his foreign policy views hew more closely to 'Jacksonianism'—a populist foreign policy named after the seventh president that is largely transactional, somewhat aloof yet, at times, heavy-handed—and the record of his first term somewhat vindicates this judgment. There are some similaritiesbetween the returning president and Andrew Jackson himself, such as their penchant for tariffs, 'don’t tread on me' quality, and distrust for the elite. Yet there is another trend one can glimpse from the composition of the Trump administration 2.0. Whether out of political expediency, strategic deliberations, or mere coincidence, the president-elect announced that several individuals from his adopted state of Florida would assume key roles in his administration. Of importance, from the president on down, key national security posts will be filled with Floridians—most notably Senator Marco Rubio as the Secretary of State and Representative Michael Waltz as the National Security Advisor. Hence, the rise of the 'Gators.' These appointments, in my view, will manifest as a certain kind of Jacksonianism: a focus on their own continent, the Americas. Unlike their predecessors who cut their teeth in the executive branch in Washington, DC, these individuals are from the legislature, which interacts directly with voters who are in turn affected by local geographies. And if, as historian Walter McDougall observed, statespersons’ geographic perceptions have shaped history, these individuals’ own outlook on American geography, informed by these experiences, will likely shape their own perspectives, knowingly or not. Not only is Florida much more conservative than the bicoastal regions where the traditional foreign policy elite comes from—Floridians are also more concerned with hemispheric issues than Eurasia. And this may have important foreign policy ramifications. *** The fledgling United States took over what is now Florida from the Spanish Empire in 1819. From the outset, the Florida peninsula was of interest to American statesmen due to its location as a gatekeeper to the Gulf of Mexico. For instance, Thomas Jefferson entertained the idea of purchasing it along with New Orleans. After the Louisiana Purchase, the border between the young republic and the erstwhile Spanish holding became unstable due to frequent skirmishes between the American settlers and the Seminole Indians. In response, Washington ordered Andrew Jackson, then commander of the southern district, to take 'necessary measures.' Jackson took the opportunity to not only crush the invaders, but also expel European powers who were backing them—the Spaniards and, to a lesser extent, the Brits—for good. The resultant annexation of Florida coincided with the period during which the burgeoning republic under the stewardship of James Monroe and John Quincy Adams pursued a strategy to undermine European powers’ influence in the Western Hemisphere—most notably exemplified by the Monroe Doctrine. Incidentally, Jackson was appointed as the first military governor of Florida. The annexation of Florida in effect secured the southeastern flank of the United States. More importantly, as geographer Donald Meinig described, this new territory brought attention to Cuba—a key Spanish holding in the Caribbean. Thereafter, Cuba became a thorny issue in the debate over American foreign policy since the mid-19th century. By the end of that century, the United States resolved the issue by expelling the Spaniards from the Caribbean for good. In 1898, the Spanish-American War broke out over the explosion, supposedly caused by the Spaniards, of USS Maine harbored at Havana to protect American citizens and properties on the island amidst a civil war that had been going on between the Spanish colonists and the indigenous population of Cuba. The Spanish-American War was an important milestone in the history of American foreign relations. During the war, the difficulty of moving ships between the Atlantic and the Pacific became pronounced, which rekindled the debate over the isthmus canal and ultimately resulted in Theodore Roosevelt’s support of Panamanian independence from Colombia several years later. Most importantly, although America’s initial casus belli was the emancipation of Cubans who had been persecuted under Spanish rule, the war in the Caribbean ultimately led to America’s involvement in the Far East by way of the annexation of the Philippines. It also acquired a set of islands leading to the erstwhile Spanish holding: Hawaii, Guam, and Wake Atoll. Previously, American concerns in the Pacific had been mostly commercial. With the annexation of the Philippines, however, Americans now had territorial and security stakes in the region. In other words, the control of Florida and its adjacent seas laid the foundation for America’s rise as a global power and its involvement with the broader world—especially what is now called the Indo-Pacific. *** Often, major foreign policy debates revolve around which frontier the country should focus on. In our time, the Republicans are split among three groups: libertarian-isolationists, or 'restrainers,' who favor a much reduced presence around the globe; 'primacists'—more commonly known as neoconservatives—who advocate for a continued forward presence in all three key regions of Eurasia (Europe, the Middle East, and Asia); and finally, the self-described realists who are calling for concentration of efforts on the Indo-Pacific front—hence the moniker 'prioritizers.' What all these groups share—perhaps with the exception of the first one—is their focus on Eurasia; the Western Hemisphere, in contrast, has been put on the back burner in recent years. While neglect of the Americas might have made sense given the benign circumstances in the immediate aftermath of the Cold War, the geopolitical situation is calling for a rethink. America’s southern border is increasingly porous, through which illegal immigrants as well as deadly substances, such as fentanyl, flow. Drug cartels are not only bringing in narcotics, but also engaging in other heinous crimes, such as arms dealing and human trafficking. Aside from these nontraditional issues, hostile great powers have taken advantage of America’s neglect to exert influence in the region. For instance, Moscow signed a set of agreements with Caracas earlier this month, strengthening cooperation on intelligence and energy fronts. Similarly, Iran has maintained security ties with the region, either directly or vicariously through Hamas. Most importantly, China has been operating spy stations in Cuba and making significant investments in the rest of the region—exemplified most recently by the funding of a billion-dollar, deep-water port in Peru. The state of Florida is exposed to Latin America and the Caribbean more than the bicoastal regions—especially the Acela corridor and the Bay Area, which have deeper ties with Europe and Asia. For instance, South/Central America and the Caribbean were Florida’s largest market in 2023; in contrast, Asia was the largest market for both California and New York. In terms of population, Hispanics represent almost 30 percent of Florida’s population—far above the national level (approximately 20 percent). Unlike elsewhere, where Mexicans constitute the majority, however, Hispanics of Cuban origin account for the largest portion in Florida. Not surprisingly, their views are very different—more conservative than their southern brethren, if you will. Given their number, this has state-wide effects; in fact, Florida is more conservative than the rest of the country. *** Seen in this light, the rise of the 'Gators' may be hinting at the possibility of a change in America’s policy in the Western Hemisphere. Senator Marco Rubio’s anti-communist stance, originating in part from his Cuban-American background, and its possible consequences on America’s Latin America policy are widely discussed. Representative Michael Waltz was one of the lawmakers who introduced the bill to deploy U.S. military to root out drug cartels in Mexico; he has advocated for an 'updated Monroe Doctrine' in the Western Hemisphere to deal with cartels, energy security, and Chinese influence. It should be noted that his wife and fellow Floridian, Julia Nesheiwat, served as the homeland security advisor in the first Trump administration. Susie Wiles, Trump’s top campaign manager and chief of staff nominee, has deep ties with Florida politics, which may result in additional nominations of Floridians. The president-elect himself has made the southern border front and center of his campaign agenda; also, he was very critical of the Clinton administration’s attempt to normalize diplomatic relations with Cuba. He reversed much of the Obama administration’s Cuba policies during his first term. What are foreign policy implications of the rise of the 'Gators'? First, the Western Hemisphere will figure more prominently in American foreign policy. This is truer given that hemispheric issues permeate domestic, economic, and foreign policies. The president-elect’s threat to impose tariffs on Canada and Mexico to stop the influx of migrants and narcotics may prove to be an opening salvo of more heavy-handed approach in the Americas. Second, relatedly, this may at times result in rocky situations—for instance, between Washington and Mexico City. On the other hand, America might have an opportunity to make supply chains more secure, especially the sourcing of critical minerals or the production of semiconductors. More often, however, the result will be mixed. On Venezuela, for instance, the new administration will have to strike a delicate balance of interests concerning energy, strategic diplomacy, and migration. Even the author of The Art of the Deal will have to settle for less at times. Third, this focus on hemispheric issues, combined with America’s increasingly limited resources as well as the president-elect’s penchant for dealmaking, may result in America’s 'deprioritization' of less important regions. As of this writing, the U.S. national debt has reached approximately $35 trillion, out of which over $1 trillion were spent to cover interest payments—exceeding its defense budget earmarked at slightly over $800 billion. While brighter military minds will disagree, the new administration might want to tie loose ends on economic grounds. In fact, in his recent interview, Waltz already hinted that the incoming Trump administration would focus on the Western Hemisphere after quickly settling the ongoing conflicts in Europe and the Middle East. After all, no power can exert influence abroad without having secure peripheries. Looking at the Indo-Pacific, this may present both challenges and opportunities. While both Senator Rubio and Representative Waltz have been known as 'China hawks,' this does not mean that they would be easy on America’s regional allies crucial to deterring China. In fact, they may demand more financial, military, or other contributions, reflecting their principal’s well-known complaints about allied band-wagoning. That is, America’s allies may now have to turn their attention to the Americas to find ways to help the United States deal with these hemispheric issues, while taking on larger military roles in their respective theaters. Even so, they should confront the reality that America remains the best guarantor of their security and prosperity—at least better than the alternatives. And now it has problems in its own neighborhood. In the age of the 'Gators,' therefore, U.S. allies across the Indo-Pacific would do well to keep in mind the old adage: 'A friend in need is a friend indeed.'

The Keynesian Liquidity Trap Fable – Analysis	By Frank Shostak Many economists wrongly assume economic activity is accurately presented as a circular flow of money. Spending by one individual becomes part of the earnings of another individual; spending by another individual becomes part of the first individual’s earnings. Assuming this, recessions are because individuals—for whatever psychological reasons—have decided to cut down on their expenditure and raise their savings. For instance, if some individuals have become less confident about the future, they are likely to lower their outlays and 'hoard' (save) more money. Therefore, once individuals spend less, this will necessarily worsen the situation of some other individual, who, in turn, also cuts his spending. A vicious cycle, therefore, sets in—the decline in an individual’s confidence causes him to spend less and to 'hoard' more money; this lowers economic activity further, thereby causing individuals to 'hoard' more, etc. Following these faulty assumptions, in order to prevent a recession from getting out of hand, the central bank must expand the money supply and aggressively lower interest rates. Once individuals have more money in their pockets, it is believed, their confidence will increase and they will start spending again, thereby reestablishing the 'circular flow' of money. On the other hand, a situation could emerge when aggressive lowering of interest rates by the central bank could bring rates that could not decline further. As a result, the central bank will not be able to revive the economy. This situation is labeled as a 'liquidity trap.' Allegedly, the liquidity trap could occur because individuals might adopt a view that the interest rates have bottomed out and that the interest rates should subsequently rise, leading to capital losses on bond holdings. As a result, individuals’ demand for money would become extremely high, implying that individuals would 'hoard' money and refuse to spend it no matter how much the central bank tries to expand the money supply. Most experts are of the view that once a low-interest-rate policy becomes ineffective, monetary authorities should step in and spend. The spending can be on any and all sorts of projects. What matters here is that a lot of money must be pumped through inflation of money and credit. This is expected to boost consumer confidence. With the hoped-for higher level of confidence, consumers are likely to lower their savings and raise their expenditure, thereby reestablishing the 'circular flow' of money. Does the 'liquidity' trap emerge because of the lack of consumer spending? According to some popular thinking, the ever-expanding monetary flow is key for economic prosperity—what drives economic growth is spending. When individuals spend more of their money, this implies they save less. Conversely, when individuals reduce their monetary spending, they save more. Saving is supposed to be bad news for the economy—the more individuals save, the worse things become. The 'liquidity trap' comes from too much saving and the lack of spending, according to this theory. Observe, however, that individuals do not ultimately pay with money, but rather with goods that they have produced. The chief role of money is to fulfill the role of the medium of exchange. Hence, the demand for goods is constrained by the production of goods and not by the amount of money as such. (The role of money is to facilitate the exchange of goods). To suggest that people could have an almost-unlimited demand for money—leading to unlimited savings and a 'liquidity trap'—would imply that no one would be exchanging goods. Obviously, this is not a realistic proposition, especially given the fact that individuals require goods to support their continued existence. Being the medium of exchange, money can only assist in exchanging the goods of one producer for the goods of another producer. The medium-of-exchange service that money provides has nothing to do with the production of consumer goods as such. What permits the increase of these goods is production, saving, and accumulation of capital goods. With more capital goods (i.e., tools and machinery), individuals’ ability to produce goods of greater quantity and quality more efficiently increases. A so-called 'liquidity trap' does not emerge in response to consumers’ large increases in the demand for money, but comes as a result of expansionary monetary policies, which inflict damage and distort production, savings, and the capital structure. The 'Liquidity Trap' and the Shrinking of Savings As long as the growth rate of savings stays positive, this can continue to sustain productive and consumptive activities. Trouble erupts when, because of expansionary monetary policies, a structure of production emerges that ties up much more producer and consumer goods than the amount it creates and maintains. Excessive consumption relative to the production of capital and consumer goods leads to a decline in savings and capital. This, in turn, weakens the support for individuals that are employed in the various stages of the production structure, resulting in the economy plunging into a slump. Once the economy falls into a recession because of a declining savings and capital investment, any central bank attempts to revive the economy through further inflation will fail. Not only will these attempts fail to revive the economy, these attempts are going to deplete savings and distort the capital structure further, thereby prolonging the economic slump. The shrinking genuine savings and capital investment exposes the erroneous nature of the commonly-accepted view that expansionary monetary policies can grow an economy. The fact that central bank policies become ineffective in reviving the economy is not due to the 'liquidity trap.' Rather, this decline emerges due to previous expansionary monetary policies. The ineffectiveness of inflationary monetary policy to generate the illusion that the central banks can grow the economy has nothing to do with the 'liquidity trap.' The ineffectiveness is always present whenever the central authorities are attempting to 'grow the economy.' The only reason why it appears that these policies 'work' is because savings are still expanding during that period. Monetary Liquidity and the Stock Market When money supply increases, it enters various markets, including the stock market. Whenever new money enters a particular market, it means that now we have a greater amount of money per unit of goods in that market. A price of a good is the amount of money per good or per asset. Hence, all other things being equal, an increase in money supply results in an increase in the prices of goods. For a given amount of money, the value of stocks is going to be determined by the real wealth produced and expected by various activities that stocks represent. With the expansion and the enhancement of the infrastructure (i.e., capital goods) more wealth and hence a greater economic growth emerges. When the central bank tampers with money supply, however, this misleads investors. They perceive the increase in money as the increase in wealth. This, in turn, causes them to push the stock market prices higher. As long as savings are still expanding, the central bank’s expansionary monetary policies are driving the stock market higher. Once savings start to decline and/or the central bank contracts monetary policy, the stock market follows suit. In this sense, the attempt by the central bank to counter the 'liquidity trap' prolongs the economic slump and the bear market in stocks. Conclusion Contrary to much popular thinking, if the US economy were to fall into a so-called 'liquidity trap,' the reason for this is not a strong increase in the demand for money, but because previous expansionary monetary policies have depleted savings and distorted the structure of production.

A One-Time ICC Advocate Recants – OpEd	We are fast approaching the five-year anniversary of the pandemic outbreak that began my disillusionment with the United Nations system of which I had been a lifelong devotee both as a professor and a senior insider. My book The United Nations, Peace and Security was published by Cambridge University Press in 2006 with a revised and updated second edition in 2017 and has more than 1,000 Google Scholar citations. Its concluding chapter brought together the various threads of the previous thematic chapters to argue that the UN’s challenge was to reconcile realism with idealism, the world in which it actually operates with the idealised vision of a better world towards which humanity strives. The World Health Organisation betrayed both realism and idealism in its performance as the global lead authority on responding to the novel coronavirus in 2020. It trampled on core human rights principles and may actually have caused more long-term public health harms around the world than it helped to avert and mitigate. A second consequence of the disenchantment was to look afresh at the science and data behind the global warming-cum-climate change agenda, the reliance on assumptions-driven modelling, the fear porn, the multitude of failed alarmist predictions, and the strenuous efforts to silence, suppress, censor, and defund contrarian and dissenting research and voices. In both agendas, moreover, governments and international organisations have colluded with rent-seeking enterprises to coerce and shame people into changing behaviour to align with elite policy priorities, hypocritical elites broke the very rules they imposed on the public, economic costs were borne mainly by the less well-off while the wealthy profited from generous public subsidies and transfer of risks to the taxpayer, and poor peoples and countries have been further impoverished. Now comes the third leg of the disillusionment with regard to the institutions of international criminal justice, where too the conceit of professional international elites and technocrats is leading them into appropriating powers of sovereign states to make calculated policy trade-offs. To understand why, we need to go back almost 20 years to the time when the inaugural Prosecutor of the International Criminal Court (ICC) issued the first dramatic arrest warrant for a sitting head of state. Will it prove a case of three strikes and you are out with respect to global governance? Looking Back at 2005–08: The First Prosecutor In retelling the first case, I draw entirely on two publicly accessible documents, even today, on the websites of the ICC itself and the Administrative Tribunal of the International Labour Organisation (ILO) which is a specialised agency of the UN. It was set up in 1946 as the successor to the Administrative Tribunal of the League of Nations established in 1927. The 7-judge ILO Tribunal adjudicates more than 150 employee-employer conflicts annually involving 60 intergovernmental organisations, including the ICC, covering around 60,000 international civil servants. In Judgment No. 2757 handed down in Geneva on Wednesday 9 July 2008, the Tribunal ruled on an appeal by the ICC Public Information Adviser Christian Palme of Sweden against summary dismissal by the first ICC prosecutor Luis Moreno-Ocampo. The bulk of the judgment, as we shall see shortly, was not favourable to the prosecutor or to the ICC judges. On Thursday, Moreno-Ocampo issued a statement, reported by the Washington Postand PBS on Friday, that he would be submitting a request for an arrest warrant against Sudan’s President Omar Hassan al-Bashir. He duly did so on Monday 14 July. The ICC issued the warrant on 4 March 2009. Regardless of the prosecutor’s motivations and calculations which we have no way of determining, the coincidence of the proximity of timing meant that news of the first head of state facing the prospect of arrest by the ICC-dominated news coverage and the ILO finding was lost in the noise. The Timeline The ILO judgment begins with a bare-bones timeline of events. On 20 October 2006, Palme submitted an internal complaint to the ICC president accusing the prosecutor of ‘serious misconduct…by committing the crime of rape, or sexual assault, or sexual coercion, or sexual abuse against [a named individual] and that for this reason he should be removed from Office.’ Note that the ILO does not name Palme, identifying him merely as a 52-year-old Swede who joined the ICC on 6 June 2004 and a year later was promoted to the position of Public Information Adviser. Not only does this make it relatively simple to figure out who the person is. In fact he is identified by name in a 2009 article by two respected Africa experts Julie Flint and Alex de Waal that is available from the ICC’s website directly, as the first document in Annex 1. Returning to the ILO document, a panel of three ICC judges was set up to look into the complaint. On 8 December the ICC informed Palme that it had accepted the panel’s finding that his complaint was manifestly unfounded. Palme had submitted an audio recording of a telephone conversation between the alleged victim and an ICC colleague [Yves Soroboki] as supporting evidence. The ICC demanded all copies of the recording to be handed over for destruction. On 23 January 2007, the ICC’s HR section head wrote to Palme that he was being placed on a three-month suspension while the prosecutor’s complaint against him of serious misconduct was investigated. A follow-up letter on 16 March informed Palme that the prosecutor was considering dismissal. On 13 April Palme was told in a letter dated the 11th that he had been summarily dismissed. On 1 May Palme appealed to the internal Disciplinary Advisory Board alleging procedural and substantive flaws in the dismissal. The board requested and was given a copy of the panel’s report with an accompanying advisory that it was confidential. However, the board was asked to inform both Palme and Moreno-Ocampo that no findings of bad faith or malicious intent had been made against Palme. The board informed both parties of this on 26 May. On 18 June the board unanimously ruled that the dismissal was procedurally flawed and had also failed to establish the substantive charge of ‘obvious malicious intent.’ Accordingly, it called for the summary dismissal decision to be rescinded. On 13 July the prosecutor rejected the board’s recommendation and reconfirmed the summary dismissal of Palme. Palme then submitted an appeal to the ILO repeating his complaint of lack of due process and arbitrary dismissal and added that the prosecutor’s rejection of the board’s unanimous recommendation demonstrated the retaliatory nature of his dismissal. He urged the ILO Tribunal to quash the impugned decision and award material damages. The Tribunal’s Decision In the decision summarised at the end on p. 7 of the judgment, the Tribunal ‘set aside’ the prosecutor’s decisions of 11 April (Palme’s dismissal) and 13 July (rejecting the board’s recommendation); awarded Palme salary compensation worth the time that had remained in his contract plus a repatriation grant and other benefits payable when an employee separates from the organisation, plus 5 percent annual interest on these amounts; material damages amounting to two years of salary plus relevant allowances; moral damages; and costs. The total value of the monetary compensation came to €248,000. The reasoning behind the Tribunal’s conclusions is especially interesting. The court (not the prosecutor) had contended that it had separately interviewed the alleged victim and the prosecutor and both had ‘unambiguously denied’ the charge of rape. The Tribunal responded that Palme had alleged an act of ‘rape, or sexual assault, or sexual coercion, or sexual abuse,’ to which end the prosecutor had taken the alleged victim’s car keys and refused to return them until she consented to sexual intercourse (p. 3, consideration 2). The Disciplinary Board seems to have concluded there was no rape because force was not used (p. 4, consideration 10). Palme had not alleged the use of force, but rather that the journalist had consented to sexual intercourse in order to regain her car keys that had been taken by the prosecutor. He had submitted an audio recording in evidence in which the female journalist ‘sounded distressed and denied that she had been forced to have sexual intercourse but did not deny that she had consented in order to regain possession of her keys’ (consideration 3). The Board did not at any stage consider the precise factual allegation made by the complainant; namely, that the alleged victim had consented to sexual intercourse in order to regain possession of her keys (p. 4, consideration 7). The Tribunal noted that if a complainant makes a statement believing it to be true on reasonable grounds then, even if the statement turns out to be false, it does not meet the threshold of serious misconduct (consideration 9). Palme made the complaint based on information from a colleague whose admittedly ‘secondary evidence’ ‘may have been probative in criminal proceedings,’ ‘depending on the circumstances.’ Moreover, there was nothing to suggest that the ‘colleague was unreliable or untrustworthy, much less that he was known to be so by the complainant’ (p. 5, consideration 11). In the recorded conversation, the journalist ‘indicated unambiguously that the Prosecutor 'took [her] keys' and that she had consented to sexual intercourse 'to get out of [the situation]'’ (p. 5, consideration 11). Palme had ‘characterised the Prosecutor’s alleged conduct as 'rape, or sexual assault, or sexual coercion or sexual abuse' which, given differing national laws, is tolerably accurate’ (p. 5, consideration 10). Hence ‘it is not correct’ for the ICC to have concluded that ‘the complainant acted '[w]ithout any evidence of relevant probative value'.’ Nor can malice be inferred from his conduct. ‘The protection of the standing of the ICC, a matter in which the complainant had a legitimate interest, is also a proper purpose, as are other purposes such as ensuring observance of the law’ (p. 5, consideration 14). ‘Accordingly, the material on which the ICC relies does not justify a finding that the complainant acted with malicious intent’ (p. 6, consideration 16). Nuanced Initial Support for and of the ICC The 2008 ILO decision has a two-fold relevance to current events. First, it explains why some early advocates of universal international criminal justice who had welcomed the creation of the ICC began to have serious doubts about it. The judgment helped change my mind on the threat-benefit equation regarding the ICC. The arrest warrants against Israel’s PM and former defence minister have turned the 2009 disillusionment into outright opposition. The current Israeli case is all too familiar to observers of Middle Eastern and world affairs. The earlier case is mostly unfamiliar. Writing in the International Herald Tribune on 17 July 2001, I drew a distinction between activists who assert ‘the primacy of justice without borders’ and sceptics who warn of ‘international anarchy if we depart from realpolitik in a state-based system of world order.’ Even though the potential exists for abuse of universal justice ‘for vexatious and vindictive purposes,’ I concluded, the world was moving ‘inexorably from the culture of national impunity of previous centuries to a culture of international accountability more suited to the modern sensibility.’ In an article published in the same paper on 16 August 2002, I warned that with the newly operational ICC, the shift in balance in favour of the prosecution was producing a ‘transformation from protecting the rights of the accused to privileging the case for the prosecution.’ In addition, ‘Criminal law, however effective, cannot replace public or foreign policy.’ Both these articles were published while I was a senior UN official, with the disclaimer that they expressed personal opinions. The third article I wish to recall was published in the Daily Yomiuri (which no longer exists) on 12 July 2007, shortly after I left the UN, but summarising a presentation I made to a group of Japanese MPs just before my separation. Japan’s Parliament was debating ratification of the ICC at the time which did come about and possibly my presentation was helpful to that outcome. I argued that ‘Revulsion at the murder of large numbers of civilians in atrocity crimes has led to a softening of public and governmental support for the norms and institutions that shield the perpetrators of atrocity crimes from international criminal accountability.’ The UN Charter ‘was never meant to be a tyrant’s charter of impunity.’ Even so, international criminal justice still requires ‘sensitive judgment calls…the prosecution of alleged atrocity criminals must be balanced against the consequences for the prospects and process of peace, the need for post-conflict reconciliation and the fragility of international as well as domestic institutions.’ Chapter 5 of The United Nations, Peace and Security, originally published when I was still a senior UN official, is entitled ‘International Crime Justice.’ It analysed ‘the dynamic interaction between law and politics in the search for universal justice.’ I concluded that although the establishment of the ICC marked ‘one of the most significant advances in international law,’ the debates around the effort and negotiations ‘were testimony to a significant division of opinion in the international community.’ Finally, I also oversaw two international projects in collaboration with institutes in the Netherlands and Ireland and co-edited the two resulting books that were published by the United Nations University Press: From Sovereign Impunity to International Accountability: The Search for Justice in a World of States (2004) and Atrocities and International Accountability: Beyond Transitional Justice (2007). Damaging the International Criminal Justice Project Neither the world’s most powerful countries nor those representing the majority of the world’s peoples are party to the ICC statute. Of the ten most populous countries, only three are ICC members: Nigeria, Brazil, and Bangladesh. In the group of sixteen countries with a population of over 100 million, there’s also Mexico, Japan, and the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Non-members comprise 88 percent of the ten most populous and 84 percent of the hundred million population club of countries. As for the group of powerful countries, the only two of the five permanent members of the UN Security Council (P5) included among the ICC states parties are France and the UK. Judicial romantics privilege legal processes over every other consideration. This can be problematic in some cases even in domestic systems with well-established rule of law and separation of the different branches of government. Consider the US Supreme Court’s Dobbs decision (24 June 2022) which overturned the 1973 Roe v Wade decision. Contrary to much of the hysterical immediate reaction, Dobbs did not ban abortion. Rather, it made two important statements. The issue was not one of federal Constitutional power but of state jurisdiction. And it was not a judicial but a political issue, to be resolved by state-by-state political processes. The Court noted that women possess electoral and political power that can be exercised ‘by influencing public opinion, lobbying legislators, voting, and running for office.’ In this context, the court pointed out (pp. 65–66): It is noteworthy that the percentage of women who register to vote and cast ballots is consistently higher than the percentage of men who do so. In the last election in November 2020, women, who make up around 51.5 percent of the population of Mississippi, constituted 55.5 percent of the voters who cast ballots. In effect, the Court concluded that politicising the judiciary to resolve bitterly contested moral beliefs and social policy can increase social conflict. Judges should not be the arbiter of bioethics. Rather, it is for people through their elected representatives to find the appropriate balance between the competing interests of women, the unborn child, and society’s moral compass. Judicial romanticism is fraught with even more risks in international affairs where conflicts are typically resolved through diplomatic negotiations and/or on the battlefield. The absence of world government also means that the World Court and the ICC depend on the UN Security Council for enforcement action. But the P5-dominated Security Council reflects the power structure of 1945 and is dangerously misaligned with the current distribution of power in the real world. It is also the supreme political organ of the UN system. The blowback effects of criminal convictions of state leaders that remain unenforced damage the credibility, authority, and legitimacy of the courts themselves. Bashir never did stand trial at The Hague. The growing African irritation and anger with the ICC culminated in South Africa, despite being an ICC state party, defying its own courts to facilitate the departure of Bashir out of the country. The third India-Africa Forum summit was held in New Delhi from 26–29 October 2015, with 41 of 54 Africa’s heads of government/state in attendance. The summit was among the largest gatherings of African leaders in a foreign country and also the largest diplomatic event in India in over three decades. In an op-ed in the Japan Times on 4 November 2015, I wrote that Bashir’s presence at the India summit ‘was a challenge’ to the ICC and the UN Security Council. ‘Superficially, this signified disrespect for the rule of law. In reality, it is a rebellion against a normative enterprise of international criminal justice being subverted into a political project.’ The challenge to the ICC’s authority has only intensified in the decade since then. President Vladimir Putin, wanted over alleged war crimes in Ukraine, was warmly welcomed on an official visit to ICC member state Mongolia in September. He shook hands with UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres at the BRICS meeting in Kazan, Russia the following month and is expected to travel to India shortly. All 124 ICC member states, including the 27 members of the EU, are legally obligated to arrest Netanyahu should he travel to their country. Ireland, Denmark, and the Netherlands – which hosts the ICC at The Hague – have said they would enforce the arrest warrants. The UK is likely to do so. Germany has said no ‘because of its Nazi history.’ In open defiance of the ICC, PM Viktor Orbán has invited Netanyahu to visit Hungary. Several experts in France and the UK believe that arresting Netanyahu could be illegal under their national laws which confer immunity on the head of government of Israel, a state that is not a signatory to the Rome Statute (1998) that established the ICC. PM Justin Trudeau says Netanyahu will be arrested if he were to come to Canada: ‘We stand up for international law, and we will abide by all the regulations and rulings of the international courts…This is just who we are as Canadians.’ Opposition leader Pierre Poilievre, ahead by more than 20 points in the polls, responded that Trudeau should be ‘fired’ for his ‘extreme’ views against ‘the leader of a democratically-elected government…which has been besieged by terrorists and foreign tyrants attacking its land.’ Back in the day, then-Foreign Minister Alexander Downer won the argument in cabinet against PM John Howard and Australia joined the ICC. He believed at the time that sufficient safeguards had been built into the system to prevent malicious and frivolous investigations of democratic leaders of countries with robust rule of law, as is the case in Israel. He too has now concluded that the good faith towards the court has been betrayed. However, today’s Labor PM Anthony Albanese has reiterated that Australia follows the court’s ruling as ‘a point of principle.’ President Joe Biden has condemned the decision as ‘outrageous’ and the US ‘fundamentally rejected’ the call for arrests. Trump’s national security adviser-designate Mike Waltz says the arrest warrants have no legitimacy and the world ‘can expect a strong response to the anti-Semitic bias of the ICC and UN come January.’ On 2 December Trump himself warned of ‘all hell to pay in the Middle East’ if Hamas had not released the remaining Israeli hostages in Gaza before he takes office on 20 January. I suspect that, given Trump’s strong antipathy towards the ICC and his earlier sanctions on ICC prosecutor Fatou Bensouda on 2 September 2020 (lifted by Biden in April 2021), most Western countries will be wary of antagonising him by taking action against Netanyahu. Consequently, the ICC warrants are unlikely to lead to the arrest of either Netanyahu or Gallant anytime soon. Attempts to enforce them almost certainly will attract the hostile attention of Trump after 20 January.

The Real Scandal Of Hunter‘s Pardon – OpEd	Politicians and pundits spent much of last week commenting on President Biden’s pardon of his son Hunter for lying on a federal gun purchase form, failing to pay taxes, and any other offenses he may have committed over the past decade. Much of the controversy is because President Biden repeatedly pledged that he would never pardon his son. Some have also observed that the pardon’s timeline starts the year Hunter Biden joined the board of the Ukraine energy company Burisma. This has led to speculation that President Biden is trying to block any investigation into links between his son’s business dealings and President Biden’s Ukraine policy. What has not been widely discussed is the fact that Hunter Biden may be the only American President Biden has pardoned for violating unconstitutional federal gun and drug laws. Hunter Biden was convicted of lying on federal Form 4473. This is a form Americans must fill out to get federal government 'permission' to purchase a firearm. Specifically, Hunter Biden gave a false answer to the question, 'Are you an unlawful user of, or addicted to, marijuana or any depressant, stimulant, narcotic drug, or any other controlled substance?' The Second Amendment forbids the federal government from limiting the ability of any American to exercise his natural right to own a firearm. Furthermore, federal drug laws are themselves unconstitutional. The Constitution only creates three federal crimes: treason, piracy, and counterfeiting. All other crimes are under the jurisdiction of state and local governments. So, the required use of this form is a constitutional violation of the rights of Hunter Biden and all other Americans who are subjected to it when they seek to obtain a gun. Form 4473 warns Americans that 'the use or possession of marijuana remains unlawful under Federal law regardless of whether it has been legalized or decriminalized for medicinal or recreational purposes in the state where you reside.' Thus, someone could be prevented from exercising his Second Amendment right because of his activities that are perfectly legal in his state. This turns federalism on its head. Hunter Biden was also convicted of, and pardoned for, tax evasion and the filing of fraudulent tax returns. It is hard for anyone who values liberty to get upset at those who violate the tax laws since the income tax is a form of theft by the government of people’s hard-earned income. An outrage of Hunter Biden’s pardon is President Biden’s hypocrisy. When he served as chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee in the 1990s, then-Senator Biden played a major role in getting through Congress the Brady Law that created the federal gun purchase background check system that Hunter Biden was convicted of violating. Senator Biden also was a leading drug warrior who led the fight to pass the 1994 crime bill and was a champion of mandatory minimums and other infringements of civil liberties in the name of the war on drugs. President Biden also supported hiring more IRS agents to squeeze more money from taxpayers. Then-Senator Biden wrote large parts of the PATRIOT Act. As chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Senator Biden also led the effort to pass the unconstitutional (and disastrous) 'authorization for use of military force' against Iraq. President Biden should spend his last month in office pardoning more Americans for violations of unconstitutional drug and gun laws. This would serve as a small gesture of atonement for a political career spent advocating policies destructive of peace, prosperity, and liberty.

Trump’s 2025 Agenda Trades US Global Leadership For Tariffs – Ana...	By Gary Hufbauer The surprise was not so much Donald Trump’s election in the 2024 US presidential race as Republican victories in both the Senate and the House of Representatives. The resulting trifecta will enable Trump to reshape the US role on the world stage, making changes that ripple across the international order. When he takes office on 20 January 2025, Trump can again deploy not only the extensive executive authority conferred on the president by past statutes. He can also pursue new legislation to further his radical economic agenda. Trump seems on course to dismantle four pillars of the Washington Consensus that guided US economic policy before his first election in 2017 — relatively free and non-discriminatory trade, open capital markets, modest budget deficits and an independent central bank. Trump can impose tariffs of any measure, on any country or product through executive orders. During his campaign, Trump advocated a tariff wall of 10 or 20 per cent on all imports on top of existing bound tariffs against all US trade partners, including those with free trade agreements. He also proposed hiking 2019’s partial 19 per cent tariffs to 60 per cent on all imports from China. Shortly after the election, Trump threatened Mexico and Canada with 25 per cent tariffs on all US imports unless they stop fentanyl exports and illegal emigration. He also threatened BRICS with 100 per cent tariffs if they seek an alternative currency to the US dollar. The practical limitation facing Trump is not the scope of executive power but rather the magnitude of domestic political pushback arising from three main sources. The President-elect’s trade policy will be constrained by foreign retaliation against US exports, higher prices on sensitive consumer goods and potential harm to US firms that rely on foreign components. Yet pre-inauguration statements indicate that Trump may frequently use the threat of new tariffs as leverage to extract concessions from foreign partners. The annual US National Trade Estimate Report on Foreign Trade Barriers — a document summarising trade concessions that Washington might seek — may foretell the details of Trump’s potential demands. He may allow exceptions for ‘essential’ or price-sensitive products and items dear to important corporate supporters. The tariff wall and its exceptions will create considerable drama, not least at the World Trade Organization. The outcome will be considerably less free trade and extensive discrimination between and against partners. Trump has discarded the notion of mutual gain from trade and instead views commerce as a tool of combat between nations. Among Trump’s long-standing complaints about US economic governance is the size and persistence of US trade deficits — the current account deficit is approximately US$950 billion in 2024. Unlike economists, Trump does not see deficits as the outcome of the internal balance between savings, investment and government spending. He perceives the cause to be unfair foreign trade practices and industrial policies. If the US dollar appreciates due to tariffs and the trade deficit widens, the second Trump administration may seek to devalue the dollar as a remedy. The federal budget deficit reached US$1.8 trillion in fiscal year 2024, almost 7 per cent of projected GDP at US$29 trillion. Legislation in 2025 will seek to extend and expand the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. Trump wants to slash the corporate tax rate from 21 to 15 per cent and eliminate income tax on tips, overtime and Social Security benefits. Macroeconomists suggest that Trump’s tax agenda could add US$800 billion to the annual federal deficit even allowing for higher tariff revenue. This stimulus could overheat the already robust US economy. Inflationary pressure and the impact of tariffs on the cost of living would prompt the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates — a manoeuvre that Trump rejects. Scarred by its tepid response to incipient inflation in 2021 and 2022, the Federal Reserve will step on the monetary brakes if the economy overheats. Trump could then ask Congress to draft legislation giving the president sweeping powers over the Federal Reserve. These could include the ability to dismiss governors — or to be consulted on monetary policy — potentially eroding the dollar’s preeminent role in world trade and finance. Trump’s aversion to foreign US military involvement may mean that Washington’s alliances no longer guarantee its support against Russian or Chinese aggression. In fact, Trump’s penchant for ‘big deals’ could lead to accommodations with Russia on Ukraine and potentially with China on Taiwan. All told, Trump’s economic and foreign policy playbooks could amount to US abdication of global leadership. Short of global war, a more disruptive outcome is hard to imagine.

When Rights Become Privileges: Is The Constitution Becoming Optio...	Disguising its power grabs in the self-righteous fervor of national security, the Deep State has mastered the art of the bait-and-switch. It works like this: first, the government foments fear about some crisis or threat to national security, then they capitalize on it by seizing greater power and using those powers against the American people. We’ve seen this play out over and over again. The government used its so-called War on Terror to transform itself into a police state. Then the police state used its War on COVID-19 to claim lockdown powers. All indications are that the government’s promised War on Illegal Immigration will be yet another sleight of hand that allows the powers-that-be to engage in greater power grabs while weakening the Constitution. Therein lies the danger of the government’s growing addiction to power. Whatever dangerous practices you allow the government to carry out now—whether it’s in the name of national security or protecting America’s borders or making America healthy again—inevitably, these same practices can and will be used against you when the government decides to set its sights on you. The slippery slope that starts with illegal immigration has all the makings of a thinly veiled plot to empower the government to become the arbiter of who is deserving of rights and who isn’t. That quickly, we could find ourselves navigating a world in which the rights enshrined in the Constitution for all persons living in the United States are transformed into privileges enjoyed only by those whom the government chooses to recognize as legitimate. By persuading the public that non-citizens, particularly illegal immigrants, do not enjoy the same inalienable rights as law-abiding citizens (a fact refuted by the Constitution and every credible legal scholar in the country), the Deep State is leading us down a road in which all rights are transitory. This is how you establish a hierarchy of rights, contingent on whether you belong to a favored political class. Be warned. At such a time as the government is emboldened to flip that switch and appoint itself the ultimate authority on which protected class of individuals gets to enjoy the rights enshrined within the Constitution, the dividing line will not be between legal citizens and illegal immigrants. It will not even be between Republicans and Democrats. Rather, the purpose of that line of demarcation will be to distinguish the compliant, obedient, subservient vassal of the American police state (the so-called Loyalists) from everyone else. We’re almost at that point now. This is how tyranny rises and freedom falls. Here are some of the inherent dangers in allowing the government to become the arbiter of who is deserving of rights: It leads to the erosion of universal rights. The Bill of Rights was designed to protect the fundamental rights of all persons within the United States, regardless of their citizenship status, race, religion, or any other factor. When the government starts making distinctions about who is entitled to these rights, it undermines the universality that makes them so powerful. This creates a slippery slope where rights become privileges, subject to the whims of those in power. It gives rise to authoritarianism. History is replete with examples of governments that consolidated power by first stripping away the rights of marginalized groups. Once the principle of universal rights is breached, it becomes easier to target other groups deemed 'undesirable' or 'unworthy.' This paves the way for authoritarianism, where the government dictates who enjoys freedom and who does not. It creates a two-tiered society. A hierarchy of rights inevitably leads to a two-tiered society, where some individuals enjoy full protection under the law while others are relegated to second-class status. This fosters resentment, division, and social unrest. It also creates a vulnerable population that can be easily exploited and abused. It undermines the rule of law. The rule of law is a fundamental principle of a just society. It means that everyone is subject to the same laws and that no one is above the law. When the government selectively applies the law based on arbitrary criteria, it undermines the rule of law and erodes trust in the legal system. It chills free speech and dissent, i.e., the right to criticize the government. When people fear that their rights are contingent on their political views or social status, they are less likely to speak out against injustice or challenge the government. This chilling effect on dissent stifles free speech and creates a climate of fear and conformity. It contributes to the loss of moral authority. A nation that claims to champion liberty and justice for all loses its moral authority when it denies those principles to certain groups within its borders. This undermines its standing in the world and diminishes its ability to promote human rights abroad. Remember, the erosion of inalienable rights often starts subtly, with the government chipping away at the edges of those rights for specific groups. The pattern is subtle at first, with government officials exploiting fear and prejudice in order to target groups that are already marginalized or perceived as 'outsiders.' Incrementally, the net is cast wider and wider, so that by the time the injustice is widespread enough to inspire outrage in the greater populace, it’s too late to resist. Historic examples abound of how the government has manufactured a blatantly unjust hierarchy of rights in order to diminish certain segments of society. These run the gamut from slavery and the persecution of Native Americans to the Japanese internment camps and segregation. More recently, we’ve seen this tactic deployed in order to justify policies that run afoul of the Constitution, ranging from immigration policies and mass surveillance programs to SWAT team raids, voting rights, and the erosion of due process. Clearly, Martin Niemöller’s warning about the widening net that ensnares us all, a warning issued in response to the threat posed by Nazi Germany’s fascist regime, still applies. 'First they came for the socialists, and I did not speak out—because I was not a socialist. Then they came for the trade unionists, and I did not speak out— because I was not a trade unionist. Then they came for the Jews, and I did not speak out—because I was not a Jew. Then they came for me—and there was no one left to speak for me.' This is how the slippery slope to all-out persecution starts. It doesn’t help that growing numbers of American citizens barely know their rights. Consider that only 5% of the U.S. adults surveyed could correctly name all five rights in the First Amendment, 20% could not correctly name any, and less than one in 10 Americans know they have a right to petition the government. Such civic illiteracy lays the groundwork for all manner of tyrannies to follow. After all, how can you defend your rights if you don’t know what those rights are? Then again, civic illiteracy among government officials, who are entrusted with upholding and protecting the Constitution, doesn’t appear to be much better. It was ten years ago on December 15, National Bill of Rights Day, that the U.S. Supreme Court in its 8-1 ruling in Heien v. State of North Carolina gave police in America one more ready excuse to routinely violate the laws of the land, this time under the guise of ignorance. The Heien case, which started with an improper traffic stop based on a police officer’s ignorance of the law and ended with an unlawful search, seizure and arrest, was supposed to ensure that ignorance of the law did not become a ready excuse for government officials to routinely violate the law. It failed to do so. In failing to enforce the Constitution, the Court gave police the go-ahead to justify a laundry list of misconduct, from police shootings of unarmed citizens to SWAT team raids, roadside strip searches, and the tasering of vulnerable individuals with paltry excuses such as 'they looked suspicious' and 'she wouldn’t obey our orders.' Ignorance of the law has become an all-too-convenient cover for all manner of abuses by government officials who should know better. I’m not sure which is worse: government officials who know nothing about the laws they have sworn to uphold, support and defend, or a constitutionally illiterate citizenry so clueless about their rights that they don’t even know when those rights are being violated. This much I do know, however: for anyone to advocate terminating or suspending the Constitution is tantamount to a declaration of war against the founding principles of our representative government and the rule of law. If there is one point on which there should be no political parsing, no legal jockeying, and no disagreement, it is this. Then again, as I make clear in my book Battlefield America: The War on the American People and in its fictional counterpart The Erik Blair Diaries, one could well make the case that the Constitution has alreadybeen terminated after years on life support, given the extent to which the safeguards enshrined in the Bill of Rights—adopted 233 years ago as a means of protecting the people against government overreach and abuse—have been steadily chipped away at, undermined, eroded, whittled down, and generally discarded with the support of Congress, the White House, and the courts. History provides chilling examples of how quickly rights can vanish, even in a nation such as ours founded on the principles of freedom. As George Carlin astutely observed: 'If you think you do have rights, next time you’re at the computer, get on the internet, go to Wikipedia. When you get to Wikipedia, in the search field for Wikipedia, I want you to type in ‘Japanese Americans 1942’ and you’ll find out all about your precious … rights. In 1942, there were 110,000 Japanese American citizens in good standing, law-abiding people, who were thrown into internment camps simply because their parents were born in the wrong country. That’s all they did wrong. They had no right to a lawyer, no right to a fair trial, no right to a jury of their peers, no right to due process of any kind. The only right they had: ‘right this way’ into the internment camps. Just when these American citizens needed their rights the most, their government took them away. And rights aren’t rights if someone can take them away.' Remember you were warned, folks. At the point that rights become privileges, then the Constitution and the government’s adherence to the rule of law will become optional.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfDHDLflDWSKeJLQaPFxyaH	2024-12-09T17:16:52-08:00	
World’s Top Arms Producers See Revenues Rise On Back Of Wars And ...	Revenues from sales of arms and military services by the 100 largest companies in the industry reached $632 billion in 2023, a real-terms increase of 4.2 per cent compared with 2022. Arms revenue increases were seen in all regions, with particularly sharp rises among companies based in Russia and the Middle East. Overall, smaller producers were more efficient at responding to new demand linked to the wars in Gaza and Ukraine, growing tensions in East Asia and rearmament programmes elsewhere. SIPRI Top 100 companies ramp up production and build workforces In 2023 many arms producers ramped up their production in response to surging demand. The total arms revenues of the Top 100 bounced back after a dip in 2022. Almost three quarters of companies increased their arms revenues year-on-year. Notably, most of the companies that increased their revenues were in the lower half of the Top 100. ‘There was a marked rise in arms revenues in 2023, and this is likely to continue in 2024,’ said Lorenzo Scarazzato, a Researcher with the SIPRI Military Expenditure and Arms Production Programme. ‘The arms revenues of the Top 100 arms producers still did not fully reflect the scale of demand, and many companies have launched recruitment drives, suggesting they are optimistic about future sales.’ US companies’ arms revenues rise, but production challenges remain The 41 companies in the Top 100 based in the United States recorded arms revenues of $317 billion, half the total arms revenues of the Top 100 and 2.5 per cent more than in 2022. Since 2018, the top five companies in the Top 100 have all been based in the USA. Of the 41 US companies, 30 increased their arms revenues in 2023. However, Lockheed Martin and RTX, the world’s two largest arms producers, were among those registering a drop. ‘Larger companies like Lockheed Martin and RTX manufacturing a wide range of arms products often depend on complex, multi-tiered supply chains, which made them vulnerable to lingering supply chain challenges in 2023,’ said Dr Nan Tian, Director of SIPRI’s Military Expenditure and Arms Production Programme. ‘This was particularly the case in the aeronautics and missile sectors.’ European arms industry trails rest of world in revenue growth The combined arms revenues of the 27 Top 100 companies based in Europe (excluding Russia) totalled $133 billion in 2023. This was only 0.2 per cent more than in 2022, the smallest increase in any world region. However, behind the low growth figure the picture is more nuanced. European arms companies producing complex weapon systems were mostly working on older contracts during 2023 and their revenues for the year consequently do not reflect the influx of orders. ‘Complex weapon systems have longer lead times,’ said Lorenzo Scarazzato. ‘Companies that produce them are thus inherently slower in reacting to changes in demand. That explains why their arms revenues were relatively low in 2023, despite a surge in new orders.’ At the same time, a number of other European producers saw their arms revenues grow substantially, driven by demand linked to the war in Ukraine, particularly for ammunition, artillery and air defence and land systems. Notably, companies in Germany, Sweden, Ukraine, Poland, Norway and Czechia were able to tap into this demand. For instance, Germany’s Rheinmetall increased production capacity of 155-mm ammunition and its revenues were boosted by deliveries of its Leopard tanks and new orders, including through war-related ‘ring-exchange’ programmes (under which countries supply military goods to Ukraine and receive replacements from allies). Wartime production leads to sharp rise in Russian firms’ arms revenues The two Russian companies listed in the Top 100 saw their combined revenues increase by 40 per cent to reach an estimated $25.5 billion. This was almost entirely due to the 49 per cent increase in arms revenues recorded by Rostec, a state-owned holding company controlling many arms producers, including seven previously listed in the Top 100 for which individual revenue data could not be obtained. ‘Official data on Russian arms production is scarce and questionable but most analysts believe that the production of new military equipment increased substantially in 2023, while Russia’s existing arsenal underwent extensive refurbishment and modernization,’ said Dr Nan Tian. ‘In particular, combat aircraft, helicopters, UAVs, tanks, munitions and missiles are all thought to have been produced in greater numbers as Russia continued its offensive in Ukraine.’ South Korean and Japanese companies lead revenue growth in Asia and Oceania The 23 companies in the Top 100 based in Asia and Oceania recorded 5.7 per cent arms revenue growth year-on-year, to reach $136 billion. The four South Korea-based companies recorded a combined 39 per cent increase in arms revenues to reach $11.0 billion. The five companies based in Japan saw their combined arms revenues rise by 35 per cent to $10.0 billion. A policy of military build-up in Japan since 2022 drove a flurry of domestic orders, with some companies seeing the value of new orders increase more than 300 per cent. ‘The sharp growth in arms revenues among South Korean and Japanese companies reflects the bigger picture of military build-ups taking place in the region in response to heightened threat perceptions,’ said Xiao Liang, a Researcher with the SIPRI Military Expenditure and Arms Production Programme. ‘South Korean firms are also trying to expand their share of the global arms market, including demand in Europe related to the war in Ukraine.’ Middle East arms producers see revenue growth linked to Gaza, Ukraine conflicts Six of the Top 100 arms companies were based in the Middle East. Their combined arms revenues grew by 18 per cent to $19.6 billion. With the outbreak of war in Gaza, the arms revenues of the three companies based in Israel in the Top 100 reached $13.6 billion. This was the highest figure ever recorded by Israeli companies in the SIPRI Top 100. The three companies based in Türkiye saw their arms revenues grow by 24 per cent to $6.0 billion, benefiting from exports prompted by the war in Ukraine and from the Turkish government’s continued push towards self-reliance in arms production. ‘The biggest Middle Eastern arms producers in the Top 100 saw their arms revenues reach unprecedented heights in 2023 and the growth looks set to continue,’ said Dr Diego Lopes da Silva, Senior Researcher with the SIPRI Military Expenditure and Arms Production Programme. ‘In particular, as well as taking in record arms revenues in 2023, Israeli arms producers are booking many more orders as the war in Gaza rages on and spreads.’ Other notable developments The nine companies in the Top 100 based in China saw their smallest year-on-year percentage increase in arms revenues (+0.7 per cent) since 2019 amid a slowing economy. Their total arms revenues in 2023 reached $103 billion. The combined arms revenues of the three Indian companies in the Top 100 increased to $6.7 billion (+5.8 per cent). NCSIST, the only Taiwan-based company in the Top 100, recorded a 27 per cent increase in its arms revenues to $3.2 billion. Türkiye’s Baykar produces armed uncrewed aerial vehicles (UAVs) that have been widely used in the war in Ukraine. Exports accounted for around 90 per cent of its arms revenues in 2023, which increased by 25 per cent over the year to $1.9 billion. The United Kingdom’s Atomic Weapons Establishment, which designs, manufactures and maintains nuclear warheads, recorded the largest year-on-year percentage increase in arms revenues (+16 per cent) among UK companies in the Top 100, to reach $2.2 billion.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfDHDLflDWSKWrupIZCEG9e	2024-12-09T17:14:00-08:00	
Fico Proposes ‘COVID Amnesty’ And Compensation For Thousands Of S...	(EurActiv) -- Slovakia's Prime Minister, Robert Fico, proposed a measure to forgive misdemeanours related to the COVID-19 pandemic, covering a period spanning 42 months. The intervention has been approved by the government and is currently pending parliamentary approval. The Ministry of Interior will reimburse funds for fines imposed by police officers and district offices and meal expenses charged to individuals placed in quarantine facilities. Fines will also be reimbursed by other institutions that imposed them at the time for violations of anti-pandemic measures, such as regional public health offices, municipalities, and cities. The Ministry's preliminary estimates indicate more than 17,000 invoices for meal expenses in state quarantine facilities and approximately 58,000 records of infractions under the Public Health and Civil Protection Acts. 'First and foremost, it should be noted that it is the government that is authorised, under article 90 of the Misdemeanours Act, to grant amnesty in matters of misdemeanours adjudicated by the authorities of the Slovak Republic,' Slovak Ombudsman Róbert Dobrovodský explained to Euractiv. 'Correcting injustice' The total amount of fines imposed during the delineated COVID-19 period is € 2.7 million, of which around €989 thousand have been paid. The total amount invoiced for meals is above €1.5 million, with invoices amounting to more than €1.36 million already paid. The government also approved an amnesty for all unpaid fines imposed for infractions related to anti-pandemic measures during the entire period when a state of emergency or crisis was declared due to the pandemic. The amnesty also includes an order to halt all ongoing proceedings related to misdemeanours. PM Fico stated that this was the first step toward correcting injustices. 'It was a dark period in terms of the legal order and the violation of human rights,' the PM added. The proposal is expected to cost the state budget €3.3 million, a sum the Prime Minister deems manageable. The validity of leniency Under Article 121 of the Slovak Constitution, the government has the right to grant amnesty in matters of misdemeanours. The government concession is also anchored in the Misdemeanours Act. According to Dobrovodský, similar to the case of granting pardons by the Slovak President, the decision on the scope and recipients of amnesty for misdemeanours granted by the government is exclusively within the government's discretion. 'It is established that, in legal theory, amnesty is granted based on generally defined criteria to an unspecified group of recipients. Legally, therefore, the amnesty meets these criteria,' Dobrovodský added. Amnesty and self-exoneration According to the Ombudsman, the legal doctrine also states that amnesty is often granted in connection with significant historical events. In the case of pardons, this instrument is used to mitigate the severity or injustice of a law. 'Regarding the question of whether a significant historical circumstance has arisen or whether the law was unduly harsh in penalising individuals who violated COVID-19 measures contrary to applicable and effective rules, the government likely assessed this positively, as it decided to grant the amnesty,' he continued. 'Whether this reasoning is correct and based on solid grounds is not for me to judge, especially since the government falls outside the scope of my authority,' Dobrovodský concluded. The compensation could also be claimed by the PM's Smer-SD party, which, while in opposition, violated pandemic measures during a rally in Rimavská Sobota, a town in southern Slovakia, resulting in a €3,000 fine. The practicalities The draft law regulates financial reimbursement for individuals who suffered financial damage due to the implementation of pandemic measures. This includes compensation for fines paid for COVID-19-related infractions committed between March 12, 2020, and September 15, 2023. 'The compensation system itself will be set up as reimbursement of paid amounts, based on the submission of an application by an authorised person along with the relevant documents. Once the draft law is approved, the Ministry of the Interior will make a form available for submitting such applications. The anticipated deadline for submitting applications is August 31, 2025,' the Ministry of Interior said. According to the Ministry, the amounts to be compensated will also include any other verifiable costs incurred by the authorised person in connection with imposing the obligation and executing the decision. For example, expenses related to misdemeanours, court or enforcement proceedings, and late payment interest. If the application is complete and the compensation conditions are met, the Ministry of the Interior will disburse the funds to the eligible persons within 60 days of receiving the full application.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfDHDLflDWSKUTpkk5ejJP-	2024-12-09T17:12:09-08:00	
How Assad’s Fall Threatens Russia’s Military Influence In Syria, ...	By Mike Eckel (RFE/RL) -- Nine years ago, a caravan of hulking military cargo planes and aging naval ships began shuttling back and forth from Russian bases depositing a massive expeditionary military force to western Syria, cementing Russia's muscular presence in the Middle East and ultimately saving the regime of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. Assad is now gone, the fate of those bases are now jeopardy, and the question of Russia's entire Middle East strategy is now very much up in the air. The fall of the Assad regime this past weekend was a tectonic event, reverberating across the entire Middle East and further. The Kremlin's 2015 Syria intervention, which scrambled the regional calculus, is now being scrambled yet again as Moscow tries to figure out what to do next. As of December 9, there were no confirmed signs of any Russian pullout from Syria. An unnamed Kremlin official told the TASS state news agency that Russia had reached an agreement to ensure the safety of its military assets in Syria. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov declined to comment to reporters. 'It's still premature to discuss this,' he told reporters. 'However, this will be a topic for discussion with whomever will be in charge in Syria in the future.' Here's what you need to know about Russia's presence in Syria, and what might come next. What, Where, And Who Russia's presence with Syria dates back to Soviet relations with Assad's father, and resulted in a critical asset for Moscow in 1971: naval access to the deep-water Mediterranean port at Tartus. Moscow's attention waned until 2011, when a popular uprising morphed into outright civil war threatening Assad's government. In September 2015, Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered Russia's largest expeditionary force in decades, if ever, to deploy to Syria to bolster Assad's sputtering efforts to battle rebels and extremist groups. Syria granted Russia a 49-year lease access to Tartus and the air base at Hmeimim. 'The situation was very difficult, both in terms of morale and exhaustion,' General Valery Gerasimov, the chairman of Russia's General Staff, said in an interview published in 2017. 'A lack of ammunition, necessary types of support, command. Our operation began, and after some time we saw the first successes…. Today the Syrian Army is capable of performing tasks to protect its territory.' The following year, after months of relentless air strikes that obliterated cities -- a campaign so ruthless that the commander who ordered it was given the nickname 'General Armageddon' -- Syria's military had the upper hand. Emboldened Russian forces, whose numbers also included private Wagner Group mercenaries, clashed with U.S.-backed forces in eastern Syria in 2018. At the peak of Russia's intervention in Syria, around 2017, as many as 6,000 combat and auxiliary troops were deployed, including mercenary forces, according to estimates by the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a Washington think tank. Most of those ground forces were employed to advise Syria's military, but commanders also deployed Russian artillery and armored units, as well as special forces, to support Syrian infantry, particularly in 2016 during the offensive to retake Aleppo, Syria's largest city. It's unclear how big the current Russian contingent on the ground is. The Telegram channel YeZh estimated 7,000 troops remained in the country. Whither The Warm-Water Port Tartus was a springboard for Russia to project power, not only in Syria throughout the Middle East but into Africa and elsewhere. After 2015, Russia used its Baltic and Black Sea ships extensively to supply the port and transport heavy weaponry and construction equipment. A construction company linked to a Kremlin-allied businessman was awarded a contract in 2019 to manage and expand the port. The port's mooring capacity is as many as 11 vessels, including nuclear-powered ships. Several diesel-electric submarines cycled in and out of the facility and were used to fire Kalibr cruise missiles at Syrian targets. The port's water depth also accommodated larger ships, including the Russian Navy's oft-mocked flagship, the Admiral Kuznetsov aircraft carrier, which was deployed to the eastern Mediterranean between October 2016 and January 2017. In days prior to the capture of Damascus by Syrian rebel groups, several ships, most of which that had been berthed at Tartus, were spotted heading out to sea, stoking speculation that an evacuation was under way. Тhe Defense Ministry, however, on December 3 released footage of the flotilla firing missiles, saying the maneuvers were a training exercise. 'What Tartus meant for Russia was the ability to project maritime power and political influence relatively uncontested in the Middle East and allowed to punch above its weight,' Fredrik Van Lokeren, a retired Belgian naval officer, wrote in a December 8 blog post. The Russian ships at Tartus might have been utilized to help Russia's operations in the Black Sea, which have also been severely curtailed by innovative Ukrainian tactics. But the warships are barred from transiting Turkey's Bosporus by international treaty. Forced Air Located some 60 kilometers up the coast from Tartus, Russia's air forces have utilized the Hmeimim air base. In addition to hosting fighter jets and helicopters, it's also served as the destination for the massive cargo planes that have shuttled men and materiel in and out of Syria. Russian engineers enlarged the base in 2016-17, lengthening runways and expanding parking capacity. Putin paid an unannounced visit to the base in December 2017, where he declared victory of Syria's rebel forces, whom he called 'terrorists.' 'If the terrorists again raise their heads, we will deal such blows to them as they have never seen,' he said at the time. Russia's air fleet in Syria included more than two dozen Su-24 and Su-25 frontline bombers and ground-attack aircraft, according to a semi-official report published in 2016, along with at least eight advanced Su-30 fighter bombers and 12 Mi-24 and Ka-52 attack helicopters, among others. From September 2015 to January 2018, CSIS estimates, Russian forces flew more than 34,000 combat sorties, with Su-24s and Su-34s serving as the primary strike aircraft. Russian forces also deployed short-range Iskander-M ballistic missiles systems, as well as the sophisticated long-range S-400 air-defense system and short-range defenses like Pantsir and Tor systems. All would have to be shipped out by air or sea. In recent days, commercial satellite imagery has shown the presence of several Ilyushin Il-76 jets -- heavy-lift workhorse cargo planes -- parked on the runways at Hmeimim, suggesting the possibility of the beginning of an evacuation. However, given the amount of weaponry and equipment deployed to Syria and Moscow's reluctance to leave it for Syrian rebels, it would require dozens of flights or sea shipment to remove it all. It will be difficult to hide that, said Dara Massicot, an expert on the Russian military at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. From Latakia To Donbas The best explanation for the dizzying collapse of Assad and his military is the absence of support from Damascus's two strongest allies: Iran and Russia. Where Russia is concerned, the explanation leads to its unrelenting invasion of Ukraine, now in its 34th month with no end in sight. Russia's casualties there have climbed past 600,000, according to Western estimates, and its economy is running at torrid pace, as defense factories rush to keep pace with Ukraine's destruction of weaponry and equipment. That means little spare capacity -- men and material -- to bolster Syria's efforts. The Kremlin may still end up reaching an agreement with the rebel leadership and preserve access to one or both facilities in Syria. If not, however, Russia's ability to project military or economic power will be severely curtailed. The two facilities were a key conduit for covert and overt military supplies in north and central Africa, as well as a conduit for revenues generated in several countries, often under dubious circumstances. That includes places like Libya, where Russian mercenaries and irregular forces fought alongside a renegade Libyan general, Khalifa Haftar, in a 2019 offensive to seize the port of Tripoli. Russia operations have also spread to other troubled African regions like the Central African Republic and Niger. Last July, in Mali, a Russian mercenary force suffered major losses in a battle with Tuareg rebels. Experts say Russia could shift some aviation operations to Libya, about 1,500 kilometers to the southwest across the Mediterranean. But it would be more difficult to fly cargo jets all the way from Russia to Libya loaded down with heavy weaponry -- even assuming Russia could secure overflight rights from Turkey. Russian war bloggers have voiced alarmed about the potential loss of Russian bases in Syria. 'Russia's military presence in the Middle East region hangs by a thread,' Rybar, a blogger with links to Defense Ministry, said in a post on Telegram. 'It is almost impossible to evacuate the bases. In the best case, it is possible to evacuate most of the personnel, documentation and serviceable aircraft,' one prominent blogger, named FighterBomber, said in a Telegram post prior to Assad's fall. 'Some equipment that's still running can be packed into dry cargo ships and landing ships, but of course not all. All the rest of the property will remain at the bases.'

Chinese Electric Vehicle Sales In Indonesia Gain On Japanese Domi...	By Ami Afriatni On the streets of Jakarta and other major Indonesian cities, Chinese electric vehicles (EVs) are becoming a familiar sight – a sign of their growing appeal in Southeast Asia’s largest auto market. Chinese brands including Wuling, BYD and Chery are making inroads into Indonesia’s auto industry by offering affordability, cutting-edge technology and design, challenging Japanese stalwarts including Toyota, Honda and Mitsubishi. Indonesia’s EV infrastructure – including charging stations – remains underdeveloped, but the country’s upper-middle class is not daunted by such challenges, said Syakur Usman, an automotive observer and author of The Automotive Industry in Indonesia. 'These are global-minded consumers who frequently travel abroad and are already familiar with EVs,' he said. Though electric vehicles account for just 5% of Indonesia’s total car sales this year so far, analysts see vast potential in a market of over 270 million people where environmental awareness is on the rise. 'Public acceptance of EVs is steadily increasing,' said Muhammad Nur Yuniarto, executive director of the Automotive Control System Center at the Sepuluh Nopember Institute of Technology in Surabaya. 'Initially, there were concerns about battery durability and reliability, but these have been dispelled as EVs have proven reliable and safe for daily use,' he told BenarNews. While Toyota and Daihatsu still hold the top spots, Chinese sales are increasing. BYD has sold over 11,000 vehicles in Indonesia since deliveries began in July. It rose to sixth place in October, with sales that month reaching 2,488 units, according to data from the Indonesian Automotive Industry Association (Gaikindo). Meanwhile, Wuling Motors reported selling 9,000 EVs in 2023. 'BYD’s success in Indonesia as a market leader is a testament to our commitment to providing high-quality, affordable electric vehicles that meet the needs and preferences of Indonesian consumers,' Eagle Zhao, president director of BYD Motor Indonesia, said in a statement last month. The resurgence of Chinese automakers is striking given their rocky start in Indonesia. Early entries in the 2000s struggled with perceptions of poor quality, causing brands such as Chery and Geely to withdraw. But by 2017, companies including Wuling Motors had returned, making local investments including a U.S. $700 million factory near Jakarta. BYD, meanwhile, is building a $1.3 billion factory in West Java, which is expected to produce 150,000 vehicles annually. In addition, Chinese manufacturers have benefited from government incentives aimed at boosting EV adoption. Policies introduced in 2023, including reduced luxury taxes and import duties, have made EVs more accessible. Chinese automakers now command an 80% share of Indonesia’s EV market. This year, the government issued a regulation exempting import duties on completely constructed electric vehicles, spurring a 347% increase in imports, according to Gaikindo. Domestic parts requirements To boost local manufacturing, the government has ordered that 40% of EV parts be domestically produced by 2026 and 80% by 2030. Officials said this shift is crucial to developing Indonesia’s domestic EV ecosystem, creating jobs and growing the local economy. Syakur, the automotive observer, said Chinese companies have leveraged their extensive manufacturing capabilities to dominate the still developing EV industry in Indonesia. 'They aren’t held back by legacy technologies or hesitation,' Syakur told BenarNews, contrasting this with the approach of Japanese brands, which have been slower to embrace EVs. Japanese brands including Toyota and Honda continue to focus on conventional and hybrid vehicles that combine internal combustion engines with batteries. Last month, a Toyota official said the company is focusing on hybrid vehicles in Indonesia. According to him, consumers preferred hybrids over battery electric vehicles. 'Hybrid vehicles are a vital stepping stone in the transition to electrification,' said Bob Azam, deputy president director of PT Toyota Motor Manufacturing Indonesia. 'They need support to help bridge the gap between conventional cars and fully electric models,' he added. In 2025, the government is planning a set of tax incentives with a particular focus on hybrid and other types of vehicles, Industry Minister Agus Gumiwang Kartasasmita said Friday. 'For example, we recently discussed incentives or stimulus for the automotive sector,' Agus told reporters. 'Policies such as luxury goods sales tax and VAT exemptions will be applied not only for electric vehicles but also for hybrids and other types.' Groups like the NGO Walhi have argued that measures to promote EVs such as subsidies and tax incentives fail to address the broader sources of the environmental crisis, including the continued use of coal-fired power plants, industrial emissions and waste-burning practices. The focus on EVs also overlooks impactful solutions such as improving public transportation systems. Competitive pricing Airlangga Hartanto, the country’s top economic minister, urged automakers to make EVs more affordable. 'Prices must become more competitive for the market to absorb them,' Airlangga said this month. China’s Wuling Air EV, priced at around 200 million rupiah ($12,600), caters to the middle class, while the BYD Dolphin at $22,812 and the Chery Omoda E5 at $26,250 attracts wealthier buyers. By contrast, Toyota’s bZ4X and European brands such as BMW remain prohibitively expensive, according to authorities. Bany Akbar, 45, a Jakarta office worker, has owned an Air EV for 18 months. He said he has specific needs including school drop-offs and weekday commutes. 'It’s my second car,' he told BenarNews. 'The price was reasonable, and it suited our needs.'

Not As Simple As 1, 2, 3: Humanity Has A Surprisingly Diverse Und...	Numeracy or numerosity, the ability to think about and use numbers, varies among human cultures and within populations, much like intelligence does. Many known languages, for example, have no words for numerals above 2 or 3. A linguist who curated a database of the world's languages in 2015 estimated that of the 6,880 languages for which there are published data on numerals, 1,093 had a counting system that ends at 2 or 3. Compare that lack of a developed counting system to today's technologically complex societies, where the average person encounters about 1,000 numbers an hour in daily life, as estimated by cognitive neuroscientist Brian Butterworth, professor emeritus at University College London. At a simple level, we keep time, keep a calendar, memorize addresses and phone numbers, and at a more complex level, we calculate interest rates and stock valuations, election vote percentages, temperatures and rain accumulations, missile trajectories, and astronomical relationships. Cultures With Restricted Numeracy What does a culture with a restricted number system look like? Early reports of this came from 16th-century explorers, who described the hunter-gatherer tribes they found, for example, the Taino and Tupinambá in the Americas. Anthropologists later documented hundreds of other societies that only used numbers up to 2 or 3. Today, the Pirahã in Brazil are 'the only known tribe/people whose language and culture appear not to have progressed beyond an analog notion of magnitude, similar to that of higher animals,' an applied mathematician wrote in 2023 in his review of prehistoric mathematics origins. The cultural reason suggested for this is that the Pirahã 'reject the value of future planning and are completely non-materialistic.' Anthropologist Caleb Everett, the son of missionaries who lived with the Pirahã in his youth, describes the tribe as 'cognitively normal and well-adapted' to their environment, with a 'superior understanding' of their river ecology. The Pirahã number about 700 people and live in very small villages along the Maici River, a small tributary of the Amazon. They are semi-nomadic and thus have regular contact with outsiders. A comprehensive 2011 review of Pirahã numeracy described experiments in two Pirahã villages to test whether tribal individuals could match quantities larger than 3, which is where their number system ends. Matching consisted of selecting how many empty rubber balloons would match three spools of thread in various arrangements. Everett and co-author Keren Madora reviewed previous research on the Pirahã and numeracy that had contradictory results about the Pirahã ability to make one-to-one number correspondence for quantities greater than 3. The reason, Everett and Madora suggested, is that the Pirahã have no number words for integers more than 3. They based their conclusion on fieldwork that Madora did with the Pirahã. Madora, who has 30 years of experience speaking the Pirahã language, spent months in one village, and at the request of the Pirahã, taught them basic arithmetic. To do this, she invented words for numbers 4 through 10, based on their existing word for hand. After becoming familiar with the new number words, the research review stated that the Pirahã demonstrated 'heightened performance on the one-to-one matching task.' The researchers concluded that exact recognition of quantities greater than 3 'relies on a culturally constructed conceptual tool, namely precise number terminology, which is not universal to all human societies.' The Brain and Numbers The fact that members of a society with a restricted number system could accurately work with numbers larger than three when adult individuals were taught new words for larger numbers indicates both the importance of a language for numbers and the inherent ability of the human brain to develop. Perhaps there is a capacity for numeracy, whether or not it is developed across all human cultures and within cultures. Studies of the brain and numeracy may provide evidence of whether a capacity for numeracy is universal, even when a language for numbers is not. Today advanced imaging technologies, including magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and other neuro-imaging methods, can help assess the capacity for numeracy by identifying the brain cortex areas and neural networks associated with specific skills in math competence. A 2023 review of the neural bases of math competence proposed that a 'distributed and interconnected network of regions across the brain, primarily focused on frontal and parietal cortices' is key for complex math skills. The frontoparietal area of the brain is generally the control network responsible for coordinating goal-directed tasks. For adolescents with better math ability, the review reported that gray matter volume in the frontoparietal area is important, as is the thinning of the cortex and having a larger frontoparietal network surface. The authors of the review also emphasized that 'cortical plasticity' in childhood makes it an important time for math training. The authors noted that although the number of studies investigating the effects of short-term math training on children is 'scarce,' the existing studies demonstrate that proper training improves 'neural processing and function.' They also cited one study that 'showed that aerobic fitness training could improve children's math learning outcomes via cortical thinning.' Overall, studies show that math training improves neural efficiency in math, and over time, makes specific math tasks more automatic. Not surprisingly, math skills were associated with general intelligence, reading capability, and cognitive ability. More studies are needed, the review concluded, to examine specific neural connections in math abilities. Importantly, the authors also cautioned that the present studies' conclusions don't permit 'causal relations' between brain structure and math abilities, only correlations. What Are Numbers and Which Species Can Count? A continuing controversy in the study of numeracy is whether number sense precedes language historically, or vice versa. Another debated question is whether number literacy is the basis for abstract thinking. Homo sapiens may be the only species with symbolic thinking, but research has demonstrated that many animal species can count and that the neural mechanisms involved may be similar to those of humans. As one specialist in psychology and language described it, 'animals are mathematically inclined, but only to a certain degree.' This researcher noted, for example, that monkeys could remember and compare sets of numbers (performing similarly to young children) and could learn the meaning of Arabic numerals. Comparing numbers is important for animal survival. 'Any creature that can tell the difference between a tree with 10 pieces of fruit from another with only six pieces, or between two predators and three on the horizon, has a better chance of surviving and reproducing,' the researcher commented. It's not only primates that can perform numerical comparisons: Studies have shown that other mammals (including dogs, cats, rodents, and dolphins) and some species of fish, birds, reptiles, and amphibians can also discriminate between numbers to varying degrees. A detailed 2021 neuroscience reviewof 'how evolution shaped different animal brains to process numerical information' points out what is now known and the research needed. From Restricted Numeracy to Calculus How Homo sapiens evolved from having rudimentary numeracy to using calculus is a fascinating question. Did numeracy start with our hands and feet, as some linguists, anthropologists, and others suggest? Most of the world's number systems use multiples of base 5, 10, or 20—corresponding to the number of fingers on one hand, two hands, plus the toes on both feet. The word 'five' in many languages is derived from the word for 'hand,' Everett wrote. Others argue that numeracy is inherently abstract. University of Bologna philologists Miguel Valério and Silvia Ferrara wrote in 2020, 'Linguistic evidence does not support an evolution of numbers from concrete to abstract. There is no evidence that early numbers were conceived as fused with counted objects.' The authors reviewed the early Mesopotamian development of language and counting, as well as that of other ancient cultures where writing might have been independently invented and concluded that numbers were 'always abstract.' The convergence of number development and writing, they wrote, 'pivots on the appearance of power-based systems of number notation.' In other words, a system of notating numbers came into being using a number base and its powers and this coincides with the beginning of writing in Mesopotamia. Further evidence to support the argument that numeracy is abstract comes from experiments with newborn infants. An international group of researchers, writing in 2008, showed that newborns 'spontaneously associate stationary, visual-spatial arrays of 4–18 objects with auditory sequences of events on the basis of number.' In other words, the infants recognize and compare numbers when they hear and see them. The experiments familiarized the infants with a particular sequence of sounds or images and then measured the length of their gaze when presented with matching or non-matching sequences. The infants looked longer at the matching sequences. The authors concluded: 'Their performance provides evidence for abstract numerical representations at the start of postnatal experience.' An Open Field of Study Many fascinating questions remain in the study of numerosity in humans and animals in addition to those discussed here. For example, did numerosity lead to the cognitive basis for abstractive and symbolic thinking? Or what role did plants play in the human development of mathematics? Finally, some of the research on this subject is quite practical: It can have immediate application to helping children and adults with math learning difficulties, so that fewer people will be able to say, 'I'm not good at math.'

Chilling Warnings For Syria: When Foreign Interventions Go Bad – ...	The reports through Western presses read rather familiarly. Joyful residents taking selfies on abandoned, sullen tanks. Armed men ebullient and shooting into the sky with adventurist stupidity. The removal of statues and vulgar reminders of a regime. Prisoners freed; torture prisons emptied. The tyrant, deposed. This is the scene in Syria, a war with more external backers and sponsors than causes. The terrain for some years had been rococo in complexity: Russia, Iran and Shia militants in one bolstering camp; Gulf states and Turkey pushing their own mixture of Sunni cause and disruption in another; and the US throwing in its lot behind the Kurdish backed People’s Protection Units (YPG). Even this schema is simplified. While there will be an innumerable number of those delighted at the fall of Bashar al-Assad, the end of the Arab socialist Baathist regime provides much rich food for thought. Already, the whitewash and publicity relations teams are doing the rounds, suggesting that we are seeing a sound, balanced group of combatants that will ensure a smooth transition to stable rule. Little thought is given to the motley collection of rebels who might, at any moment, seek retribution or turn on each other, be they members of the Turkish-backed Syrian National Army (SNA), or those from the largest, most noted group, Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS). There is little mention, for instance, about the blotted resume of the aspiring usurper, Abu Mohammad Al-Jolani, who retains a bounty of US$10 million for information on his whereabouts and capture by US authorities. Human rights activist and former British diplomat Craig Murray helpfully posted a link from the US embassy in Syria from 2017, with the blood red title 'Stop This Terrorist'. As he acidly notes, 'You might want to retweet this before they delete it.' When foreign powers meddle, particularly in the Middle East, the result is very often a cure worse than the disease. The billowy rhetoric follows a template: evil dictators, oppressors of their people, finally get their just desserts at the hands of a clearly demarcated, popular insurrection, helped along, naturally, by the world’s freedom lovers and democracy hailers. That those same freedom loving powers tolerated, traded and sponsored those same despots when it was convenient to do so is a matter confined to amnesia and the archives. A few examples suffice. The scene in Libya in the immediate aftermath of the 2011 NATO intervention that overthrew Muammar al-Gaddafi saw commentary of delight, relief and hope. New prospects were in the offing, especially with the news of his brutal murder. 'For four decades the Gaddafi regime ruled the Libyan people with an iron fist,' stated US President Barack Obama. 'Basic human rights were denied, innocent civilians were detained, beaten and killed.' At the end of the regime, Obama confidently claimed that the new administration was 'consolidating their control over the country and one of the world’s longest serving dictators is no more.' UK Prime Minister David Cameron struck the same note. 'Today is a day to remember all of Colonel Gaddafi’s victims.' Libyans 'have an even greater chance, after this news, of building themselves a strong and democratic future.' French President Nicolas Sarkozy chose to see the overthrow of Gaddafi as the result of a unified, uniform resistance from 'the Libyan people' who emancipated 'themselves from the dictatorial and violent regime imposed on them for more than 40 years.' What followed was not stability, consolidation and democratic development. Jihadi fundamentalism exploded with paroxysms of zeal. The patchwork of unsupervised and anarchically disposed militia groups, aided by NATO’s intervention, got busy. Killings, torture, enforced disappearances, forced displacement and abductions became common fare. The country was nigh dismembered, fragmenting from 2014 onwards between rival coalitions backed by different foreign powers. The same gruesome pattern could also be seen in the post-Saddam Hussein Iraq of 2003. It began with a US-led invasion based on sham premises: Weapons of Mass Destruction that were never found. It also resulted in the overthrow of another Arab socialist Baathist regime. Statues were toppled. There was much celebration and looting. Even before the invasion in March that year, US President George W. Bush was airily declaring that 'a new regime in Iraq would serve as a dramatic and inspiring example of freedom for other nations in the region.' In November 2004, Bush would dreamily state that the US and Britain 'have shown our determination to help Iraqis achieve their liberty and to defend the security of the world.' The consequences of the invasion: the effective balkanisation of Iraq aided by the banning of the Baath Party and the disbanding of the Iraqi Army; the murderous split between Sunni and Shia groups long held in check by Saddam with Kurdish rebels also staking their claim; the emergence of Iran as a regional power of significance; the continued thriving of al-Qaeda and the emergence of the caliphate-inspired Islamic State (ISIS/ISIL) group. Even as the body count was rising in 2006, Britain’s Prime Minister Tony Blair was still fantasising about the political wishes of a country he had been so instrumental in destroying. 'This is a child of democracy struggling to be born,' he told a gathering at Georgetown University in May that year with evangelical purpose. 'The struggle for Iraqis for democracy should unite them.' The unfolding disasters were mere 'setbacks and missteps'. Blair continued to 'strongly believe we did and are doing the right thing.' And so, we see the same pieties, the same reassurances, the same promises, played on a sedating loop regarding Syria’s fate, the promise of democratic healing, the transfiguration of a traumatised society. How long will such prisons as Sednaya remain unfilled? Therein lies the danger, and the pity.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfDHDLflDWSKYbYF3KCAszo	2024-12-09T16:58:19-08:00	
India And Bangladesh Begin Mending Fences – Analysis	I have underlined today India's desire to work closely with the interim government of Bangladesh authorities,' said Indian Foreign Secretary Vikram Misri after talks with his Bangladeshi counterparty Md.Jashim Uddin in Dhaka on Monday. Indian Foreign Secretary Vikram Misri and his Bangladeshi counterpart, Md. Jashim Uddin, who met in Dhaka on Monday, voiced the concerns of their countries but at the same time expressed a desire to continue bilateral cooperation and people-to-people ties. According to sources in Dhaka, Misri's talks with Jashim Uddin have prepared the ground for a political rapprochement between the estranged neighbours. Both sides expressed a desire to continue bilateral cooperation in development works and also to promote strong people-to-people ties that had benefited both countries until a rupture occurred following a mass movement which ousted the pro-Indian Bangladesh Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina on August 5. Though described as being part of a regular 'structured dialogue' between the two countries, Vikram Misri's engagement with the Interim Government in Dhaka was basically a fire fighting exercise as bilateral relations were suffering due to incendiary statements and actions of groups on both sides with a political axe to grind. After his meeting with his Bangladeshi counterpart, the Indian Foreign Secretary Misri said that the close relationship between the two countries 'is reflected on a daily basis with development projects that have been executed on the ground in Bangladesh and that continue to be developed.' 'The close relationship is also reflected in the mutually beneficial engagement we have on a whole set of issues ranging from trade, commerce, connectivity, power, water, energy, development and other areas of cooperation.' 'There is no reason why this mutually beneficial relationship should not continue to develop in the interest of our people. To that end, therefore, I have underlined today India's desire to work closely with the interim government of Bangladesh authorities,' Misri said. Concerns Expressed In the free and frank interaction, both sides expressed their pressing concerns. The Indian foreign secretary said: 'We also had the opportunity to discuss certain developments and issues and I conveyed our concerns, including those related to the safety, security and welfare of the minorities.' He was referring to some regrettable incidents of attacks on cultural, religious and other properties in Bangladesh. 'We expect an overall constructive approach on all these issues by the Bangladesh authorities and we look forward to moving the relationship forward in a positive, forward looking and constructive direction.' 'Today's discussions have given both of us the opportunity to take stock of our relations, and I appreciate the opportunity today to have had a frank, candid and constructive exchange of views with all my interlocutors.' 'I emphasised on a positive, constructive and mutually beneficial relationship with Bangladesh,' Misri said. He further said that India has always seen, and will continue to see in the future, the Indian-Bangladesh relationship as a people-centric and people-oriented relationship—one that has the benefits of all the people as it's central motivational force. Bangladesh Raises Sovereignty Issue The Bangladesh Foreign Secretary Jashim Uddin told journalists that Dhaka asked New Delhi not to interfere in Bangladesh's internal affairs. 'We said people of all religions in Bangladesh freely practice their faiths. This is our internal affair. It is not expected (of other countries) to make comments on our internal affairs. We don't do it for other countries.' Reasons for Standoff After Sheikh Hasina was ousted from the Premiership of Bangladesh and was forced to flee to India on August 5, India-Bangladesh relations went down the chute. It went further down consistently since then, with serious charges being bandied about by both sides, not officially, but by loud mouths in political parties and YouTube channels. Demonstrations were held in various cities in both countries queering the pitch and adding fuel to the fire. Interested parties in India have, for their own narrow political gain, interpreted the July-August student-led mass movement against Hasina's oppressive rule as a movement against the Hindu minority in Bangladesh and also against India with which the Hindus have been unfairly bracketed. On the Bangladesh side, radical Islamic forces like the Jamaat-e-Islami and Hefazat-i-Islam saw in the July-August political crisis and its uncertain aftermath, an ideal opportunity to attack the Hindus who they dubbed as infidels deserving only a subordinate place in an 'Muslim' Bangladesh. Thus, a popular, though violent, movement, against a dictatorial ruler, turned out to be a Hindu-Muslim and an India-Bangladesh conflict. The crisis has made the Hindus of Bangladesh (who are 8% of the 170 million Bangladeshis), fear attacks from the Muslim side. Indeed, a large number of Hindu properties and even temples were vandalized by Islamic zealots and anti-Awami League hot heads. And the Muslim majority feared an Indian attempt to twist the arms of the weak Interim Government of Prof. Muhammad Yunus to restore Hasina's rule. This was based on a popular belief in Bangladesh that Hasina was powerful for 15 years because she had India's full backing. Hackles went up in New Delhi when the Bangladeshi authorities said that Hasina would be extradited from India and tried in the International Criminal Court (ICC) at the Hague. Forces opposed to Hasina saw her relations with India during her 15-year tenure as having been patently asymmetrical and skewed in favour of powerful India. But those of this view had turned a blind eye to the fact that Bangladesh too had gained a lot from close ties with India. Bangladesh would not have been able to grow and even survive without close economic and people to people ties with India. Bangladesh is surrounded on three sides by India and the Bay of Bengal in the fourth side. Many commodities of common use are available in Bangladesh at reasonable prices thanks to trade with India. India is the main medical treatment destination for middle class Bangladeshis. Geopolitical Dimension The crisis had acquired geopolitical dimensions as well. Among Indians, the attacks on the Hindus in Bangladesh rekindled fears of rising radical Islam. They rekindled Islamophobia in the West. Some British MPs condemned the attacks on the Hindus in Bangladesh. US President-elect Donald Trump stung Bangladeshis by his condemnation of the attacks on Hindus on October 31. Bangladeshis saw a US-India axis emerging to thwart the August 5 regime change. On the other hand, Indians tended to see the ouster of Hasina as a 'Pakistani-US plot' aimed at ending India's monopoly of influence over Bangladesh. When Bangladesh eased visa procedures for Pakistanis and improved trade with Pakistan, India smelt an anti-India axis emerging. The India-Bangladesh conflict is being exacerbated by unverified reports of India deploying troops on the border and Bangladesh using Turkish drones over the border. There were attacks on the Bangladesh mission in Tripura and demonstrations in Dhaka against the Indian mission. Bangladeshi and Indian flags were burnt. For Indian Hindus, the latest provocation has been the arrest of a Hindu monk, Chinmoy Krishna Das Sammilita Sanatani Jote, on 'sedition' charges and the denial of bail to him. There was intense propaganda in India that Chinmoy Das is a member of the renowned International Society of Krishna Consciousness (ISKCON). It was alleged that Chinmoy has no lawyer to defend him because they were beaten up. India called for a fair trial. However, ISKCON's international spokesman monk Devshekhar Das told The Week that Chinmoy Das did not belong to ISKCON. He had left the organization some months ago to start his own outfit. Earlier, ISKCON Bangladesh had publicly stated that Chinmoy Das was sacked in July for child abuse. Chinmoy Das's issue is of immediate importance politically. There is a Hindu nationalistic government firmly ensconced in New Delhi for which the Hindus are the core political constituency. And the brand 'ISKCON' is highly valued in India, though in this case ISKCON is not actually involved, as its spokesman Deveshekhar Das stated. Businesses to the Rescue However, in the midst of gloom, there was light at the end of the tunnel. The business community both in India and Bangladesh pressed the two governments to bury the hatchet and resume normal relations. Reports from India said that businessmen both in retail and in cross border trade, were feeling the pitch after entry and exit points were threatened with closure. The call for a boycott of Bangladeshis by eating houses and hospitals in Tripura and Kolkata had begun to hurt these institutions financially. Eventually, the boycotts were lifted. Indian and Bangladeshi authorities reopened the largest land port between the two countries which connects Petrapole in India and Benapole in Bangladesh. The speedy restoration of trade was a result of the economic interdependence between India and Bangladesh. India is Bangladesh's second-largest trading partner. Bangladesh shares 94% of its 4,367 km-long border with India and it relies on India for many essentials like rice, wheat, cotton, iron and steel, electronic equipment and textiles for its garment industry.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfDHDLflDWSKYLEXa9ku6nd	2024-12-09T16:56:45-08:00	
Myanmar: Rebels Capture Last Military Post On Bangladesh Border	Ethnic minority insurgents have captured the last Myanmar military position on the border with Bangladesh after its defenders, including pro-junta militiamen from the mostly Muslim Rohingya community, abandoned the post and fled, the rebel group and residents said. The Arakan Army, or AA, which is fighting for self-determination in Rakhine state, seized the military stronghold known as Border Guard Post No. 5 near the town of Maungdaw on Sunday, the group said. 'The Arakan army successfully captured and neutralized the last remaining outpost … in the Maungdaw region,' it said in a statement. Junta forces and members of Rohingya militia raised by the junta to battle the AA were trying to flee across the Naf River, which forms the border with Bangladesh, 'using motorboats and canoes' and launching attacks as they did so, the AA said. 'Clashes are still occurring … Therefore, due to military necessities and public security concerns, all river transportation in the Naf River will be indefinitely suspended,' the group said. Residents of Maungdaw said they were worried about the possibility of a navy boat operating offshore opening fire in retaliation for the AA’s capture of the position. 'The AA has captured the entire border with Bangladesh,' said one resident who declined to be identified for safety reasons. 'There’s still one junta navy ship … we need to keep that in mind, they can still shoot pretty far with their cannon.' The junta that seized power with the ouster of an elected government in February 2021 has been pushed back by insurgents in several parts of the country over the past year, raising questions about the sustainability of military rule. The capture of the entire border with Bangladesh by one of Myanmar’s most powerful insurgents armies comes days after ethnic minority Kachin insurgents in northern Myanmar, seized control of all of the border with China where its forces operate. ‘Commander captured’ A source close to the AA said the commander of military operations in the area, Brig. Thurein Tun, was among junta forces captured as they were trying to flee after the fall of the base. 'He was arrested last night on the road that goes down to the river along with his personal staff, majors, captains and senior police officers,' said the source, who also declined to be identified. RFA tried to telephone the AA spokesperson, Khaing Thu Kha, and the junta spokesperson, Maj. Gen. Zaw Min Tun, to ask them about the situation but neither answered calls. Rohingya militia men from groups such as the Rohingya Solidarity Organization, Arakan Rohingya Salvation Army and Arakan Rohingya Army, were among the pro-jutna forces that fled, the AA said. AA fighters were on Monday searching for fleeing junta forces along the Ah Leh Than Kyaw Beach and in various waterways, residents said. The AA draws its support from the state’s Buddhist majority and has a fraught relationship with members of the Muslim minority, particularly since the junta started recruiting Rohingya this year into militias to battle the AA. Human rights investigators said the AA was responsible for killing scores of Rohingya civilians trying to flee from Maungdaw to Bangladesh on Aug. 5, when they were attacked with drones and artillery as the AA intensified its campaign to capture the town. The AA denied responsibility. The AA controls about 80% of Rakhine state – 10 of its 17 townships and one in neighboring Chin state. In townships it does not control, it has pinned junta forces into pockets of territory, such as the state capital, Sittwe, a military headquarters in the town of Ann and the Kyaukpyu economic zone on the coast where China has energy facilities and wants to build a deep-sea port.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfDHDLflDWSKYfoP8GGySvr	2024-12-09T16:51:01-08:00	
India-Myanmar: Simmering Insurgency – Analysis	By Afsara Shaheen On December 3, 2024, the Yung Aung faction of the National Socialist Council of Nagaland-Khaplang (NSCN-K-YA) issued a demand of INR two million from Oil India Limited (OIL), a prominent petroleum company. The extortion note was delivered to the company's office in the Manabhum Reserve in the Lohit District of Arunachal Pradesh, by Tha Aung, an NSCN-K-YA 'major'. The note had set a deadline of December 10, 2024, for the payment. OIL Spokesperson Prankush Malla Buzarbaruah accepted that the company had received the extortion note from the outfit. On November 24, 2024, two civilians - Vignesh Kumar Jha and Bishnu Chetry - were abducted by a heavily armed 10-member NSCN-K-YA group, from a bridge construction site located between Pongchau and Konnu villages in the Longding District of Arunachal Pradesh. Sources disclosed that the group was led by NSCN-K-YA leader Akham Konyak. On October 25, 2024, a clash occurred between the Assam Rifles and NSCN-K-YA in Longding District, in which an NSCN-K-YA cadre was killed. The NSCN-K-YA initiated the attack by firing at the Assam Rifles personnel, while they were moving from Wakka towards the Indo-Myanmar border. On February 18, 2024, 10 workers employed at the Finboro coal mine in Changlang District of Arunachal Pradesh, were abducted by suspected militants of NSCN-K-YA and the Independent faction of United Liberation Front of Asom (ULFA-I), after a failure to meet extortion demands. Sources stated that a group of seven armed militants held the workers at gunpoint and transported them in a dumper truck towards Old Longtoi, a remote location within Arunachal Pradesh. Security forces (SFs) later rescued seven of the 10 miners. Three workers were rescued after several months. According to partial data compiled by the South Asia Terrorism Portal (SATP), there were three NSCN-K-YA-linked incidents of violence in 2024, which included one incident of killing and two of abduction (data till December 8, 2024), resulting in the death of one terrorist. In 2023, there were six such incidents, which included one incident of killing (one civilian), one incident of injury (one militant injured), and four abductions, in which seven persons were abducted. Since August 17, 2018, when the outfit 'officially' came into existence, there have been 27 such incidents, including 15 of killing, nine of abduction (24 persons abducted) and three of injury (two SFs, one civilian and one terrorist). The incidents of killing resulted in the death of 15 persons: two civilians, four SF personnel and nine militants. Some of the incidents of killing, in addition to the one mentioned above, included: December 28, 2023: NSCN-K-YA through a press release, claimed responsibility for the execution of former legislator Yumsen Matey on December 16, 2023, along the Indo-Myanmar border in the Tirap District of Arunachal Pradesh. NSCN-K-YA justified the execution, asserting that Matey was 'awarded capital punishment on 16/12/2023 due to his active involvement in all sorts of anti-NSCN activities.' The insurgent group accused Matey of 'masterminding anti-NSCN propagandas and slogans in Tirap District of Arunachal Pradesh' and of conspiring against the NSCN/Government of the People's Republic of Nagaland (GPRN), the armed wing of the outfit. July 28, 2021: Two NSCN-K-YA militants were gunned down during a search operation in the Kottam Forest area of Tirap District. The two militants fired at SFs when asked to surrender, and were shot dead in retaliatory firing. NSCN was formed in 1980, initially under the leadership of Isak Chishi Swu, Thuingaleng Muivah, and S.S. Khaplang. The organization aimed to establish a 'Greater Nagaland' or 'Nagalim,' a territory that would encompass all Naga-inhabited areas, transcending state and even international boundaries. However, NSCN split in 1988, primarily over ideological and operational differences, giving rise to two factions: NSCN-IM (led by Isak and Muivah) and NSCN-K (under Khaplang). The NSCN-K, with its base largely in Myanmar, pursued a different strategy from that of its India-based counterpart, the NSCN-IM. While the NSCN-IM eventually engaged in peace negotiations with the Indian government, resulting in the 1997 ceasefire and subsequent political dialogue, the NSCN-K maintained its militant stance under Khaplang's leadership for some more time. NSCN-K's militant opposition to compromise stemmed from Khaplang's belief in Naga sovereignty that transcended borders, particularly given his own roots in Myanmar's Naga-inhabited regions. However, Khaplang's militant stance did not last longer and within a month of the Union Government's announcement of a ceasefire with the outfit on November 14, 1998, the NSCK-N declared a ceasefire on December 18, 1998. The ceasefire continued thereafter, and a significant milestone was achieved in April 2001 with the formulation of a 15-point charter of cease-fire ground rules. The peace process culminated in September 2001 with formal talks in Kohima, emphasizing sustained dialogue and mutual cooperation for conflict resolution. However, S.S. Khaplang, the leader of the NSCN-K, unilaterally withdrew from the ceasefire agreement with the Government of India on March 27, 2015. This decision surprised the Indian authorities, as there was no prior official communication. The ceasefire, established in 2001, had been periodically renewed, but Khaplang's withdrawal marked a significant escalation in hostilities, including ambushes and attacks on Indian SFs. Following S.S. Khaplang's death in 2017, the NSCN-K saw internal divisions over leadership and ideological direction. In this environment, Yung Aung, a nephew of Khaplang, rose to prominence, leading a faction that upheld a radical vision for Naga independence. Finally, a splinter faction under Yung Aung - NSCN-K-YA - was formed in 2018. Unlike the faction that sought a ceasefire with the Indian government, Yung Aung's group categorically rejected any peace accords, denouncing them as betrayals of the Naga cause. Yung Aung's ascent reflects a generational shift in the NSCN-K, with younger leaders adopting an uncompromising stance, shaped by a narrative of unrelenting struggle and skepticism toward diplomacy. The Yung Aung faction thus reflects a commitment to armed struggle, paired with its cross-border alliances and anti-establishment rhetoric. By rejecting any formal engagement with the Indian state, the faction seeks to assert its legitimacy and differentiate itself from the NSCN-IM, which it perceives as having 'sold out' through negotiations. Later, differences emerged within the NSCN-K-YA. This division was fueled by dissatisfaction with Yung Aung's leadership, with allegations of mismanagement and policies contrary to the group's principles and resulted in a split within the outfit. 'Major General' (Retd.) Ang Mai, who had previously been expelled from the faction in 2019, was elected as the leader of the new faction during an emergency meeting held on June 27, 2023. His faction criticized the Yung Aung group for isolationist policies, while Yung Aung accused Ang Mai of colluding with the Myanmar military, further straining Naga unity. The Ang Mai faction operates in the border areas between India and Myanmar, primarily in Tirap, Changlang, and Longding Districts of Arunachal Pradesh as well as Mon District of Nagaland in India whereas on the Myanmar side, the Ang Mai faction operates in the Sagaing Region. The Yung Aung faction's ideology is steeped in a sense of historical grievance and the demand for sovereignty. It contends that Naga aspirations cannot be fulfilled within the constitutional framework of India or Myanmar, both of which it views as 'colonial' powers. Unlike the NSCN-IM, which has settled for an autonomy model under Indian federalism, the Yung Aung faction advocates complete secession. Its ideological framework includes elements of nationalism, ethno-political identity, and an aversion to any form of 'integration' with either the Indian or Myanmar state structures. This uncompromising vision is reflected in the faction's modus operandi: maintaining an armed presence across the India-Myanmar border, targeting Indian security forces, and allying with other insurgent groups in the region, including the ULFA-I and the Manipuri insurgent group People's Liberation Army (PLA). Strategically, the faction leverages the geography of Northeast India and Myanmar, operating from remote, forested areas that are difficult for state forces to penetrate. The NSCN-K-YA reportedly has camps in Haukyat, Khanmoi, Lohan, Kamai and Pangsau in the Sagaing Division of Myanmar. These are areas falling along the main locus of operations of the militant group in India - the Tirap, Changlang and Longding Districts of Arunachal Pradesh and the Mon District of Nagaland. This approach enables the faction to sustain its activities and maintain connections with other ethnic armed groups in Myanmar, forming a network of mutual support. The organizational structure of the Yung Aung faction is both hierarchical and decentralized. The leadership under Yung Aung maintains central authority over major decisions; however, field operations are often conducted by semi-autonomous local commanders. This setup allows for flexibility and adaptability in response to SF pressures. The faction's operations frequently involve small, mobile units capable of conducting hit-and-run attacks, ambushes, and other forms of guerrilla warfare, minimizing large-scale confrontations with state forces. A defining characteristic of the Yung Aung faction is its cross-border operational framework. The faction's base in Myanmar allows it to evade Indian security forces, which face jurisdictional constraints. This cross-border refuge also facilitates its alliances with other insurgent groups, including ULFA-I and PLA. These alliances have enhanced its operational capabilities, with support in the form of logistical resources, intelligence, and mutual access to safe havens across borders. The existence of the Yung Aung faction poses a significant challenge to the Naga peace process. While the NSCN-IM's 2015 framework agreement with the Indian government represents a step towards reconciliation, the Yung Aung faction's unyielding stance underscores the limitations of such agreements. As long as factions like NSCN-K-YA continue to operate outside the peace framework, the vision of a comprehensive Naga peace deal will remain elusive. For India, the faction's activities complicate counter-insurgency efforts in the Northeast. The faction's cross-border operations require a coordinated response, involving both Indian and Myanmar authorities. However, the porous nature of the India-Myanmar border, combined with limited state presence in the border regions on Myanmar's side, provide significant operational leeway for the insurgents. Further, the faction's alliances with other militant groups contribute to an interconnected insurgent landscape in the Northeast, creating challenges for regional stability. The NSCN-K-YA's unyielding militancy underscores the fragile nature of the peace processes in Northeast India. Sustainable peace hinges on a unified strategy involving India and Myanmar, recognizing the complexities of the Naga identity and aspirations, and the conflicting ambitions of multiple stakeholders.

The Geopolitics Of Elite Insanity: Teetering On The Brink Of Arma...	As the world simultaneously teeters on the brink of nuclear war in Central Asia, shatters any remaining sense of ‘international justice’ by taking no effective action to halt the televised genocide in Palestine (let alone the risk of a dramatically expanded war in West Asia), and runs headlong into the rapidly advancing technocracy – to nominate just three of the more pronounced threats – the bulk of the human population yawns while they scroll through the latest entries in the various chat groups on their phone. Virtually all of these chat groups (and the channels through which they are distributed), like the ‘news’ distributed by the corporate media through television, radio and newspapers, find an endless sequence of inconsequential issues to distract people from reality. And so our death or transhuman slavery awaits us. As I have explained many times in the past, it is only a rare person who understands how the world works, who orchestrates and drives events, how they do so, and the purposes of their program. For one account of this, see Historical Analysis of the Global Elite: Ransacking the World Economy Until ‘You’ll Own Nothing.’ Consequently, most analysts misconceive what is taking place and, therefore, what is necessary to resist it effectively. Inevitably therefore, the human population continues to be victimized by this program, as has been routinely demonstrated throughout history. Unfortunately, time is now rapidly running out with the Elite program – heavily concealed by this endless barrage of corporate ‘news’, among other techniques (see ‘The Elite’s 5,000-Year War on Your Mind is Climaxing. Can We Defeat it?’) designed to divert attention from the fundamental threats – to depopulate Earth and imprison those left alive in a technocratic ‘smart city’ prison advancing daily. In the latest, most significant development, NATO-produced and guided weapons were fired from Ukraine to attack Russian territory: On 19 & 20 November, U.S. ATACMS (supersonic tactical ballistic) missiles and British ‘Storm Shadow’ (cruise) missiles were used to destroy targets in Russia. In response, and immediately following the latest update of Russian nuclear doctrine – English translation here ‘Full Text of Russia’s Updated Nuclear Doctrine’ and briefly and simply explained by Andrew Korybko here ‘Russia’s Updated Nuke Doctrine Aims To Deter Unacceptable Provocations From NATO’ – Russia fired an ‘experimental’ version of the new hypersonic ‘Oreshnik’ (ICBM) missile (equipped with six independently-targetable warheads, each containing six submunitions) which traveled at Mach 10 (that is, ten times the speed of sound) to destroy the Yuzmash missile factory in the Ukrainian city of Dnipropetrovsk. Among a wide range of expert commentaries expressing grave concern, including because of the latest update of NATO strategy – see ‘NATO After the Washington Summit: Future-Proofing the Alliance and Supporting Ukraine until Victory: Resolution 494’ – see Scott Ritter’s ‘On the Brink’, Drago Bosnic’s ‘Nukes and medium-range missiles for Neo-Nazi junta, perfect recipe for WW3’ and watch Colonel Doug Macgregor’s recent interview ‘How Close Are We to WWIII?’ And geostrategic analyst Drago Bosnic specifically draws attention to the lack of evidence that President Biden has officially authorized the delivery of US nuclear weapons for use by Ukraine despite the fact that prominent media outlets, starting with the New York Times, have indicated, without offering any evidence, that this has taken place. Watch ‘Say No to Nuclear War! Peace on the Planet’. So while we can speculate about the identity of the person or persons responsible for such a decision, assuming it has been made, it simply highlights the point that those we believe are in control are not, in fact, in control. The Elite is scripting key world events and simply using the chosen puppets in governments, bureaucracies, international organizations and the media to offer an endlessly disconnected sequence of actions and announcements so that most people are confused and left unable, even if inclined to do so, to act decisively and effectively. Two factors seriously complicating this conflict are that Russia appears to possess at least one type of weapon and a weapon delivery system that can generate the equivalent damage as the blast impacts of a nuclear weapon but without the massively damaging heat and deadly radioactive fallout of nuclear weapons. This means that the damage can be ‘contained’ to a precise, if very large, target. And delivery of the weapon cannot be intercepted. The destructive power of this weapon, based on the descriptions offered by Ritter in his articles ‘On the Brink’ cited above and ‘Fahrenheit 7232’ – ‘Each war head in turn contained six separate submunitions, consisting of metal slugs forged from exotic alloys that enabled them to maintain their form during the extreme heat generated by hypersonic re-entry speeds. These slugs are not explosive; rather they use the combined effects of the kinetic impact at high speed and the extreme heat absorbed by the exotic alloy to destroy their intended target on impact.’ – suggests a substantially scaled-down version of the geoengineering weapon known as a ‘Rod from God’. Unlike the original version of this weapon, this Russian weapon was delivered using a hypersonic missile and fired against its target as a cluster of ‘smaller’ weapons. The geoengineering version of this weapon was fired from a satellite and used to generate the earthquake in Turkey and Syria in February 2023. It was thoughtfully described by the head of the Turkish Space Agency, Serdar Hussein Yildirim here, but earlier description of these Hypervelocity Rod Bundles (‘Rods from God’) are available in US military literature and elsewhere. See, for example, the U.S. Air Force ‘Transformation Flight Plan’ with the subject simply discussed in ‘Hypervelocity Rod Bundles’. Separately from its destructive power, the delivery system for this Russian weapon was the Oreshnik missile, which is hypersonic. It can travel at speeds up to Mach 10 and it cannot be intercepted with any existing technology, as was made clear by Russia’s President Vladimir Putin in his official statement following the strike. See ‘Statement by the President of the Russian Federation’ [re firing of the Oreshnik missile on 20 Nov 2024]. So while Russia has recently updated its nuclear doctrine to allow a lower threshold for the use of nuclear weapons, it has already developed, deployed and used a non-nuclear technology that can, by using modest quantities of the weapon, replicate the blast impact of a nuclear weapon and be delivered at breathtaking speed. The fundamental complication of this state of affairs is that the United States does not have weapons with equivalent capacities so it is more likely to resort to the use of nuclear weapons despite the fact that their impacts are far from ‘clean’, relatively confined or even short-lived. Consequently, the world stands at a dangerous turning point. This is particularly because the Elite orchestrating this and other critical conflicts is insane, as I have explained many times previously – see ‘The Global Elite is Insane Revisited’ – and most of their agents throughout governments and key international organizations are likewise insane, with many even holding fundamentalist or otherwise extreme beliefs (as one aspect of their insanity). One variation of this insanity is those people sometimes labeled ‘Armageddonists’ – people who believe, as indicated by this comment to Professor Bernard Lown by a senior US State Department official in 1998, ‘if there is a nuclear war, we will be the first ones to rise up and meet Jesus in the sky’. When Lown queried the official about whether anyone else in the US State Department felt the same way, the official replied: ‘Oh yes, many of us do.’ Quotes cited in ‘Iran: The Road to Armageddon? Would the US Administration really endanger the Entire planet?’ If you are unfamiliar with the damage that a nuclear weapon can do, this 18-minute video will make it clear enough: ‘The True Scale of Modern Nuclear Weapons’. And Annie Jacobsen’s latest book makes it clear too: Nuclear War: A Scenario. But, I want to emphasize yet again, whether or not the war in Central Asia goes nuclear (or the Israeli genocide of the Palestinians and war against its Arab/Persian neighbours in West Asia goes the same way), a wide range of Elite objectives in relation to its genocidal and transhumanist/technocratic program is being fulfilled and no amount of complaining about it, signing petitions or statements, lobbying of Elite agents in governments and international organizations, or demonstrating on the streets can make a difference. For a fuller explanation, see ‘The Elite Coup to Kill or Enslave Us: Why Can’t Governments, Legal Actions and Protests Stop Them?’ So I can only encourage any reader to have a ponder about the dangerous predicament in which we find ourselves and to seriously consider participating in comprehensive grassroots nonviolent strategies to halt the war in Central Asia, end the genocide against the Palestinians and defeat the advancing technocracy. In the following articles, I have explained the Elite program that drives each of these conflicts. Crucially, I have explained (or linked to) the nonviolent strategies necessary to end each of them. Strategies to address many other threats have already been elaborated elsewhere or in some cases (including geoengineering and synthetic biology) are being developed. ‘The War in Ukraine: Understanding and Resisting the Global Elite’s Deeper Agenda’which references a list of Strategic Goals for a Nonviolent Struggle to End a War. ‘Nonviolent Strategy to Halt the Genocide in Gaza, Liberate Palestine and Defeat the Global Technocracy’. ‘Fighting for Our Humanity, Fighting for Our Future’. Each article also links to the ‘We Are Human We Are Free’ campaign – which identifies the strategic action necessary to defend yourself from the advancing technocracy (explained, most simply, on the ‘We Are Human We Are Free’ one-page flyer, available in 23 languages). As the title of the last article suggests, there is an monumental amount at stake and it is going to take enormous effort by a substantial number of people to defend human life and a life worth living. And yet, despite the enormity of these threats, there no effective resistance to the threat of nuclear war, the rapidly advancing technocracy or even the televised genocide in Gaza. Why? The Other Side of the Coin This is because there is an even bigger hurdle that must be overcome for effective resistance to manifest. Most ‘ordinary’ people are trapped in a childhood version of submissive obedience. That is, most adults are incapable of doing anything beyond the adult equivalent of the powerless complaining about an injustice that they learned to do as a child. After all, whether or not it is consciously realized by any adult, the primary purpose of ‘socialization’ generally and punishment specifically is to terrorize the child into submissive obedience of ‘higher authorities’ in the child’s life: parents, teachers and religious figures. This is done so that the future adult will be submissively obedient to employers, the legal system and other state actors as well as (for some) military officers. See ‘Punishment is Violent and Counterproductive’. Overwhelmed by the deluge of ‘visible’, ‘invisible’ and ‘utterly invisible’ violence inflicted on them during childhood – see ‘Why Violence?’ and ‘Fearless Psychology and Fearful Psychology: Principles and Practice’ – the child ultimately learns that powerless complaining to their perpetrators is the limit of their permissible ‘action’. Consequently, the typical adult is submissively obedient and confines their ‘action’ to the adult equivalents of complaining such as signing a petition or letter of complaint to a higher authority (often a government), lobbying a politician or attending a protest gathering. Their fear ensures that the idea of taking strategically powerful action never even occurs to them or, in the case of the person to whom the idea occurs or is presented, is quickly discarded from thought and memory. In essence, effective resistance requires strategically-oriented action and that is inherently frightening to most people. It is ‘safer’ to do something ineffective (that is, confined within the ‘permissible’ range) rather than to take action that will make a difference but likely incur punishment (such as a fine or prison sentence for civil disobedience). Conclusion Major international processes and events are driven by the Global Elite which is insane. While the Elite remains largely hidden from view, their equally insane or submissively obedient agents in international organizations, governments, corporations and non-government organizations carry out their insane will. At the moment, this includes driving the world to the brink (and possibly over the brink) of nuclear war, against a backdrop of the rapidly advancing technocracy and the genocide in Gaza. And while there is zero effective resistance to any of these threats – even with much hang-wringing in some quarters – the Elite program proceeds unimpeded. So if you are not taking action that is going to make a strategic difference, I can only encourage you to do so – perhaps as part of a group so that your fear might be contained – while there is still time to defend a life worth living, both for ourselves and others.

Syrian Rebel Leader, Outgoing PM Discuss ‘Transfer Of Power’	Syrian rebels say leader Abu Mohammed al-Golani met for the first time Monday with the outgoing prime minister following the lightning advance by rebels who ousted President Bashar Assad. A statement posted on the rebels' Telegram channels said Golani met with Mohammed Ghazi Jalali to 'coordinate a transfer of power.' Jalali told Sky News Arabia TV on Monday, 'We are working so that the transitional period is quick and smooth.' He said most Cabinet ministers are still working from offices in Damascus. However, the U.N. resident and humanitarian coordinator for Syria, Adam Abdelmoula, told The Associated Press that some key government services had shut down as anxious state workers stayed home. The U.N. Security Council scheduled closed-door talks Monday on the situation in Syria. Russia, which provided military assistance to Assad during the nearly 14-year Syrian civil war, requested the Security Council session to discuss the developments, including the potential implications on the U.N.’s peacekeeping mission in the Golan Heights. Many questions remained Monday about who will lead Syria and how the country will try to recover after years of war and more than five decades under the rule of the Assad family. Israeli troops deployed Sunday to the U.N.-monitored buffer zone in the Golan Heights, with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu saying the move was necessary to protect Israelis after Syrian forces abandoned their positions. Israeli Foreign Minister Gideon Saar said Monday it was a 'limited, temporary' step. Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov told reporters Monday that Russian President Vladimir Putin decided to grant asylum to Assad. Peskov said there were no plans for Putin to meet with Assad, and he declined to comment on Assad’s location. Russian news agencies said Sunday that Assad and his family had arrived in Moscow. Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan said his country hopes for a 'new Syria' that has good relations with its neighbors and helps bring regional stability. 'We expect international actors, especially the United Nations, to reach out to the Syrian people and support the establishment of an inclusive administration,' Fidan said in a speech to ambassadors. A spokesperson for China’s foreign ministry said Monday that China was watching the developments in Syria and that the 'future and destiny of Syria should be decided by the Syrian people.' U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said in a statement late Sunday that the United States will be 'closely monitoring developments as they unfold and engaging with our partners in the region.' 'The United States strongly supports a peaceful transition of power to an accountable Syrian government through an inclusive Syrian-led process,' Blinken said. 'During this transitional period, the Syrian people have every right to demand the preservation of state institutions, the resumption of key services, and the protection of vulnerable communities.' Blinken said the United States will support international efforts to hold Assad and others accountable for abuses against the Syrian people and detention of civilians such as U.S. journalist Austin Tice. Assad was accused of war crimes and crimes against humanity during the country’s civil war, including a 2013 chemical weapons attack on the outskirts of Damascus. More than half a million Syrians died in the war, and the conflict displaced at least half the country’s pre-war population of 22 million people. Assad’s fall prompted crowds to gather and celebrate in Damascus and elsewhere. Rebels opened prisons where the Assad government held thousands of people as part of its crackdown against the uprising that began in 2011 against his rule. There was continued focus Monday on the Saydnaya prison outside of Damascus, where the White Helmets rescue organization said it deployed teams to search for potential hidden, underground cells where people may still be held. Assad’s downfall was stunningly quick, with the rebels capturing the cities of Aleppo, Hama and Homs in a matter of days as the Syrian army ended any opposition. The rebels are led by the Hayat Tahrir al-Sham group (HTS) which has its origins in al-Qaida and is considered a terrorist organization by the United States and the United Nations. Golani is a former al-Qaida commander who cut ties with the group years ago and says he embraces pluralism and religious tolerance. Syria still faces divides, with Turkey-backed opposition fighters battling U.S.-allied Kurdish forces in the north, and the Islamic State group still active in some remote areas.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfDHDLflDWSKYkRYL6TkpJg	2024-12-09T16:43:25-08:00	
Hanukah And The Origins Of Religious Martyrdom – OpEd	Rabbi Marty Lockshin points out that while Hanukah celebrates the miraculous military victories of the 'few over the many,' and of Jewish religion over Greek culture; Hanukah has also given us a new genre of Jewish literature, one that has been in frequent use ever since: Religious Martyrdom. The original martyrdom accounts like those of 'Channa' and her seven sons spawned more in this genre: most famously the story of the ten rabbis who were martyred in the 2nd century C.E., a story featured in the liturgy of the Ninth of Av and Yom Kippur. Martyrdom stories remained popular in Jewish circles through the ages for the sad reason that Jews often found themselves in similar situations, having to decide whether to give up their lives or their religion. The events of the four books about the Maccabees' victories over the Syrian-Greeks are not found in the Hebrew Bible. But the books of the Maccabees, now found in the Apocrypha, were written by proud Jews with strong commitment to Jewish values and observance. Even if these books are not 'holy,' they represent what many loyal Jews were thinking between the middle of 2nd century B.C.E. and the end of the 1st century C.E. In these books, descriptions of glorious victories are mixed with tales of failures and of heroes dying in battle. In the 1 Maccabees chapter 6, Eleazar, the brother of Judah the Maccabee, 'win for himself an everlasting name' by dying heroically: 1 Maccabees 6:40 states: 'Now a part of the king's army was spread out on the high hills, and some troops were on the plain, and they advanced steadily and in good order. 6:41 All who heard the noise made by their multitude, by the marching of the multitude and the clanking of their arms, trembled, for the army was very large and strong. 6:42 But Judas and his army advanced to the battle, and six hundred of the king's army fell. 6:43 Now Eleazar, called Avaran, saw that one of the animals was equipped with royal armor. It was taller than all the others, and he supposed that the king was on it. 6:44 So he gave his life to save his people and to win for himself an everlasting name. 6:45 He courageously ran into the midst of the phalanx to reach it; he killed men right and left, and they parted before him on both sides. 6:46 He got under the elephant, stabbed it from beneath, and killed it; but it fell to the ground upon him and he died.' Eleazar's death is not attributed to any sin that he committed, but to his brave action and his willingness to risk almost certain death. He did not immediately accomplish any military gain: in the continuation of the story, 'when the Jews saw the royal might and the fierce attack of the forces, they turned away in flight.' Still, the author sees Eleazar's actions as heroic and worthy of emulation. No narrative like this martyrdom account appears in the Hebrew Bible. The most famous martyrdom story in the four books of the Maccabees is 'Channa and her seven sons'. The story appears, with significant variations, in many ancient sources (including both 2 Maccabees and 4 Maccabees). In the core story, a tyrannical non-Jewish king gives the seven sons of a woman (usually described as a widow) the choice of transgressing Jewish law (by worshiping idols or eating 'polluted' food) or dying a terrible death. With the encouragement of their mother, all seven sons remain steadfast and are killed by the tyrant. The story was originally told in connection with the events of Chanukah; the tyrant being Antiochus. But in later sources, from the classical rabbinic period, the events take place in the Roman period, as part of the Hadrianic persecutions, three hundred years after the events of Chanukah. In the earliest versions of the story from Maccabees 2 and 4, the woman is not given a name. In the rabbinic text of Eikhah Rabbah (written between the 5th and 7th centuries) she is referred to as Miriam bat Tanhum. In other midrashim, she is called Miriam bat Nahtom. Referring to the woman as Channa, which is ubiquitous in Jewish circles today, originates in Yossipon, a medieval Jewish history book that reworks much material from Josephus, and was probably edited in Italy in the ninth century. By the days of Rabbi Maimonides (1138-1205), the story was well known, and the mother's name was simply assumed to be Channa. In 4 Maccabees, religious martyrdom is the core of the book which praises the martyrs for their loyalty to Judaism and for resisting both the threats of the Syrian-Greek monarch and the attractions of Greek culture. The original martyrdom stories like those of 'Channa and her seven sons' spawned more in this genre: most famously the story of the ten rabbis who were martyred in the 2nd century C.E., which was featured in the liturgy of the Ninth of Av and Yom Kippur. Martyrdom stories remained popular in Jewish circles through the ages for the sad reason that Jews often found themselves in similar situations, having to decide whether to give up their lives or their religion. The dedication and valor of the Maccabees, and all those who joined them in their resistance to the attempt by the ruling powers to force the Jews to abandon their God given religion, and conform to Greek forms of worship and culture. Abandoning circumcision was one example. Those Jews who militantly resisted the pressure to conform to the majority culture were Muslims (Arabic for faithful followers of God's will) and their dedication eventually led to religious freedom and national independence for the oppressed Jews living in the Land of Israel. The oppression of Judaism by Antiochus IV, the Syrian Greek king, was the first known historical attempt at suppressing a minority religion, but unfortunately not the last. Other well known attempts were the three century long Roman persecution of Christianity, and the persecution of Prophet Muhammad and his followers by the majority of pagan Arabs in Makka. Muslims and Jews who celebrate Christmas, deny that they believe Jesus was the Son of God. They just desire to join in the merry mood of Christmas together with their Christian neighbors and friends, most of whom are not church going Christians anyway. But, like Jews who also do the same thing, Muslims are usually ambivalent and defensive about what they are doing. Jews who celebrate Christmas often show their ambivalence by calling their own Christmas tree; a Hanukah bush. Most Jews, who resist the normal desire of both children and adults to fit in and conform to the majority, claim that a Hanukah bush in a Jewish home, is the direct opposite of the Jewish holiday of Hanukah, which celebrates the values of religious freedom and religious diversity. Hanukah, the Hebrew word for Dedication refers both to two things: The rededication of the ancient Temple in Jerusalem after it was profaned in 168 BCE by an idol installed in it by the Syrian Greek king Antiochus IV; and The dedication and valor of the Maccabees, and all those who joined them in their resistance to the attempt by the ruling powers to force the Jews to abandon their God given religion, and conform to Greek forms of worship and culture. Abandoning circumcision was one example. Those Jews who militantly resisted the pressure to conform to the majority culture were Muslims (Arabic for faithful followers of God's will) and their dedication eventually led to religious freedom and national independence for the oppressed Jews living in the Land of Israel. Hanukah is a celebration of religious freedom; especially the freedom of all religious minorities to observe their religious practices with equal treatment and respect. But freedom is not only freedom from oppression. It is also freedom to do the right things, and to become a really good loving person. A free person is not free to oppress, hurt or insult other people or their religious beliefs. Freedom comes from fulfilling your responsibilities to other people, to nature, and to God. I think that this year we need to focus on increasing hope for peace by putting people first and land second and saying: 'From the river to the sea Palestinians and Israelis should be freed from hatred and suffering' with 'a two state for two peoples sharing of the land peacefully solution.' The Qur'an refers to Prophet Abraham as a community or a nation: 'Abraham was a nation/community [Ummah]; dutiful to God, a monotheist [hanif], not one of the polytheists.' (16:120) If Prophet Abraham is an Ummah then fighting between the descendants of Prophets Ishmael and Isaac is a civil war and should always be avoided. 'Lo yisa goy el goy kherev velo yilmedu od milkhama' 'Nation shall not lift sword against nation, neither shall they learn war anymore. (Isaiah 2:4) If all Arabs and Jews can live up to the ideal that 'the descendants of Abraham's sons should never make war against each other' is the will of God; we will help fulfill the 2700 year old vision of Prophet Isaiah: 'In that day there will be a highway from Egypt to Assyria. The Assyrians will go to Egypt, and the Egyptians to Assyria. The Egyptians and Assyrians will worship together. On that day Israel will join a three-party alliance with Egypt and Assyria, a blessing upon the heart. The LORD of Hosts will bless them saying, 'Blessed be Egypt My people, Assyria My handiwork, and Israel My inheritance.'...(Isaiah 19:23-5)	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfDHDLflDWSKajdS2EZun3D	2024-12-09T16:40:50-08:00	
Post-Assad Power Struggle: A New Battle Awaits Syria – OpEd	The watershed moment in Syria with the ousting of Bashar al-Assad has triggered a complex and high-stakes scramble for influence in a region already rife with instability. As Syrian rebel forces have seized Damascus, toppling over more than 50 years of Assad family’s autocratic rule, the implications for regional geopolitics are profound. A newly fragmented Syria presents both opportunity and peril, as regional powers, each with divergent interests, race to reshape the country’s future. Regional Rivalries: A Battle for Influence In this rapidly evolving power vacuum, countries like Saudi Arabia, Egypt, the UAE, Turkey and Qatar will very soon start attempting to assert their influence. Each of these states has its own vision for Syria’s future, guided by broader regional ambitions and ideological leanings. For Egypt and the Gulf monarchies, particularly Saudi Arabia and the UAE, the overriding concern will be preventing the rise of Islamist groups they deem a threat to their political systems. Specifically, the Muslim Brotherhood, long seen as an existential threat by these states, will be at the center of their strategy. Both Saudi Arabia and Egypt, along with the UAE, have been vocal in their opposition to any group affiliated with the Brotherhood or those espousing similar ideological leanings. In the post-Assad landscape, they will likely back rebel factions that can check the influence of these Islamist groups, ensuring that Syria’s future more aligned with their own authoritarian models, which are hostile to political Islam. On the other hand, Turkey and Qatar, which have long supported the Muslim Brotherhood and its affiliates, will work to ensure that Syria’s political future accommodates groups sympathetic to their cause. Turkey, already heavily involved in the Syrian conflict and keen on countering Kurdish influence, will push for a post-Assad Syria that is friendly to its interests. Ankara’s backing of rebel factions with Islamist leanings will be key in shaping the future trajectory of Syrian politics, which may involve an uneasy coalition of Islamist and nationalist forces that align more closely with Turkey’s regional goals. Israel's Security Interests: Covert Operations and Syria’s Fragmentation Israel, having spent years trying to weaken the Assad regime and its allies, especially Iran and Hezbollah, will welcome the collapse of Assad’s rule. Israel will likely continue its covert operations in Syria, targeting any remaining Iranian and Hezbollah assets as well as any rebel factions it perceives as a threat. Israel has already signaled its intention to maintain a visible and strategic military presence in the region, especially along the Golan Heights and in areas near the Syrian border. Israel’s goal will be to ensure that no single force, whether a rebel faction or a pro-Iranian proxy, can dominate Syria and pose a direct threat to Israeli security. Accordingly, Israel’s primary goal after the fall of Assad would be the ongoing fragmentation of the country. A divided Syria, with competing rebel factions and no strong central government, serves Israel’s strategic interests, as it avoids the consolidation of a unified and hostile neighbor on its border. U.S. Pursuit of Democracy in Syria The U.S.’s objectives in Syria revolve around maintaining a foothold in the region and advancing its ideological goals. In particular, Washington has consistently supported Kurdish-led forces, such as the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), which it sees as a counterbalance to ISIS and other adversarial forces. These groups are also positioned as important U.S. allies in the broader effort to promote liberal values and establish democracy in Syria and the Middle East. However, the U.S. faces a difficult balancing act. While it has long advocated for a post-Assad Syria governed by democratic principles, the presence of Islamist factions, such as those aligned with Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS, complicates this vision. Washington will likely continue to back those forces it deems most likely to resist Islamism, even if those forces, like the SDF, are viewed as terrorists by regional players such as Turkey. The future of U.S. involvement in Syria will be shaped by the need to prevent the resurgence of ISIS and similar groups. With Assad out of the picture and Russia distracted by the ongoing war in Ukraine, the U.S. may seek to strengthen its influence over the Syrian political process, but it will be hampered by the complexity of dealing with a patchwork of militias, regional players and global powers all vying for control. Daunting and Fragile Road to Reconstruction As celebrations in Damascus give way to the sobering realities of post-Assad Syria, the challenges ahead are immense. With competing factions, sectarian divides and the looming specter of groups like ISIS, the path to stability will be long and fraught with obstacles. Rebuilding the country will require not just military victory but economic reconstruction, social reconciliation and political transition. The international community, particularly Western nations, will likely be called upon to provide aid and assistance in Syria’s rebuilding efforts. However, this assistance will be highly contingent on the political direction the country takes. Will Syria lean towards the liberal values championed by the West, or will it move toward Islamist governance? How the new Syrian leadership, likely to be dominated by HTS or similar groups, navigates this question will be crucial. Sanctions, Diplomacy and Alliances in the New Reality One of the most pressing questions is how the international community will engage with Syria’s new rulers. The Western powers, which have long shunned Assad, will have to grapple with the reality that many of the factions now in control of Syria, especially those linked to HTS, are considered terrorist organizations by the U.S. and its allies. A significant challenge will be determining how to engage with a new Syria while balancing the need for stabilization with the desire to avoid empowering forces that the U.S. and its allies view as terrorists. The geopolitical contest will also involve Russia and Iran, whose influence in Syria has been severely weakened by the fall of Assad. Russia, bogged down by the war in Ukraine, will be unable to project power in Syria as it once did. Iran, similarly, has seen its position erode with the departure of Assad. In Syria, the future of Russia and Iran will depend on their ability to recalibrate their strategies, possibly by backing certain rebel factions or negotiating with new political authorities in Damascus. Battle for Syria’s Future is Far from Over While the fall of Assad marks a historic moment, the true test of Syria’s future will be how the country rebuilds politically, economically and socially. Regional and global players are positioning themselves to shape the outcome, with each having a stake in what comes next. What is clear, however, is that the road ahead will be turbulent, with power struggles both within Syria and across the Middle East. In the end, Syria’s fate will be shaped not only by its own people but by the shifting dynamics of regional and international politics.

Pakistan’s Proxy War Intensifies In Kashmir – Analysis	By Ayjaz Wani After an uneasy lull in violence since the abrogation of Article 370 and increased vigilance from the counterterrorism strategies by Indian security forces, Pakistan is back to fomenting trouble in the Kashmir Valley. India’s northwestern neighbour has now resorted to using terrorists and sleeper cells to disrupt peace in Jammu and Kashmir, to sabotage the democratic process in the region. Shortly after Omar Abdullah was sworn in as the first Chief Minister of the Union Territory (UT) of Jammu and Kashmir (J&K), a series of terror incidents unfolded in the Kashmir Valley. Between 16 October and 7 November, terrorists targeted eight locations across Kashmir. The recent grenade blast in Srinagar city that left 11 people injured, and the killing of a wanted Pakistani Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) commander in the heart of Srinagar indicates that terrorism is making a comeback, with Pakistan intensifying its proxy war against India. Between 1 and 9 November, eight terrorists were killed in six encounters across the Kashmir region; four taking place in North Kashmir. As of 4 December, since January 2024, there have been 60 terror incidentsinvolving killings in 2024, resulting in the deaths of 31 civilians, 26 security personnel and 64 terrorists in J&K. Civilian casualties from terrorist attacks have doubled this year than in 2023, with most victims being non-locals. Pakistan’s proxy war and foreign terrorists in J&K Since 2020, terrorists have been operating in the south of the Pir Panjal and Jammu regions. The recently held J&K assembly elections saw a 63.9 percent voter turnout, but with only six out of 20 districts of Kashmir showing increased participation—Kulgam by 3.4 percent, Pulwama by 2.5 percent, Shopian by 8.5 percent, Srinagar by 2.1 percent, and Baramulla by 3.3 percent. The elections were conducted without any terror incidents, marking a successful first test of democracy in the UT after the abrogation of Articles 370 and 35A. Even foreign diplomats from 15 countries observed the election process and visited polling stations in Budgam and Srinagar to witness the UT’s vibrant democracy in action. The peaceful elections in J&K were the result of a zero-tolerance approach towards the terror ecosystem and its sympathisers in the region. The security forces dismantled the Over Ground Workers (OGW) network and acted against terror funding through arrests, raids, account freezing, and the denial of government jobs. Moreover, a significant positive shift in youth perception towards New Delhi contributed to decreased violence. The youth realised that Islamabad and Pakistan-based terror groups are exploiting religion to incite trouble and use narcotics to fund terrorism. Due to enhanced security measures and positive changes, only four individuals joined local terror outfits as of November this year. This marked a significant decline in local recruitment from 22 in 2023 and 113 in 2022. Consequently, there are currently around 16 or fewer local insurgents compared to more than 80 foreign terrorists. Due to the increasingly peaceful environment and the recent success of democracy in J&K, Islamabad and its terrorist groups are attempting to induce radicalisation and escalate terrorist violence through manipulative top-down techniques. Pakistan not only established new virtual terrorist groups but also intensified anti-India activities across social media platforms such as Facebook, X, Telegram, as well as the Dark Web. In October 2024, security agencies reported over 2,000 concerning posts, a significant increase from just 89 during the same period in 2023. Among these posts, 130 were related to terrorism, 310 posed threats to infrastructure, and 33 supported separatism. Pakistan and terror groups in Islamabad are strategically using cyber-enabled influence campaigns and propaganda to shape the public discourse on terrorism and terror violence. The four years have seen a steady increase in foreign terrorists, initially in the south of Pir Panjal and now in Jammu as well as in the Kashmir region. These groups exploit the dense forests and complex terrain for their activities. Following deadly ambushes and attacks in the Rajouri-Poonch area, terrorist activities have surged across six districts in Jammu, resulting in the deaths of 44 people, including 18 security personneland 13 terrorists. After elections, there is typically a rise in the activities of foreign terrorists in the Kashmir Valley, particularly in the districts of Baramulla, Kupwara, Bandipora, and Ganderbal. This trend ignites the disturbing memories of the period from 2004 to 2016, during which foreign terrorists successfully carried out terrorist activities to keep J&K on the boil. Pakistan’s nefarious activities were supported by Burhan Wani and other local insurgents, who used social media to boost local recruitment. Way forward The Af-Pak region has become a cradle for terrorism due to Islamabad’s state policy of using terror for geopolitical and geostrategic interests. The use of terrorism as a foreign policy tool, distortion of the hadith, the use of encrypted apps and social media for recruitment, and state support from Pakistan and other terror groups have complicated New Delhi’s counterterrorism strategies in J&K. The TECHINT-based (Technical Intelligence) information about the presence and movement of the terrorist has diminished, forcing the security agencies to reinforce HUMINT (Human Intelligence) for successful operations against the terrorists. New Delhi should strengthen its counterterrorism strategies and enhance coordination within the Multi-Agency Centre (MAC). India’s Home Minister has made it clear that greater collaboration among agencies is essential to tackle the evolving security threats facing the nation and to effectively dismantle terror networks. To respond to terrorism and a proxy war in J&K proactively and reactively, New Delhi should think of establishing four dedicated fusion centres for improved coordination in North Kashmir, South Kashmir, Rajouri-Poonch and Jammu, with locals from different agencies under the supervision of a multi-agency centre (SMAC) at the UT level. To remain a step ahead, joint training and exercises should be conducted between the different agencies at these fusion centres on the use of big data, technological advancements and Artificial Intelligence to curb terrorism. Joint training is also essential to establish priorities and operational procedures that will significantly contribute to achieving lasting peace in J&K. While coordination at the upper levels of the MAC is commendable, New Delhi must enhance collaboration at the lower level to ensure a better understanding of robust intelligence.

US–China Relationship’s Fragile Stability Shows Fractures In 2024...	By Jia Qingguo As 2024 draws to a close, the stability of US–China relations is fragile at best. Even this fragile stability cannot be sustainable after Donald Trump’s victory in the US presidential election. But there may be a silver lining. People in the United States, China and other countries will likely fear escalating tensions and oppose further confrontation. The year began with some modest optimism following the stabilising San Francisco summit between Chinese President Xi Jinping and US President Joe Biden in November 2023. The meeting indicated the possibility of real progress in cooperation on some issues, occurring halfway through the US Trade Representative’s statutory four-year review of Trump’s tariffs. Some observers believed that the Biden administration would find it in US interests to lift at least some tariffs on China, given their controversial results. Senior officials from both nations maintained a sense of normalcy and stability in their diplomacy. President Xi and President Biden held a phone call in April and met in person at the November APEC Leaders’ Summit in Lima. They reaffirmed their commitment to maintaining dialogue and careful management of this complex relationship. Meanwhile, high-level meetings continued, including US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen and Secretary of State Antony Blinken’s separate visits to China in April and Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin’s meeting with his Chinese counterpart in May. Both countries’ economic officials and military officers also conducted dialogues on topics of shared interest and concern in more institutionalised settings and cooperated on issues such as climate change, fentanyl trafficking and repatriation of illegal immigrants. But the relationship has remained largely confrontational. The United States has continued to pursue its policy of strategic competition with China, and China has enacted countermeasures. The Biden administration did not make much effort to improve the relationship. The review of Trump’s high and counterproductive tariffs on Chinese imports did not produce recommendations for meaningful tariff reductions. The Biden administration spent much time and energy devising ways to implement the policy of strategic competition — or confrontation — with China. These included incentives promoting near-shoring and friend-shoring in the production of certain commodities, and additional high-tech export restrictions against China. The administration also added more Chinese companies to the restrictive US Bureau of Industry and Security’s Entity List and prohibited US investment in China’s high-tech sectors. The administration has sold more and better weapons to Taiwan. Biden’s State Department even issued a travel warning for China until relaxing it on 27 November 2024. The administration has also tried to rally other countries to develop common security and economic policies against China. The US Congress has been busy drafting various anti-China statutes and resolutions, ranging from providing more support to Taiwan to suspending China’s permanent normal trade relations with the United States. Both the administration and Congress have threatened sanctions against China over its alleged support for Russia as its battlefield odds amid the invasion of Ukraine shifted in Russia’s favour. Despite US pressure, China has remained strategically defiant. It has accelerated efforts to diversify its trade relations away from the US market. It has intensified indigenous technology development to counteract US export restrictions and continued to advocate for free trade through initiatives like the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership and through applying to join the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership. China expanded cooperation with Russia, deepening trade and conducting joint military exercises despite US frustration. Beijing has also promoted international cooperation through the BRICS bloc and the Belt and Road Initiative. While demanding that the United States observe its commitments regarding Taiwan under the three foundational US–China communiques, China increased military activity around Taiwan in response to perceived US and Taiwanese provocations. The country has also accelerated its military modernisation programs to deter potential US intervention. These interactions have contributed to uncertainty in bilateral trade, relatively declining technological import dependence, reduced foreign investment, and increasingly negative public sentiment. Even the fragile stability may be ending with Donald Trump’s victory in the 2024 US presidential election. The second Trump Administration is likely to present even more serious challenges to the US–China relationship given his political track record and the policy inclinations of some key cabinet appointees. The relationship’s trajectory will likely be defined by increased tariffs on Chinese exports to the US, more controls on high-tech exports to China and more Chinese companies added to the Entity List. Trump’s presidency will likely also obstruct people-to-people exchanges, intensify provocations in the Taiwan Strait and reduce diplomatic communication. Under these circumstances, the risk of accidental military conflict would drastically increase. But challenges often come with opportunities. Further deterioration of the US–China relationship poses serious risks for both countries and the world. Trump’s campaign promise to impose 60 per cent tariffs on Chinese imports would have dire consequences if implemented. It would trigger further inflation in the United States, massive job losses in both countries, global trade disruption and lower the threshold for China to undertake potential retaliatory actions. Beijing could refuse to cooperate with Washington to reduce fentanyl trafficking, expand military actions in the Taiwan Strait, pursue an arms race or offer support for global activities against US interests. Such prospects may motivate US citizens and the international community to resist further escalation in tensions. If the mutual benefits of cooperation cannot rescue US–China relations, they may ironically be salvaged by people of both countries and the international community against efforts to escalate confrontation for fear of the catastrophic consequences of any potential confrontation.

Is Laos Actually Tackling Its Vast Scam Industry? – Analysis	By David Hutt In early August, the authorities in Laos delivered an ultimatum to scammers operating in the notorious Golden Triangle Special Economic Zone: Clear out or face the consequences. On Aug. 12, the Lao police, supported by their Chinese counterparts, swooped in. Some 711 people were arrested during the first week. Another 60 Lao and Chinese nationals were arrested by the end of the month, and more arrests have been made since. The way Vientiane frames it, Laos is now getting tough on the vast cyber-scamming industry that has infested much of mainland Southeast Asia. In Laos, the sector could be worth as much as the equivalent of 40 percent of the formal economy, according to a United States Institute of Peace report earlier this year. The think tank estimated that criminal gangs could be holding as many as 85,000 workers in slave-like conditions in compounds in Laos. People in Laos tell me there is some truth to Vientiane’s assertions. This might have been why Laos was downgraded to Tier 2 on the U.S. State Department’s annual human trafficking ranking in July, while Myanmar and Cambodia were downgraded to the lower Tier 3. According to one expert, 'Laos is taking this issue more seriously than Cambodia and has more capacity to respond than Myanmar.' Admitting a problem is the first step, but Vientiane has been somewhat fortunate in how the scam industry has structured itself differently in Laos. In Cambodia and Myanmar, for instance, scamming tends to be geographically dispersed with compounds across the country and controlled by different syndicates. Zhao Wei’s empire In Laos, however, the industry was, until very recently, almost entirely centered in the Golden Triangle Special Economic Zone, an autonomous area long notorious for organized crime and run by the Chinese crime boss Zhao Wei and his Kings Roman Group, which has close ties to organized crime in China and Hong Kong. The United Wa State Army and the Myanmar National Democratic Alliance Army, Myanmar-based militias with large stakes in Southeast Asia’s drug trade, are also active in criminal activity, including scam centers, within the SEZ. Initially, this centralization of criminality was a problem. After the Golden Triangle SEZ was founded in 2007, on a 99-year concession awarded to Zhao, it essentially operated as a mini-fiefdom. The Lao authorities were not even allowed entrance to the economic zone, giving the criminals carte blanche. This was a concern of a few nationalists within Laos’s communist party but tolerated by the majority, who regarded crime as a lesser evil, since Zhao and his associates were bringing in considerable foreign investment — and, of course, some cash to the political elites. However, as the cyberscam problem has metastasized since 2022, this situation has made it somewhat easier for Laos to respond. Because Zhao and his associates had established laundering trails to China and Myanmar years earlier, it meant that, unlike in Cambodia, most of the revenue from the scam industry immediately left Laos. This limited the amount of money needing to be recycled or laundered through local conglomerates, thus reducing the sums needed to corrupt Laotian officials, politicians, and tycoons. This meant that officials, especially those outside Bokeo province where the SEZ is located, weren’t contaminated by scam money, so they were not invested in protecting the racket. Sovereignty over SEZ By comparison, the scam industry is more geographically dispersed and controlled by more numerous players in Cambodia. This means much of the revenue stays within Cambodia where it is laundered through businesses run by some of the most prominent Cambodian oligarchs and politicians. So well-connected has the industry become that even if a faction within Cambodia’s government favored a full-frontal assault on the scammers, they know they would have to take on most of the country’s political aristocracy and oligarchy, risking strife within the ruling party. Scamming isn’t such an existential threat for the ruling Lao People’s Revolutionary Party, or LPRP. Indeed, the normally sedate National Assembly has noisily pressed Vientiane to tackle the scam problem, even last year rejecting a proposed government bill to toughen up regulations on SEZs for being too weak. In May, the Lao government reshuffled the leadership of Bokeo province, where the Golden Triangle Special Economic Zone is located, ostensibly to clean out officials who had been bought off. Vientiane has somewhat reasserted its sovereignty over the zone this year. Through discussion and threats, it got Zhao and his Kings Roman Group to accept greater access for Laotian police and troops to the economic zone. That said, Zhao and associates can still limit what Lao authorities can do in the zone Another advantage is that Zhao serves more at the whim of the Chinese Communist Party, which wants to crack down on parts of the scam industry in Southeast Asia, than some of the more independent operators in Cambodia and Myanmar. And the Lao government is also more dependent on Beijing than Cambodia’s authoritarian government. Pressure from China That means Vientiane, which relies almost entirely on Chinese investment for economic growth and on Chinese debt relief so the state doesn’t go bust, cannot say no when Beijing orders it to move on the scammers. The raids on the Golden Triangle SEZ in August came after a meeting earlier that month between the Lao Ministry of Public Security and Zhao – and just weeks after Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi visited Vientiane. However, we must also ask whether Laos’s cure is actually creating a worse disease. According to a USIP report last month, the Aug. 6 meeting between government officials and Zhao Wei, weeks before the raid on his GTSEZ, 'gave criminal kingpins and their senior [scam] compound managers ample time to relocate. Many of them shifted operations to Cambodia or the Myanmar border with Thailand.' Simply scaring off some scammers to Cambodia might not be the best regional response, although Vientiane probably won’t give a fig about this. However, Vientiane would care if scammers are now merely set up shop elsewhere in Laos. One source tells me that they are already embedding themselves in the capital and near the Laos-China border. Depending on how things play out, Laos might end up with a diffuse scam industry that’s structured a lot more like Cambodia’s — and which is far harder to dismantle. Dispersing the scam compounds means increasing contacts between the criminals and officials from other provinces. Less sophisticated syndicates mean more of the scamming profits stay in-country, laundered through the local economy, infecting everything. Narco-states like Mexico and Colombia have learned the brutal lesson that it’s simpler to deal with an illegal industry run by one dominant cartel, even one you have to tolerate, rather than a scorched-earth free-for-all between many warring factions. Possibly, a similar impulse may be why Vientiane seemingly wants to push Zhao and his associates enough for some smaller operators to flee the country, but not enough that the Golden Triangle SEZ collapses.

From Korean War To Ukraine Conflict: The Evolution Of North Korea...	A critical period in the Cold War, the Korean War (1950–1953) represented the ideological conflict between capitalism and communist. The Soviet Union's secret intervention at this time was crucial in determining the course of the conflict and laid the groundwork for its long-lasting alliance with North Korea. The dynamics of this alliance have changed in the present as North Korea provides Russia with reciprocal assistance in the context of the crisis in Ukraine. This analysis looks at how North Korea and Russia's relationship has changed over time, examining how their current strategic partnership is influenced by historical ties established during the Korean War. The Korean War: Soviet Support to North Korea Following the conclusion of World War II, the Korean Peninsula experienced a division along the 38th parallel, with the northern region coming under the occupation of the Soviet Union and the southern region under the control of the United States. This division established the foundation for rival regimes: a communist state led by Kim Il Sung in the northern region, significantly supported by Moscow, and a democratic state in the southern region, under the backing of Washington. The military and logistical assistance provided by the Soviet Union played a crucial role in the formation of the North Korean People’s Army (KPA) and its air force, thereby laying the groundwork for the conflict that would ensue in 1950. In the late 1940s, as geopolitical tensions escalated, Joseph Stalin’s Soviet Union strategically sought to extend its influence in Asia, perceiving the Korean Peninsula as an essential buffer against Western powers. Stalin's measured yet tactical choice to back Kim Il Sung's intentions to invade South Korea—dependent on Chinese backing—illustrated the intricate geopolitical strategy of expanding communist dominance while steering clear of direct conflict with the United States. The assistance provided by the Soviet Union to North Korea throughout the war included a range of military equipment, specialized knowledge, and essential logistical backing. The military initiatives of North Korea were significantly enhanced by the provision of Soviet-supplied T-34/85 tanks, artillery, and small arms, including the PPSh-41 submachine gun. The support provided facilitated the North's unexpected incursion into South Korea in June 1950, allowing for a swift advance southward until the intervention of the UN. The contributions of the Soviet Union transcended mere military cooperation and contribution. Moscow rendered essential medical and logistical assistance by deploying medical professionals and teams to support the forces of North Korea and China. Soviet advisers provided training to North Korean personnel, thereby augmenting the operational capabilities of the Korean People's Army in their military campaigns. The aerial conflict in Korea represented a crucial arena in which Soviet participation was notably impactful. The deployment of the MiG-15 fighter jet, flown by Soviet pilots under the guise of Chinese personnel, posed a significant challenge to the air superiority of UN forces. The 64th Fighter Aviation Corps, a Soviet military formation engaged in operations over Korean airspace, imposed considerable losses on United Nations aircraft, notably including advanced American fighter jets such as the F-86 Sabre. Although Soviet pilots adhered to strict protocols to maintain plausible deniability—wearing Chinese uniforms and avoiding speaking Russian—their presence became evident. These efforts showcased the Soviet Union’s commitment to North Korea while carefully managing the risks of direct engagement with the United States. The Soviet Union’s covert yet substantial role in the Korean War cemented its alliance with North Korea, fostering a relationship rooted in mutual strategic interests. For Moscow, North Korea served as a critical ally in the fight against Western imperialism, while Pyongyang relied on Soviet support to build its military and economic infrastructure. The war’s outcome—a stalemate leading to the division of the peninsula—solidified the Cold War’s bipolar order and set the stage for enduring alliances. The dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991 marked a turning point in North Korea-Russia relations. While ties weakened during Russia’s economic and political transitions in the 1990s, they never fully dissolved. By the early 2000s, under Vladimir Putin’s leadership, Russia began to reassert its influence in East Asia, seeking to restore its partnership with Pyongyang. This renewed relationship was driven by shared interests in countering U.S. dominance and fostering economic cooperation. North Korea, facing international isolation and economic sanctions, viewed Russia as a valuable ally in its efforts to secure diplomatic and economic support. The partnership evolved into a pragmatic alignment, with Russia providing political backing in international forums and limited economic assistance. The Ukraine Conflict: North Korea’s Support for Russia In the context of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, the dynamics of North Korea-Russia relations have undergone a notable shift. For the first time in their history, North Korea has emerged as a proactive supporter of Russia’s military campaign, underscoring a reciprocal dynamic rooted in their Cold War-era alliance. North Korea’s leader, Kim Jong-un, has been openly supporting Russia’s actions in Ukraine, framing the conflict as a legitimate exercise of self-defense against Western aggression. Pyongyang has criticized Western arms supplies to Ukraine as provocations and has aligned itself with Moscow’s narrative of resisting U.S.-led imperialism. Reports indicate that North Korea has provided material and logistical support to Russia, including the deployment of thousands of troops to Russia’s western Kursk region. This unprecedented move reflects Pyongyang’s willingness to reciprocate the Soviet Union’s support during the Korean War, albeit under vastly different geopolitical circumstances. According to Matt Murphy BBC Report (28 October 2024), North Korean forces have aided Russia in the conflict in Ukraine, which is a major development in the conflict. For the first time, North Korean troops are stationed in the Kursk border region of Russia, where Ukrainian forces have advanced, according to NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte. Between 1,500 and 10,000 North Korean troops, including specialized units, are thought to have been deployed to support Russian operations. This deployment is a component of Pyongyang and Moscow's larger military partnership. In order to support Russia's war operations, North Korea has also sent ballistic missiles and artillery munitions. In return, Russia is allegedly giving North Korea financial assistance and cutting-edge military hardware to help it get over international sanctions. In view of Russia's growing international isolation after its 2022 invasion of Ukraine, this relationship demonstrates a growing agreement between the two countries.Although North Korean participation increases Russian soldiers, logistical difficulties, a language barrier, and a lack of recent combat experience have caused observers to question the efficacy of these forces. However, their deployment highlights the war in Ukraine's expanding international character, causing Western capitals to worry about possible escalation and the instability of international security. The implications of this partnership extend beyond the immediate conflict in Ukraine. The North Korea-Russia alliance exemplifies the shifting dynamics of global power, where traditional Cold War alliances are repurposed to address contemporary challenges. This realignment poses a challenge to the rules-based international order, underscoring the complexities of managing global security in an era of multipolar competition. Conclusion The trajectory of North Korea-Russia relations from the Korean War to the Ukraine conflict illustrates the enduring significance of historical alliances in shaping contemporary geopolitics. The Soviet Union’s covert support during the Korean War laid the foundation for a relationship characterized by strategic reciprocity. Decades later, North Korea’s reciprocal support for Russia in the Ukraine conflict underscores the resilience of this alliance, even amidst evolving global dynamics. As the international community grapples with the challenges posed by the North Korea-Russia partnership, it is essential to recognize the historical context that informs their collaboration. Addressing these challenges requires a nuanced understanding of the legacy of Cold War alliances and their implications for modern geopolitics. The evolution of North Korea-Russia reciprocity serves as a reminder of the enduring relevance of history in shaping the future of international relations.

Trump: Sweeping Changes Starting On First Day He Takes Office – A...	By Ken Bredemeier U.S. President-elect Donald Trump is vowing to make swift and sweeping changes as he takes office on January 20, deporting millions of migrants in the country illegally, imposing tariffs on imported goods that could raise consumer prices for Americans and pardoning rioters who tried to upend his 2020 reelection loss. Six weeks ahead of taking office for a new four-year tenure in the White House, Trump seemed emboldened by his victory last month, making him only the second American president elected to a second, nonconsecutive term after Grover Cleveland in the 1890s. 'People like me now, you know?' he told NBC’s 'Meet the Press' in an interview conducted Friday in New York and broadcast Sunday. 'It’s different than the first — you know, when I won the first time [in 2016], I wasn’t nearly as popular as this,' he said. 'And one thing that’s very important, in terms of the election, I love that I won the popular vote, and by a lot,' with about a 2.3 million-vote margin in his defeat of Vice President Kamala Harris out of the 155 million ballots that were cast. But Trump, a Republican, also lapsed into familiar grievances, refusing as he has for four years to concede he lost the 2020 election to Democrat Joe Biden because of unfounded claims of fraudulent balloting and vote counting. Asked by NBC anchor Kristen Welker how, in his view, Democrats were able to steal that election but not the one a month ago, Trump said, 'Because I think it was too big to rig.' Trump blamed Biden for the nation’s political divide and heaped insults on his perceived foes, including the nine-member House of Representatives committee that spent more than a year examining the January 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol by Trump supporters trying to block lawmakers from certifying that Biden had won the 2020 election. He called the seven Democrats and two Republicans on the investigative panel 'political thugs and, you know, creeps. For what they did, honestly, they should go to jail.' Trump said that on his first day in office he would be 'acting very quickly' to pardon many of the more than 1,200 people convicted of an array of offenses linked to the rioting at the Capitol. Many of them have already completed their prison sentences while others have years to go or have to be tried. He has characterized those imprisoned as 'hostages' and called them 'patriots.' 'These people are living in hell,' he said. Yet Trump said he would not appoint a special prosecutor to investigate Biden. 'I’m not looking to go back into the past,' he said. 'Retribution will be through success.' But he said that if the Senate confirms his choices of former Florida state attorney general, Pam Bondi, as attorney general, and loyal political supporter Kash Patel as FBI director, they would have autonomy in deciding what to investigate and prosecute. Trump described special counsel Jack Smith, who twice indicted him, as 'very corrupt.' Trump centered much of his campaign on closing the southwestern U.S. border with Mexico and said mass deportations will begin quickly. First will be convicted criminals, he said, while other incoming Trump officials have said those with deportation orders will also be among the first to be deported. 'I think you have to do it, and it’s a hard — it’s a very tough thing to do. It’s — but you have to have, you know, you have rules, regulations, laws. They came in illegally,' he said. Trump made no exceptions for families with mixed immigration status, where some family members are in the U.S. legally and some illegally. 'I don’t want to be breaking up families, so the only way you don’t break up the family is you keep them together and you have to send them all back,' he declared. Trump said the cost and logistical complexity of such a massive deportation plan does not faze him. 'You have no choice,' he said. 'First of all, they’re costing us a fortune. But we’re starting with the criminals, and we’ve got to do it. And then we’re starting with the others, and we’re going to see how it goes.' But he said he would attempt to work with Democratic lawmakers to exempt so-called 'dreamers' from deportation, young children who were brought into the U.S. illegally by their parents and have little connection to their native countries. He also said he will attempt to end birthright citizenship in the U.S., now embedded in the country’s Constitution, which guarantees citizenship to anyone born on U.S. soil regardless of the legality of their parents being in the U.S. Trump said he would keep a campaign promise to levy tariffs on imports from America’s biggest trading partners, including China, Mexico and Canada. He acknowledged that he could not 'guarantee American families won’t pay more' as a result of his plan. 'I can’t guarantee anything,' Trump said. 'I can’t guarantee tomorrow.' He said he is actively trying to end Russia’s war on Ukraine, 'if I can.' He said Kyiv may not get as much military assistance under his administration as it has under Biden. During a political debate in September, Trump declined to say he wants Ukraine to win the war.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWdv4JuulzYzj16YNRypq0wL	2024-12-08T16:06:38-08:00	
A Defining Moment In The Ukraine War – OpEd	The Russian President Vladimir Putin issued a statement on Thursday regarding the two attacks by Western long-range weapons on Russian territory on November 19 and 21 and Moscow’s reactive strike on a facility within Ukraine’s defence industrial complex in the city of Dnepropetrovsk with a hitherto unknown non-nuclear hypersonic ballistic missile named Oreshnik. On Friday, at a meeting in the Kremlin with the military top brass, Putin revisited the topic where he clarified that Oreshnik not really at an 'experimental' stage, as Pentagon had determined, but its serial production has actually commenced. And he added, 'Given the particular strength of this weapon, its power, it will be put into service with the Strategic Missile Forces.' He then went on to reveal, 'It is also important that along with the Oreshnik system, several similar systems are currently being tested in Russia. Based on the test results, these weapons will also go into production. In other words, we have a whole line of medium- and shorter-range systems.' Putin reflected on the geopolitical backdrop: 'The current military and political situation in the world is largely determined by the results of competition in the creation of new technologies, new weapons systems and economic development.' Succinctly put, the escalatory move authorised by the US president Joe Biden has boomeranged. Did Biden bite more than he could chew? This is the first thing. The US apparently decided that Putin’s 'red lines' and Russia’s nuclear deterrence were the stuff of rhetoric. Washington was clueless about the existence of a wonder weapon like the Oreshnik in the Russian armoury that is as demonic frightening as a nuclear missile in its sheer destructive apocalyptic potential but will spare human lives. Putin added calmly that Russia intends to give advance notice to civilians to get out of the way before Oreshnik heads for its designated target to annihilate it. The shock and awe in the western capitals speaks for itself. Biden avoided commenting on the issue when asked by reporters. The Oreshnik is not an upgrade of old Soviet-era systems but 'relies entirely on contemporary cutting-edge innovations,' Putin stressed. Izvestia reported that Oreshnik is a new generation of Russian intermediate-range missiles with a range of 2,500-3,000km and potentially extending to 5,000km, but not intercontinental, equipped with multiple independently targeted re-entry vehicles (MIRV) — ie., having separating warheads with individual guidance units. It has a speed between Mach 10 and Mach 11 (exceeding 12,000 kms per hour). The Russian daily Readovka, published from Smolensk, which copiously covers the war, reported that with an estimated 1,500 kgs of combat payload, lifting to a maximum height of 12 km and moving at a speed of Mach 10, the Oreshnik launched from the Russian base at Kaliningrad would strike Warsaw in 1 minute 21 seconds; Berlin, 2 min 35 sec; Paris, 6 min 52 sec; and London, 6 min 56 sec. In his statement on Thursday, Putin said, 'there are no means of countering such weapons today. Missiles attack targets at a speed of Mach 10, which is 2.5 to 3 kilometres per second. Air defence systems currently available in the world and missile defence systems being created by the Americans in Europe cannot intercept such missiles. It is impossible.' Indeed, a terribly beauty is born. For, Oreshnik is not just an effective hypersonic weapon and is neither a strategic weapon nor an intercontinental ballistic missile. But its striking power is such that when used en masse and in combination with other long-range precision systems, its effect and power is on par with strategic weapons. Yet, it is not a weapon of mass destruction — rather, it’s a high-precision weapon. Serial production implies that dozens of Oreshnik are in the process of being deployed, which means that no US / NATO staff group and no Anglo-American target intelligence unit in bunkers in Kiev or Lvov is safe any longer. Oreshnik is also a signal to the incoming US president Donald Trump who is ad nauseam calling for an immediate end-of-war settlement. Oreshnik, ironically, has been developed only as Moscow’s reaction to the hawkish decision by then US president Trump in 2019 to unilaterally withdraw from the 1987 Soviet-American treaty on intermediate range nuclear forces (INF). Hence this also signals that Moscow’s trust in Trump is near zero. To drive home this point, on the very same day Oreshnik emerged out of its silo, Tass carried an unusual interview with a top Russian think tanker affiliated to the foreign ministry and Kremlin — Andrey Sushentsov, program director of the Valdai Discussion Club, dean of the Russian Foreign Ministry’s MGIMO International Relations Department, and member of the Scientific Council under the Russian Security Council. The following excerpts of the interview, plain-speaking and startling, should scatter the hypothesis that there is something special going on between Trump and Putin: 'Trump is considering ending the Ukrainian crisis, not out of any sympathy for Russia, but because he acknowledges that Ukraine has no realistic chance of winning. His goal is to preserve Ukraine as a tool for US interests, focusing on freezing the conflict rather than resolving it. Consequently, under Trump, the long-term strategy of countering Russia will persist. The US continues to benefit from the Ukrainian crisis, regardless of which administration is in power.' 'The United States has regained its position as the European Union’s top trading partner for the first time in years. It is the Europeans who are bearing the financial burden of prolonging the Ukrainian crisis, while the US has no interest in resolving it. Instead, it is more beneficial for them to freeze the conflict, keeping Ukraine as a tool to weaken Russia and as a persistent hotspot in Europe to maintain their confrontational approach.' 'Trump has made numerous statements that differ from the policies of Joe Biden’s administration. However, the US state system is an inertial structure that resists decisions it deems contrary to American interests, so not all of Trump’s ideas will come to fruition.' 'Trump will have a two-year window before the midterm congressional elections, during which he will have a certain freedom to push his policies through the Senate and the House of Representatives. After that, his decisions could face resistance both domestically and from US allies.' Make no mistake, Russia is under no illusions. Putin will not waver from the conditions he outlined in June for resolving the conflict: the withdrawal of Ukrainian troops from Donbass and Novorossiya; Kiev’s commitment to abstain from joining NATO; the lifting of all Western sanctions against Russia; and the establishment of a non-aligned, nuclear-free Ukraine. Clearly, this war will continue on its course till it reaches its only logical conclusion, which is Russian victory. Russian Security Council Deputy Chairman Dmitry Medvedev is spot on when he said in an interview with Al Arabiya yesterday that the use of Oreshnik missile 'changes the course' of the Ukrainian conflict. The Western capitals will have to reconcile with the reality that the scope for escalation of the war is ending. Make no mistake, if another ATAMCS strike inside Russia is attempted, it will have devastating consequences for the West. Serbian President Aleksandar Vucic put it nicely: 'If you [NATO] think you can attack everything on Russian territory with Western logistics and weapons without getting a response, and that Putin won’t use whatever weapons he deems necessary, then you either don’t know him or you’re abnormal.'	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWdv4JuulzYzj1gaeiG6aKiZ	2024-12-08T16:05:25-08:00	
From Oblivion To Influence: Rediscovering Milton’s Eikonoklastes ...	Introduction: 'Eikonoklastes' is a polemical work written by John Milton in 1649, directly responding to 'Eikon Basilike,' a work attributed to Charles I that presented the executed king as a pious martyr. Commissioned by the Commonwealth government, Milton's 'Eikonoklastes' aimed to counteract this royalist narrative, defending the actions of the Parliamentarians and justifying the regicide. The book is a substantial treatise, characteristic of 17th-century political and religious discourse, spanning several hundred pages of dense, scholarly prose. Belonging to the genre of polemical literature, 'Eikonoklastes' is a piece of political and religious advocacy. It falls within the broader category of pamphlet literature, a common medium for public debate during the English Civil War and Interregnum. Milton's polemic is intended to persuade and influence public opinion through rigorous argumentation and rhetorical strategies, showcasing his engagement with Puritanism and republicanism. Milton wrote 'Eikonoklastes' in English, making it accessible to a wide audience in England. The language of the text is sophisticated and erudite, reflecting Milton's extensive education and mastery of classical rhetoric. His complex and forceful use of English aims to convince readers through the power of his arguments and the clarity of his prose. The Influence of Religious Forces: Religion played a crucial role in shaping Milton's arguments in 'Eikonoklastes.' As a staunch Puritan, Milton was deeply influenced by the tenets of personal piety, moral rigor, and opposition to religious corruption. These beliefs permeate 'Eikonoklastes,' where Milton critiques the religious hypocrisy of Charles I and argues for a more authentic Christian leadership. His Puritan convictions are evident throughout the text, reflecting his deep-seated belief that true Christian governance must align with scriptural teachings and moral integrity. Milton criticizes the portrayal of Charles I in 'Eikon Basilike' as a saintly martyr, arguing that the king's actions were inconsistent with true Christian values. He writes, 'He who would have thought himself most wronged, and counted it half no less than treason to have been so cited, if this were a question, whether he loved God or no; and yet being able to bring witness of his not loving him, should lose by the verdict.' This critique of Charles's religious hypocrisy is central to Milton's argument, as it undermines the royalist portrayal of the king as a pious and just ruler. Milton exposes the disparity between Charles's public persona and his actual deeds, emphasizing the king's failure to embody the virtues he purportedly espoused. Furthermore, Milton challenges the notion of divine right, asserting that political legitimacy must be based on reason and justice rather than hereditary privilege. He argues that the misuse of religion by monarchs like Charles I undermines true Christian governance and leads to tyranny. Milton writes, 'For it were a kind of treason to his person, and a sacrilege to the commonwealth, to judge that he who is their King should be their enemy.' This critique of the divine right of kings is a recurring theme in 'Eikonoklastes,' reflecting Milton's belief in the separation of religious and political authority. He contends that kings who exploit religious sentiment to bolster their authority are guilty of corrupting the very foundations of Christian ethics and governance. Milton's disdain for the abuse of religious authority by monarchs is evident in his condemnation of Charles's supposed piety. He criticizes Charles I's public prayers as hypocritical, pointing out the inconsistencies between the king's religious posturing and his political actions. 'He that prays for the peace of his people, but does not endeavor to promote it, is not a peacemaker but a deceiver,' Milton writes, highlighting the gap between the king's words and deeds. This moral indictment of Charles I serves to dismantle the sanctified image presented in 'Eikon Basilike,' revealing the king's duplicity and moral failings. Questioning the Divine Right of Kings: Why does Milton vehemently oppose the divine right of kings? For centuries, this doctrine justified the absolute power of monarchs, arguing that their authority was derived directly from God and therefore unquestionable. Milton's critique strikes at the heart of this belief, asserting that political legitimacy must be based on reason and justice rather than hereditary privilege. He contends that when monarchs misuse religion to justify their actions, they undermine true Christian governance and lead their people into tyranny. 'For it were a kind of treason to his person, and a sacrilege to the commonwealth, to judge that he who is their King should be their enemy,' Milton writes, highlighting the betrayal inherent in the misuse of divine right. Political Advocacy and Republicanism: Milton's political beliefs were profoundly shaped by his support for the Commonwealth and republican principles. He believed in the sovereignty of the people and the accountability of rulers, and these beliefs are evident throughout 'Eikonoklastes.' Milton's arguments against tyranny and for rational governance reflect his commitment to republicanism and his opposition to monarchical autocracy. His political philosophy is rooted in the idea that legitimate authority derives from the consent of the governed, rather than divine mandate or hereditary succession. In 'Eikonoklastes,' Milton employs a range of political arguments to justify the execution of Charles I and defend the actions of the Parliament. He critiques the notion of royal inviolability, arguing that kings, like all rulers, must be accountable to the people. Milton states, 'Kings most commonly, though strong in legions, are but weak at arguments; as they who ever have accustomed from the cradle to use their will only as their right hand, their reason always as their left.' This critique of the inherent weakness of monarchical rule underscores Milton's belief in the importance of rational governance and accountability. He portrays kings as being unaccustomed to reasoned debate and reliant on brute force, contrasting this with the rational deliberations of a republican government. Milton also highlights the importance of liberty and the dangers of tyranny. He writes, 'For indeed none can love freedom heartily, but good men; the rest love not freedom, but license.' This statement reflects Milton's belief that only virtuous individuals can truly appreciate and uphold liberty, contrasting with the corrupt and arbitrary rule of tyrants like Charles I. Milton argues that genuine freedom is grounded in moral virtue and rational governance, whereas tyrannical rule represents a perversion of liberty into mere license. Accountability of Rulers: Why must rulers be accountable to the people? Milton's belief in accountability is grounded in his commitment to republican principles. He argues that the power of rulers must be derived from the consent of the governed and that they should be subject to the same laws and moral standards as their subjects. In 'Eikonoklastes,' Milton contends that Charles I's actions had consistently undermined the commonwealth and the welfare of the people. 'When a king instead of defending becomes a destroyer of his people, a patron of evil-doers, and a persecutor of good men,' Milton writes, 'he forfeits his right to govern and becomes an enemy of the state.' This powerful indictment of Charles I's reign serves to justify the regicide and the establishment of a government that prioritizes the common good over monarchical privilege. Narrative Techniques and Rhetorical Strategies: Several narrative techniques are employed by Milton in 'Eikonoklastes' to strengthen his arguments and engage readers. He often uses direct address, speaking to the reader with second-person pronouns to create a sense of immediacy and involvement. This technique helps to draw the reader into the argument and emphasize the urgency of his message. By directly addressing the reader, Milton fosters a sense of personal engagement with the political and moral issues at stake. The book is structured around the method of refutation, systematically deconstructing the claims made in 'Eikon Basilike' point by point, showcasing Milton's analytical skills. This methodical approach allows Milton to address each of Charles's claims in detail, providing a comprehensive rebuttal that dismantles the royalist narrative. By engaging directly with the text of 'Eikon Basilike,' Milton demonstrates his thorough understanding of the arguments he opposes and the rhetorical strategies he employs to counter them. As a devout Puritan, Milton frequently references the Bible, using scriptural allusions to bolster his arguments and align his political stance with religious authority. He employs biblical imagery and quotations to lend moral weight to his critique of Charles I and to frame his political arguments within a broader theological context. This use of scriptural references serves to legitimize Milton's arguments and to appeal to the deeply religious sensibilities of his contemporaries. Engaging the Reader: How does Milton engage the reader effectively? Direct address and rhetorical questions are key techniques. Milton often speaks directly to the reader, using second-person pronouns to create a sense of immediacy and involvement. This direct address fosters a sense of personal engagement, making the reader an active participant in the debate. Additionally, Milton uses rhetorical questions to challenge the assertions of 'Eikon Basilike' and provoke critical thinking. These questions are designed to undermine the royalist narrative and highlight the contradictions in Charles I's portrayal. By posing rhetorical questions, Milton encourages readers to question the validity of the claims made in 'Eikon Basilike' and to consider alternative perspectives. In addition, Milton employs analogies and metaphors to illustrate his points and make complex ideas more relatable. For example, he likens Charles I's manipulation of religious imagery to the actions of a deceiver, enhancing the reader's understanding of his critique. By using vivid and accessible metaphors, Milton makes his arguments more engaging and persuasive. The Reception and Impact of 'Eikonoklastes': 'Eikonoklastes' was published in October 1649, just months after the execution of Charles I, at a time when public opinion was deeply divided. The royalist narrative presented in 'Eikon Basilike' had gained significant traction, and many viewed Charles I as a martyr. Milton's work aimed to counter this narrative and provide a justification for the Parliamentarian actions. While Milton's arguments were persuasive to some, they did not completely neutralize the impact of 'Eikon Basilike.' However, 'Eikonoklastes' contributed to the broader pamphlet wars and the ongoing ideological battle between royalists and Parliamentarians. The Restoration of the monarchy in 1660 led to the suppression of works like 'Eikonoklastes.' The re-establishment of royal authority involved a campaign to erase the memory of the Commonwealth and the regicide. Works that defended or justified the execution of Charles I were suppressed, and Milton himself faced persecution for his republican writings. Many copies of 'Eikonoklastes' were destroyed or fell out of circulation during this period of royalist retribution.

Congressional Committee Condemns (Nearly) Every Feature Of The Co...	Are there words in the English language that fully describe what happened during the Covid years that are not already overused? Calamity comes to mind. Disaster. Cataclysm. Ruin, devastation, catastrophe, unprecedented debacle, fiasco, and utter wreckage – all fine words and phrases but nothing quite captures it. Given that, there is probably no report on the thing that can properly characterize the whole of it. On the other hand, it’s worth trying. Meanwhile, the results of Covid commissions of governments around the world have become unbearably predictable. So far they have mostly said their government failed because they didn’t act fast enough, did not enforce lockdowns hard enough, did not communicate and coordinate well enough, and so on. Everyone in the corporate world knows that when a committee reduces all problems to 'communication and coordination' you are being fed a load of bull. So far, it’s been almost entirely bureaucratic blather, and that helps account for the global loss of confidence in political systems. They cannot even be honest about the most catastrophic policies in our lifetimes or several. The amount of corruption, waste, and destruction from this period of our lives, lasting from 2020 until 2023 but with remnants of bad policies all around us, is so unspeakable that not one report has yet been fully honest about what happened, why it happened, who really won and lost, and what this period implies for how vast swaths of the public see the world. Among other astonishing revelations to come from this period was a full presentation of just how many institutions have been corrupted. It was not just governments and certainly not just the elected leaders and career bureaucrats. The problems are very deep and reach more deeply to intelligence agencies, military-based bioweapons systems, and preparedness agencies that guard their activities under the cloak of what is called classified. This is a major reason why so many questions are being left unasked and unanswered. Then we have the ancillary failures in a whole series of additional sectors. The media went along with the nonsense as if they are wholly owned and controlled by government and industry. Industry mostly went along too, at least the highest reaches of it, even as small business was crushed. The tech companies cooperated in a massive censorship operation. The retail end of the pharmaceutical companies enforced the government’s edicts, denying people basic medicines, as did the whole of the medical systems, which heavily enforced mandates on an experimental and failed product mistakenly called a vaccine. Academics were largely silent and public intellectuals fell in line. Most mainline religions cooperated in locking worshippers out. Banks were in on it too. And advertisers. In fact, it’s hard to think of any institution in society that leaves this period untarnished. It’s probably not possible for a government report on the subject to be fully honest. Maybe it is too soon, plus the hooks that created the whole problem are still embedded too deeply. All that said, we’ve got a solid start with the highest-level government report produced to date: After Action Review of the Covid-19 Pandemic: The Lessons Learned and a Path Forward, by the Select Subcommittee on the Coronavirus Pandemic as assembled by the US House of Representatives. The report was written by the majority and it shows. Coming in at 550 pages with 2,000-plus footnotes (we have made a physical version available here), the preparation involved hearing from hundreds of witnesses, reading thousands of documents, listening to thousands of reports and interviews, and working at a furious pace for two years. Based on the outline and breadcrumbs of the Norfolk Group, while adding in additional material based on critiques of media and economic policy, it is a comprehensive blast against the public-health features of the pandemic response. The conclusion of the report: nothing worked and everything tried resulted in more damage than the pandemic could ever have achieved on its own. In this sense, and given the low bar of expectations for all such political commissions, every champion of truth, honesty, and freedom should celebrate this report. It is an excellent breaking of the ice around the topic. Note that this report has received very little press attention, which only further underscores the problem. Coming in for heavy criticism: gain-of-function research, the deference to the WHO, the lab-leak coverup, the funding of pharma cutouts, business and school closures, mask mandates, the lack of serious attention to disease monitoring, vaccine mandates, the sloppy approval process, the vaccine injury system, the banning of off-the-shelf therapeutics, social distancing, the rampant fraud in business loans, the effects of monetary policy, and more. The report contains nuggets that we cannot help but praise: Ignored in the report: the rental moratorium, the frenzy of Plexiglas and air filtration, the push for sanitizing all things, the reopening racket designed to prolong lockdowns, domestic capacity restrictions, the division of the workforce between essential and nonessential, the role of CISA and the intelligence agencies, the CDC’s push for mail-in ballots that might have been decisive in the national election, and the astonishing gibberish over the infection fatality and case fatality rates. There is so much more to chronicle and criticize that the report could have been 10 or 100 times as long. To be sure, the report has plenty of problems aside from these exclusions. Operation Warp Speed comes in for praise for saving 'millions' of lives but the citation is to a modeling exercise that assumes what it is trying to prove. Look at the footnote: It’s bad science. The real trouble with this section is not even its incorrect claim that the vaccine saved lives. The core issue is that the whole point of the lockdowns and all that followed was to create conditions for the release of the countermeasure. The plan from the beginning was: lockdown until vaccination. Praising the goal while criticizing the ineffective means diverts the point. This is precisely what was explained to me in the early days in a phone call from a member of George W. Bush’s biosecurity team, a man who now runs a vaccine company. He said we would stay locked down until the world’s population got a shot in the arm. This phone call happened in April 2020. Quite simply, I thought he had lost his mind and hung up. I did not believe that 1) the plan was always to stay in lockdowns until vaccination, and that 2) anyone seriously believed that governments could vaccinate their way out of a wave of respiratory infections insofar as the pathogen had a zoonotic reservoir. The very idea struck me as so preposterous that I was incredulous that an educated and responsible adult could ever advance it. And yet that was precisely the plan all along. Sometime in the last week of February 2020, a global cabal decided to pull the trigger on a worldwide campaign of shock and awe – tapping every asset in civil society for assistance – to bring about worldwide forced medicalization with a new technology. This was never really a public health response. That was only the cover story. This was a coup against science and against democracy, for purposes of industrial and political reset, not just in one nation but all nations at once. I get it: that is an ominous statement and hard to wrap one’s brain around the whole of it. In completely ignoring this point, the Select Subcommittee has missed the forest for the trees. Let’s attempt a different metaphor. Let’s say your car is hijacked in Manhattan and you are thrown in the backseat. The goal is to drive all the way to Los Angeles for a drug deal. You could object to the means and goal but instead you spend the entire trip complaining about potholes, reckless driving, warning of the need for an oil change, and complaining about the bad music playing on the car radio. At the end of the trip, you put out a report to this effect. Do you think that would be strange, to wholly ignore the theft of your car and the destination and purpose of the hijacking and instead focus on all the ways in which the grand larceny could have been smoother and happier for everyone involved? In that spirit, the Subcommittee’s separate recommendations list is weak, leaving governments wholly in charge of anything labeled a pandemic while only suggesting a more cautionary approach that takes into consideration all costs and benefits. For example, it says on travel restrictions: 'It is far easier to undo the restrictions that may have been unneeded than it is to take a ‘wait and see’ approach once the unknown virus of concern has entered our borders and thoroughly spread.' It seems like the core lesson – governments cannot be masters of the microbial kingdom and allowing them to pretend otherwise for purposes of an industrial and political reset cues up a moral hazard that is an ongoing threat to freedom and rights – is not yet learned, or even so much as admitted. We are still being invited to believe that the same people and institutions who created calamity last time should be trusted again next time. And keep in mind: this is the best report yet issued! My friends, we have a very long way to go to absorb the fullness of the reality of what was done to individuals, families, communities, societies, and the whole world. Nor is it truly possible to move on without a full accounting of this disaster. Has it begun? Yes, but there is a very long way to go.

Losing Syria Is A ‘Huge Slap In The Face’ For Russia – Analysis	By Michael Scollon and Frud Bezhan (RFE/RL) -- When Vladimir Putin took the reins of power in a post-Soviet Russia in shambles a quarter-century ago, he immediately set about restoring Moscow's status as a global power. It took 15 years, but Russia heralded its military intervention in the Syrian civil waras proof of its return as a force to be reckoned with on the international stage. Moscow leveraged that image to expand its influence throughout the Middle East and beyond as a counterweight to the West. Now, the fall of the government of President Bashar al-Assad, a key ally of Moscow, has dealt a serious blow to Russia's great-power ambitions. 'Putin's military adventure in Syria was designed to demonstrate that Russia is a great power and can project its influence abroad,' said Phillip Smyth, a Middle East expert. 'Losing Syria is a huge slap in the face for Putin.' Assad's ouster represents not only a reputational hit to Russia but likely a major strategic setback. Syria is home to two major Russia military installations: an air base in Hmeimim and a naval base in Tartus. The latter is Russia's only warm-water naval base outside the former Soviet Union and provides Moscow access to the Mediterranean Sea. 'Russia has used its bases in Syria to project its power both into the eastern Mediterranean and into the broader Middle East,' said Smyth. High-Maintenance Asset Russia's military intervention in Syria in 2015 changed the tide of the war. Moscow's devastating aerial campaigns against rebel positions helped the Syrian Army regain swaths of territory and keep Assad in power. Moscow's Syria campaign came a year after its invasion of Ukraine's Crimean Peninsula as well as its support for separatist forces in Ukraine's east. Moscow capitalized on its involvement in both Syria and Ukraine to sell itself as a power capable of challenging the United States, NATO, and the West in general while expanding its global reach from the Mediterranean to Africa and Latin America. Following Russia's all-out invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, Syria became more of an asset for Moscow, experts say, while also presenting the challenge of maintaining military campaigns on two fronts. With the anticipated fall of Russian military assets in Syria, following the collapse of Assad's government, the task has become even more daunting. Russia is already heavily invested in a major counteroffensive to regain captured territory in its southwestern Kursk region that it lost to Ukraine, to the point that it is relying on help from North Korean troops. At the same time, it is trying to take as much territory as it can in Ukraine's east before possible peace talks. Russia military facilities along the Mediterranean coast in western Syria could be overrun by militants led by Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), a U.S.-designated terrorist organization, and its allies. Aaron Zelin, senior fellow at the Washington Institute, said Russia simply does not have the same firepower at its disposal to protect its assets in Syria. 'It is important to remember that Russia has to deal with its larger war in Ukraine now compared to when they first went in Syria in 2015,' said Zelin. 'Russia also has its assets fighting in sub-Saharan Africa, too. And unlike a decade ago, when Russia had the Wagner Group led by [the deceased Yevgeny] Prigozhin ... Russia doesn't have the same level of capacity or capability to deal with this now in the same way.' Zelin said losing the Tartus naval base, in particular, would be an 'extremely huge loss for Russia.' 'It's Russia's only warm-water port that it can use for its naval activities and power projection,' he said. 'Losing it would essentially cut Russia out of the core of the Middle East.' Moscow did not send ground troops to help Damascus, which fell to the HTS and its allies on December 8. Russia conducted dozens of air strikes since the militants launched their offensive against Assad's forces in late November, but Moscow's limited intervention did little to stop the rebel advance. Russia will pay a huge price for its failure in Syria, experts say. The fall of Assad is a 'major blow to Russia's claim of still being a global power in terms of sustaining military and political influence abroad,' said Hamidreza Azizi, fellow at the German Institute for International and Security Affairs. From there, actors in other regions such as Latin America and Africa might 'start rethinking their ties and their reliance on Russia as well,' he said.

Trump Has Strong Mandate For Immigration Reforms – OpEd	By Dalia Al-Aqidi Immigration took center stage in Donald Trump’s 2024 presidential campaign, solidifying its role as a defining issue in his political narrative. While the border wall symbolized his immigration stance in 2016, his current platform represents a strategic pivot, emphasizing robust interior enforcement and sweeping deportation policies. This shift, bolstered by discussions among his advisers and key stakeholders, highlights a detailed vision for immediate and large-scale immigration reforms.On his first day in office, President-elect Trump has vowed to reinstate many of the strict border and immigration policies of his previous administration, undoing the measures introduced under President Joe Biden.Among these priorities is the swift removal of undocumented immigrants who have committed crimes within the US. This initiative signals an uncompromising stance aimed at reshaping the country’s approach to immigration enforcement and prioritizing what he views as the restoration of law and order.At the heart of the planned policies is a reintroduction of the 'Remain in Mexico' program, formally known as the Migrant Protection Protocols. This policy requires asylum seekers to remain in Mexico while their immigration cases are processed in US courts — a measure intended to deter unauthorized migration. Additionally, the plan includes imposing stricter limits on asylum applications, revoking protections under Biden’s humanitarian parole programs and rolling back enforcement priorities that shifted the focus away from low-level offenders.These initiatives collectively mark a return to a more aggressive approach to immigration control, which mirrors the hallmark strategies of Trump’s first term. With these policies, the new administration aims to signal a renewed commitment to curbing unauthorized migration and addressing what it perceives as loopholes in the existing system.According to several media outlets, the plan involves an executive order mandating the detention of migrants, effectively eliminating the practice of releasing individuals pending their immigration hearings. Historically, such releases have been a pragmatic response to limited federal detention resources. Trump’s plan seeks to challenge this norm by prioritizing detention at scale, paving the way for an ambitious deportation framework.It is estimated that more than 11 million undocumented immigrants currently reside in the US. Vice President-elect J.D. Vance has proposed a plan under which as many as 1 million individuals could face deportation annually, signaling a potential shift toward intensified immigration enforcement. Supporters argue that this policy would deter unauthorized crossings and strengthen border security. However, critics warn that it could overwhelm detention facilities, exacerbate humanitarian crises and infringe on the rights of asylum seekers. The logistics of implementing such a plan on a national scale also present significant challenges, including resource allocation, legal hurdles and international diplomacy.Trump has announced plans to issue an executive order aimed at redefining the constitutional principle of birthright citizenship, which has long granted automatic citizenship to children born within the US. Under his proposal, federal agencies could enforce stricter criteria, requiring that at least one parent be an American citizen or lawful permanent resident before issuing a passport or social security number. This significant shift in immigration policy would represent a departure from decades of legal precedent. However, any attempt to revoke or alter birthright citizenship is expected to face intense legal scrutiny and substantial challenges in federal courts. The new policies would introduce stricter measures, such as expanded background checks, prolonged administrative processing times and a higher rate of visa denials. Additionally, prior approvals for visa extensions might no longer be given the benefit of the doubt, even when the circumstances remain unchanged. Requiring biometrics for dependents, mandating more interviews for green card applicants and operating with reduced staffing levels could further slow the already lengthy adjudication processes.Under the Biden administration, immigrant visas for people with exceptional skills or whose work benefits the US became more popular, especially for professionals in areas like artificial intelligence and emerging technologies. While the rules for these visas may not change, a second Trump administration might take a stricter view of what counts as 'national interest' or 'benefiting the US,' making it harder for some to qualify.During the first Trump administration, employers seeking H-1B visas — a temporary nonimmigrant visa enabling foreign professionals to work in the US in specialized fields — faced heightened scrutiny as the government significantly increased the issuance of so-called requests for evidence. These requests questioned entry-level wages, creating obstacles for businesses hiring international workers. Meanwhile, the administration sought to raise the required salaries for visa holders and green card applicants. Certain professions, such as computer programmers, were excluded from the 'specialty occupations' classification.The proposed policies have sparked intense debate, highlighting the complexity and emotional weight of immigration reform. Nevertheless, it is essential to emphasize that Congress will hold significant authority in shaping any proposed large-scale deportation efforts. Its decisions on whether to approve or deny funding will be crucial in determining the feasibility of such initiatives. Furthermore, Congress is positioned as a vital safeguard, ensuring accountability if the new administration seeks to reallocate funds from other federal programs to finance deportations without explicit approval.The growing concern over the large flow of undocumented immigrants into cities across the US has amplified the need for these measures. More than 77 million Americans voted for Trump, signaling widespread support for stricter immigration policies aimed at addressing these challenges. This strong backing from the electorate highlights the urgency many citizens feel about restoring order at the border and managing the impact of illegal immigration on their communities.

In The Rawalpindi-Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf Conflict, Pakistan’s T...	From the statement issued by Pakistan army’s media wing Inter Services Public Relations [ISPR] on conclusion of the 84th Formation Commanders Conference held last Thursday, it’s apparent that the spectre of 'propaganda and disinformation' against the country’s armed forces continues to give the Pakistan military’s top brass sleepless nights. This is understandable because in a country where the army is considered a holy cow by the people, anything that impinges on the military's exalted status is unacceptable as this can become a serious threat to the army’s phenomenal overreach and extra-constitutional authority. Hence it is evident that Pakistan army chief Gen Syed Asim Munir’s emphatic 'any effort to weaken our armed forces is akin to weakening the state' declaration is merely a cunning ploy to invoke nationalism for preserving Rawalpindi’s exclusive turf. Similarly, while there could well be 'foreign hand' involvement of in social media campaigns against the Pakistan army, but overplaying this issue to the extent of suggesting that this trend has acquired gargantuan proportions solely due to foreign intervention is clearly an attempt by Rawalpindi to conceal its own misdoings and highhandedness. Gen Munir wants the government to 'check unfettered and unethical use of freedom of expression to spew venom, lies and sow the seeds of polarisation' and maintains that 'those spreading fake news for vested political/financial interests need to be identified and brought to justice.' His observations and recommendations do create the misleading impression that even though the Pakistan army is being systematically demonised by 'vested political/financial interests,' the government unfortunately continues to remain a silent and inactive spectator. Readers would recall that after facing mounting criticism, Rawalpindi had in 2021 craftily orchestrated an amendment in Pakistan Penal Code and Code of Criminal Procedure through insertion of Section 500-A. This section which criminalises ridiculing of the armed forces states, 'Whosoever intentionally ridicules, brings into disrepute or defames the Armed Forces of Pakistan or a member thereof, he shall be guilty of an offence punishable with imprisonment for a term which may extend to two years, or fine which may extend to five hundred thousand rupees, or with both.' That the Pakistan military is perhaps the only army within the community of democratic nations that needs legal protection against slander from its own countrymen, does convey a lot! With no clarity on what constitutes ridiculing, bringing into disrepute or defaming the armed forces or its members, this draconian law gives the army [which has its own full-fledged legal setup] the opportunity to take offenders to court. So, instead of initiating legal action against those who he perceives are maligning the army, why is Gen Munir unnecessarily complaining against what he considers to be government apathy and the army's helplessness? Isn’t it his moral responsibility to uphold the image of the army? However, for the army to blame the government is nothing new in Pakistan. [Didn't former Pakistan army chief Gen Qamar Javed Bajwa say that the 1971 debacle which led to creation of Bangladesh was 'a political failure and not a military one'?] The ISPR statement further mentions that 'This pre-planned coordinated and premeditated propaganda reflects the continuity of a sinister design by certain political elements as an attempt to drive a wedge between the public & Armed Forces and institutions of Pakistan.' [Emphasis added]. Though ISPR hasn’t named the 'political elements' that it accuses of spreading propaganda, it’s obvious that this barb is directed at Imran Khan and his Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf [PTI] party. This is yet another classic example of Rawalpindi’s unending interference in politics, which is the prime reason behind its burgeoning unpopularity. Remember former Pakistan army chief Gen Qamar Javed Bajwa’s matter-of-fact admission that 'The main reason for this [public criticism] is the involvement of the army in politics for the last 70 years, which is unconstitutional'? Gen Munir is enraged by PTI’s accusation that the Pakistan army and Rangers [which are commanded by army officers] had opened fire at protesters in D Chowk on November 26 causing death of 12 workers and injuries to several others. This is evident from ISPR’s statement that the 'Forum noted with concern the malicious propaganda done in the aftermath of the lawful deployment of the army in the capital to secure key government buildings and provide [a] safe and secure environment for the valued visiting dignitaries.' However, does this anger justify Rawalpindi’s getting into a one-on-one slugfest with PTI and creating a mess? Both the government and the Pakistan army may deny having fired live bullets at protesters but there’s credible evidence that suggests otherwise. In an Al Jazeera video, senior journalist Kamal Hyder reporting from ‘ground zero’ clearly mentions use of live bullets by security forces and even draws attention of listeners to what’s undoubtedly the repetitive staccato of semi-automatic rifle fire in the background. He also confirms not having seen any armed protesters at D Chowk.Then there are several horrific videos on social media that show civilians with gunshot wounds. Most importantly, abduction of TV anchor and You-tuber Matiullah Jan and his colleague Saqib Bashir by men in black uniforms while they were collecting data on protester casualties from Pakistan Institute of Medical Sciences and booking Jan on terrorism and narcotics related charges also raises serious doubts regarding the official claim that no bullets were fired at protesters. The One of the most gruesome video that’s bound to generate anti-army sentiments amongst the people is that of an elderly man offering prayers mercilessly being pushed down from atop a container by Rangers. Why has Rawalpindi maintained a stoic silence and failed to take cognisance of this criminal act by soldiers commanded by Pakistan army officers is indeed intriguing and provides a reason for public resentment against the Pakistan army. Dawn in its December 7 editorial has aptly observed that 'The ruling party’s-and the establishment’s [Pakistan army]-disagreements with the PTI are political and need to be resolved through political means, while terrorist groups pose an existential threat to the nation…. It is unwise, therefore, to link the PTI to militant groups. Both the civilian and uniformed leaderships need to focus all their efforts on countering the terrorist threat… the effort to brand the PTI or other critics of the state as ‘terrorists’ will only divert attention from the real threat.' Whether Gen Munir will heed to this sagacious suggestion however remains a million dollar question.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWdv4JuulzYzj-9Gx40GDFmU	2024-12-08T15:57:53-08:00	
Indian Foreign Secretary’s Visit To Bangladesh Critical For Resto...	The Indian Foreign Secretary Vikram Misri will be in Dhaka for 12 hours on December 9 to meet his counterpart and also the Chief Advisor to the Interim Government Dr. Muhammad Yunus. Though described as being part of a routine 'structured dialogue' between the two countries, Vikram Misri's talks with the Interim Government in Dhaka will decide if India and Bangladesh will return to being friends or will continue to be antagonistic. After Sheikh Hasina was ousted from the Premiership of Bangladesh and was forced to flee to India on August 5, India-Bangladesh relations went down the chute. It has been going further down consistently since then, with serious charges being bandied by both sides, not officially, but by loud mouths in political parties and YouTube channels. Demonstrations are held in various cities in both countries increasing the pitch and adding fuel to the fire. Interested parties in India have, for their own political gain, interpreted the July-August student-led mass movement against Hasina's oppressive rule into a movement against the Hindu minority in Bangladesh and against India with whom the Hindus have been linked. At the same time, some radical Islamic forces in Bangladesh like the Jamaat-e-Islami and Hefazat-i-Islam saw in the July-August political crisis and its uncertain aftermath, an ideal opportunity to attack the Hindus who they dub as infidels with only a subordinate place in Islamic Bangladesh. Thus, a popular, though violent, movement, against a dictatorial ruler, turned out to be a Hindu-Muslim and an India-Bangladesh conflict. The crisis has made the Hindus of Bangladesh (8% of the 170 million), fear attacks from the Muslims. And the Muslim majority are fearful of an Indian attempt to twist the arms of the weak Interim Government of Prof. Muhammad Yunus in order to restore Hasina's rule. The popular belief in Bangladesh has been that Hasina was powerful because she had India's full backing. Hackles went up in New Delhi when Bangladeshi authorities said that Hasina would be extradited and tried in the International Criminal Court (ICC). As per Dhaka Tribune, a complaint had been lodged against Hasina and 24 others in the International Criminal Court (ICC) in The Hague, Netherlands for allegedly violating human rights. Forces opposed to Hasina saw her relations with India during her 15-year tenure as having been patently asymmetrical and skewed in favour of powerful India. A blind eye was turned to the fact that Bangladesh too had gained a lot and that Bangladesh would not have been able to grow and even survive without a close economic and people to people ties with India. Bangladesh is surrounded on three sides by India and the Bay of Bengal in the fourth side. Geopolitical Dimension The crisis had acquired geopolitical dimensions as well. Among Indians, the attacks on the Hindus in Bangladesh rekindled fears of radical Islamism. They rekindled Islamophobia in the West. Some British MPs condemned the attacks on the Hindus in Bangladesh. US President-elect Donal Trump's sharp comment in favour of the Hindus in Bangladesh has created apprehensions about an US-India axis to thwart the August 5 regime change in Bangladesh. Indians see the ouster of Hasina as a Pakistani-US plot aimed at ending India's monopoly over Bangladesh. Bangladesh's step of easing the granting of visas to Pakistanis and also improving trade with Pakistan are seen as the development of an anti-Indian axis. The India-Bangladesh conflict is being exacerbated by unverified reports of India deploying troops on the order and Bangladesh using Turkish drones over the border region to check on any hostile activities. There have attacks on the Bangladesh mission in Tripura and demonstrations in Dhaka against the Indian mission. Bangladeshi and Indian flags were burnt. For Indian Hindus, the latest provocation has been the arrest of a Hindu monk, Chinmoy Krishna Das, denial of bail to him, and the postponement of the hearing of the case to January 2025. He has no lawyer to defend him because volunteers had allegedly been beaten up. India charged the Interim Government of dereliction of duty in this matter.. It is amidst this volatile situation on both sides of the border that India's Foreign Secretary Vikram Misri would be in Dhaka on December 9 for talks with his counterpart and other leaders. Though described as being part of a routine 'structured dialogue' between the two countries, Misri's talks with the Interim Government in Dhaka will decide if India and Bangladesh will return to being friends or will continue to be antagonistic. Monk and Minorities Misri is expected to address India's concerns regarding rising violence against Hindus and other minorities, which is a political hot potato in India especially with the Hindu nationalist government ensconced in Delhi. 'Our position is clear—the interim government must fulfil its responsibility to protect minorities,' said Indian Foreign Ministry spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal on November 29. Misri is expected to seek a fair trial forcefully in his meetings in Dhaka. Backed as it is by the US in this matter, India would expect a fair trial for the Hindu monk. Business to the Rescue Meanwhile, despite the tension, trade between the two countries has not been perceptibly affected though there were calls for the boycott of Indian goods from the Bangladeshi side and blockades from the Indian side. Some Indian hospitals and hotels declared that they would not entrain Bangladeshis but later business sense prevailed and the notices were withdrawn. Indian and Bangladeshi authorities restored trade by reopening the largest land port between the two countries, which connects Petrapole (India) and Benapole (Bangladesh). This was done after India closed the six major land ports between the two countries in response to August forced change of government in Bangladesh. The speedy restoration of trade was a result of the economic interdependence. India and Bangladesh have a close economic relationship, with India being Bangladesh's second-largest trading partner. Bangladesh is almost entirely surrounded by India, sharing 94% of its 4,367 km-long border with it. Bangladesh relies on India for many supplies, including rice, wheat, cotton, iron and steel, electronic equipment and textile for its garment industry. Saner Voices Meanwhile, saner voices in both India and Bangladesh have called for restraint while being firm on fundamentals. Ambassador Harsh Vardhan Shingla, a former Indian Foreign Secretary, told an Indian TV channel that India-Bangladesh relations had a win-win quality as both nations had gained. Bangladesh needs India for its economic growth and survival, surrounded as it is by India on three sides. And India needs Bangladesh for its security and defence against separatism in the North East India and expansionist radical Islam. In Bangladesh, Zillur Rahman, executive director at the Centre for Governance Studies (CGS), wrote in The Daily Star: 'The worst thing Dr Muhammad Yunus' interim government can do is appear sympathetic to any side of this ongoing culture war. What Bangladesh needs right now is justice and a path to healing. The problem lies herein that justice and revenge are often impossible to distinguish.' Rahman further said: 'At present, no one can ignore the rise in vitriolic rhetoric targeting certain minority groups and Indigenous communities. This escalation has left these groups feeling frustrated and fearful, prompting some to resort to their own brand of vitriolic, populist, and anti-establishment sentiment. What is deeply concerning is that individuals carrying such radical views may now have the ear of some of the advisers.' 'At the moment, long unresolved divisions in society are catalysing due to the machinations of subversive foreign and domestic factors. This kind of division only worsens due to rampant misinformation pushed on social media without any accountability.' Rahman appealed to the Interim Government to remain above the fray of the culture war and focus squarely on its mandate and stop the public humiliation of groups or institutions not directly linked to the previous regime. 'Such actions would alienate important segments of society and deepen existing divisions, creating unnecessary distractions when the focus should remain on healing and rebuilding.'	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWdv4JuulzYzj0I_fWHgC03e	2024-12-08T15:55:58-08:00	
Why Is Russia Expanding Its Military Presence In Libya? – OpEd	The Telegraph's analysis of air bases in Libya reveals the presence of military transport aircraft, updated runways, reinforced perimeter defenses, and new buildings. Russia is now landing military aircraft in Libya on newly refurbished runways as part of its rapid expansion in Africa. The analysis conducted by The Telegraph at three Libyan air bases indicates the presence of Russian military transport aircraft, updated runways, reinforced perimeter defenses, and newly constructed buildings. Russia's military presence in Libya is growing significantly due to the developing partnership between General Khalifa Haftar, who commands the eastern and southern regions of the country, and the Russian president. The refurbishment of the airstrip has enhanced the base's ability to efficiently receive and launch military aircraft. Russian air operations are ongoing at the Brak al-Shati and al-Jufra bases, with satellite imagery showing active aircraft movements and frequent operations, suggesting a continuous transfer of supplies. The al-Qardabiya base is currently undergoing extensive renovations, including runway improvements and reinforced defenses, indicating a strategic move to expand and strengthen its defensive capabilities. Libya serves as a pivotal location for Russia's expanding operations in Africa, opening up opportunities for further access to countries such as Sudan, Mali, Chad, and the Central African Republic. By establishing military control in Libya, Russia can extend its sphere of influence from the eastern Mediterranean, where it already holds coastal positions in Syria, to the southern Mediterranean through Libya. Diplomatic relations between Moscow and Tripoli began on September 4, 1955. In December 1991, when Libya announced its official recognition of Russia after the collapse of the Soviet Union, relations began to develop after Muammar Gaddafi took power. Relations were based on establishing projects in late 1990, and political contacts between the two countries became active. Gaddafi visited the Russian Federation in 2000 and 2001. Relations developed in April 2004 with Saif al-Islam Gaddafi. On October 31, 2008, the first visit of the leader of the Libyan revolution, Muammar Gaddafi, to Moscow took place to conclude an agreement between the Russian and Libyan governments in the field of using nuclear energy and establishing a joint bank. Memoranda of Understanding were signed, aiming to... Russia's position emerged after the February 17 revolution, as the Russian Foreign Ministry called on all parties in Libya to find a peaceful solution through national dialogue to put an end to the violence. Russia also criticized the military intervention led by NATO in the Libyan civil war, although it chose not to use its veto in the UN Security Council to prevent this. The Russian Foreign Ministry announced on September 1, 2011, that Moscow recognized the Libyan National Transitional Council as the current authority in the country. Legal contracts and agreements began, such as signing the agreement on trade, economic, scientific and technical cooperation and the agreement to form a bilateral government committee on trade, economic, scientific and technical cooperation, and they cooperated in the field of oil and gas, while military cooperation came after the revolution. Alexander Fomin, head of the Russian Federal Service for Military-Technical Cooperation, announced on June 27, 2012, that Russia is counting on resuming the supply of weapons and military equipment to Libya and other countries with which military-technical cooperation was interrupted due to the deterioration of the political situation there. Tripoli - The strengthening of military cooperation between the Libyan National Army, led by Field Marshal Khalifa Haftar, and Russia raises great American and Western concerns about the penetration of Russian influence in North Africa, in particular, and the conclusion of joint military agreements, as well as talk about Moscow's intention to establish a naval base in the east of the country. Russia has intervened in the Libyan crisis for years, as it supported the Libyan National Army forces in the fight against the National Accord forces, a support that raised Washington's concerns and was among the reasons that thwarted efforts to control the capital, Tripoli, and liberate the western region from the influence and dominance of the militias. Wagner elements, whose numbers range between 2,000 and 2,500, are stationed in several military sites in Libya. Russia established a military naval base in Libya, which has raised concerns in the West. Russia is providing expertise to strengthen the sovereignty and independence of the Libyan state and its armed forces. Within the framework of this cooperation, 250 students and officers were sent to study in military academies in the Russian Federation, including 100 students and officers in Russian naval academies. Russia has bolstered its military presence in Libya by incorporating the Wagner paramilitary forces into a broader strategy. Moscow aims to create a more open defense industry with the Libyan parties as part of a plan to destabilize the southern wing of NATO. Washington emphasizes its efforts to enhance military cooperation with Libya to combat terrorism, organized crime, and smuggling. A military expert close to the situation commented on these developments, stating, 'Russian moves indicate a long-term strategy to strengthen Russian influence in the region, focusing on developing crucial air capabilities for military and geopolitical balance. Renovation operations at Russian air bases like Brak al-Shati and Jufra are key in maintaining Russian logistical operations and their role in the Libyan military scene.' Russia has strategically utilized Libya as a new location, taking advantage of governance issues and corruption. Satellite images, local investigations, and interviews reveal Russian forces upgrading facilities at the Brak al-Shatti military base. Russian military planes have been landing at Brak and making maritime deliveries through the port of Tobruk. The European Council on Foreign Relations estimates thousands of tonnes of weapons have been delivered to the al-Jufra facility. Russian forces have fortified the al-Qardabiyah air base, revamping runways, and enhancing perimeter defenses. They also train Gen Haftar's forces at the base. Russian troop numbers, which peaked at 3,000 in 2020, are now around 2,000 personnel, with a return to previous levels expected. Ultimately, Russia stands to gain significant military cooperation, political power, status, and recognition through engagement in Libya, increasing their overall strength.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWdv4JuulzYzjzpIxaHo2Lky	2024-12-08T15:54:40-08:00	
Developments In Syria: Regional Dynamics And Implications For Tur...	Recent political and military developments in Syria suggest a potential shift in regional power dynamics. Reports citing Kremlin sources claim that Syrian President Bashar al-Assad and his family have sought asylum in Moscow, sparking new debates about Russia's continued presence in Syria. The Potential Russian Withdrawal and Power Vacuum in the South The extent to which Russia will maintain its military presence at strategic sites such as Deir ez-Zor, Khmeimim Airbase, and Tartus Naval Base remains uncertain. A withdrawal from these locations, coupled with Israel's ongoing territorial expansion beyond the Golan Heights, could create a significant security vacuum in southern Syria. Russia's silence on Israel's actions in the Golan region further fuels speculation about its diminishing influence in the area. Uncontrolled Movements at the Lebanon-Syria Border.... Unregulated activity along the Lebanon-Syria border has reportedly accelerated the return of Syrian refugees from Lebanon to their homeland. However, the uncoordinated and insecure nature of these returns raises concerns about the potential for chaos in the region. Meanwhile, Turkey's border policy contrasts sharply: while Syrians under temporary protection are allowed to make permanent returns, those wishing to re-enter after leaving are denied, highlighting differing border management approaches. The Rise of HTS and the Risk of an Afghanistan-Style Administration.... The leadership of Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), with its Taliban-linked background, raises concerns about the emergence of an Afghanistan-style regime along Turkey's southern border. HTS's efforts to establish a governance model based on Sharia principles in the territories under its control threaten to create further instability in the region. The growing strength of radical elements poses a long-term security challenge for Turkey. Turkey's Security Policies.... Turkey must adopt a more proactive approach to address both the return of refugees and cross-border security risks. As regional power dynamics continue to evolve rapidly, Turkey's collaboration with international actors to enhance border security and strengthen its regional influence is crucial. The current situation in Syria underscores the need for Turkey to develop a comprehensive strategy addressing both humanitarian and security challenges. It is imperative to closely monitor how these regional developments will shape Turkey's position moving forward.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWdv4JuulzYzj34u0l1Tok2g	2024-12-08T15:53:16-08:00	
Armenia: PM Pashinyan Insists Country Has Irrevocably Broken With...	By Ani Avetisyan (Eurasianet) -- Armenian Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan insists his country’s break with the Russia-led Collective Security Treaty Organization (CSTO) has passed the 'point of no return.' But Russian officials are playing a waiting game, apparently believing Moscow’s gravitational force remains sufficiently strong to prevent Yerevan from escaping its orbit. Speaking at a parliamentary session in Yerevan on December 4, Pashinyan reiterated that Armenia now considers itself effectively outside the military alliance, having suspended its participation and choosing not to veto documents under discussion at the CSTO’s most recent meeting. He also criticized other CSTO members for failing to fulfill their treaty obligations by not coming to Armenia’s aid during the Second Karabakh War, which resulted in Azerbaijan’s reconquest of the disputed territory of Nagorno-Karabakh. 'We have fulfilled all our allied obligations accurately, both morally, politically, and legally, but the allied obligations towards us have not been fulfilled,' the Armenpress news agency quoted Pashinyan as saying. 'In a difficult moment, they [the CSTO] left us alone, they abandoned us, and yes, there are opinions that we were betrayed.' The CSTO came into being in 1992 comprising six former Soviet republics — Russia, Armenia, Belarus, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, and Tajikistan. Envisioned as a counterbalance to NATO, the alliance was meant to ensure collective security among its members. But for many Armenians, the CSTO is now a symbol of unfulfilled promises. Pashinyan’s efforts to sever ties with the CSTO are part of a broader effort to move Armenia toward integration with Western political, economic and security institutions, and out from under Russia’s security and economic umbrella. Russia’s response to Pashinyan’s latest verbal salvo was relatively muted. On December 5, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said the CSTO had not received any official communication from Armenian leader concerning the country’s organizational status, adding that Armenia remains a welcome member of the group. 'We hear these rumors that the prime minister of Armenia spoke and discussed many things on this topic in the parliament,' Lavrov told journalists. 'We are convinced that making the most of [CSTO] membership is in the interests of Armenia’s security. Russia and other CSTO members have not taken and are not going to take any action that will be perceived as closing the doors to Yerevan.' Earlier, at a CSTO summit in Kazakhstan on November 28, Russian leader Vladimir Putin expressed a belief that Armenia ultimately would not quit the CSTO, suggesting that Pashinyan’s statements were aimed at a domestic audience, motivated by internal factors relating to Armenia’s crushing defeat in the Karabakh conflict. He added that it would have been improper for the CSTO to intervene in the Karabakh conflict.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWdv4JuulzYzj4pSyrRivL-D	2024-12-08T15:52:31-08:00	
Macron Brings Together Trump, Zelenskyy Ahead Of Notre-Dame Cerem...	(EurActiv) -- US President-elect Donald Trump, French President Emmanuel Macron and Ukraine's leader Volodymyr Zelenskyy held talks in Paris on Saturday (7 December), brought together by a grand ceremony to mark the reopening of Notre-Dame Cathedral. Macron convened the trilateral meeting ahead of an evening event he was hosting to celebrate the cathedral's restoration five years after it was ravaged by fire. President Zelenskyy and European leaders have been concerned that Trump, who takes office next month, could withdraw US military aid to Ukraine at a crucial juncture in Kyiv's battle to repel Russia. Zelenskyy said the meeting was 'good and productive' and that the three men agreed to continue working together. 'President Trump is, as always, resolute. I thank him,' Zelenskyy wrote on social media platform X. 'We all want this war to end as soon as possible and in a just way.' Trump was on his first trip overseas since winning last month's presidential election and the visit to Paris was seen as offering Macron an early opportunity to play the role of mediator between Europe and the incoming president, a role the French leader has relished in the past. Macron is a strong supporter of the NATO alliance and Ukraine's fight, while Trump feels European nations need to pay more for their common defence. He has said a negotiated settlement is needed to end the Ukraine war. Arriving at the Elysée Palace, Trump told Macron they had enjoyed 'really great success' working together during his first term in office. 'And it certainly seems like the world is going a little crazy right now. And we'll be talking about that,' Trump added. Trump gave Zelenskyy a firm handshake and patted him on the back before Macron stood between them and Trump smiled for the camera. The meeting between the three men lasted about 20 minutes. By inviting Trump to the reopening of Notre-Dame, Macron was repeating a personalized approach that had some limited success during Trump's first term, said Heather Conley, senior adviser to the board of the German Marshall Fund, which promotes US-European ties. 'Mr. Macron knows Mr. Trump greatly appreciates the pomp, circumstance and grandeur of state and he provides it to him in abundance,' Conley said. Trump later joined world leaders, royals and business tycoons for a ceremony that got underway with the tolling of Notre-Dame's great bourdon bell. Trump, who will be sworn in on 20 January, has already held discussions with a number of world leaders and members of his team are trying to get up to speed on a number of world crises, including Ukraine and the Middle East. Global spectacle Trump, a Republican, was in power when Notre-Dame was devastated by fire in 2019 and visited France four times while president from 2017-2021, including D-Day anniversary ceremonies in 2019. 'Symbolically, both Mr. Trump's presidency and Notre-Dame have been restored in approximately the same time period. His visit to Paris is also the opening salvo of his return to the world stage, further diminishing the final days of the Biden administration,' Conley said. President Joe Biden's wife, first lady Jill Biden, was representing the United States at the Notre-Dame event. Republican strategist Doug Heye said Trump would convey a statesman-like position in Paris. 'It's not images of him at Mar-a-Lago,' Heye said, referring to Trump's Florida home where he has spent the bulk of his time since the election. 'This is the biggest event of the world and he'll be peer-to-peer with other leaders.' Macron, who is grappling with a deep political crisis at home after his government was ousted by parliament this week, pursued a non-confrontational approach toward Trump during the latter's first term, hoping that by engaging with him he could win concessions. But as the years passed, policy decisions on climate, taxation and Iran in particular caused friction between the two leaders. By the end it was a more fractious relationship. There could well be disputes in Trump's second administration, fueled by Trump's desire to impose sweeping tariffs on Europe and other US trade partners, and disagreement over how to handle the Ukraine-Russia conflict. Macron invited Trump to the annual Bastille Day military parade in Paris in July 2017, a spectacle that inspired Trump to order up his own military parade in Washington to mark America's Independence Day in 2019. Trump hosted Macron at a White House state dinner in 2018, but a year later the two quarrelled over comments Macron made about the state of NATO. 'Trump coming to Paris is a 'good coup' by Emmanuel Macron,' said Gérard Araud, a former French ambassador to Washington. 'It is indispensable to have a direct relationship with the only man who counts in the Trump administration, Trump himself.'	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWdv4JuulzYzj0-bWcJSA7qf	2024-12-08T15:51:22-08:00	
The Fall Of Damascus: How Opposition Forces Toppled Assad’s Stron...	Syria's civil war has reached a historic turning point, with opposition forces capturing most of Damascus, the capital and symbol of Bashar al-Assad's regime. In a series of rapid advances across key provinces, the opposition dismantled decades of authoritarian rule, culminating in a dramatic retreat of regime forces from strategic sites. The developments mark not only a significant shift in the civil war but also the end of 61 years of Baath Party dominance. The Road to Damascus: A Swift Advance The opposition's march toward Damascus was part of a coordinated offensive launched in late November 2024. The Syrian Free Army, alongside allied anti-regime groups, made substantial gains in northern and southern Syria, effectively encircling the regime's remaining strongholds. Beginning in Aleppo, opposition forces swiftly captured Idlib province by November 30, before turning their focus southward. By early December, opposition groups had taken control of Hama and Homs, key provinces along the route to Damascus. These victories were achieved with minimal resistance, as regime forces retreated or were overwhelmed by the speed and scale of the opposition's advance. On December 3, opposition fighters reached the outskirts of Damascus, their arrival marked by images of abandoned regime military equipment scattered along highways. By December 6, they had entered the heart of the capital, encountering little to no resistance. Damascus Falls: A Capital in Chaos The fall of Damascus was sudden and decisive. Protests erupted in multiple neighborhoods on the night of December 2, with demonstrators occupying key locations such as the Defense Ministry, Interior Ministry, and the international airport. The regime's forces, already weakened by earlier losses, abandoned these critical sites without a fight. By the morning of December 3, opposition fighters had taken control of central Damascus. The whereabouts of President Bashar al-Assad remain unknown, with rumors suggesting he fled to Homs or another regime stronghold. In a televised statement, the opposition announced the liberation of the capital and the overthrow of Assad's 24-year rule. One of the most symbolic moments came with the storming of Sednaya Prison, notorious for its association with regime atrocities. Demonstrators freed hundreds of detainees, many of whom had been held for years under brutal conditions. A Regime in Retreat: Key Losses Across Syria The collapse of the Assad regime's control in Damascus was preceded by a series of significant losses across Syria: Aleppo and Idlib: By November 30, opposition forces had seized most of Aleppo's city center and established dominance in Idlib province, a critical stronghold in the north. Hama and Homs: Intense clashes on December 1 resulted in the capture of Hama's city center, followed by rapid advances into Homs, a gateway to the capital. Southern Provinces: In the south, opposition groups captured Daraa, Suwayda, and Quneitra by December 5, solidifying their hold near the Jordanian border. Tel Rifaat: On December 1, the Syrian National Army launched 'Operation Dawn of Freedom,' liberating Tel Rifaat in Aleppo's countryside from PKK/YPG forces. The regime's forces retreated toward Damascus, abandoning positions in settlements such as Khan Sheikh, Zakyah, and Sasa in the southwestern countryside. Despite regrouping efforts, the regime was unable to halt the opposition's advance. End of an Era: The Fall of the Baath Party The capture of Damascus marks the end of the Baath Party's 61-year rule in Syria. The party came to power in 1963 through a military coup, and Hafez al-Assad consolidated control in 1970, ushering in decades of authoritarian rule. Bashar al-Assad succeeded his father in 2000, continuing the party's grip on power. The collapse of the Assad regime represents a dramatic reversal for a government that once held firm control over the nation. The uprising, which began in 2011 as a response to violent suppression of pro-democracy protests, has now culminated in the dismantling of the regime's power structure. The Humanitarian Crisis: Freedoms and Challenges The opposition's victories have been celebrated as a liberation, but the humanitarian challenges remain immense. The release of prisoners from facilities like Sednaya highlights the regime's history of human rights abuses, but it also underscores the need for justice and reconciliation in a deeply divided society. Civilian populations in newly liberated areas face ongoing threats, including the remnants of regime forces and the challenges of rebuilding infrastructure. International humanitarian organizations have called for urgent aid to address the crisis. International Reactions: Calls for Political Transition The international community has responded with cautious optimism to the fall of Damascus. UN Special Envoy for Syria, Geir O. Pedersen, has urged immediate political talks to implement Security Council Resolution 2254, which outlines a roadmap for peace and governance in Syria. 'The need for an orderly political transition has never been more urgent,' Pedersen stated at the Doha Forum 2024. He emphasized the importance of reducing tensions, protecting civilians, and forming inclusive transitional arrangements. Pedersen's efforts have garnered support from key international stakeholders, including Türkiye, Iran, Russia, and Western nations. However, the path to a stable political future in Syria remains fraught with challenges. A Nation Transformed: Looking Ahead The opposition's capture of Damascus marks a turning point in Syria's civil war, but it is not the end of the conflict. The country remains deeply divided, with competing factions and external powers vying for influence. As Syria enters a new chapter, the challenges of governance, reconstruction, and reconciliation loom large. The fall of the Assad regime offers an opportunity for renewal, but it also demands unity and vision from Syria's leaders and its people. The story of Damascus's fall is one of resilience and hope, but also of the immense cost of conflict. As the dust settles, Syria stands at a crossroads, its future yet to be written.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWdv4JuulzYzj3Tvrnb1zfTP	2024-12-08T15:49:45-08:00	
Nations Call For Stability, End Of Fighting In Syria	Nations have called for stability and an end of fighting in Syria after president Bashar Assad fled Damascus and militants took control of the capital, ending his 24-year rule. Egypt has called on all parties in Syria to preserve the capabilities of the state and national institutions, the Egyptian foreign ministry said on Sunday, following the surprise ousting of Assad. The foreign ministry, in the first comments on the situation in Syria from an Arab government, said it was following the situation with great care, affirming its support for the Syrian people and the country’s sovereignty and unity. Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan said Sunday that international and regional actors should ensure a smooth transition from the Assad government of after Islamist-led militants took Damascus. 'We have to work very hard... with Syrian people, not just Turkiye, but also regional actors, the international actors, to make sure that there is a good and smooth transition period, no more harm to the civilian people,' Fidan said at the Doha Forum in Qatar. In a press conference, Fidan said the Syrian people were not in a position to rebuild on their own and international actors and regional powers had to act with prudence and preserve the country’s territorial integrity. Terrorist organizations must not be allowed to take advantage of the situation, he added. 'As of this morning, Syria has reached a stage where Syrian people will shape the future of their own country. Today there is hope,' Fidan said. 'The new (Syrian) administration must be established in an orderly manner, the principle of inclusiveness must never be compromised, there must never be a desire for revenge... It is time to unite and reconstruct the country,' he added. Asked about the whereabouts of Assad, Fidan said he believed he was out of the country. Germany’s top diplomat called the fall of Assad 'a great relief' for the people of war-torn country, while warning against radicalization. 'The end of Assad represents for millions of people in Syria a great relief,' said Annalena Baerbock, adding, 'the country must not now fall into the hands of other radicals, whatever form they take.' Jordan affirms the importance of preserving the unity and security of Syria in light of the fast-developing recent events, the government said on Sunday. Jordan added that bolstering the state of security in the region 'is being worked on', according to Petra News Agency. Jordan underscored its dedication to safeguarding Syria’s security, stability, and territorial integrity, and further emphasized the urgency of restoring the functionality of Syria’s national institutions, Petra reported. France meanwhile welcomed news of the fall of Assad and called for fighting to end and a peaceful political transition in the country. 'Now is the time for unity in Syria,' the foreign ministry said in a statement. 'France calls for weapons to fall silent, for the democratic institutions to be preserved, for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Syria to be respected,' it added. 'It calls for a peaceful political transition, one that respects the diversity of the Syrian people, and protects civilians and all minorities, in accordance with international law. It calls on all Syrians to unite, to reconcile, and to reject all forms of extremism. 'Steadfast in its position and in its solidarity with the Syrian people since the start of the revolution in 2011, France now invites its partners to do everything in their power to help the Syrians find the path toward reconciliation and reconstruction, through an inclusive political solution, in accordance with the United Nations Security Council Resolution 2254 and with the will of the Syrian people. France will play its full part in this,' it continued. UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer issued a statement on Sunday afternoon in which he said Britain welcomed the fall of Assad. 'The developments in Syria in recent hours and days are unprecedented, and we are speaking to our partners in the region and monitoring the situation closely. The Syrian people have suffered under Assad’s barbaric regime for too long and we welcome his departure,' the statement said. 'Our focus is now on ensuring a political solution prevails and peace and stability is restored. We call on all sides to protect civilians and minorities and ensure essential aid can reach the most vulnerable in the coming hours and days,' it added. Spain will support a peaceful solution for Syria that provides stability for the region, Foreign Minister Jose Manuel Albares said following the reported fall of the Assad regime. Madrid wants 'any solution for the future of Syria to be a peaceful one... that benefits the Syrian people and in some way brings new stability to the Middle East and not more instability', Albares told Spanish public television. 'We have to take steps to ensure that it’s the Syrian people who decide how they are governed and by whom in future and, of course, that Syria’s territorial integrity is maintained,' he said. China’s foreign ministry said Sunday it hopes Syria 'returns to stability as soon as possible.' Beijing 'is closely following the development of the situation in Syria and hopes that Syria returns to stability as soon as possible', the foreign ministry said in a statement. The UAE diplomatic advisor to the president said that non-state actors should not be allowed the opportunity to exploit political vacuums, shortly after Syrian opposition fighters declared the fall of Bashar Assad’s regime in Damascus. 'Unfolding events in Syria are also a clear indication of political failure and the destructive nature of conflict and chaos,' Anwar Gargash told the Manama Dialogue security forum in the Bahraini capital in the first official comments from the UAE on the matter. Gargash also urged Syrians to collaborate to avert tumult: 'We hope that the Syrians will work together, that we don’t just see another episode of impending chaos.' The UN Secretary-General emphasized the 'historic opportunity for Syrians to build a stable and peaceful future' following nearly 14 years of war and the fall of Assad, adding: 'The future of Syria is a matter for the Syrians to determine.' He urged calm and the protection of all Syrians’ rights during the transition period. Highlighting the need for international support, he called for an inclusive and comprehensive political transition that respected Syria’s 'sovereignty, unity, independence, and territorial integrity,' Antonio Guterres said. The UN remained committed to helping Syrians create a future rooted in 'reconciliation, justice, freedom, and prosperity,' honoring the memory of those who suffered throughout the conflict. UN special envoy for Syria Geir Pedersen underscored the clear desire expressed by millions of Syrians that stable and inclusive transitional arrangements are put in place, according to a statement published on Sunday. The diplomat urged all Syrians to prioritize dialogue, unity, and respect for international humanitarian law and human rights as they seek to rebuild their society, adding he stands ready to support the Syrian people in their journey toward a stable and inclusive future.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWdv4JuulzYzjwjCBbne-mbL	2024-12-08T15:48:45-08:00	
The Rise Of The Demonic – OpEd	By Father Myron J. Pereira (UCA News) -- Of all the angels whose names we keep, none exerts a greater fascination than the archangel Michael. Is this the reason why Michael is one of the most popular names for both boys and girls? Typically, Michael is a warrior in full armor, thrusting his spear into a powerful but defeated dragon who cowers at his feet. Or he wields a sword, uplifted to strike Lucifer and cast him into hell. Millions of artistic depictions have stamped this image of Michael upon our collective memory — and not just Michael, but of his 'look-alikes' as well: St George and the dragon; white Crusaders bearing down upon infidel Saracens; and in our Indian tradition, victorious Kali crushing the buffalo-demon, and devouring him. Our deepest fears Iconography has an intuitive way of evoking our deepest fears and longings. What do these pictures of violent struggle speak of? Do they depict the tensions between good and evil, so much part of our daily experience? Or the urges to power, violence, and self-assertive righteousness? Or the demands of appeasement, of bloody sacrifice? We don’t quite know. Michael. Satan. Crucifixion. Ram-Ravana. Mahakali. These are powerful symbols from our collective unconscious. Which means to say that they exist so close to us, that we can’t even get them into objective focus. If anyone doubts this, let him reflect just a moment on the war and violence that has erupted across the world these last two years — Manipur, Gaza, and Ukraine — and held us all in thrall. In the name of God and country, armies have moved to kill and destroy, giving vent to all those outpourings of blood and passion, which altogether escape the cool light of reason. I call this the rise of the demonic. Where are the demons? The demons are always within. It is wise and healthy to recognize this, as the ancients did, and not pretend otherwise. Even the Gospels, which transcend in form and vision so much of the ancient world, acknowledge the presence of the beast — dragons, serpents, betrayers, apostates, persecutors, devils, and unclean spirits — all forms of the 'strong man' [Luke 11.21] who holds this world in thrall. And today the demons are still within. The anger and hurt we carry with us over generations — caste hatreds, religious prejudices, fears of losing power, sexist fears, racist fears. The unclean spirits return sevenfold in the refurbished apartment which is clean but empty. In other words, unoccupied by good spirits [see Luke 11.24-26]. Demonic and angelic? The demonic and the angelic are those vital forces, for good as well as evil, which undergird reason, and often bypass it altogether. Where there are demons, there are angels too, so perhaps I should also use the term 'angelic' for a more accurate description of those benevolent spirits that fill our souls, and lead us on the paths of righteousness and wisdom. As ABBA sang, 'I believe in angels/something good in everything I see.' Angels lead us to kindness and mercy, and compassion for those in need. They signify self-sacrifice and surrender beyond the call of duty. They inspire a deeper wisdom and perception, which comes from a higher power. They open us to life and experience in all its forms. But angels and devils inhabit the same space, and as the poet Rilke once put it, 'If you drive away my demons, I fear my angels will also take flight.' The world of the spirits To open the windows of the soul to the world of the spirits is to experience the tussle of conflicting spirits, as Ignatius Loyola well knew. His rules 'to discern the spirits' are a classic guide in this field. But what if one decides that it is safer to bolt the doors and fasten the windows, so that one feels safe and closed within? The room may become unbearably hot and stifling, but it is safe... for a time. Ah, but what if the doors and windows cannot stand the pressure of the gales which blow without? The powers of religion traffic with the world of the spirit. Their symbols reach up to the heavens and plumb the fearful depths. Unlike law or politics which control only external behavior, religion addresses the demons within us. And what are these? One example: in our building of the saeculum, for instance. We have no potent symbols of the secular to stir our bowels or palpitate our hearts, as religion has. Our talk of the secular is just that: abstract words. We have not waded through the wars of religion, as Europe did. We have not been persecuted enough for the values of mercy and human rights. We have not struggled to become secular; we merely adopted the phrases. It is only through a public confrontation with the demons of our primitive past in which religion played its part, a struggle in which Satan and his minions are hurled into the pits of hell, that we will be able to join hands and build the saeculum. Michael and the dragon tell us that the field of righteousness is a constant battlefield. Maybe like Jacob wrestling with his angel, we will prevail, but limp forever. Or maybe our demons will scurry into the dark corners of the city sewers, like the rats in Camus’ The Plague, and bide their time before they strike again. *The views expressed in this article are those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the official editorial position of UCA News.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWdv4JuulzYzj_HVhF0_XvMh	2024-12-08T15:47:25-08:00	
Evaluating President Zelensky? – OpEd	Ukraine President Zelensky is the greatest salesman in history, every time he comes to US, he walks away with $60 billion.' - says Donald Trump President Zelensky has proved to be pretty smart enough leading Ukraine in the war against Russia now for almost three years. He initially earned the respect of most and was smart enough to strike the Russian military right where it hurts them most! Imagine what he could have done if he had the airpower and the pilots! However, now voices of varying black and white opinions on President Zelensky are being heard from across the world. The assessment of President Volodymyr Zelensky's leadership and its impact on Ukraine depends on the perspective and priorities of the evaluator. Zelensky has faced significant challenges during his tenure, including the ongoing Russian invasion, economic struggles, and political reform pressures. Zelensky: Inspirational War Leader Zelensky's background as a former comedian actor and his media-savviness have enabled him to connect with global audiences and portray Ukraine's plight. His refusal to flee Ukraine during the early days of the invasion strengthened morale within Ukraine and garnered respect globally. He has secured significant military, financial, and humanitarian aid from Western allies, bolstering Ukraine's defense efforts. Zelensky has proven to be just the leader Ukraine needed in her greatest hour of darkness since WW2. He is a wartime leader in the mold of Winston Churchill, uniting and rallying his nation against an unbridled and unjust attack on its sovereignty. Zelensky is also working tirelessly to form world opinion and getting support for Ukraine that makes a real difference on the battlefield. Zelensky has been an inspirational President. He has done what nobody thought possible. He has rallied the citizens of Ukraine to defy one of the world superpowers and, despite the murderous Russian assault on the civilian population, has fought them to a standstill. Zelensky will be remembered in Ukraine as a hero. If, by brilliant, you refer to his courage, and fortitude, in the face of almost insurmountable odds, then he's one of the most brilliant politicians of all time. He has been a beacon of light for every Ukrainian to stand up and fight for their country against their Invaders. He himself with military fatigue is with his army in the bunkers, unlike Putin who is suited and booted who sits at Kremlin Palace and gives orders. He has stunned the youth of the World to show them what Bravery is all about. Europe cannot let him fail, if we do then Russia will continue to roll up the former satellite countries, the buffer zone. There will be another Special Military Action in Poland. Even Finland and Sweden are in danger. The Cold War gets Hot again. Zelensky: Now under Criticism I fail to comprehend why he is cheerleading his nation in an internecine war that is already devastating his country with untold misery that is now afflicting the common people there. He urged all the warmongers to supply him with lethal weapons, a request they gleefully acknowledged. Now his friends are comfortably living thousands of kilometers away in their own countries, unwilling to put boots on the ground in Ukraine. Do they have any concern for innocent Ukrainian lives? No, they are doing so at the behest of their ‘Armament Industry’ and the construction companies that are ready to descend on to Ukraine for lucrative contracts once the dust has settled down. He genuinely thinks the West will start WWIII for Ukraine's sake! Former longest serving NATO Chief the preacher of 'Weapons are for Peace.' He is a sellout to US who never put Ukrainian interests above anything. Before the war broke out, he allowed his land to become a playground for American dirty games against Russia, which led to the war. After the war broke out, he did nothing to save people’s lives or the civilian establishments. He is squarely responsible for the destruction his country is seeing. Now the country is in complete shambles and half its population stays as refugees in different parts of Europe likely to never come back. Zelensky, is not innocent in the suffering of his country. Zelensky before the war one of the most hated because of his corruption practices. This is not unscrupulousness; this is simple greed or a lust for power. First, the United States buys them for a decent loot, then they turn them into obedient slaves - fascists. He simply did what he did best when war broke out. He’s an entertainer, a TV star, someone who can jump onto a stage and give an inspirational speech and make people enthusiastic. He’s not a military commander and appears to take the advice of those who are. He’s not an expert on infrastructure and appears to take the advice of those who are. He’s not an expert on economics and appears to take the advice of those who are. He knows he’s an inspiring figurehead for the resistance, and he’s excelled at that. He knew the invasion was coming and might have had his famous line about ammunition written beforehand by his script writers if it should come in handy, which doesn’t diminish the impact it had at the time. He is set to inspire Ukraine to actually defeat Russia. 'Foolish'? How, exactly? He has managed to use words to ensure the survival of Ukraine as an independent nation. He has single-handedly created Ukraine as the nation we will know for the coming century. I would prefer the term 'Foolhardy'. As a real president, I think he is a talking head and, again, an actor. This time tragic. He has been playing his role well, but now he cannot ignore the fact that the Ukrainian people are suffering largely because of him, his pointless stubbornness. Zelensky was pretty ordinary as Ukraine leader prior to this year. Zelensky in 2022 is Lincoln in 1861. Zelensky in 2022 is Churchill in 1940. A leader of unequaled brilliance for this season, if not all seasons. Could the War have been Avoided? He is simply a foolish person. He could have saved his country from the disaster without any loss. All Russia wanted is that Ukraine does not join NATO. Joining NATO was not a profitable bargain for Ukraine. Friendship with a mighty neighbour is better than a faraway enemy of the neighbour. Zelensky will now sue for peace and may have to accept all demands that were put before him before Russia was forced to invade Ukraine. Staying at his post looks brave. But with millions of the Ukraine citizens running away, due to the Russian attacks will rase lots of questions in the future. Could it have been avoided. Was it OK to sacrifice so much, for what. He is also a gullible daydreamer. He should have been able to see through the US ploy of using Ukraine as a pawn to weaken Russia. Now he has lost the war and still not understood that Joe Biden wants to defend Ukraine until the last Ukrainian is dead. Whatever happens his name will go down in the history of the world as a man who destroyed his country through his myopic vision and narrow-mindedness. The results are there for all to see - many regions razed to the ground and every day kms of destruction being witnessed. What after the War? When Ukrainians win the war? Much of their country will have been destroyed and desolate. Everything will have to be rebuilt. Not just the infrastructure but also their culture. How does one bring back thousands of people who have scattered away? How does one convince refugees that it's safe to come back on top of the fact that there's no homes or grocery stores to come back to? Zelensky will still be needed to rally the free world to help rebuild and secure Ukraine’s future. Remember how quickly after World War II the government of Winston Churchill was tossed out of office. Even then, Zelenskyy has an excellent chance of being considered Ukraine’s greatest 21st-century hero. Politics is a skill, Like my friend put it 'Zelensky tickled the bear for too long' He gambled with nation and ruined its future. Soon Zelensky’s 'Bravery' will be forgotten but 'Zelensky will have to live with the knowledge that he could have prevented a war and failed to do so.'

The Funan Techo Canal And Vietnam’s Maritime-Continental Dilemma ...	By Nguyen The Phuong Since the establishment of the modern Vietnamese nation-state in 1945, the country’s grand strategy has revolved around two pillars: 'building' and 'defending'. Before 1975, the Communist Party of Vietnam (CPV) focused on two main tasks: 'building' socialism in the North, while 'fighting' against the southern regime and liberating the South from American imperialism.[1] This process was largely continental in nature, with most of the 'fighting' and 'building' taking place on land. The continental West and North were the main sources of Vietnam’s security concerns and formed the pillars of its defence strategy, as evidenced by its wars with China and the Khmer Rouge. After 1991, with the resolution of the Cambodian issue, Vietnam shifted its focus towards the 'building' pillar. At the same time, the country has increasingly turned to the maritime East for its economic prosperity. On 5 August 2024, Cambodia broke ground for the Funan Techo Canal Project, generating new tensions between Vietnam and Cambodia and sparking debates over its security implications for Vietnam. As Vietnam shifts its attention towards the 'maritime' East, this project brings back bitter memories of the 'continental' West that presented a grave security threat to the country during the 1970s and 1980s. Vietnam now faces the challenge of defending its interests from an increasingly assertive China in the South China Sea in the east, and a complex and growing non-traditional threat from the west.[2] This raises a crucial question: how should Vietnam, with its limited resources, balance its interests in the continental West and the maritime East? CONTINENTAL WEST VERSUS MARITIME EAST Since the turn of the 21st century, the maritime East has been designated a crucial area for Vietnam’s economic progress. Gazing out towards the sea serves as a way for the Vietnamese nation to reconnect with its maritime heritage. Throughout history, the maritime space has played a significant role in shaping the country’s political economy, even before the independence of the first Vietnamese dynasties from Chinese rule in the 10th century AD.[3] The prominence of Đại Việt (a feudal state encompassing parts of present-day Vietnam) in regional maritime trade networks, as well as the development of a distinct maritime identity in the southern Cochinchina kingdom during the 16th and 17th centuries, proves that the Vietnamese people have always had strong ties to the maritime domain[4] Moreover, by expanding its interests into the maritime sphere, Vietnam is also redefining its 'living space'.[5] After experiencing border conflicts with China and the Khmer Rouge in the 1970s and 1980s, Vietnamese leaders recognised the need to extend the country’s sovereignty and jurisdiction beyond its coast. This was done with the aim of creating a security buffer in the South China Sea[6] while maximising the country’s economic gains from maritime resources. The strategic importance of the sea was officially recognised in 1993, and this importance was further institutionalised in the following decades.[7] The goal was clear: to transform Vietnam into a 'strong maritime country'.[8] This objective was reiterated in the 2007 Maritime Strategy and the revised Blue Economy Strategy in 2018. These documents reflect the Vietnamese leadership’s strong maritime strategic mindset. The 2007 Maritime Strategy, for example, acknowledged that the 21st century would be the 'maritime century', hence the motto 'hướng ra biển là thịnh vượng' (turning to the sea brings prosperity).[9] The sea is considered the country’s 'living space', crucial to its development and security.[10] Therefore, developing and implementing a maritime strategy was imperative to steering the country’s sea-based development . That said, Vietnam’s traditional strategies have been primarily shaped by a continental mindset dominated by a Confucian, anti-mercantile ruling elite during the country’s dynastic era.[11] Throughout the 20th century, Vietnam faced numerous land-based security threats and engaged in wars fought primarily on land. The Vietnamese civilisation has thrived and been sustained by its extensive river systems. The Red River Delta in the North has long been considered the cradle of Vietnamese civilisation, while the Mekong Delta in the South is the country’s primary source of food. In fact, nearly half of the country’s rice, 65 per cent of its aquaculture, and 70 per cent of its fruits are produced in the Mekong Delta.[12] This strong continental identity is further reflected in the dominance of the army over the navy in terms of personnel and resources within the military. In sum, the co-existence of this continental mindset versus maritime thinking suggests that Vietnam cannot solely focus on one extreme or another. Vietnam’s future will be defined by both its maritime space and its investment in its continental landmass. THE FUNAN TECHO CANAL: A NON-TRADITIONAL THREAT FROM THE CONTINENTAL FRONTIERS The crux of the recent friction between Vietnam and Cambodia over the Funan Techo Canal Project lies in the lack of clarity over how Cambodia intends to utilise the water from the canal, including its intended purposes and volume. In 2023, the Cambodia National Mekong Committee (CNMC) released a 14-page report on the project. Vietnamese experts, however, criticised the report for failing to include information on the anticipated procedures of operation or the assessment of environmental impacts caused by the canal.[13] The report only mentioned the canal’s function as a waterway or navigation route, leaving unclear the extent to which it will serve purposes like irrigation, drainage, and water collection for various activities. As such, the report contradicts recent statements by Senate President Hun Sen that the canal would 'facilitate agricultural activities by providing water for crop cultivation'.[14] Deputy Prime Minister Sun Chanthol also discussed the irrigation benefits of the canal in an English-language video interview.[15] Moreover, although the CNMC report mentions the use of a navigation lock system to prevent water from leaving the Mekong mainstream, more information is needed on its design, maintenance, and operations.[16] In September 2023, the Vietnamese Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment requested that experts assess the impacts of the project. The following month, the Vietnamese Meteorological and Hydrological Administration released a four-page report emphasising that 'the construction of a waterway canal in Cambodia will significantly exacerbate the issue of water resource depletion in the Mekong Delta, as seen in recent years.'[17] However, this analysis only considers the impact on water supply if the canal is used for transportation purposes. In April 2024, participants at a conference in Can Tho City highlighted the canal’s potential negative impacts on the Mekong Delta. At a regular press conference the same month, the spokesperson of the Vietnamese Ministry of Foreign Affairs expressed interest in the Funan Techo Canal Project and urged the Cambodian government to closely coordinate with Vietnam and the Mekong River Commission, as well as the international community, in sharing information about the project.[18] This highlights the lack of information available to the Vietnamese government regarding the project. Both Vietnamese scholars and Western experts have expressed concerns over the environmental consequences of the project on the Lower Mekong River Basin.[19] However, Vietnamese experts have varying opinions on the scale and extent of the impact. The most extreme estimation suggests that the canal could decrease the water flow to the Mekong Delta by over 50 per cent or even 70 per cent during the dry season.[20] However, other experts disagree, stating that the potential scenario would not be as severe, with a loss of 5-13 per cent of water flowing to the Delta.[21] The project will also have a significant impact on the hydrological regime of the transboundary floodplain.[22] For example, seasonal flooding provides irrigation to the Vinh Te Canal in Vietnam’s Kien Giang Province. However, building high levees to protect the Funan Techo Canal from flood damage will cause a large area of the Mekong Delta and significant portions of Cambodia’s floodplain to suffer from reduced natural flooding and increased dryness, ultimately resulting in a loss of industrial-scale agricultural production.[23] It is evident that Vietnamese government officials and experts have been closely monitoring the issue since the CNMC submitted its initial document to the Mekong River Commission in 2023 regarding the construction of the Funan Techo Canal. Despite differences in assessing the potential impact of the project, most Vietnamese experts agree that Cambodia should be more transparent and provide more information and data on the operating procedures of the canal, its functions and purposes, as well as solutions to ensure safety in the event of any incidents. VIETNAM’S OLD DILEMMA IN A NEW CONTEXT Given Hanoi’s priorities of economic development and a peaceful approach to foreign and defence policy, it is highly unlikely that the Vietnamese government will respond aggressively to Cambodia’s plans to build the Funan Techo Canal. However, this recent friction has shed light on an important truth that has long been overlooked by the Vietnamese public: the increasing significance of the continental West in Vietnam’s security landscape, albeit of a different nature compared to the past. As Vietnam heavily relies on the sea for its grand strategy and faces potential conflicts in the South China Sea, the country must now navigate the challenge of balancing resources and strategic priorities between the maritime East and the continental West. Challenges from both domains are viewed as existential threats to Vietnam’s national interests, or, from a geostrategic standpoint, to its 'strategic space'. It is worth noting that 'strategic space' holds significant weight in Vietnam’s strategic lexicon. It refers to a country’s physical environment, including its land, sea, space, and surrounding areas, as well as neighbouring countries and their foreign policies. Vietnam’s current strategic space includes its continental North and West (with Cambodia, Laos, and China as immediate neighbours) and the maritime East, with the South China Sea serving as the new frontier in the 21st century. Balancing the threats in both of these strategic spaces is a daunting task, requiring skilled statecraft and resource allocation. Vietnam’s continental landmass and its immediate neighbours (Laos, Cambodia, and China) will always be crucial for its defence and security. Without stable and friendly neighbours, Vietnam would struggle to mobilise resources for economic and social development. Historically, the continental frontiers served as both sources of security and insecurity in a traditional sense, primarily focused on expanding and protecting territories. However, in the interconnected world of the 21st century, shaped by a specific international order, the nature of threats from the continental frontier has become more complex and less focused on territorial issues. These non-traditional challenges require Vietnam to be more adaptable, innovative, and skilled in managing its relationships, both bilaterally and multilaterally. Vietnam may need to focus on not only external factors but also internal development to secure its economic future and partnerships with neighbouring countries. A strong economic foundation is essential for ensuring long-term stability along Vietnam’s western border. The primary challenge for Vietnam’s grand strategy is finding a balance between the continental West and the maritime East. This involves effectively allocating resources to both domains, particularly in defence and security. It is not a matter of choosing one over the other, but rather identifying the strategic priority in a complex and ever-changing environment; this is no easy task and can be costly, especially for a middle-income country. China’s notorious illegal, coercive, aggressive, and deceptive activities in the South China Sea pose a threat to Vietnam, forcing the country to invest heavily in developing and modernising its maritime forces. The recent controversy surrounding the Funan-Techo Canal Project highlights that future challenges from the continental West could potentially divert resources away from the South China Sea. CONCLUSION The growing influence of China on Vietnam’s western 'continental' frontiers is a legitimate concern for the country. As tensions in the South China Sea continue to escalate, the construction of the Funan Techo Canal raises a larger question at a grand-strategic level: how can Vietnam effectively balance its resources and vision between the 'continental' West and the 'maritime' East? While the South China Sea remains the primary battleground for sovereignty, the western frontiers are now faced with a variety of non-traditional security challenges, including issues in the Mekong region, human trafficking, and transnational crimes, which require a different approach. Some analysts believe that Vietnam should take proactive measures with expert-led strategies and practical solutions to mitigate any potential impact that may arise from the canal.[24] At the same time, the government must balance the competing needs of the continental West and the maritime East. It is crucial for Vietnam to continue leveraging on international support and collaboration in managing security and development concerns on both fronts. While the maritime domain offers opportunities for economic growth and prosperity, without the support of the continental domain, the foundation of Vietnam’s economic and security interests would not be sustainable.

The Use And Abuse Of Malaysia’s Law Enforcement And Judicial Syst...	Malaysia has one of the most crooked legal systems in the region The integrity of Malaysia’s legal-judicial system has rapidly decayed since Anwar Ibrahim became prime minister in November 2022. Since Anwar has been prime minister, a number of high-profile court cases were terminated with a 'Discharge Not Amounting to an Acquittal (DNAA),' allowing defendants to walk free from the court. Malaysians saw a number of high-profile politicians, including deputy prime minister Ahmad Zahid Hamidi, being the most noteworthy, discharged from indictments of corruption and money laundering this year. Former prime minister Najib Razak’s prison sentence was commuted from 12 to 6 years, and fine reduced by 75 percent to RM 55 million by the Pardons Board. These visible special arrangements made for VVIPs has hastened the undermining the system of justice in Malaysia. A survey undertaken by the writer indicates a low level of trust and confidence in the Malaysian judicial system. It’s easy to speculate this low level of trust has come from citizens observing law enforcement and the legal system being used as a tool for bullying, intimidation, selective prosecution of critics of the government and the political opposition. At the same time, there is declining case diligence by the Attorney General’s Chambers (AGC) with cases involving government members on trial, amounting to case dismissals. Bullying and Intimidation The current modus operandi today is an environment where the police can act with impunity when bullying and intimidating a citizen over what he/she thinks and expresses to the community as opinion. If someone exposes the money laundering, corruption, and criminal activities of the elite, they will be chastised by the authorities. Corruption is covered up by the concoction of the 3Rs (race, religion and royalty), where any discussion of these subjects by ordinary citizens results in arrest and intimidation, while those on the government side do so with total impunity. This is a total abuse of the legal system. Upon examination, the 3Rs mantra puts itself above the Constitution. Any corruption regarding members of the monarchy can be suppressed, where the whistleblower exposing corruption punished. Other matters regarding race and religion impinge upon freedom of speech and freedom of religion, written into the constitution. The Royal Malaysian Police (PDRM) acts upon consultation with the Malaysian Communications and Multimedia Commission (MCMC), the Malaysian Islamic Development Department (JAKIM), and even the governing political parties. The police often conduct joint raids with the above and state religious departments. These raids are made on the basis of a person’s beliefs, opinion, and faith, as well as political allegiance. Most of these raids don’t end up in charges. They are acts of intimidation, where people are falsely imprisoned for a short length of time, intimidated, where their computers and mobile phones confiscated, most often not returned to the owners. The treatment of citizens this way is a total abuse of power. Most of these acts are politically motivated, where opposition MPs and activists have been the prime victims. In addition, the police often hold press conferences asserting guilt of people through accusation, usually without any follow-up. Law enforcement in Malaysia is now a politicised system. There is no ombudsman or statutory body to report these abuses, as a means to seek any accountability by authorities. Lawfare and persecution are now specialities of the authorities in Malaysia. A number of prominent opposition MPs have been very publicly humiliated and charged, which is manipulated in a way the public cheer on and media highlights manipulated public support to the government’s advantage. These are now media spectacles, where police with firearms wearing balaclavas to hide their identities are used in this theatre. Most of the charges laid under these sham-operations end up being delayed and eventually dismissed by courts with little media coverage. It must be noted here that the home minister Saifuddin Nasution Ismail, who is ultimately in charge of all these operations lost his seat in the last general election, and was appointed a senator. He will never be democratically accountability to the people. The Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission (MACC) has been conducting ‘revolving door’ persecutions of prime minister Anwar’s adversaries through very public investigations. These ‘suspects’ are called up for questioning, but to-date no criminal charges have been laid against any of them. Attorney General’s Chambers The work of the Attorney General’s Chambers must be called into question with their sloppy court preparations and presentations that have led to the dismissal of criminal charges against Anwar’s political allies. One way to fix a court trial is to prepare and present a poor prosecution that the court has no alternative but to discharge the defendant due to lack of evidence. This occurred to deputy prime minister Ahmad Zahid Hamidi, who was given a discharge not amounting to an acquittal (DNAA) on 47 charges of corruption and money laundering. In some countries this would be called ‘fixing a trial’. This has been caused by either total incompetence of the AGC, or premeditated tampering of trials to acquit defendants. The AGC remains totally unaccountable for this. The case of Yusoff Rawther is very concerning. Yusoff was arrested on firearm and narcotics charges under suspicious circumstances, where the planting of evidence by police is a possibility. There is great concern for the personal wellbeing for Yusoff, where Yusoff had filed a suit against prime minister Anwar for sexual assault. Sections of the legal community are saying the case is politically motivated, where the police had assisted in perverting the course of justice. With 74 deaths, many of these in suspicious circumstances, in police custody during 2023, there is a need for concern. Bribery in the legal profession The writer has been told a number of stories about the poor performance of their attorneys, which led to their loss in court against civil powerful and politically connected plaintiffs. Many believe, although it must be said without proof, that appearances by their lawyers in court had been working against, in what appeared to be favouring the other side. This is not an isolated story. This is a common complaint the writer has received by aggrieved defendants How much this is a widespread practice, is difficult to ascertain. However, there exists a group of some lawyers who will ‘sell out’ their clients in the Malaysian legal profession today. The independence of the judiciary There is no evidence of members of the judiciary taking biased positions in cases, since Anwar Ibrahim’s sodomy 1 and corruption case in 1999, where he was convicted. However, public observation of case results against VVIPs have created an impression of bias. There is a long history of suspicion of judicial bias in Malaysia, particularly in political cases. This is what makes it very difficult to provide the perception that a judge is above any bias in a 3R case. The judge is a citizen of a state with a Sultan, he or she may personally be acquainted with or even socialise with. Thus, hearing cases in the same state, where any charges involve the current Sultan may prevent any defendant obtaining a fair trial, due to the perception of bias. Law enforcement authorities and prosecution attorneys may feel a misguided sense of duty towards their Sultan, above their duty towards the law. Malaysia is now a country where the fair treatment of a person by the police, investigating authority, and judiciary is suspect. One only has to look at the sentence of two years jail over a defamation case given to British journalist Clare Rewcastle Brown in absentia, over a book outlining corruption and the 1MDB financial scandal. The integrity and ability of a person obtaining a fair hearing in any Malaysian court must be questioned. One cannot even assume safety in detention with a politically biased police institution. Malaysia’s system of justice outwardly appears two-tiered where it’s depends upon who you are, as to the treatment one will receive. Ordinary citizens appear to have little chance of fairness throughout this decadent system. When a single uneducated mother gets 10 months jail for stealing a bottle of coffee and VVIPs get off for stealing billions, not millions, something is wrong. Malaysia has now joined a number of other countries, where lawfare against ‘enemies of the state’ is common practice. The home minister Saifuddin Nasution Ismail who oversees the system has no hesitation in using draconian laws his own political party pledged to repeal before coming to office. Malaysia is not a country one would want to submit themselves to a crooked legal and judicial system and expect a fair hearing.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWcgC_hnYt32F8i6QlmHplcK	2024-12-07T20:25:43-08:00	
Matrilineal Society Of Meghalaya (India): Historical Roots And Co...	In a largely patriarchal society, Meghalaya is one of the northeastern regions of India, stands out as a shining example of matrilineal tradition. The Khasi, Garo, and Jaintia tribes have established a cultural framework that places women at the center of family and social structure in a system where social identity, inheritance, and lineage are carried down through the maternal line. However, the fundamental tenets of the matrilineal system are being questioned as Meghalaya experiences cultural and economic changes brought on by urbanization and globalization. The historical significance of matrilineality in Meghalaya, its changing nature, and the significant obstacles it faces today—particularly with regard to gender roles, political representation, and the effects on women's economic participation—are all covered in this discussion. Meghalaya’s Matrilineal Tradition: Historical Foundations The Khasi, Garo, and Jaintia tribes' cultural and religious traditions are firmly rooted in Meghalaya's matrilineal system, which has long served as a stabilizing influence on the social fabric of the area. With children taking on their mother's surname and property going to the youngest daughter ('Ka Khadduh') to maintain the family's history, this structure demonstrates respect for the maternal line. This system's origins can be found in the agrarian economy of the area, when women's efforts were essential to maintaining household stability and fostering community solidarity. The significance of maternal lineage was further strengthened by indigenous beliefs, such as the worship of the 'Goddess Mother,' which gave this distinctive social structure a spiritual component. The story of the Hynniewtrep ('seven huts') is one example of a folktale that links the Khasi identity to divine beginnings and highlights the sacred role of women as keepers of social and familial continuity.It is important to recognize that the matrilineal system, especially in its original form, has not resulted in women's unrestricted empowerment, despite the seeming respect for women in the home and in society. Women have traditionally held the reins of family power and property inheritance, but males have continued to hold the reins of political power and leadership positions, creating a paradox of gendered authority. Contemporary Challenges Meghalaya's matrilineal system is put to the test as it struggles with contemporary influences, putting its adaptation and tenacity to the test. These issues show themselves in a number of areas, including household decision-making, political representation, and the changing nature of gender roles as a result of globalization. The continued political underrepresentation of women in formal political organizations is one of the most glaring inconsistencies of Meghalaya's matrilineal society. Despite playing a crucial role in inheritance and family, women have had difficulty gaining traction in the political sphere. There are disproportionately more men than women running for office and elected as legislators, according to data from Meghalaya's legislative assembly elections over the years. For example, out of 379 candidates, just three women were elected in the 2023 elections—a stark discrepancy that highlights structural obstacles. Women are frequently excluded from decision-making positions in traditional governing structures like the 'Dorbar Shnong' (Village Councils) and 'Dorbar Kur' (Clan Councils), which are still controlled by men. This exclusion stems from societal traditions that confine women to the home and place a higher value on men's participation in public affairs. Furthermore, this imbalance is further entrenched by cultural norms that prevent women from pursuing political ambitions and political parties' reluctance to recruit female candidates. Women's capacity to influence laws and initiatives that cater to their needs and goals is significantly impacted by their lack of political representation, making it more than just a symbolic problem. The promise of female equality within Meghalaya's matrilineal structure remains unfulfilled in the absence of fair involvement in governance. In the matrilineal society of Meghalaya, women have historically been remained custodians of managing household finances and property. However, because of changing social and economic forces, these roles are becoming more and more threatened. Women's power within households has started to decline due to the increasing presence of men in the workforce and the invasion of patriarchal norms. On the other hand, women have frequently been shouldering the majority of unpaid household labor in rural areas, which declining of their decision making role on account of their economic prospects. This is especially noticeable in areas like West Garo Hills, where women's participation in market operations is impeded by their domestic duties. Although both sexes can technically access marketplaces, the fact that males predominate there adds to the obstacles facing women's economic autonomy. Women are further marginalized by the lack of financial knowledge and educational opportunities, especially in rural areas. As a result, they are less able to pursue jobs in formal industries like banking or finance, which increases their economic reliance and diminishes their sense of independence. The matrilineal customs of Meghalaya's tribes are being challenged by the external values brought about by urbanization and globalization. Local views on gender roles have been progressively impacted by media, migration, and exposure to patriarchal systems from other regions of India. Sensing that the current system disadvantages them, some Khasi males have called for a shift to patrilineal customs because they feel excluded by the traditional inheritance structure. Younger generations have also been impacted by these cultural changes, as they increasingly strive for contemporary lives that might not be consistent with conventions. Meghalayan society must thus do a difficult balancing act since the matrilineal structure is under pressure to change while maintaining its fundamental values. Implications for Gender Equality The paradox of Meghalaya's matrilineal society is that women's marginalization in public and political life coexists with their higher status in inheritance and family responsibilities. This dichotomy emphasizes the necessity of a sophisticated interpretation of gender equality that transcends cultural symbolism. Matrilineality can help women become more powerful, but it cannot provide gender equality in all spheres of life. Women's ability to promote change and fight for their rights is restricted when they are excluded from decision-making positions in both contemporary political systems and traditional institutions. Similarly, the revolutionary potential of the matrilineal framework is undermined by economic restrictions and the enduring patriarchal views. The Way Forward Meghalaya's matrilineal society faces challenges that require a comprehensive strategy that honors traditional practices while integrating progressive reforms. This includes promoting women's political participation, enhancing economic opportunities, and promoting intergenerational dialogue to reconcile traditional values with modern aspirations. Investment in educational and vocational training, particularly in rural regions, is crucial for women's economic independence. Community-driven initiatives can reinforce matrilineal practices while addressing gender role evolution grievances. Promoting gender-sensitive policies is essential to alleviate women's unpaid labor burden and promote an equitable distribution of household responsibilities. Creating platforms that amplify women's voices in policy discussions is crucial for their perspectives to be integral to decision-making. By integrating these strategies, Meghalaya's matrilineal society can evolve while preserving its distinctive traditions and promoting gender equality and inclusive development. Conclusion In conclusion, Meghalaya's matrilineal society, while rich in cultural heritage and offering a unique perspective on gender dynamics, faces significant challenges in the context of modernization and globalization. The need for a comprehensive strategy that honors traditional practices while implementing progressive reforms is paramount. By promoting women's political participation, enhancing economic opportunities, and fostering intergenerational dialogue, Meghalaya can reconcile its cultural identity with contemporary aspirations. Investment in education and vocational training, particularly in rural areas, alongside community-driven initiatives, will be crucial in empowering women and ensuring their voices are heard in decision-making processes. Ultimately, by embracing gender-sensitive policies and creating platforms for women's representation, Meghalaya has the potential to evolve its matrilineal legacy, setting a precedent for gender equality and inclusive development in societies grappling with the balance between tradition and modernity.

Atomic Salvation: Did The Atom Bombs Save 500,000 To 32 Million L...	By Joshua Mawhorter 'I wanted to save a half million boys on our side.... I never lost any sleep over my decision.'—Harry Truman, (quoted in Alfred Steinberg, The Man From Missouri (New York, 1962), p. 259) It is estimated that there were 416,480 American military deaths in WWII. Thus, what we are invited to believe by Truman’s assertion that the atomic bombs saved 500,000 (or many more) American lives is that, had the US invaded Japan, more Americans would have died in such actions than in all the theaters of WWII combined. Further, that prior to the bombs, Truman, Stimson, and Marshall would have approved an invasion plan (as those of Honshu and Kyushu) had they actually believed that 500,000 American deaths would have resulted, as opposed to more likely alternatives prior to invasion. The Bomb and Big Fish Stories Like the tendency of 'who-caught-the-biggest-fish' exaggerations to grow with each next story, it seems that the numbers of the American lives supposedly saved by the alternative of the atomic bomb seems to grow with each retelling! James B. Conant—wanting to get ahead of the story—convinced Secretary of War Stimson to publish an article justifying the use of the bomb. In the article in Harper’s (1947), it was claimed that the bomb probably prevented 'a million more' American casualties. However, in 1946, the United States Strategic Bombing Survey published the following assessment, Based on a detailed investigation of all the facts and supported by the testimony of the surviving Japanese leaders involved, it is the Survey’s opinion that certainly prior to 31 December 1945, and in all probability prior to 1 November 1945, Japan would have surrendered even if the atomic bombs had not been dropped, even if Russia had not entered the war, and even if no invasion had been planned or contemplated. (emphasis added) In light of this early post-war evidence, it is doubtful that such a defeated force could have caused 500,000 American deaths or more. Shortly following Nagasaki, Churchill claimed that the bombings saved well over 1,200,000 Allied lives. In 1953, Winston Churchill wrote, 'To quell the Japanese resistance man by man and conquer the country yard by yard might well require the loss of a million American lives and half that number of British…' (emphasis added). This was based on memories of the Battle of Okinawa (65,631 casualties; 7,374 deaths), thus, nowhere near 500,000 American deaths, let alone 'a million.' While in the White House, Truman usually placed the number of American lives saved around 250,000, and occasionally around 200,000. After leaving the White House, Truman began upping the number to 300,000 lives in the first drafts of his memoirs. In 1955, Truman penned his Memoirs and, in volume 1—Year of Decisions (1955)—he wrote, 'General Marshall told me that it might cost half a million American lives to force the enemy’s surrender on his home grounds.' Truman also wrote a letter in 1953 that appears in The Army Air Force in World War II, Vol. 5, The Pacific, Matterhorn to Nagasaki, June, 1944-August, 1945, in which he stated, I asked General Marshall [at Potsdam] what it would cost in lives to land on the Tokyo plain and other places in Japan. It was his opinion that such an invasion would cost at a minimum a quarter of a million American casualties, and might cost as many as a million, with an equal number of the enemy. The other military men agreed. (emphasis added) Note that Truman admits that General Marshall spoke of casualties, not deaths. Based on the average ratio of casualties to deaths in the Pacific, this would entail about 50,000-250,000 deaths, not the 500,000 Truman would later claim in 1955. For those and other reasons, Barton J. Bernstein argues that, 'The claim of half a million was a post-war creation.' Even though the claim of 500,000 American lives saved by the avoidance of invasion because of the atomic bomb was unwarranted, the counterfactual numbers of lives allegedly saved by the atomic bomb continued to grow. A sampling of secondary school textbooks reported that invasion, instead of the bomb, could have caused the loss of one million American lives. In the Washington Post (December 1, 1991), President George H. W. Bush claimed that the atomic bombs 'spared millions of American lives.' Finally, Tom Lewis wrote Atomic Salvation: How the A-Bomb Attacks Saved the Lives of 32 Million People—described in a sympathetic review as assuming the dichotomy between atomic bomb or invasion without other options, as lacking an index, limited to only English-language sources, mainly built off of secondary works, and using primary sources that provide little insight into American decision-making—counting the total lives saved—American, Japanese, and others. Alternatives and Worst-Case Scenario While such counterfactual claims of lives saved may seem plausible given the viciousness of Pacific warfare, and while we should not fault anyone for a wrong estimate in general, and while history ought to be fair to what was known at the time, the confident claims of 500,000+ American lives saved by the atomic bomb are not only dubious, but were directly contrary to the evidence and estimates at the time. There were various invasion scenarios and, at worst, the American death estimates did not even come close to 500,000. Much of this evidence was unearthed by Gar Alperovitz in his Atomic Diplomacy (1965) and subsequent scholarship. In June 1945, US military planners estimated that, in the worst-case scenario, the most American deaths in an invasion plan amounted to 46,000. On June 15, 1945, the Joint War Plans Committee (JWPC) projected estimates for three invasion scenarios—1) an attack on southern Kyushu, followed by an assault on the Tokyo plain (40,000 dead); 2) an attack on southern Kyushu, followed by northwestern Kyushu (25,000 dead); and, 3) an attack on southern Kyushu, followed by northwestern Kyushu, and then the Tokyo plain (46,000 dead). Barton J. Bernstein concluded, Clearly, all these estimates fell far short—by at least 454,000—of later claims of 500,000 American lives. In fact, in early June 1945, when a layman suggested a high number as a half a million dead, army planners bluntly replied in a secret report: '[such an] estimated loss…is entirely too high.' In private writings soon after Hiroshima and Nagasaki—and thus having little reason to exaggerate numbers—US military leaders agreed that the claim of 500,000 American lives saved was entirely too high. Not only this, but General MacArhtur believed that the casualties and deaths would not be as high as the rate at Normandy and Okinawa (65,631 casualties; 7,374deaths), in fact, he estimated that total casualties would be well under 100,000. This was communicated to the White House by General Marshall. Even the more pessimistic Admiral Leahy—mistakenly overstating Okinawa casualty estimates for reference—suggested that the highest estimate for casualties at Kyushu would possibly be 230,000. Other estimates, based on similar historical documents, argue that 'even in the worst case, [American lives saved] would have been in the range of tens of thousands rather than hundreds of thousands.' The scholarly consensus now asserts that the war would have ended in a relatively short time even without the atomic bombs, that the alternative invasions of Japan would have been unlikely, and that Truman and his advisers were aware of these options. Another scholar, using the facts available at the time, argues the results of the unlikely worst case, If this 'worst-case scenario' had occurred—that is, if the atomic bomb had not worked or had not been used, and if Japan had somehow held out beyond November 1, 1945, and if the successful invasion of southern Kyushu had been carried out, and if the Russians had entered the war in August (as they did) and engaged the Japanese in Manchuria and Korea, and if at that point the Japanese had surrendered—then a reasonable estimate of American deaths almost surely would have been not more than 20,000 and probably less than 15,000 (5,000 for air and naval losses before the invasion, not more than 10,000 during the invasion of Kyushu, and an added allowance of 5,000 for unforeseen losses). (emphasis added) Nevertheless, while it is difficult to backwards project a counterfactual history that did not happen, the fact remains that, 'When Truman approved the order of July 24 to use atomic bombs, he had never received a high-level report suggesting half a million or even a quarter a million U.S. dead.' No US military planner between May 1945 and the period following the bombings would have put the number of American lives saved anywhere near that high. To put it succinctly, 'The myth of 500,000 [let alone millions of] American lives saved thus seems to have no basis in fact.' About the author: Joshua Mawhorter is assistant editor of Mises.org.

Trump’s Victory And The Coming Realignment In Europe – OpEd	By Alexander Brotman Donald Trump’s victory in the 2024 presidential election is likely to spark a realignment in Europe when it comes to defense spending, transatlantic relations, and the future of the conflict and the Euro-Atlantic trajectory of Ukraine. Some NATO member states like Poland and the Baltic states are well positioned, having promoted European self-reliance and increased defense spending for some time, proving themselves as capable partners of both Republican and Democratic administrations. France and Germany are more vulnerable due to fractious internal politics and the collapse of Germany’s fragile coalition government just the day following the US election, with a likely Christian Democratic Union-led government emerging next year. For Europe, Trump’s re-election is a wake-up and a warning call, a signal that the Biden years may not have been a return to normal and that Trump is not an anomaly but representative of a deep-seated feature of US politics. However, NATO’s ‘brain death’ in the words of French President Macron, is far from assured, and while the future of Ukraine is undoubtedly more perilous than it would have been under a Harris administration, Kyiv’s defeat is far from certain. Ukraine may even welcome the unpredictability of the new president, as a recent article in The Economist argued, and while some domestic cabinet posts have sparked controversy, Trump’s picks of Keith Kellogg as special envoy to the Ukraine-Russia conflict, Marco Rubio as Secretary of State, and Mike Waltz as National Security Adviser have been welcome developments. As former Zelensky aide Iuliia Mendel wrote in an op-ed for The Kyiv Post, this moment is also an opportunity for Ukraine to refocus, to recharge, and to recognize that a temporary ceasefire may be necessary. For Mendel, it is a moment for ‘consistency, commitment, and a clear-eyed understanding of the reality’ in Ukraine that calls for nuance and humility, a recognition that the worst headlines may come to pass. The Trump administration will have allies in Ukraine that it did not have previously, those who care deeply about the survival of the Ukrainian state and its people but not at any cost and who operate with a more malleable definition of victory. The Biden administration was rhetorically confident but strategically and militarily cautious on Ukraine. For Kyiv, there is an opportunity under Trump not to capitulate to Russia but to regroup, staying true to its values and identity as a proud European nation with immeasurable strengths to bring to the NATO alliance despite formal transatlantic membership being even further away. In Trump’s victory, the era of transatlanticist US presidents whose views are shaped by and wedded to the post-World War II international order has effectively ended. This does not mean future US presidents won’t view European security and European political issues as critical interests of the United States, but only so far as they are extensions of the national interest. President-elect Trump’s picks of Keith Kellogg and Marco Rubio are likely to favor a strong US presence in NATO while simultaneously advocating for European allies to spend more on their own defense. In December 2023, Congress approved legislation co-sponsored by Rubio and Sen. Tim Kaine (D-VA) that prevents the president from withdrawing the US from NATO without Senate or Congressional approval. There remains broad bipartisan support for NATO in Congress, making it difficult, but not impossible, for Trump to attempt a US withdrawal. The reporting from the Wall Street Journal that the Trump administration’s peace proposal for Ukraine includes a 20-year halt to its NATO membership in exchange for freezing the current lines in the conflict may be a hard pill to swallow but it reflects the political and military realities on the ground. Writing in The National Interest last year, Kellogg countered the notion that Trump would abandon Ukraine, and instead advocated for lifting restrictions on military aid to Ukraine in order to force Putin to consider a peace settlement. This is the ‘escalate to de-escalate’ strategy of the incoming Trump administration that is less of a sophomoric negotiating tactic and more of an unconventional break from strategic orthodoxy that may just win over some prominent leaders in Ukraine. The creation or furtherance of a frozen conflict in Ukraine or any other corner of Europe is a gift to Vladimir Putin that should never be the primary goal of those seeking peace and stability in the region. However, at this stage it doesn’t signal appeasement so much as it reflects NATO’s broader failures in properly integrating and managing its relationship with Ukraine and other aspirant states like Georgia stretching back decades. This month’s European Political Community (EPC) meeting in Budapest provided a glimpse into the mood in Europe towards Trump’s return to power, as well as what is necessary for EU and NATO member states to build greater resilience. President Macron, who organized the EPC in response to Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, asked whether Europeans are ready to defend the interests of Europeans, while including the usual plea for Europe ‘to believe in our sovereignty and strategic autonomy.’ European strategic autonomy has been an agenda item for Macron since he was first elected in 2017, and it remains a complicated idea meaning different things to different EU member states. For Macron, it ultimately means creating the conditions for Europe to act independently of the United States as a geopolitical actor on the world stage. It is something that will take on greater urgency in the second Trump administration, but Macron will not be on the political stage for that much longer and is increasingly seen as a lame-duck leader. It is hard to predict how Europe will look at the end of Trump’s second term in 2028. Leaders like Macron will have left the stage, Ukraine may still be fighting for its survival or be bound to neutrality, and other unforeseen conflicts will likely tear at the fabric of European solidarity. For now, Europe will prepare for unpredictably from both Washington and within its own ranks. President-elect Trump and forces closer to home will question not just Europe’s ability to be a geopolitically independent actor but also its very relevance and will to fight for its interests when under attack. Likewise, Macron’s vision of strategic autonomy is likely to clash with the visions of his political adversaries like France’s National Rally party and Hungary’s Orban. There are nationalistic and more protectionist streaks on both sides of the Atlantic, advocating for a Europe or America first approach, and hopefully meeting when those interests align. Just as Europe cannot afford to pull up the drawbridge, Washington cannot afford to construct more moats. Whether there is friction or fraternity between Washington and various European capitals, there is now the clear recognition that Trump is not an aberration and cannot be treated as such. For Europe, it is a moment of supreme clarity that should necessitate an era of supreme conviction.

The Sectarian Risk: Turkey’s Syrian Mission – OpEd	Turkey’s Recep Tayyip Erdoğan must be delighted about what is unfolding in Syria, though it is a feeling bound to be tempered by swiftly changing circumstances. Iran’s Shia proxies have been weakened by relentless Israeli targeting and bombing. Russia’s eyes and resources are turned towards war in Ukraine. With reports that Syrian rebel groups are now fighting on the outskirts of the capital Damascus, the Assad regime looks frail, its leader either in hiding or evacuated. In the salad mix of jihadis, nationalists, and run of the mill mercenaries, Turkey’s hand looms large. It’s intervention in Syria’s conflict was motivated by two main goals: the containment, if not elimination of Kurdish militants in northern Syria, seen as indistinguishable from their PKK (Kurdistan Workers’ Party) counterparts in Turkey itself, and creating conditions of stability or 'safe zones' that would enable a return of Syrian refugees when feasible. Since August 2016, Turkey has made three incursions seizing parts of Syria’s north, imposing an occupation using regular troops and auxiliary forces including the Syrian National Army (SNA) and a coalition of groups comprising former Free Syrian Army (FSA) fighters. In 2018, the Military Police was established by both Turkish authorities and the Syrian Interim Government (SIG), a force ostensibly intended to protect the civilian population. Instead, this period of Turkish rule has been marked by brutality, repression and sheer neglect. In its February 2024 report, Human Rights Watch documented instances of abductions, arbitrary arrests, unlawful detentions (these include children), sexual violence and torture. The perpetrators spanned elements of the SNA, the Military Police, members of the Turkish Armed Forces, the Turkish National Intelligence Organisation (Milli İstihbarat Teşkilatı, MİT), and various military intelligence directorates. To this colourfully gruesome range of cruelties can be added the abuse of property rights, looting, pillaging, confiscation of property, extortion and the absence of any consistent system of restitution. The group enduring the heaviest burden of suffering are Kurdish residents, notably those that had received protection from the US-backed Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) comprising the People’s Protection Unit (Yekineyen Parastina Gel, YPG), and the Women’s Protection Unit (Yekineyen Parastina Jin). These forces proved crucial in countering the Islamic State (ISIS) group. In October this year, Erdoğan reiterated the long held view that such Kurdish protective units were merely 'the Syrian branch of the PKK terror group, destined to be abandoned, left isolated.' Arabs and other groups seen as having links to the SDF and the Autonomous Administration of Northeast Syria (AANES), have also been targets of Turkish-led ire. The SNA is no friend of the headline grabbing Islamist outfit, Hayat Tahrir-al Sham (HTS), the primary spear in the lighting operation against the Assad regime. HTS has marketed itself as a self-sufficient, modern, more considered group, less fire and brimstone from its al-Qaeda and al-Nusra iterations and supposedly more tolerant to other religions, sects and views. Its leader, Abu Mohammad Al-Jolani, has managed to receive praise and plaudits in the Western media for that change, despite his listing by the US State Department as a 'Specially Designated Global Terrorist' worthy of a $10 million reward to anyone willing to offer information leading to his capture. Even on the progress of HTS, Turkish influence cannot be discounted, despite Ankara eschewing open support for the group. As Fuad Shahbazov, writing for the Stimson Center remarks, the recent advances of HTS 'would have been unthinkable without Turkey’s military and logistical backing, and provision of advanced weaponry.' It has also been suggested that Ankara gave a nod of approval to the offensive led by HTS after it failed to secure a rapprochement with Assad. Erdoğan’s statements on the advance show a slippery mind in operation. On December 6, he told reporters after Friday prayers that the target of the offensive was evidently Damascus. 'I would say we hope for this advance to continue without any issues.' But he also expressed the view that these advances were 'problematic' and 'not in a manner we desire'. While not elaborating on that point, it could be gleaned from the remarks that he is concerned about various 'terrorist organisations' operating in the rebel forces. The next day, the Turkish President decided to be lofty in his assessment as the rebels entered the suburbs of Homs. 'There is now a new reality in Syria, politically and diplomatically,' he declared in a speech delivered in the southern Turkish city of Gaziantep. 'And Syria belongs to Syrians with all its ethnic, sectarian and religious elements.' In keeping with the views of other leaders responsible for intervening in the affairs of another state, Erdoğan spoke of Syrian independence as viable, the will of its people as inviolable. 'The people of Syria are the ones who will decide the future of their own country.' He hoped that the country would 'quickly regain the peace, stability, and tranquillity it has been longing for 13 years.' He went on to remark that 'responsible actors and all international organisations' should support the preservation of the state’s territorial integrity. The audacity of such statements does nothing to conceal the sectarian and ethnic dangers unfolding at the end of this Ankara-sponsored mission. The fall of Bashir al-Assad will imperil Shia communities and do even more harm to the Kurds, leaving the door open for Salafism. The rebel groups, only united by the common cause of overthrowing Assad, may well find battling each other hard to avoid. As for the territorial integrity Erdoğan speaks of, Turkish officialdom and policy will never wear it short of any number of guarantees Ankara is bound to extort on hefty terms. And as for refugees? Expect many more to gush out in desperation.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWcgC_hnYt32F8-9T5C7JsAl	2024-12-07T20:21:01-08:00	
Israeli-Palestinian Conflict: Right To Statehood Or Recipe For Ne...	By Dr Alon Ben-Meir Trump, who wants an end to the Israeli-Hamas war even before he reassumes the Presidency, must know that denying the Palestinian right to statehood and conceding further Palestinian land in the West Bank and Gaza to Israel is a recipe for the next horrific inferno that will overshadow even the present calamitous Israel-Hamas war Hamas’ horrific October 7 attack and Israel’s massive retaliatory war have fundamentally changed the dynamic of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Returning to the status quo that existed before October 7 will be impossible. New political, psychological, and factual regional conditions have been created that cannot be ignored, as they directly impacted not only Israeli-Palestinian relations for a generation but also the regional stability fed by power dynamics and rivalries between the states in the area. Given these new regional dynamics, Trump will have to choose between paving the way toward the establishment of a Palestinian state or setting the stage for the next catastrophic conflagration that will dwarf the current Israeli-Hamas war. Trump and his team should carefully consider the following seven crucial changes in regional dynamics if he wants to prevent another catastrophic war and revive 'the deal of the century,' however remote it may seem at this particular juncture. Hamas’ Massacre and its Psychological Implications It is hard to overestimate the psychological ramifications of Hamas’ October 7 attack on the Israeli mindset as it brought to life images from the Holocaust. In many ways, it reaffirmed Netanyahu’s misleading two-decades-long public narrative and reinforced the pervasive Israeli public mindset that the Palestinians posed a perpetual threat to Israel’s national security. Thus, more than any time before, any effort made by the Trump team that could lead to a two-state solution will face vehement Israeli resistance. This can be mitigated once the Israelis come to terms with the fact that their ultimate national security rests on the establishment of a Palestinian state, firmly tied to comprehensive security arrangements to allay the ingrained psychological impediment among the Israelis. The Israeli War of Retaliation Although Israel has the right to defend itself, its war against Hamas was disproportionate even compared to the gruesome Hamas attack. By all accounts, the unprecedented destruction rained on Gaza and the death of over 43,000, nearly half of them women and children, only attest to the desire for revenge and retribution and disregard for innocent human lives. Not since Israel’s war of independence in 1948, and especially under the 57-year-long occupation, has the hatred, distrust and violence been intensified between the two sides; Israel’s relationship with the Palestinians has reached a new nadir. Ninety percent of all Palestinians were born under occupation, and the Israel-Hamas war only accelerated the rise of a new hopeless and despairing generation of Palestinian youth for whom jihad and martyrdom are not slogans. Their life mission will be dedicated to avenging what has befallen them, and the harsher measures Israel employs, the more intense and deadly their resistance will be until they realize their national aspiration. Mutual Realization that Neither can Destroy the Other After 14 months of a brutal war that exacted a horrific toll in blood and treasure, both sides have failed to achieve their stated objective. Even if Israel captures or kills every Hamas combatant, it cannot liquidate it as a national movement and as an idea. Hamas will survive any losses and terrorize Israel for as long as it takes, albeit knowing that Israel is a formidable military power, far beyond their reach to destroy now or at any time in the future. This mutual realization has changed the conflict’s dynamic. Though nearly decimated, Hamas largely achieved its goal. It has fundamentally shaken the status quo and made an unequivocal statement that the Palestinian cause will no longer be ignored. It has set the stage for a breakthrough in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict if Trump seizes the opportunity. The role of Saudi Arabia Before the eruption of the Israel-Hamas war, the US had been negotiating the normalization of relations between Israel and Saudi Arabia. At the time, the Saudis were willing to settle for a vague commitment by Israel ‘to make major progress toward a solution to the Palestinian conflict.’ But as the horror of the war in Gaza unfolded, the Saudis changed their position, mainly due to the public’s outcry about what the Palestinians have tragically endured. Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman (MBS) publicly stated, 'The Kingdom will not cease its tireless efforts to establish an independent Palestinian state with East Jerusalem as its capital, and we affirm that the kingdom will not establish diplomatic relations with Israel without one' [emphasis added]. It should be noted that such a statement from MBS is not political posturing. Saudi Arabia is the leader of Sunni Islam worldwide, making it difficult for MBS to renege and settle for a vague reference to the Palestinians’ right to statehood, making him feel obligated to play a central role toward that end. Jordan’s Growing Trepidation The implications of the Gaza war for Jordan are profound and multifaceted. The kingdom faces significant challenges in maintaining internal stability amid rising public anger towards Israel. Jordan must balance its historical commitments to the Palestinian cause and its peace treaty with Israel while managing complex regional dynamics. There are fears of a spillover of refugees from the West Bank and Gaza into Jordan, which can destabilize Jordan, especially if Israel annexes further Palestinian territories in the West Bank. Recently, the far-right Israeli Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich declared before a meeting of his Religious Zionism party that '2025 is the year of sovereignty in Judea and Samaria,' resurrecting the notion that 'Jordan is Palestine,' which terrifies the Kingdom. The ongoing conflicts could also increase militant activity and exacerbate existing vulnerabilities, particularly among Jordanian youth. Moreover, regional dynamics involving Iran and other actors further complicate Jordan’s position, which compels the kingdom to navigate threats from Iranian proxies while managing its relationships with Israel, Western allies, and neighboring Arab states. Nothing would allay the Jordanian fears and prevent regional uproar but the creation of a Palestinian state. International Recognition of a Palestinian State One hundred forty-six countries have recognized the Palestinian state, which is a significant step because it legitimizes the Palestinians’ right to statehood and places Palestine on equal footing with other states. It allows countries to establish diplomatic relations and facilitate direct economic ties, sending a clear message to Israel about international support for Palestinian statehood. Of special significance is that three Western European countries, Ireland, Norway, and Spain, have recognized Palestine this year, which may encourage other European states to follow suit. There is no escaping the reality that the Palestinians have made significant inroads into the international arena in support of a Palestinian state. The Israeli Government The current Israeli government led by Netanyahu is unmatched as the most extremist right-wing government since Israel’s creation. It is bent on annexing most of the West Bank and reestablishing Israeli settlements in Gaza. Two of its most radical right-wing ministers, National Security Minister Ben-Gvir and Finance Minister Smotrich have stated that the Palestinians, not Israel, are the occupiers of Jewish land. Smotrich recently said, 'The new Nazis need to pay a price through land that will be permanently taken from them, both in Gaza and in Judea and Samaria… we were just a step away from applying sovereignty over the settlements in Judea and Samaria, and now the time has come to do it.' Ben-Gvir and Smotrich were salivating to recall the 2019 statement of Mike Huckabee, Trump’s nominee for US Ambassador to Israel, that he believes Israel has the right to annex significant parts of the West Bank and added that there was no such thing as a settlement or even a Palestinian people. And Steven Witkoff, whom Trump appointed as his special envoy to the Middle East, is also a staunch supporter of Israel. For Netanyahu, these appointees’ positions align ideologically with his government’s policies. There is nothing more ominous for Israel if, indeed, the government implements such a plan that will shatter the Palestinians’ final glimmer of hope, as it will lead to horrific consequences unless Trump prevents it from happening. Trump Faces a Historic Opportunity Trump may well be in the best position to start a genuine Israeli-Palestinian peace process that will eventually lead to Palestinian statehood. Given his commitment to Israel’s security and well-being, he must not allow Israel to annex any more territory in the West Bank or resettle in Gaza, as this will only set the stage for the next horrific conflagration and throw the entire region into unprecedented turmoil. Being an ardent supporter of Israel, and due to the affinity that most Israelis hold towards him, Trump is in a much stronger position than many of his predecessors, not only to call for a two-state solution but act on it. During his first term in office, Trump put forward a peace deal that recognized Palestinian statehood, which was a sharp departure from past proposals; it did not call for the evacuation of Israeli settlements, which is supported by a vast majority of Israelis. Working toward Palestinian statehood would dramatically allay the Jordanians’ deep anxiety about their country’s stability, meet the Saudis’ demand to establish a Palestinian state as a prerequisite to the normalization of relations with Israel, give hope to the Palestinians that the day of their salvation is near, and temper extremism and anti-Israeli sentiments while depriving Iran and its 'axis of resistance' from exploiting the Israeli-Palestinian conflict to advance their regional agendas. The biggest obstacle Trump will face is the current Israeli government, which has sworn to never allow the creation of a Palestinian state. They seem to have learned nothing from decades of occupation that has only intensified Palestinian militancy, culminating in Hamas’ savagery and Israel’s retaliatory war. Now, this messianic government wants to annex much of the West Bank, resettle in Gaza, and plunge Israel into interminable violence and destruction unseen before. Indeed, whereas Israel can prevail over any external enemy, the enemy from within is the current Israeli government, which must be dislodged before any agreement can be reached. For Trump to revive the 'deal of the century,' he will have to go over the head of Netanyahu and address the Israeli public directly and point out the stark reality that the Israelis have and continue to be oblivious to but must live with. He should emphasize that: Nearly seven million Palestinians are living in the West Bank, Gaza and Israel proper, which is equal to the number of Jews living in Israel and the West Bank. By what means and for how much longer, he must ask, can Israel dominate and oppress the Palestinians of an equivalent population with no endgame in sight? Ninety percent of all Palestinians were born under occupation; they will deprive Israel of a day of peace until they free themselves from the shackles of the occupation that has dehumanized them and robbed them of their dignity. Coexistence is not one of many options; it is the only option. The Israelis must choose to live in peace or maintain a state of constant hostilities while poisoning one generation after another to be consumed by hatred and disdain toward the Palestinians. Israel has lost much of its moral international standing and more tragically, it is losing its very reason for being. An increasing number of diaspora Jewry feel betrayed by the country they viewed as the sanctuary for any Jew who wants to live in peace and security. Conclusion It is impossible to overestimate the intractable issues between Israel and the Palestinians that must be addressed to reach a peace agreement. But however painful that might be, it will pale if compared to the alternative of continuing death and destruction that will destroy one generation after another. Trump faces a historic opportunity. He can lay the foundation for a Palestinian state or set the stage for the next catastrophic war. His appointment of an extraordinarily supportive team of Israel gives him the latitude and credibility to persuade the Israelis that only a two-state solution offers them peace and security, and his 'Deal of the Century' provides the framework to that end.

How Corruption Permeates Iran’s Ruling System – OpEd	For years, the fabric of the mullahs’ regime ruling Iran has been intertwined with corruption and plunder. Even regime supreme leader Ali Khamenei admitted during the anniversary of the anti-monarchical revolution in 2018: 'Corruption is like the mythical seven-headed dragon; when you cut off one head, the other six continue to move.' However, this dragon has not only persisted but has grown larger and more monstrous each year, continuing to steal the wealth of the people. The agents of the clerical regime themselves admit that 'corruption has struck at the roots of the system.' On September 1, 2016, the state-run Mardomsalari news website wrote, 'Not a day goes by without news of financial abuse, embezzlement, or massive bribery being heard. The figures have numbed the minds of the people, to the point where even mathematics cannot express them anymore.' The cancer of corruption has spread throughout the system. Even Mohammad Javad Hojjati Kermani, a close associate of Khamenei, admitted, 'The cancer of corruption has engulfed the entire system, ranging from moral decline and hypocrisy to economic corruption and internal conflicts' (Source: Ettelaat newspaper, August 19, 2019). However, the severity and depth of regime corruption from those years to the present day is incomparable. According to a report by the Transparency Lab on February 7, 2023, corruption in Iran’s ruling system is defined as 'the legal or illegal misuse of power for personal or factional interests, or to strengthen the power of the political structure.' The corruption dominating the structural and systemic relations of the regime has become so pervasive and deep-rooted that terms like 'under-the-table payment,' 'tea money,' 'kids’ share,' and 'sweetener,' or more bluntly, 'bribe,' are familiar to many Iranian citizens dealing with government offices. The main institutions and organizations that demand bribes from ordinary citizens include 'municipalities, the police force, courts, banks, the tax authority, brokers and intermediaries of organizations and high-ranking officials, customs offices, the tax department, real estate registration offices, civil registry offices, and banks. These entities have been at the forefront of those where administrative obstacles are easily removed through the payment of bribes, and they have contaminated other governmental agencies as well' (Source: Open Data, April 27, 2021). Economist Ahmad Alavi states: 'Systemic corruption in Iran still has many unknown dimensions that account for much of the imbalances in the Iranian economy, such as budgetary discrepancies, energy shortages, issues with pensions, and banking sector crises. What is observed and experienced as corruption is merely a small part, or the ‘tip of the iceberg,’ emerging from the sea of corruption' (Source: Iran-e Emrooz, November 24). According to Alavi, the regime operates based on a 'model of economic rentierism, where oil revenues and other key national resources are allocated not for sustainable development but to maintain the loyalty of officials, supporters of the Supreme Leader, and to strengthen power factions. This allocation also funds soft and hard repression and the export of the Supreme Leader’s ideological discourse. Institutions like the Islamic Revolution Guard Corps (IRGC), semi-private companies, and religious foundations dominate much of the economy, effectively eliminating transparency, accountability, and competition.' Not long ago, Ali Rabiei, the Minister of Labor during Hassan Rouhani’s presidency (2013-2021), revealed that a member of parliament had offered 500 billion rials in exchange for a managerial position in the Social Security Investment Company (Shasta). On November 25, Sazandegi news website quoted Rabiei as saying, 'Not a week goes by without receiving at least two confidential reports of corruption within the companies affiliated with the Ministry of Labor.' Mohammad Bagher Ghalibaf, speaker of Majlis (Parliament), also presented another example of government corruption: 'Between 25 to 30 million liters of fuel are smuggled out of the country daily. Make no mistake; this smuggling is organized, and the primary producers and major consumers are the first suppliers of this smuggling' (Source: Jahan-e Sanat news website, November 27). On November 27, a reporter at Rouydad 24 website wrote, 'At a meeting of media managers, I seized the opportunity to raise an issue I found critical: the problem of social anger. A powerful feeling told me that this anger poses dangerous consequences for the country, and action must be taken urgently to address it. During the session, I asked Mr. Ghalibaf, ‘What is your share and that of your allies and opponents in creating these conditions? The country is at the edge of a cliff, where even a single grain of sand slipping could lead to a collapse.''	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWcgC_hnYt32F0o5ujm5ZI0e	2024-12-07T20:17:55-08:00	
Uzbekistan: Demands To Reopen, Not Demolish, Church And Mosque – ...	By Mushfig Bayram Urgench Council of Churches Baptist Church and Tashkent's Shaykhontohur District Imam al-Bukhari Mosque are being simultaneously demolished. The Baptist Church is being demolished by the Bailiff's Department, and the Mosque by an unknown person or company with the full co-operation of the regime. By 5 December most of the roof, walls, and floors of the Baptist Church were destroyed, and most of the walls, roof, and dome of the Mosque were destroyed. Baptists and Muslims in both cities insist to Forum 18 that they want the demolitions stopped and their buildings returned, so they can use them to meet for worship. On 25 April 2024, two buildings under construction belonging to Urgench Council of Churches Baptists were ordered to be destroyed and were partially demolished. The demolition was halted after protests, but the Baptists were not permitted to repair the damage or complete the construction of the buildings. Regime officials stated, though, that they are 'determined to complete the demolition sooner or later'. This threat is now being carried out. On 4 December, Bailiffs came with police and demolition vehicles and equipment to destroy the buildings. By 5 December most of the roof, walls, and floors of the Baptist Church were destroyed. The regime is 'intent on tearing down the second building after finishing the destruction of the first building', Baptists said (see below). On 2 December, the person Baptists bought the land for their Church from received a letter from Dovron Aitov of Urgench Bailiffs Department that the Department will demolish the buildings, Baptists who wish to remain anonymous for fear of state reprisals told Forum 18. None of the other owners of buildings on adjoining land bought from him are being threatened with demolition (see below). Local Baptists told Forum 18 that both the buildings, one of which was close to completion for use as a church, are one-storey buildings which are each about 270 square meters (2,900 square feet) in area. Local Baptists insist to Forum 18 that they want the demolition stopped and their buildings restored, so they can use them to meet for worship (see below). Neither Bailiff Aitov, nor Khorasm Regional Bailiffs Department, nor the Land Cadastre Department answered their phones whenever Forum 18 called between 5 and 6 December (see below). Tashkent's Shaykhontohur District's Muhammad Ismoil Mosque, known locally as the Imam al-Bukhari Mosque, is also being demolished at the same time as the Urgench Baptist Church. The building is being demolished by an unknown company or person with the full co-operation of the regime, Muslims who wished to remain anonymous for fear of state reprisals told Forum 18. Sometimes the Mosque had as many as 2,000 Muslims coming to worship before it was closed, local Muslims told Forum 18. The Mosque is a roughly 25 metre (27 yard) high brick building, which is about 900 meters (9,700 square feet) in area, local Muslims said. Demolition of the Mosque began on 27 November, witnesses told Forum 18. By 5 December almost half of the Mosque building - including most of the walls, roof, and dome - had been demolished. Local Muslims have insisted to Forum 18 that they want the demolition stopped and their Mosque restored, so they can use it to meet for worship (see below). The Imam al-Bukhari Mosque was opened in 1995 but forcibly closed by the regime in 2009. Police 'without giving any explanation came one day and told the Imam that the Mosque will be closed down.' One of the Muslims stated that 'we were not happy, but local police falsely told local residents that the Mosque will reopen soon.' Another Muslim told Forum 18 that 'we all were very unhappy our Mosque was closed down in 2009, and we made many official complaints to the authorities.' Local police visited the mahalla several times after the complaints to talk to residents. 'Each time they promised that it would reopen. Just be patient, they told us. But they were lying' (see below). Tashkent Administration in 2016 transferred the mosque and its land to a car wash company, which in 2022 sold it on to an unknown person or company. Demolition workers in December 2024 also refused to reveal the identity of the new owner to local residents, but said that a business centre will be built on the land (see below). The new owner also attempted to demolish the Mosque in 2023, but did not do this after local residents wrote many complaints to local prosecutors and the Prosecutor General's Office (see below). A human rights defender, who asked to remain anonymous for fear of state reprisals, linked the demolition of Tashkent's Shaykhontohur District Imam al-Bukhari Mosque to Prime Minister Abdulla Aripov's June 2024 statement threatening to confiscate mosques for business use. 'This could have encouraged the owner to demolish the Mosque now,' the human rights defender told Forum 18 on 5 December. Muslims, who asked to remain anonymous for fear of state reprisals, have told Forum 18 that they have observed that the demolition is being carried out with the full co-operation of the police (see below). No official answered their phones whenever Forum 18 called between 5 and 6 December. A wide range of religious communities continue to be blocked from using or repairing their own buildings, forcibly closed, gaining state registration, or having their grounds seized without compensation. Urgench Baptist Church's buildings being demolished On 25 April 2024, two buildings under construction belonging to Urgench Council of Churches Baptists were ordered to be destroyed and were partially demolished. The demolition was halted after protests, but they are not being permitted to repair the damage or complete the construction of the buildings, local Baptists told Forum 18 on 21 November. Regime officials stated, though, that they are 'determined to complete the demolition sooner or later'. This threat is now being carried out (see below). Local Baptists told Forum 18 that both the buildings, one of which was close to completion for use as a church, are one-storey buildings which are each about 270 square meters (2,900 square feet) in area. Khorezm Regional Administration officials, and Zafarbek Khojaniyazov of the Land Cadastre Department (who is responsible for dealing with complaints), did not answer their phones whenever Forum 18 contacted them between 21 and 25 November. So Forum 18 was not able to ask them why they are refusing to give permission for the Baptists to repair the damage the regime has caused and complete the construction work. The Baptists bought a plot of land from local resident Atajan Kurbanov in Shakkasholikor village of Urgench District on the southern edge of the city's airport in early 2023. Kurbanov sold part of the land to the Baptists and the rest to other people. Many of the purchasers then constructed buildings on their newly-acquired land. Baptists bought the land and constructed the buildings with donations from fellow believers. 'We have all the legal papers that we can construct the buildings on the land,' local Baptist Konstantin Kim told Forum 18 in August 2024. Yet, on 2 December, Kurbanov received a letter from Dovron Aitov of Urgench Bailiffs Department that the Department will demolish the buildings, Baptists who wish to remain anonymous for fear of state reprisals told Forum 18 on 5 December. None of the other owners of buildings on adjoining land bought from Kurbanov are being threatened with demolition. On 4 December, Bailiffs came with police and demolition vehicles and equipment to destroy the building. By 5 December most of the roof, walls, and floors of the Baptist Church were destroyed. The regime is 'intent on tearing down the second building after finishing the destruction of the first building', Baptists added. Local Baptists insist to Forum 18 that they want the demolition stopped and their buildings restored, so they can use them to meet for worship. Neither Bailiff Aitov nor Khorezm Regional Bailiffs Department answered their phones whenever Forum 18 rang between 5 and 6 December. Khojaniyazov of the Land Cadastre Department (who is responsible for dealing with complaints) also did not answer his phone whenever Forum 18 called between 5 and 6 December. Tashkent's Shaykhontohur District's Imam al-Bukhari Mosque also being demolished Tashkent's Shaykhontohur District's Imam al-Bukhari Mosque, on the inner ring road to the west of the city centre, is being demolished by an unknown company or person with the full co-operation of the regime, Muslims who wished to remain anonymous for fear of state reprisals told Forum 18. Demolition of the Muhammad Ismoil Mosque, known locally as the Imam al-Bukhari Mosque, began on 27 November, witnesses told Forum 18. By 5 December almost half of the Mosque building including most of the walls, roof, and dome had been demolished. Local Muslims insist to Forum 18 that they want the demolition stopped and their Mosque restored, so they can use it to meet for worship. Mosque opened in 1995, forcibly closed in 2009 The Muhammad Ismoil (Imam al-Bukhari) Mosque was recognised by the state-controlled Religious Affairs Committee on 5 June 1995, and the Tashkent Justice Department registered the Mosque on 15 April 1999. The Religious Affairs Committee appointed an imam for the Mosque in 1995, Imam Muhammad Rakhmonov who was from the same mahalla (local district) as the Mosque. 'Respected elders of our mahalla spent their own money to buy the land in 1991 and paid for the construction of the Mosque,' local Muslims, who asked to remain anonymous for fear of state reprisals, told Forum 18 on 4 December 2024. They stated that sometimes the Mosque had as many as 2,000 Muslims coming to worship. The Mosque is a roughly 25 metre (27 yard) high L-shaped brick building, on a 900 square meters (9,700 square feet) site, local Muslims said. However, in 2009 the regime forcibly closed the Mosque. Police 'without giving any explanation came one day and told the Imam that the Mosque will be closed down'. One of the Muslims stated that 'we were not happy, but local police falsely told local residents that the Mosque will reopen soon.' Another Muslim told Forum 18 that 'we all were very unhappy our Mosque was closed down in 2009, and we made many official complaints to the authorities.' Local police visited the mahalla several times after the complaints to talk to residents. 'Each time they promised that it would reopen. Just be patient, they told us. But they were lying.' Transfer to car wash company, then sold on to unknown owner Tashkent Administration on 23 September 2016 transferred the mosque and its land to a car wash company. The owner of the company told Forum 18 on 4 December that in 2022 he sold the land and Mosque to another person. When Forum 18 asked the car wash company's owner how Tashkent Administration could give him the Mosque and its land, and who the person he sold it to is, he did not answer and put the phone down. Local residents told Forum 18 that they know of this 2022 sale, but do not know the identity of the new owner. Demolition workers in December 2024 also refused to reveal the identity of the new owner to local residents, but said that a business centre will be built on the land. The new owner also attempted to demolish the Mosque in 2023, but did not do this after local residents wrote many complaints to local prosecutors and the Prosecutor General's Office. In written 2023 replies (which Forum 18 has seen), both Tashkent Deputy Prosecutor, E. Inamjanov and City Prosecutor Erkin Yuldashev claimed that Tashkent Administration's decisions are lawful as no claims were made about the ownership of the land and building in due time. Both Prosecutors stated that Shaykhontohur Inter-District Civil Court on 14 February 2011 confiscated the land and the Mosque building for the state. Neither the Prosecutor General's Office, nor Tashkent Prosecutor's Office, answered their phones whenever Forum 18 called between 5 and 6 December 2024. Abdurakhim Kadyrov of the Religious Affairs Committee's section responsible for work with Mosques confirmed to Forum 18 on 29 November that the Mosque was registered until 2009, when its registration was revoked. He would not explain why the Committee has done nothing to help the Mosque or stop the demolition. 'Those decisions were made not by us but by Tashkent Administration. You need to talk to them,' he claimed. Neither Tashkent Administration nor Shaykhontohur District Administration answered their phones whenever Forum 18 called between 3 and 6 December. In another Tashkent place of worship demolition case, it was suggested confidentially to Forum 18 that corruption may have been a factor in a long-threatened demolition by a private company of Tashkent's Ashkenazi Synagogue. No official was willing to explain how a company could be handed property that belongs to a religious organisation whose ownership is recorded on the State Land Registry. The threat to the synagogue was only withdrawn in August 2020after the case attracted international attention. Corruption has long been endemic in the country, including in relation to freedom of religion or belief violations. Many are reluctant to discuss corruption as a factor in the human rights violations they experience, yet there appears to be a strong connection between human rights violations and corruption. Prime Minister orders mosques to be seized, demolished, handed over to business use On 24 June 2024, Prime Minister Abdulla Aripov ordered the seizure and possible demolition of more than 400 unregistered mosques and houses, built by residents but not registered with the Justice Ministry. Some of the buildings to be seized were to be given to entrepreneurs for commercial use. In mid-July, a State Security Service (SSS) secret police officer and an official of the local Administration's Religious Affairs Department came to Abu Zar Mosque in Yangiyul District of Tashkent Region. They said that as the Mosque is not functioning, it will be handed over for business use. A local Muslim linked the move to the Prime Minister's reported 24 June order that unregistered Mosques should be demolished or handed over for business use. Abu Zar Mosque, built with state permission, functioned from the 1990s. The regime closed the mosque in 2007 and it has not functioned since then, despite campaigns by local Muslims to reopen it. When Forum 18 in April pointed out to Jakhongir Azomkhanov, Tashkent Regional Administration's official overseeing freedom of religion or belief issues, that the Abu Zar Mosque was built by the mosque community who would like to pray every day in their own mosque, and that travel to other mosques can be difficult, Azomkhanov did not address those points. On 21 November he refused to speak to Forum 18 about the continued forced closure of the Mosque. Why is Imam al-Bukhari Mosque being demolished now? A human rights defender, who asked to remain anonymous for fear of state reprisals, linked the demolition of Tashkent's Shaykhontohur District Imam al-Bukhari Mosque to Prime Minister Abdulla Aripov's latest statement about confiscating mosques for business use. 'This could have encouraged the owner to demolish the Mosque now,' they told Forum 18 on 5 December. Muslims, who asked to remain anonymous for fear of state reprisals, told Forum 18 that they have observed that the demolition is being carried out with the full co-operation of the police. Prime Minister Aripov's Office did not answer their phones whenever Forum 18 called between 5 December and 6 December. Local Muslims have insist to Forum 18 that they want the demolition stopped and their Mosque restored, so they can use it to meet for worship.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWcgC_hnYt32F08AVxfHsWeX	2024-12-07T20:16:10-08:00	
Peace Dividend: 80 Years Of US-Saudi Relations – OpEd	By Jonathan Gornall On Feb. 14, 2025, it will be exactly 80 years since King Abdulaziz of Saudi Arabia stepped aboard a US warship moored in the Suez Canal for a historic meeting with American President Franklin D. Roosevelt.Roosevelt had a great deal on his mind.In Europe, where Soviet troops were within 60 km of Berlin, the Second World War was drawing to its bloody conclusion, but in the Far East the conflict was a long way from ending.As he welcomed King Abdulaziz aboard the USS Quincy in Egypt’s Great Bitter Lake, Roosevelt knew that in five days’ time thousands of US Marines would die in a costly battle to seize the Pacific island of Iwo Jima.The storming of the island of Okinawa, the last battle before an anticipated invasion of the Japanese home islands, would follow on April 1. This would prove even more bloody, costing the lives of 100,000 American and Japanese soldiers.The president, who in 1942 had launched the top-secret Manhattan Project, was wrestling with an epoch-defining decision: whether to end the war by using the world’s first nuclear weapons.But in February 1945, Roosevelt, on his way back to the US from the Yalta conference of the soon-to-be-victorious Allies, made time to meet the man known in the West as Ibn Saud — the enigmatic leader who in 1932 had successfully united the tribes of Najd and Hijaz under the banner of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.Roosevelt knew that, even as the Second World War was drawing to a close, in the wings a new world order was taking shape — and that Saudi Arabia was a nation that the US needed to befriend.The president did not have long to live — in two months’ time he would be dead. But the meeting with King Abdulaziz was the first step toward a close relationship between the two countries that has endured for the past eight decades.Eighty years is a mere blink of the eye of time — there are Saudis alive today who were alive when the president met the king. Yet in that time the Kingdom has developed beyond all recognition, and its influence on the world stage has grown exponentially.On the eve of a new year fraught with uncertainty, that influence is set to play a pivotal role in the thinking of key players, including the new US president-elect, as the Middle East seeks to turn its back on death and destruction and looks forward with hope to a future of peace and prosperity.It was not by chance that during his first presidency President Donald Trump’s first official overseas trip, in May 2017, was to Saudi Arabia. At the time the visit was portrayed in Western media as a departure from diplomatic norms, but in fact since 1974 no fewer than eight US presidents have followed Roosevelt eastward and walked on Saudi soil in recognition of the reality that the Kingdom is an influential locus of security and stability in an otherwise troubled and unstable region.It is not yet known where President-elect Trump’s travels will take him after his inauguration on Jan. 20. But what is clear is that his administration will be looking toward Saudi Arabia as a key partner in Trump’s declared intention to end the war in Palestine and Lebanon swiftly. The Americans are not alone in looking to Saudi Arabia as a vital partner in diplomacy and commerce, as the recent appearances of British Princess Beatrice at the Future Investment Initiative in Riyadh and, with her sister Princess Eugenie, at the World Economic Forum meeting in the city in April testify.The upcoming visit to the Kingdom of British Prime Minister Keir Starmer is further evidence of the extent to which the polarity of the relationship between the two countries has reversed since the days when Britain rather highhandedly considered the Arabian Peninsula to be within its sphere of influence.Eighty years ago, Roosevelt saw that the postwar world would become increasingly dependent on the emerging oil reserves of Saudi Arabia and the other Gulf states.But his meeting with King Abdulaziz in 1945 had a second purpose — to persuade the most influential leader on the Arabian Peninsula that, in the wake of the Nazi persecution of Europe’s Jews, Palestine should become a Jewish homeland.On this matter the king was adamant, and prescient.At their meeting, with his words recorded by an American translator, the Saudi ruler had told Roosevelt that 'amends should be made by the criminal, not by the innocent bystander.'What injury have Arabs done to the Jews of Europe?' he asked. 'It is the ‘Christian’ Germans who stole their homes and lives. Let the Germans pay.'King Abdulaziz felt so strongly that a great catastrophe was about to be unleashed on the Middle East that after their meeting he wrote to Roosevelt to press his case again.'To install Jews from every horizon in this sacred Muslim Arab country,' would be 'a calamitous and infamous miscarriage of justice,' he wrote in a letter dated April 30, 1945.The Jews, he predicted, 'will do wrong to the quiet and peaceful Arabs. The Heavens will split, the earth will be rent asunder, and the mountains will tremble at what the Jews claim in Palestine, both materially and spiritually.'Three years after the historic meeting on board the USS Quincy, on May 14, 1948, Zionist leader David Ben-Gurion proclaimed the establishment of the State of Israel, which was recognized by US President Harry S. Truman, Roosevelt’s successor, that same day.The tragic consequences of the Jewish colonial adventure, foretold by King Abdulaziz, are still with us.It can only be hoped that in 2025 the relationship between the US and Saudi Arabia, begun 80 years ago and alive today in the affinity between Trump and a Saudi leadership committed to sovereignty for the Palestinian people, might yet yield the long overdue dividend of peace, prosperity, and justice for the Arabs of Palestine. • Jonathan Gornall is a British journalist, formerly with The Times, who has lived and worked in the Middle East and is now based in the UK.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWcgC_hnYt32F-lP07Co6xSm	2024-12-07T20:15:17-08:00	
A Nation’s Betrayal: The Unfolding Tragedy Of Hindus In Banglades...	The Hindu community of Bangladesh, once an integral and vibrant part of the region's cultural mosaic, is now enduring systemic oppression, targeted violence, and ever-deepening marginalization. Rooted in the land for centuries, this minority group has continuously faced challenges shaped by the tumultuous events of the 1947 partition, the liberation war of 1971, and the evolving political landscape of Bangladesh. Their story is one of profound sacrifice during key moments in history, particularly during the war for independence, juxtaposed with their relentless struggle for justice and equality in an increasingly exclusionary society. Created in 1947 as a Muslim-majority state during the partition of India, East Pakistan (now Bangladesh) saw many Hindus migrate to India, yet a substantial number remained in East Pakistan, anchored by their deep cultural ties, economic investments, and hopes for peaceful coexistence. The Bengali Hindus shared a common language, history, and social fabric with their Muslim neighbors, which fostered optimism about a future based on pluralism. However, this hope would soon clash with reality as the Hindu community faced growing discrimination, economic dispossession, and rising communal violence, all set against the backdrop of a state increasingly defined by its Islamic identity. The 1971 war of independence marked a pivotal moment for the Bangladeshi Hindu community. Amidst brutal repression by the Pakistani military, Hindus were disproportionately targeted, branded as traitors, and subjected to horrific atrocities. The community played a crucial role in the independence struggle, contributing as freedom fighters, intellectuals, and resistance organizers. The Mukti Bahini, the guerrilla force leading the insurgency, included numerous Hindu combatants who laid down their lives for the nation's freedom. Yet, despite their significant contributions, the Hindus bore immense losses, with a disproportionate number of them falling victim to the three million civilian casualties during the war. Figures like Dhirendranath Datta, a celebrated leader and language advocate who was tortured and executed, serve as enduring symbols of the Hindu community’s sacrifices, yet their valor and suffering have often been overlooked in the post-independence narrative. The initial promise of a secular Bangladesh, championed by Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, offered hope to the Hindu minority. However, the assassination of Rahman in 1975 marked a drastic shift in the nation's political landscape. Under successive military regimes, Bangladesh drifted towards Islamist politics, with the secular framework of the early years gradually replaced by the formal declaration of Islam as the state religion, further marginalizing Hindus. Over the decades, Hindus have been subjected to recurrent communal violence—attacks on temples, homes, and businesses—especially in times of political instability. The 2021 Durga Puja attacks, among many others, underscored the persistent vulnerability of the community. Moreover, Hindus have faced systemic economic marginalization, including rampant land-grabbing, which has forced many to seek refuge in India or abroad. The demographic decline of Hindus in Bangladesh—from roughly 30% of the population at the time of Partition to a mere 8% today—underscores the magnitude of their ongoing struggles. Despite constitutional safeguards, Hindus remain conspicuously absent from political power and decision-making processes. Their contributions to Bangladesh's independence and subsequent development are frequently minimized or forgotten, while their continued persecution raises critical questions about the future of pluralism and human rights in the nation. This article seeks to illuminate the unyielding resilience and sacrifices of Bangladeshi Hindus, while calling attention to the urgent need for protective measures to safeguard their dignity, safety, and equal rights in a nation they helped shape. The Persecution of Hindus in Bangladesh The situation of Hindus in Bangladesh has deteriorated sharply in recent months, as they face systematic and widespread persecution. This minority community, once an integral part of the country’s rich cultural and religious tapestry, now endures heinous acts of violence, property confiscation, and destruction of religious sites. Thousands of Hindus have been killed in these attacks, with their homes and places of worship looted and destroyed. Women and children, particularly vulnerable, face grave abuse and exploitation, with little to no legal recourse or protection. This sustained persecution is largely driven by extremist factions within the country, and despite Bangladesh’s founding ideals of secularism, there has been a growing climate of impunity surrounding these violent acts. The rule of law has weakened considerably, as local authorities often turn a blind eye to the atrocities committed against the Hindu population. Furthermore, there is a lack of freedom of religion, with attacks on Hindu temples, rituals, and festivals becoming increasingly common. The targeted violence against Hindus is compounded by a series of discriminatory policies that marginalize this community socially, economically, and politically. Religious minorities have found themselves excluded from vital decision-making processes, and Hindu leaders and activists are often subjected to harassment and even death threats. These incidents are not isolated but part of a broader pattern of violence that has escalated with alarming regularity. The international community's response to the suffering of Hindus in Bangladesh has been largely inadequate. Despite reports from human rights organizations and diplomatic efforts by countries such as India, there is little pressure on the Bangladeshi government to address the issue effectively. This lack of intervention has left the Hindu population increasingly isolated, with no one to hear their cries for justice. The plight of Hindus in Bangladesh is a reminder of the fragility of religious freedom and the importance of safeguarding the rights of minority communities. Unless urgent measures are taken to restore the rule of law, protect religious freedoms, and hold perpetrators accountable, the situation for Hindus in Bangladesh will only continue to worsen, pushing this ancient community further into the margins of society. The recent attacks on the Hindu community in Bangladesh, including the arrest of prominent spiritual leader Chinmoy Krishna Das, have highlighted an alarming escalation of religious persecution and societal unrest. Das, widely respected for his humanitarian work during the COVID-19 pandemic, was detained under baseless allegations, drawing attention to the increasing vulnerability of minorities in the country. His arrest is part of a broader trend where religious and political forces, particularly from Islamist factions, are targeting Hindus and other minorities in Bangladesh. Adding to the injustice, two of his close aides—Radharaman Dass and Vaibhav—were attacked just last week. The violence did not stop there. Chinmoy Krishna Das's lawyer, who sought to defend him, was also targeted in a brutal assault. In a shocking move, the Bar Council of Bangladesh, an esteemed legal body, issued a warning to all lawyers, discouraging them from representing Das in the ongoing case. This escalation of violence against Das and his supporters is a clear signal of the deteriorating state of religious freedom and the rule of law in Bangladesh. The Rise of Islamist Extremism: Islamist factions, particularly the Jamaat-e-Islami, have been instrumental in fomenting religious and sectarian violence in Bangladesh. These groups are reportedly leveraging the current political and social chaos to further their agenda, which often includes targeting religious minorities, especially Hindus. The role of Islamist organizations in orchestrating such attacks cannot be understated. Their influence in the political and social spheres has emboldened them to engage in acts of violence, with the explicit aim of weakening the Hindu community's presence and participation in Bangladeshi society. Jamaat-e-Islami, along with other extremist groups, has long been accused of stoking hatred and intolerance toward religious minorities. Their rhetoric, which often vilifies non-Muslims, has gained traction, particularly in rural areas where law enforcement is less effective. These groups seek to create a society where religious minorities are marginalized and oppressed, further exacerbating the societal divisions. The International Community’s Role: The international community must take note of the worsening situation in Bangladesh. While the government of Bangladesh continues to insist on maintaining an image of tolerance, the reality on the ground paints a much darker picture. Human rights organizations have long documented the plight of Hindus and other minorities in Bangladesh, and the recent escalation of violence against figures like Chinmoy Krishna Das is a stark reminder that the situation is dire. Foreign governments, especially those with close ties to Bangladesh, should urge the authorities to take stronger actions to protect religious minorities and ensure that justice is served in cases like that of Das. Additionally, international legal bodies should press for an investigation into the attacks on religious leaders and their supporters, ensuring that perpetrators are held accountable. The Role of Bangladesh's Interim Government The violence against Hindus in Bangladesh has exposed significant complicity and inaction by the interim government, further aggravating the community's plight. Reports suggest that the violent mobs, often targeting Hindu communities, enjoyed tacit or overt support from elements within the government. This impunity has emboldened perpetrators, making the situation even more dire. Government Complicity and Security Forces' Inaction: Accounts from victims and eyewitnesses highlight that security forces, including police and army personnel, frequently stood as silent spectators during violent attacks on Hindu communities. For instance, during the spate of communal violence in 2021, there were numerous instances where the police failed to intervene as rioters torched homes, looted businesses, and desecrated temples. The lack of action by law enforcement authorities has fueled perceptions of state complicity. Specific examples include incidents where Hindu families were attacked in broad daylight, their cries for help ignored by nearby police officers. In many cases, police reportedly delayed filing complaints or refused to take action against known assailants, exacerbating the community's vulnerability. The dismissive stance of prominent Bangladeshi figures like Nobel laureate Mohammad Yunus has further undermined efforts to address these issues. Yunus, while internationally celebrated, has publicly denied the severity of the violence against Hindus, framing it as exaggerated or inconsequential. This narrative diminishes the real suffering of victims and contributes to a culture of impunity. Impact of Violence on South Asia The targeted violence against Hindus in Bangladesh reverberates across South Asia, affecting the region's socio-political dynamics, interfaith harmony, and international relations. 1. Strain on Regional Stability: The ongoing violence contributes to instability within Bangladesh, undermining the country’s democratic framework and creating a climate of fear and division. This instability can spill over into neighboring countries, potentially escalating cross-border tensions. Communal violence often fuels extremist ideologies, providing fertile ground for militant groups that threaten the security of the entire region. 2. Exodus and Refugee Crisis: Persistent persecution has led to waves of Hindu migration from Bangladesh to India. This not only strains India’s resources but also impacts its domestic political landscape, as the influx of refugees often becomes a contentious issue in national and state-level politics. The refugee crisis could also challenge bilateral relations, with India pushing for accountability and solutions from Dhaka, thereby straining diplomatic ties. 3. Erosion of Interfaith Harmony: Communal violence in Bangladesh sends shockwaves through South Asia, where diverse communities coexist. Such incidents deepen mistrust among religious groups, making interfaith dialogue and reconciliation efforts more challenging. The violence can also incite retaliatory actions or communal tensions in other countries, further destabilizing the region. 4. Diplomatic Ramifications: The violence and the Bangladeshi government's inaction draw criticism from international communities, including India, the United States, and other global actors. This puts Bangladesh’s reputation as a secular and progressive nation at risk. India, as the region's largest democracy, faces pressure to act decisively, balancing its diplomatic approach with Bangladesh while advocating for the protection of minorities. 5. Impact on Regional Integration: The violence undermines regional integration efforts, such as the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC), as trust among member states is eroded. The lack of decisive action by Bangladesh risks isolating it within the regional framework. Economic and cultural cooperation, vital for South Asia's collective growth, also suffers, as communal discord weakens people-to-people ties and trade partnerships. 6. Moral and Humanitarian Crisis: The persecution of Hindus in Bangladesh presents a moral crisis for South Asia, challenging the region's commitment to upholding human rights and protecting minority communities. The failure to address these issues reflects poorly on the region’s collective progress. The violence against Hindus in Bangladesh is not an isolated domestic issue; it is a regional challenge with far-reaching consequences. It demands collective action from South Asian nations to promote justice, peace, and the preservation of the region's pluralistic ethos. Bangladesh's Hindus: Hopes and Expectations The Hindu community in Bangladesh, besieged by relentless persecution, is at a crossroads, looking for viable options to safeguard their lives, dignity, and cultural identity. Their expectations span three crucial dimensions: from their own government, from the global community, and from India and its people. Each of these avenues offers potential solutions, but all require decisive action and sustained advocacy. Expectations from the Global Community; Bangladesh’s Hindus are increasingly looking to the global stage for advocacy and intervention. They expect international organizations, foreign governments, and human rights groups to: Raise Awareness: Amplify their plight through global media and forums like the United Nations, ensuring their voices are heard on a broader platform. Sanctions and Pressure: Impose diplomatic and economic pressures on the Bangladeshi government to enforce minority protection laws. Humanitarian Aid: Provide direct support to displaced or victimized Hindu families through NGOs and relief organizations. The global response so far, though supportive in rhetoric, has often lacked the urgency required to drive meaningful change. Expectations from India and Its People’ As a neighboring country with deep historical and cultural ties to Bangladesh, India holds a unique place in the hopes of the Bangladeshi Hindu community. They look to India for: Moral and Diplomatic Support: Sustained diplomatic pressure on the Bangladeshi government to address Hindu persecution, while maintaining bilateral relations. Facilitating Refuge: Providing safe haven and legal pathways for persecuted Hindus to seek asylum in India, as was done during the 1971 liberation war. Strengthening Advocacy: Ensuring the Hindu diaspora in India and abroad becomes vocal in advocating for the rights of their counterparts in Bangladesh. Cultural Preservation: Initiating cross-border cultural exchange programs to celebrate and preserve the heritage of Bangladeshi Hindus. Indian civil society has already demonstrated solidarity, but the community seeks more robust and consistent intervention to secure their future. A Cry for Justice and Equality; The options for Bangladesh's Hindus ultimately hinge on collective accountability and action. They need their government to prioritize justice, the global community to amplify their concerns, and India to serve as their steadfast ally. Without these interventions, their survival as a vibrant and thriving community remains precarious. The world must act decisively to protect not just a minority but an essential part of Bangladesh’s cultural and historical fabric. Conclusion The plight of Hindus in Bangladesh underscores a deep and ongoing crisis, one that is rooted in historical injustices and exacerbated by the failure of successive governments to uphold the principles of equality and justice. From the partition of 1947 to the violence of today, the Hindu community has borne the brunt of systematic marginalization, cultural erosion, and physical attacks. Despite their significant contributions to Bangladesh’s independence and development, Hindus find themselves in an increasingly precarious position. The journey forward is fraught with challenges, but it is not devoid of hope. The Bangladeshi government must take urgent and concrete steps to protect its Hindu citizens and preserve the nation's pluralistic identity. The global community must go beyond symbolic gestures, offering tangible support and applying meaningful pressure on Dhaka to act against perpetrators of communal violence. India, as a historical ally and a nation bound by shared cultural ties, has a moral responsibility to advocate for the rights and safety of Hindus in Bangladesh. The Hindu community’s resilience, contributions, and sacrifices are a testament to their unwavering commitment to the ideals of equality and coexistence. However, their survival and prosperity now depend on a united front—one that brings together national accountability, international advocacy, and cross-border solidarity. Protecting the Hindus of Bangladesh is not just a moral imperative but a crucial step toward building a more just, inclusive, and peaceful South Asia.

The Elitist Tyranny Of ‘Western Democracy’ Is Exposed And Crumbli...	The charade of Western democracy is rapidly unraveling as so-called leaders and their dutiful media show themselves to be brazenly unaccountable to citizens while pursuing elitist, criminal interests. Biden using presidential powers to pardon his drug-addict felonious son – after promising he wouldn’t. Western media claims that the upsurge in conflict in Syria is a 'civil war' and not due to NATO-backed terrorist proxies. Western support for genocide in Gaza and a fascist Israeli leader who is mass murdering his way to avoid court prosecution for years of corruption. Western support for a money-laundering NeoNazi regime in Kiev whose proxy war against Russia could spiral into nuclear annihilation. Western sponsoring of anti-government violence in Georgia after pro-EU groups lost an election there. The pro-West South Korean leader declaring police state powers to avoid prosecution for corruption. That’s just a quick sample of something more ample in the West’s decaying image. The visit to China this week by German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock was another revealing fiasco. The obsessively anti-Russia Baerbock landed in Beijing not to prioritize improving trade relations with the European Union’s biggest global partner but rather to browbeat China with tedious allegations that it was helping Russia’s war effort in Ukraine. What’s more important? Getting along with China to bolster trade and jobs for millions of Germans and Europeans, or gratuitously grandstand over a wanton proxy war in Ukraine? Understandably, the Chinese authorities were not pleased by Baerbock’s insolence and gave her short shrift. She was snubbed by China’s foreign minister Wang Yi not affording a customary joint press conference after more than three hours of discussions. In a separate statement, China again rejected claims that it was aiding Russia militarily in Ukraine. So here we have Germany’s top diplomat who is soon out of a job because her coalition government has collapsed and is facing new elections – but she flies to Beijing on taxpayer money to aggravate relations with China, whose annual trade with the EU amounts to over $700 billion. At her solo press conference in Beijing, Baerbock doubled down in her arrogance, accusing China of jeopardizing peace and security in Europe because it supports Russia. She claimed that Russian President Vladimir Putin was dragging Asia into the war with Ukraine. The double-think is astounding. Germany, the European Union, NATO, and the United States have done everything to drag the whole world into a war because of its reckless proxy machinations in Ukraine against Russia. The utter failure of that gamble has cost European and American taxpayers a combined $200 billion and could frighteningly escalate into a nuclear conflagration. Baerbock turned reality on its head when she accused Russia of pulling Asia into the war in Ukraine. It is the United States, NATO, and European Atlanticist leaders who are expanding the proxy war to other regions, including the Middle East and Asia. Western so-called democracies and NATO are supporting the upsurge in violence in Syria by terrorist militias under the banner of Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), an internationally proscribed terror organization affiliated with Al Qaeda. Ukrainian military personnel and Turkey (which means NATO personnel) are reliably reported to be assisting the militants in Syria with drone technology. Evidently, the U.S.-led NATO proxy war in Ukraine is going badly as Russian forces steadily advance against the crumbling Kiev regime. Flaring up the dormant NATO proxy war in Syria is a desperate measure to divert Russian forces to assist its ally, President Bashar al-Assad. The lame-duck U.S. President Joe Biden is desperately throwing billions of dollars to prop up the Kiev regime before he leaves the White House next month. This is despite Americans voting him out of office partly because they are disgusted by his failed warmongering in Ukraine. This is the same president who this week pardoned his son’s criminal convictions and spared him from several years in jail. How much more evidence is needed to show that Western democracies have descended into oligarchies run by elitist politicians who consider themselves above the law and have nothing but contempt for representing ordinary citizens’ interests? The entire European Union has been captured by Atlanticist elites who have imposed policies that serve hegemonic Western interests and not the interests of ordinary citizens. That’s a definition of treason. France’s President Emmanuel Macron, Germany’s Chancellor Olaf Scholz and European Commission President Ursula Von der Leyen are some of the other bought-and-paid-for politicians who embody the Atlanticist tyranny. Former Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte, who is now NATO secretary-general (sinecures and pay-offs are us), and Polish Premier Donald Tusk are other examples. The feeble Danish, Finnish, Swedish and Baltic leaders are also part of the U.S. vassals club. Imbued with elitist ideology and deep-seated Russophobia, seduced by bribery, or coerced by the CIA blackmail, all these political prostitutes have been played to betray the interests of European citizens and to make life for the masses incredibly harsh. Russian energy has been cut off leaving European economies shattered. Germany is the most salient case in point where its vital auto industries are collapsing due to higher energy costs. Another absurd elitist puppet is Kaja Kallas, the former Estonian Premier, who is now the European Union’s foreign minister, taking over from that other Atlanticist tool, Josep Borrell. On her first day in office this week, Kallas visited Kiev to pledge more financial and military aid for the corrupt NeoNazi regime. That’s right. She goes to a NeoNazi regime whose expired president canceled elections, imprisons opposition politicians, censors critical, independent media, and forces military conscription on citizens who want the conflict with Russia to end. Don’t you think Kallas would have been better visiting the EU’s biggest trade partner, China, to repair relations? While in Kiev, Kallas coordinated with Germany’s Baerbock in Beijing by repeating baseless condemnation of China for its strategic partnership with Russia. Kallas accused China of prolonging the war in Ukraine simply by maintaining trade relations with Russia, buying Russian gas, and so on. This politician from a tiny Baltic state of less than 1.5 million people is now running the foreign policy of the EU whose total population is 450 million. Kallas, who is obsessed with the Russophobia typical of the Atlanticist elites, has threatened to impose higher trade tariffs on China over tenuous allegations of supporting Russia. The EU has already shot itself in both feet from slavishly following the U.S. imperialist agenda to 'strategically defeat' Russia. Now, these same elitist politicians want to compound their treasonous betrayal of European interests by destroying relations with China. However, the crass servility to an Atlanticist ideology of bankrupt democratic pretensions is rebounding with self-destruction. Western governments (in reality, regimes) and their discredited elitist charlatans are being run out of office due to growing popular disgust over lies and contradictions. Every Western state is being shaken to its core as more of its people see rank corruption and deception that for decades masqueraded as 'democracy'. Western ‘democracy’ is like a vampire. It sucked the blood of too many people for too many years – all with impunity under the cloak of being virtuous. But in the light of truth, it is decaying and crumbling.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWcgC_hnYt32F3AKPyzlb9lo	2024-12-07T20:12:31-08:00	
Trump Administration Energy And Climate Policy Imperatives – OpEd	Base policies on reality – not myths, models, misinformation and fearmongering Donald Trump and JD Vance have a mandate on energy, economic, immigration and other issues that won them 50% of popular, 58% of electoral and 82% of US county votes. On January 20 they will begin tackling the numerous problems bequeathed by the Biden-Harris Administration and Washington Deep State: illegal immigration of criminals, terrorists and opportunists; outrageous government spending by bloated federal agencies; wars and crises across the globe; and federal and state politicians and bureaucrats determined to slow or stymie their every move. Mr. Trump will let the DOGE out, to cut government waste. Pundits and political pros are offering advice across the board. My suggestions center on the 'climate crisis' and the destructive policies it has justified. * First and foremost, withdraw the United States from the 2015 Paris climate straitjacket. Its terms and subsequent agreements require that the USA and other industrialized nations switch from fossil fuels to 'clean renewable' energy and de-modernize agricultural and other practices, to eliminate 'greenhouse gas' (GHG) emissions. That would bring blackouts, de-industrialization and job losses. It would also mean now-rich nations must pay developing countries $300 billion per year for climate damage 'compensation' and renewable energy financing. But China, India and other developing countries need not cut emissions and will continue using coal, oil and natural gas in ever-increasing quantities, to modernize, create vibrant economies and lift more people out of poverty. That would mean even zero fossil fuel use by Western nations would not reduce global atmospheric GHG levels at all. Better yet, send the Paris document to Congress for Article II Senate advice and two-thirds consent. President Obama's sly move of calling this accord a mere 'agreement' that required no Senate 'treaty' review cannot be countenanced. Paris was among the most far-reaching, impactful agreements in US history. It affects our energy, economy, jobs, living standards, healthcare, national security and more. It's a treaty and should be treated as such. * Equally important, eliminate the institutionalized junk science, assertions and fearmongering that fossil fuel use has caused an existential climate crisis for people and planet. Begin by reexamining the 2009 Obama Environmental Protection Agency 'Endangerment Finding' that carbon dioxide 'pollution' threatens the American people's health and welfare. Fossil fuels provide 80% of America's energy; raw materials for thousands of petrochemical products; and the foundation of our economy, health and welfare. Their emissions certainly contribute to the 0.04% CO2 in Earth's atmosphere, but this miracle molecule enables and spurs plant growth, thereby feeding the animal kingdom and making nearly all life possible. EPA's convoluted finding defied science and reality. It allowed the Obama and Biden Administrations to justify biased climate 'research,' anti-fossil fuel regulations, sprawling wind and solar installations, and the transformation of America's entire energy system and economy. The Endangerment Decision was likely the most 'major federal action' in US history, yet it has no real statutory basis. It clearly defies the Supreme Court's decisions in West Virginia v. EPA, Chevron v. Natural Resources Defense Council and Loper Bright Enterprises, Inc., v. Raimondo. EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin should direct the agency to formally and publicly reexamine the secretive process that EPA employed to ensure its 'endangerment' decision – with no contrarian science, evidence, questions or public hearings permitted to challenge its preordained edict. A fair, balanced, scientific review would demolish the faulty Finding and bring the agency into compliance with SCOTUS rulings. The President-elect's appointment of energy and environmental 'czars' and National Energy Council will build on those important steps, help restore reality and common sense to America's energy and climate policies, rein in other Biden-era regulations and executive actions, and advance Mr. Trump's promise of US energy dominance and economic resurgence. Other actions the new Administration and Congress should take include the following. * Utilize the Congressional Review Act to reverse eleventh-hour Biden-Harris regulatory sprees – such as its ban on further coal leasing in the Powder River Basin. * Open all US non-National-Park areas for no/low impact evaluation and exploration, to identify prospects warranting more detailed assessments for critically needed metals and minerals. Most of these public land areas were deliberately made off-limits to such evaluations by Congress, courts and the Deep State, making it impossible to weigh surface values against potential for world-class subsurface deposits. China's recent ban on exports of several vital metals and minerals underscores yet again why America must not rely on adversaries for raw materials critical for US defense, aerospace, battery, AI, wind, solar and other industries – especially when those materials could be found and developed in America, under the world's best pollution control and environmental protection rules, technologies and practices. * Reopen the Delaware-sized 'coastal plain' of Alaska's South-Carolina-sized Arctic National Wildlife Refuge for oil and gas leasing, exploration and drilling. Congressional legislation in 2017 explicitly allowed those activities, but President Biden unilaterally cancelled all leases and permits in 2023. * Require that applicants for climate change research and modeling grants demonstrate that their previous models and studies have been confirmed by actual temperature, drought and extreme weather data and evidence; and provide computer codes and analyses so that reviewers can view and evaluate their work. * Define 'sustainability' to reflect complete global life-cycle raw material requirements, mining and processing needs and impacts, energy required to produce raw materials and manufacture energy and other systems, and land, air and water pollution resulting from all those activities. This will ensure that wind, solar, battery, electric vehicle and other technologies are not classified as 'clean, renewable and sustainable' merely because they don't emit CO2 or pollution after they actually start operating. * End subsidies and fast-track permitting for wind and solar installations – especially offshore wind, where raw material requirements and costs are many times higher than for onshore turbines, and far more excessive than that for combined-cycle gas generators. * Require that wind and solar projects, and associated backup battery and transmission line projects, meet the same environmental review standards and requirements as required for oil, gas, coal and metals mining, and nuclear projects, regarding local, regional and global air and water pollution, land and habitat destruction, wildlife disturbance and loss, and post-project equipment removal and land reclamation. Even better, cancel the entire offshore wind program. Its electricity is weather-dependent and ultra-expensive, threatens wildlife and fisheries, and requires unjustifiable amounts of raw materials. * Expand and streamline programs to bring new nuclear power plants online, especially small modular reactors – to meet rapidly expanding needs for abundant, reliable, affordable electricity for data centers, artificial intelligence, and increasingly electrified households, technologies and industries. * Terminate Diversity Equity Inclusion, Environment Social Governance, and Environmental and Climate Justice programs, offices and funding. They only serve as twisted justifications for arbitrarily selecting preferred companies and communities that are often less qualified to serve public health and safety. There is much more to be done. But this is a solid beginning for reducing or eliminating needless, excessive and harmful pseudo-science, grants, policies, practices and regulations – and restoring government of, by and for the People.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWcgC_hnYt32F_lIg9aCxuBi	2024-12-07T20:11:06-08:00	
Chinese Aid Cannot Overcome Myanmar Junta’s Declining Finances An...	By Zachary Abuza Despite being bolstered by an unprecedented degree of Chinese diplomatic and material support, Myanmar’s military has had mixed results in the past few weeks, in the face of mounting economic and fiscal challenges. The State Administrative Council (SAC) - as the junta is officially called - has continued to suffer military setbacks that have economic implications of their own. With the capture of Kan Paik Ti, the Kachin Independence Army (KIA) has consolidated control of the entire border with China and stepped up their offensive in the mineral rich regions. The KIA announced that it would allow the resumption of rare-earth mining in the Pangwa-Chipwi region, now under its control. In Rakhine, the Arakan Army captured Toungup, which prevents overland supply to Kyaukphyu from the south. The Arakan Army have captured the military’s last posts in Ann town, home of the headquarters of the Western Military Command and a major pumping station for the oil and gas pipelines to China. Over 800 soldiers – mainly hastily trained conscripts – have surrendered in the recent campaign. The Arakan Army now controls 11 of 17 towns in Rakhine. While there has been considerable tension between the Arakan Army and the fractious Chin opposition forces in the past, there’s been an unprecedented degree of cooperation now. Local Chin Defense Forces and the Arakan Army have interrupted resupply convoys from Magwe into Ann, capturing at least 14 soldiers. Ceasefires in Shan state In northeastern Myanmar near the border with China, the Chinese stepped up their pressure on the Myanmar National Democratic Alliance Army, or MNDAA, and the Ta’ang National Liberation Army, or TNLA. On Dec. 4, the MNDAA, which has been fighting for years for autonomy for the Kokang region, declared a ceasefire in its war against the military, the second insurgent force in days to cite pressure from China for its willingness to talk peace. The move followed the TNLA’s announcement that they would agree to talks with the junta. The regime’s counter offensive in northern Shan state continues to make little headway, and the battles have been pitched and casualties high. The regime continues to intentionally target civilians with air power. The opposition has suffered some setbacks in Karenni and in Magwe and Sagaing, where logistics troubles continue to impede their gains. Karen forces continue to opportunistically ambush junta forces. But the junta is facing its own resource challenges, and is desperate to reverse its losses ahead of Chinese-supported elections that are scheduled for 2025. But with only 40% of Myanmar’s territory under its full control, it’s hard to see how elections could serve as anything but a shambolic off-ramp for the generals. Despite the overall 12% contraction of the economy since the February 2021 coup d’etat, the junta’s defense expenditure has surged by 222%, from 1.746 trillion kyats in 2021 to 3.703 trillion kyats in 2022 to 5.635 trillion kyats (over US$2.7 billion) in 2023. The regime has not disclosed its defense budget for 2024 or 2025. Tight finances ahead At a recent meeting of the SAC’s Financial Commission, Gen. Soe Win acknowledged that Min Aung Hlaing had directed spending on security to take precedence over all other public spending, despite the fact that the military’s provision of these public goods and social services has withered in the past three years. A recent Radio Free Asia report found that the country is producing only 300MWs of electricity, a 25% decline since the coup, with many power generating facilities inoperable, or beyond the junta’s control. The country requires 540MW. Where the money for increased defense spending will come from, is anyone’s guess. Finances are tight for the junta, with foreign exchange in perpetually short supply. The regime’s currency controls remain in place, which has devastated the business community, forcing them to sell their foreign exchange at artificially low rates, prompting more companies to try to hide their assets abroad. The opposition’s control of four of the five official crossings with China has added to the financial pain, as border trade can be conducted in yuan and kyats, not dollars. That is the crux of the regime’s lobbying of China to pressure the TNLA and MNDAA, two members of the Three Brotherhood Alliance that had led offensives against the junta since October 2023, to stop their offensives. Foreign investment has fallen each year since the coup, from $1.64 billion in FY2022-23 to $661 million in FY2023-24. Now, more than three years in, investors have lost all confidence. The military government’s Directorate of Investment and Company Administration (DICA), revealed that foreign investment in the first seven months of FY 2024-25 totaled only $226 million. DICA’s data, as reported in Myanmar-Now, shows that most of that investment went to existing projects and operations; only four of 33 this year are greenfield investors. Scaring up revenue The junta has been searching for new sources of revenue. The regime’s Minister of Energy, Ko Ko Lwin, held talks with the chairman of China National Petroleum Corporation in Beijing, where they discussed additional sales of oil and gas, and improbably increasing the capacity of Myanmar-China oil and gas pipelines. Min Aug Hlaing made a show of attending the Myanmar Gems Emporium in Naypyidaw on Nov. 18, 2024, which remains one of the few reliable income streams for the junta. The Irrawaddy noted that each year since the coup, the offered lots of jade have increased – from 1,955 in 2021, to 2,150 in 2022 and 4,025 in 2023. The TNLA has worked to deprive the junta of proceeds from the ruby trade in Mogoke. While it has allowed individual miners to continue, the TNLA has blocked all large-scale mechanized mining, which has been dominated by the military-owned Myanma Economic Holdings Limited. Short on manpower, the junta is doing everything it can to force overseas workers home to be conscripted. A new regulation puts the onus on manpower agencies to recall workers who have been conscripted. They have lobbied the Thai government to send the 2 million legal residents and upwards of 3 million undocumented Myanmar nationals home. Those that continue to work abroad are a cash cow for the junta. In September the SAC enacted a rule to force the expatriate workers to transfer 25% of their remittances through formal bank channels, where they must use the official exchange rate of 2,100 kyats to the dollar and 56 kyats to the baht. The black market rate is 3,400 kyats to the dollar and around 100 kyats per baht. Economic warfare The junta, however, is also waging its own economic warfare on the opposition. While the junta has not been able to retake Mogoke or Lashio, it is actively bombing the towns to disrupt economic activity. China’s border closures and internet and electricity outages of opposition-controlled crossings have put considerable financial pressure on the citizens in territories near the frontier controlled by ethnic armies. Now the junta has blocked the sale of petroleum to opposition-controlled regions. Fuel distribution is now legally banned to the entire Rakhine state, northern Shan State, Kachin with the exception of the state capital Myitkyina. Some 26 townships in Sagaing region, a township in Magwe, and two in Mandalay have suffered the same bans. As short on resources as the junta is, they still have advantages over the opposition. But saddled with corruption and plummeting morale, will it be enough? Zachary Abuza is a professor at the National War College in Washington and an adjunct at Georgetown University.

Romania Halts Presidential Election Run-Off Amid Russia Meddling ...	By Marian Chiriac In an unprecedent move, Romania’s top court on Friday ordered a re-run of the country’s presidential elections amid alleged manipulation of public opinion by a 'foreign state' in favour of independent, far-right candidate Calin Georgescu – the surprise winner of the first round of the polls last month. The Constitutional Court said it was annulling 'the entire electoral process concerning the election of the president of Romania' so far, as procedures for a free vote were not upheld. The government will set a new date for the elections, and the process will restart from the beginning, the court added. The move comes just two days before the second-round run-off between Georgescu and Elena Lasconi, leader of the centrist, pro-EU Save Romania Union party, was due to be held. Intense speculation had erupted this week followed declassification of documents by Romania’s security agency on Wednesday, which claimed that paid influencers had boosted TikTok accounts promoting Georgescu in the lead-up to the first round of presidential elections on November 24. The documents also revealed compromised login credentials for Romanian election websites and reported over 85,000 cyberattacks during the election. Romania’s intelligence agency stated that the scale, methods and coordination of the campaign strongly suggested involvement by a foreign state. On Thursday, the Prosecutor’s Office at the High Court of Cassation and Justice launched an investigation following indications of potential electoral crimes and money laundering. 'The investigation targeted indications regarding electoral crimes that would have influenced the voting process, through methods such as corrupting voters, including in the online environment, with the aim of determining them to vote for a certain candidate,' said a Prosecutor’s Office press release. Several civil society organisations then submitted notifications to the court requesting the annulment of the results from the first round of the presidential elections. Defying all predictions, populist, NATO-sceptic and Russia-friendly politician Georgescu won the first round – signalling that EU member state Romania had joined the growing trend towards the far-right in the region. He did most of his campaigning on TikTok, and was little covered by the media until his surprise win. Under the Romanian constitution, the president wields considerable power – including oversight of foreign and defence policy and responsibility for appointing the prime minister.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWcgC_hnYt32F0L8syqBlwK7	2024-12-07T20:08:28-08:00	
The Enemy Of Our Own: India’s Bangladesh Conundrum – OpEd	Bangladesh was an entity diverted from Pakistan, created by East-Pakistani Bengalis, and supported by India. As the youngest South Asian country, the history of Bangladesh can never erase the contribution of India, despite political variations. The famous 1971 war between India and Pakistan paved the creation of a country with exclusive Bengali-speaking people trying to grab self-determination against an oppressive regime. Since its establishment, India has been supporting indiscriminately, knowing that the boundary and water disputes are yet to be settled. Moreover, the most important concern for India, from the beginning, has been the peaceful existence of the Bangladeshi Hindus, the Indian Hindus partitioned in 1947 and formally settled in Bangladesh. This short article intends to highlight the issues raised recently after the fleeing of Bangladeshi President Shaikh Hasina and subsequent atrocities against Hindus. Following the agony of the common Bangladeshi citizens against the reservation system made by the Hasina government to extend support for the family members of the freedom fighters of Bangladesh, a widespread protest took the major streets of the country, showing dissent against the provision of reservation. Within a week, the protesters started attacking the Hindus, as usually happens in Bangladesh, where a sensitive political issue turns into communal extremism. In particular, many Hindu temples were and have been vandalised by the extremists, burning the assets and deities. In such an anarchical situation, the lives of innocent Hindus seem to be threatened by intolerance, as they are denied their religious practices and social security. Recently, many Hindu monks affiliated with ISKON were taken into custody without any judicious grounds. In the recent past, the newly appointed leader of the interim government of Bangladesh, Mohammad Yunus, urged the people to mitigate the communal violence. In contrast, the violence against Hindus is rising day by day without any urgency from the side of the interim government to produce a security environment for the Hindu minorities. In addition, a petition was filed before the Dhaka High Court challenging the existence of ISKON in Bangladesh as illegal and seeking the direction of the High Court for its complete abolition. Eventually, the court refused to pass a direction for the abolition of the ISKON and restored the minority rights of freedom to practise personal religious faith and protect the institutions. The current scenario suggests the urgency of self-retrospection in Bangladesh and emerging dynamics in India. Bangladesh and its population, except the top leaders, were and have never been so grateful to India, remembering the vitality of India's interference in creating a new state for Bengalis. Unlike Pakistan, Bangladesh dreamt of becoming a secular state with mutual harmony among the communities. Still, in every forum, the Bangladeshi population have a tendency to be pro-Pakistan, i.e. cricket, politics and development. As an elder brother, India has never failed to convince Bangladesh that the Bengali population should refrain from being indulged by anti-India forces. There are many instances of cooperation and confidence-building measures from the Indian side to establish stable and time-tested relations between the countries, ranging from financial aid and infrastructural development to regional balance of power and institutional mechanisms. Moreover, unlike China, which uses Pakistan as a buffer state against India, Bangladesh has been fortunate enough not to perform that function in favour of India. Geopolitically, Bangladesh would not be a buffer state against Pakistan because of its geographical detachment. This geopolitical argument reflects India's intention behind the creation of Bangladesh, which is neither a buffer state nor a trusted friend of India. Despite major disputes, India has been supporting Bangladesh for decades, knowing that the price of friendship is very high. India has also been facing illegal cross-border migration and arms circulation from the Bangladesh border, which imposes internal security threats. After 55 years, Indian policymakers and geopolitical analysts are supposed to interrogate the reality of Indo-Bangladesh relations referencing the present developments. As Dr Jaishankar, India’s external affairs minister, pointed out, the guiding principle of India’s foreign policy has been India’s national interest. Therefore, the question arises: what kind of interest does Bangladesh serve for India? Does India need to follow the principle of non-reciprocity for its neighbours? These questions have to be answered with Indian experiences in the context of Bangladesh. From a geopolitical perspective, Bangladesh serves no significant interest of India; rather, this country has been the second frontier for India to be dealt with. The problem of constant cross-border migration, drug trafficking, and armed movements has been pushing India to arrange the security apparatus, which seems to be a burden for India. On the one hand, India has a life-long belligerent neighbour, Pakistan; on the other, India, by herself, created a neighbour, Bangladesh. Comparatively, Pakistan has been the natural enemy, but Bangladesh has been India’s enemy of her own making. Coming to the second question, the principle of non-reciprocity would serve India's interests when the price of threats is less than the price of security. Afghanistan, for instance, receives non-reciprocal help from India, confirming that it would never hamper India’s security structure. Based on this argument, India's non-reciprocal involvement with Bangladesh would never help India achieve security. India’s Bangladesh has been a frontier of insecurity. By partitioning East Pakistan in 1971, India made its territorial boundary more volatile and fragile. India could have dealt with Pakistan with a single mindset, but today, India has doubled its security architecture to deal with Bangladesh. The identity of Bangladesh, as differentiated from Pakistan, has not only degraded its own existence as an independent state and failed to protect its own citizens but rather made India more insecure. In one way or another, the performance of Bangladesh towards its religious Hindu minorities has been the same as that of Pakistan. India should deal with such issues without lying on the fantasy of morality and ethics but with realism and pragmatism. Moreover, the international community and media should not backstep in criticising the atrocities against the Hindu minorities. This is probably the time for India and its policymakers to investigate India's achievements in creating Bangladesh. The views and opinions expressed in this article are those of the Author.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWcgC_hnYt32F0FdwgyqTMbo	2024-12-07T20:06:58-08:00	
Canada’s Arctic Foreign Policy: A Strategic Framework For Navigat...	We are in a tough world, and we need to be tough in our response. Competition is growing across the globe, and the Arctic is not immune. Many countries, including non-Arctic states, aspire for a greater role in Arctic affairs. The evolving security and political realities in the region mean we need a new approach to advance our national interests and to ensure a stable, prosperous and secure Arctic, especially for the Northerners and the Indigenous Peoples who call Arctic home.' -- Mélanie Joly, Minister of Foreign Affairs In a landmark move, Canada has announced a comprehensive Arctic foreign policy aimed at addressing growing geopolitical challenges in the North. Released on December 6, 2024, by Global Affairs Canada, this policy underscores the importance of domestic and international cooperation to counter emerging foreign threats in the region. With a renewed focus on security, diplomacy, and environmental stewardship, the strategy reflects Canada's evolving role in the Arctic amid shifting global dynamics. The Arctic holds profound significance for Canada's national identity, economic well-being, and security. Encompassing 40% of the country's landmass and over 70% of its coastline, the Canadian Arctic is home to diverse communities, including Indigenous Peoples who have lived there for countless generations. Canada's new Arctic Foreign Policy (AFP) reflects a collaborative and inclusive approach, emphasizing northern Indigenous knowledge and priorities while strengthening Canada's leadership in the region. Dan Vandal, Minister of Northern Affairs, highlighted the importance of incorporating Indigenous voices, ensuring the policy is shaped by communities with deep-rooted ties to the Arctic. Natan Obed, President of Inuit Tapiriit Kanatami, emphasized the shared goal of securing prosperity for Inuit Nunangat, representing 40% of Canada's land area and all Arctic coastlines, through co-development efforts like those at the Inuit Crown Partnership Committee. Lisa Qiluqqi Koperqualuk, President of Inuit Circumpolar Council Canada, stressed the necessity of removing barriers for Inuit across borders and upholding self-determination. Leaders of Arctic territories also recognized the policy's significance: Yukon Premier Ranj Pillai welcomed its role in fostering strategic collaboration, while Northwest Territories Premier R.J. Simpson linked Arctic sovereignty with investments in infrastructure and climate resilience. Nunavut Premier P.J. Akeeagok highlighted the territory's strategic role in advancing reconciliation, economic development, and sovereignty. Finally, Bill Erasmus, International Chair of the Arctic Athabaskan Council, lauded the policy's recognition of Indigenous autonomy, underscoring the importance of unity in achieving common objectives. Together, these perspectives underline the AFP's ambition to align regional needs with national and global priorities. The Arctic Foreign Policy (AFP) serves as a comprehensive framework for Canada's Arctic engagement, enhancing diplomatic presence and partnerships to meet current needs while remaining adaptable to future challenges. Building on the 2019 Arctic and Northern Policy Framework (ANPF), the AFP focuses on safeguarding sovereignty, advancing national interests, and fostering a stable, secure, and prosperous Arctic aligned with a shared regional vision. Structured around four pillars—asserting sovereignty, advancing pragmatic diplomacy, leading in Arctic governance and multilateral issues, and adopting an inclusive approach—the policy aims to strengthen the Arctic's resilience against emerging threats while prioritizing the needs of territorial governments, provinces, and Indigenous communities. A Changing Arctic Landscape The Arctic, long considered a region of peace and cooperation, is now a focal point for global tension. The policy highlights that the 'North American Arctic is no longer free from tension,' a situation exacerbated by Russia's invasion of Ukraine. This conflict has disrupted the foundations of international Arctic cooperation, bringing heightened attention to the region's strategic importance. Geopolitical instability has introduced new challenges, particularly as nations like Russia and China expand their military and economic interests in the Arctic. Joint military exercises conducted by the two powers in July 2024 demonstrate a growing alliance that underscores the urgency of Canada's response. While the risk of a direct military attack in the North American Arctic remains low, the region has become a critical geographic vector for advanced weapon systems, posing potential threats to North American and transatlantic security. Reviving the Arctic Ambassador Role A cornerstone of the new policy is the reinstatement of Canada's Arctic ambassador, a role eliminated in 2006 under the Harper government. This position will serve as a vital link in fostering international dialogue and advancing Canada's Arctic interests. The ambassador will engage with territorial governments, Indigenous communities, and global partners, ensuring that Canada's Arctic priorities are well-represented on the international stage. Natan Obed, president of Inuit Tapiriit Kanatami, expressed satisfaction with the policy, emphasizing that an ambassador can effectively convey Canada's sovereignty and its partnership with Inuit and other Indigenous peoples in the Arctic. The co-development of this position with Indigenous stakeholders marks a significant step toward inclusive governance. The last Arctic ambassador, Jack Anawak, played a crucial role in representing Canada's interests at circumpolar meetings and the Arctic Council. Reflecting on the past, Anawak described the ambassador as pivotal in maintaining positive relations among Arctic states. This renewed role is expected to build on that legacy, adapting to the contemporary challenges of the region. Expanding Diplomatic Presence As part of its Arctic foreign policy, Canada plans to establish new consulates in Nuuk, Greenland, and Anchorage, Alaska. These diplomatic outposts will enhance Canada's ability to engage directly with Arctic partners and strengthen ties with key stakeholders. The policy allocates $34.7 million over five years, with an additional $7 million in ongoing funding to support these initiatives. This funding will primarily cover the ambassador's role and the operation of the consulates, ensuring sustained engagement in the Arctic. Strengthening Indigenous Partnerships Central to Canada's Arctic policy is its commitment to working closely with Indigenous communities. By sharing information on foreign interference threats and involving Indigenous leaders in decision-making processes, the policy ensures a collaborative approach to Arctic governance. Indigenous stewardship is also highlighted in resolving boundary disputes and managing traditional waters. This collaborative approach aligns with Canada's broader goal of asserting sovereignty while respecting Indigenous rights and knowledge systems. Navigating Foreign Threats Canada faces a delicate balancing act in safeguarding its Arctic sovereignty while engaging with global powers. The policy emphasizes a national security lens for evaluating foreign research activities in the Arctic, particularly those with potential dual-use applications, such as China's research initiatives. China's interest in the Arctic, including its 'Polar Silk Road' concept, poses unique challenges. While Beijing frames its activities as scientific, Canada has expressed concerns over the dual-use nature of some projects, which could have both civilian and military implications. The Arctic foreign policy also outlines commitments to work with NATO allies and other like-minded states to counter these threats. Initiating Arctic-specific dialogue within NATO reflects Canada's recognition of the region's growing strategic importance. Climate Change and Security The Arctic is warming at four times the global average, with profound implications for ecosystems, infrastructure, and geopolitical stability. Canada's policy recognizes climate change as a 'threat multiplier,' creating opportunities for foreign adversaries to exploit changing environmental conditions. 'Climate change is increasing access to Arctic resources and shipping lanes, enticing nations to the region and heightening competition. This evolving environment creates new security challenges. Canada's Arctic Foreign Policy responds to these growing challenges with a focus on asserting our sovereignty in the North, while supporting prosperity for those living there. This new policy complements our defence policy, Our North, Strong and Free: A Renewed Vision for Canada's Defence, which will see us expand our presence in the North.' -- Bill Blair, Minister of National Defence Melting ice has opened new shipping routes, including the Northwest Passage, which Canada claims as internal waters. However, this claim is contested by the United States and other nations that view it as an international passageway. Canada maintains a 36-year-old agreement with the U.S. to notify each other of vessel movements through the passage, but rising global interest in Arctic shipping—particularly from China—has added complexity to this issue. The policy commits Canada to resolving boundary disputes through cooperation with Indigenous communities, ensuring that traditional knowledge informs decisions on stewardship and sovereignty. Balancing Sovereignty and Collaboration Canada's Arctic foreign policy reflects a nuanced approach to balancing sovereignty with international collaboration. While it does not propose new defense spending, it seeks to enhance coordination with allies and prioritize Arctic security within existing frameworks. This approach aligns with Canada's broader strategy of leveraging diplomacy and multilateralism to address emerging challenges. By fostering cooperation among Arctic states, Canada aims to preserve the region as a space for peace and sustainable development, even amid mounting geopolitical tensions. Conclusion Canada's Arctic foreign policy marks a pivotal moment in the nation's approach to the North. By reviving the Arctic ambassador role, expanding diplomatic presence, and fostering Indigenous partnerships, the policy lays a foundation for navigating the complex challenges of a changing Arctic. As the region becomes increasingly central to global security and environmental discussions, Canada's emphasis on collaboration and resilience will be crucial. This policy positions Canada to address emerging threats while promoting sustainable stewardship of its Arctic territories.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWcgC_hnYt32F395PP9A0Duc	2024-12-07T20:05:33-08:00	
Blind Spots That Prevent Me From Being A Leader – OpEd	Most living beings live in groups, be they carnivores, herbivores, or omnivores. Wolves live and hunt in packs, so do lions, sheep, goats, and even elephants live in herds (Couzin, 2003), and just like animals, Humans too live in groups, forming communities and societies. But unlike animals, humans differ significantly from one another largely on the basis of their personalities. Not all people think alike, and this would often create conflict due to divergent goals, contrasting objectives and methods, and for this reason, for almost every procedure we undertake, we require a leader, someone who makes the final decision, solve conflicts within the group, guide others, and make sure everyone follows the decision made. A leader is necessary for any group to work both effectively and efficiently, as a leader would be the unifying force that would compel the members of the group to work together in harmony towards a common shared goal. To influence others to work towards a common goal through any methods is called leadership (Raymond, 1992). However, even in leadership there is good and bad, as a good leader would see his group excel and grow, whilst the opposite would see the group break apart eventually, and the major difference between good and bad leaders comes from their blindspots, their recognition of these blindspots and their remedies to fix them. The blindspots to leadership can be any behavior (conscious or unconscious) that would damage the effectiveness and hinder the progress and success of their group (Karthikeyan, 2017; Jaworski, 2001). Some of the most common blindspots that seep into the leader’s behavior and make themselves evident are as follows: 1: Arrogance/Overconfidence: Having far too much confidence in your decisions, even when they’re risky or not perfect, is one of the main blind spots to leadership (Goleman, 1998). Too much confidence in your own ability and decision making often results in you brushing off any criticism (even constructive criticism), not listening to feedback, and not taking into account opinions of subordinates to get their perspective or help (Collins, 2021). 2: Micromanagement: Constantly being involved in almost every aspect of work that the subordinates are doing is called micromanagement. This form of constant supervision and interference in the activities of subordinates takes away significant portion of the subordinates freedom, and forces them to stick to rigorous methods that often smother their own abilities in which they excel, forcing them to conform to methods that the leader approves. Not only does micromanagement takes away operational freedom of subordinates, it also creates a lot of stress and tension, which inturn leads to high turnover rate (Collins, 2021; Northouse, 2021). 3: Confirmation Bias: Also known as 'Yesman ship' where the leader only surrounds himself with people who approve and praise his methods and decisions, and as a result, gets rid of all possible criticism and locks himself out of any constructive feedback that he would otherwise receive. This leads to the leader not being able to see any faults and issues in his plans, and becomes blind to all the red flags in his decisions and methods (Bazerman, 2011). 4: Production orientation: Focusing solely on the outcomes and achieving goals whilst completely ignoring employee wellbeing, and prioritizing objectives and deadlines at the expense of the employee’s mental and physical health will lead to employee disillusionment with the job and dissatisfaction, employee burnout, lowered morale and loyalty, and a high turnover rate (Yukl, 2013). 5: Tunnel vision: When you fixate on specific short term goals and objectives whilst avoiding or neglecting broader perspectives and associated risks, you may end up overlooking potential opportunities to capitalize on, or ignore red flags and warning signs, or fail to adapt to changing situations (Bazerman, 2011). 6: Favoritism: As a leader, you could also end up exhibiting favoritism, where you favor one or few employees over specific traits that they may have, such as belonging to the same region as you, having similar background, etc. even if their performance is more or less the same as all the other employees (Fletcher, 1999). This would end up promoting a sense of 'unfairness' as you would favor that employee more than others, and hence offer him more opportunities than others, considering him first for promotion, bonuses, etc. which would result in the rest of the employees growing resentful of both you and the favorite employee (Northouse, 2021; Goleman, 1998). 7: Fear of Delegation: Fear of losing power or control over the subordinates, or simply lack of trust in the subordinate’s capabilities often results in the leader not delegating his responsibilities and power with them, which often overburdens the leaders who end up failing to leverage the strengths of their team, leading to wasting talents and potential of their subordinates and causing frustrations within the group (Northouse, 2021). 8: Concessions: Making too many concessions or compromises with the subordinates simply to keep the peace and avoid conflict could result in undermining authority and position of the leader, as leaders who make too many compromises not only risk losing authority, but also lose the ability to make difficult decisions when necessary (Yukl, 2013). It is important to compromise once in a while to maintain collaboration, but making too many compromises is poison. an mirr9: Absence: The opposite of micromanagement is withdrawing from the activities of the subordinates and the group. Leaders who withdraw and are unavailable both physically and mentally for their team, and avoid taking responsibility during critical moments undermine the team trust, and the group ends up being left to their own devices, which not only disrupts the existing hierarchy, but creates many conflicts and turmoil within the group (Lee et al. 2018).

Syrian Rebels’ Advance Becomes Threat To Assad’s Rule	(EurActiv) -- Syrian rebels said they seized control of the southern city of Daraa on Saturday (7 December), the birthplace of a 2011 uprising against President Bashar al-Assad and the fourth city his forces have lost in a week. Rebel sources said the military agreed to make an orderly withdrawal from Daraa under a deal giving army officials safe passage to the capital Damascus, about 100 km (60 miles) north. Social media videos showed rebels on motorcycles and others mingling with residents on the streets. People fired shots into the air at the city's main square in celebration, according to the videos. There was no immediate comment from the military or Assad's government, and Reuters could not independently verify the rebels' claim. With the fall of Daraa, Assad's forces have surrendered four important centres to the insurgents in a week. Daraa, which had a population of more than 100,000 before the civil war began 13 years ago, holds symbolic importance as the cradle of the uprising. It is the capital of a province of about 1 million people, bordering Jordan. Daraa's seizure followed the rebels' claim late on Friday that they had advanced to the edge of the central city of Homs, a key crossroads between the capital and the Mediterranean coast. Capturing Homs would cut off Damascus from the coastal stronghold of Assad's minority Alawite sect, and from a naval base and air base of his Russian allies there. 'Our forces have liberated the last village on the outskirts of the city of Homs and are now on its walls,' the Syrian faction leading the sweeping assault said on the Telegram messaging app. A coalition of rebel factions that include the Islamist group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) made a last call on forces loyal to Assad's government in Homs to defect. Ahead of the rebel advance, thousands of people fled Homs towards the coastal regions of Latakia and Tartus, strongholds of the government, residents and witnesses said. Assad regime under threat A US-backed alliance led by Syrian Kurdish fighters captured Deir el-Zor, the government's main foothold in the vast eastern desert, on Friday, three Syrian sources told Reuters. The rebels seized Aleppo and Hama in the northwest and centre earlier in the lightning offensive that began on 27 November. In another ominous sign for Assad in the east, the Syrian Kurdish force said Islamic State - a jihadist group that imposed martial law under its harsh rule before its defeat by a US-led coalition in 2017 - had taken control of some areas in eastern Syria. Aron Lund, a fellow at think-tank Century Foundation, said Assad's government was 'fighting for their lives at this point'. It was possible the government could hold Homs, 'but given the speed at which things have moved so far, I wouldn't count on it', he said on Friday. Syrian state TV reported Russian-Syrian airstrikes targeting rebel headquarters in the countryside of Hama, Idlib and Aleppo killed at least 200 insurgents on Friday, citing the Russian Coordination Centre in Syria. A Syrian army source said Iran-backed Hezbollah forces were positioned to bolster government defences in and near Homs. Syrian state media reported dozens of rebels were killed in the Homs countryside on Friday in an operation by Syrian and Russian air forces, artillery, missiles and armoured vehicles. Capturing Homs would solidify a chain of powerful positions under the Islamic insurgents' control from Aleppo on the Turkish border in the north to Daraa on the Jordanian border to the south. Gaining Homs would also increase the rebels' chances of isolating the seat of Assad's regime in Damascus with the ability to block the route northwest from the capital to the sea. Rebels reenergised As the rebels pressed their offensive, Russia and Jordan on Friday urged their nationals to leave Syria. After years locked behind frozen front lines, rebel forces have burst out of their northwestern Idlib bastion to achieve the swiftest battlefield advance by either side since a street uprising against Assad mushroomed into civil war 13 years ago. Syria's conflict killed more than 305,000 people between 2011 and 2021, the United Nations Human Rights Office said in 2022. Assad regained control of most of Syria after key allies - Russia, Iran and Lebanon's Hezbollah - came to his rescue. But all have recently been weakened and diverted by other crises, giving Sunni Muslim militants a window to fight back. Tehran, which has been focussed on tensions with arch-foe Israel since the Gaza war began last year, began to evacuate its military officials and personnel from Syria on Friday, a sign of Iran's inability to keep Assad in power, the New York Times reported, citing regional officials and three Iranian officials. The head of the main rebel faction HTS, Abu Mohammed Al-Golani, vowed in a separate interview with the New York Times published on Friday that the insurgents could end Assad's rule. 'This operation broke the enemy,' he said of the rebels’ lightning offensive.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWcgC_hnYt32F-JLQaPFxyaH	2024-12-07T20:01:29-08:00	
Syrian Rebels Drive Toward Homs, Damascus As Assad Regime Hangs I...	(RFE/RL) -- Syrian rebels led by Islamist militants were reported to be entering the central city of Homs on December 7 and closing in on Damascus suburbs as the country’s main allies -- Russia and Iran -- scrambled to protect the regime of authoritarian President Bashar al-Assad and their own assets in the country. Experts said the future of the Assad regime was hanging in the balance -- and that, if it fell, it would also represent a major geopolitical setback for the Kremlin which, along with Tehran, has bolstered the Syrian government through many years of civil war. Media reports said many residents of the capital were stocking up on supplies as thousands were attempting to leave the country through the border with Lebanon -- itself a war-torn nation in the increasingly chaotic Middle East. As fighting on the ground and rebel gains intensified, the foreign ministers of Russia, Iran, and Turkey held emergency talks in Doha, Qatar, on December 7 calling for an end to hostilities in the most serious challenge to Assad’s rule in years. The U.S. State Department told RFE/RL in a statement that 'we are closely monitoring the situation on the ground' in Syria. A spokesperson said that 'the United States, together with its partners and allies, urges protection of civilians including members of minority groups.' 'The time is now for negotiating an end to the Syrian conflict consistent with principals established in UN Security Council Resolution 2254. Constant refusal by the Assad regime to engage in this process led directly to the events we are now witnessing, ' the spokesperson added. The U.S.-based Institute for the Study of War (ISW) said that 'Assad regime forces have collapsed and Assad’s backers do not appear willing to bolster the Syrian Arab Army by rapidly deploying additional forces.' Russia has multiple military sites in Syria, including an air base at Hmeimim and strategic naval facilities at Tartus, which are also used to support the Kremlin’s actions in Africa. The ISW said that Moscow had not yet begun to evacuate the base, 'but it remains unclear whether Russia will keep its vessels at the port as Syrian rebels continue to advance swiftly across regime-held territory.' The American Enterprise Institute’s Critical Threats blog said the Assad regime 'faces an existential threat given the widespread collapse of regime forces and lack of sufficient external backing to bolster these forces.' It added that 'Russia will face logistic challenges that will undermine its Africa operations if it loses its footprint in Syria,' Critical Threats wrote. Mark Katz, a professor emeritus at George Mason University who focuses on Russia and the Middle East, told RFE/RL that the Kremlin risks losing their air assets in Syria if it can’t agree with Turkey on the use of its airspace. 'In one sense, the Turkish government might be happy to grant permission as the more the Russian Air Force is out of Syria, the happier Ankara will be,' he said. 'Russia would also face difficulties relocating its warships because they would need Turkey's permission to get into the Black Sea. They would have to go through NATO waters,' he added. Meanwhile, U.S. President-elect Donald Trump said the United States 'should have nothing to do' with the war in Syria, where a small contingent of U.S. forces remain deployed in some areas. 'Syria is a mess, but is not our friend, & THE UNITED STATES SHOULD HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH IT,' he wrote on this Truth Social platform. 'THIS IS NOT OUR FIGHT. LET IT PLAY OUT. DO NOT GET INVOLVED!' Fast-moving developments on the ground were difficult to confirm, but media outlets quoted witnesses as well as rebel and Syrian Army sources as saying militant fighters were continuing to make large gains on December 7 in their effort to topple Assad. Some reported signs of nervousness in Damascus, with shortages of critical supplies, although the government said Assad was at work as usual in the capital. Government forces and their Russian allies continued efforts to halt the continued rebel push toward Homs, which stands at an important intersection between the capital, Damascus, and Syria’s coastal provinces of Latakia and Tartus. Homs is 140 kilometers from the capital. Russia was reported to have intensified air strikes around Homs in an apparent attempt to stop the rebel advance, the Saudi-owned news channel Al-Arabiya reported. The Syrian army was also reported to be sending reinforcements to Homs, according to Arabiya and Al-Jazeera. Witnesses and army sources told Reuters that some rebels had entered Homs as government forces dug in to defend the city of 775,000 people, although reports were impossible to confirm. Homs Province is Syria’s largest in size and borders Lebanon, Iraq, and Jordan. The city is also home to one of Syria’s two state-run oil refineries. The AFP news agency quoted security sources as saying hundreds of Syrian government troops, some injured, had crossed the border into Iraq. The surprising rebel offensive was launched last week by a coalition of rebel groups lead by the Islamist Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) faction, which is considered a terrorist group by the United States, Britain, Canada, and the European Union. Besides HTS, the fighters include forces of an umbrella group of Turkish-backed Syrian militias called the Syrian National Army. Turkey has denied backing the offensive, though experts say insurgents would not have launched it without the country's consent. The U.K.-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights monitoring group said civilians were fleeing from Homs toward the Mediterranean coastal regions of Latakia and Tartus, strongholds of the government and the site of the Russian air and naval bases. Russia Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov declined to comment on the fate of the Russian bases, saying he 'wasn’t in the business of guessing.' The United Nations said on December 6 that almost 300,000 people in Syria had already been displaced since late November by the fighting, and that up to 1.5 million could be forced to flee as the rebels advance and inflict losses on Assad, as well as his allies in Russia and Iran. Assad has relied on Iran and Russia to remain in power since the conflict erupted in 2011. Following the meeting in Doha, Lavrov said -- referring to HTS rebels -- that it was 'inadmissible to allow terrorist groups' to take control of Syrian territory and that Russia would oppose them with all means possible. Since the rebels' seized control of Aleppo a week ago, they have moved on to capture other major cities with Assad’s forces providing little resistance.Besides capturing Aleppo in the north, Hama in the center, and Deir al-Zor in the east, rebels rose up in southern Suweida and Deraa, saying on December 6 they had taken control of the two cities and posting videos showing insurgent celebrations there. Taking Deraa and Suweida in the south could allow a concerted assault on the capital, Damascus, the seat of Assad's power, military sources said. Video posted online showed protesters in the Damascus suburb of Jaramana chanting and tearing down a statue of Assad’s father, Hafez al-Assad, who ruled Syria from 1971 until his death in 2000, when his son took power. HTS’s leader, Abu Mohammad al-Golani, told CNN in an exclusive interview on December 5 from Syria that Assad’s government was bound to fall, propped up only by Russia and Iran. 'The seeds of the regime’s defeat have always been within it,' he said. 'But the truth remains, this regime is dead.'	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWcgC_hnYt32Fz2NcPWUnK_W	2024-12-07T20:00:17-08:00

Trade Corridor Wars: Escalating Competition Between China, Russia...	By Antonia Colibasanu (FPRI) -- Contemporary conflicts are increasingly orchestrated across multiple nations and domains, manifesting in many ways, from conventional ground engagements to strategic influence operations. The informal coalition of China, Iran, Russia, and most recently North Korea (CIRN) represents a counter-influence regional network, challenging the geopolitical and economic sway of the United States and the broader West. While North Korea has joined Russian forces in Ukraine and is mostly visible for its political and military posturings, China, Iran and Russia are closely working together on building a new trade and investment platform to support their political agenda. Although we are not yet living a full-scale global war, a global economic confrontation is underway, which could be a prelude to overt military hostilities. This paradigm shift arguably began in 2022, when Russia blocked Ukraine’s access to Black Sea trade routes, obstructing its critical export channels to the global market, a move that was met with Western sanctions. Over the past two years, the CIRN coalition (also referred to as CRINK, to include the full acronym for North Korea) has grown increasingly prominent, while trade and investment corridors have been strategically realigned by both Western and anti-Western blocs: reflecting a recalibration of global economic dependencies and a restructuring of the world’s economy. I prefer the acronym CIRN to describe the informal alliance among China, Iran, Russia, and North Korea, as it captures the partnership’s essential dynamics. North Korea’s involvement in support of Russia’s actions in Ukraine likely depended on China’s tacit approval—if nothing else, its troops would have relied on Chinese transport routes to reach Russia. Thus, this partnership is best understood as a China-Iran-Russia network, a strategic yet informal partnership focused on advancing each country’s interests while steadily countering Western influence, particularly across Eurasia. This informal coalition became especially evident in 2022 when Russia initiated the global economic confrontation by disrupting established trade routes. Since then, CIRN has actively explored alternative pathways for influence and trade, leveraging its position to challenge the West’s diminishing dominance on the global stage. The wars in Ukraine and the Middle East have had two major consequences. The first is the increased strain and detrimental impact on marine transportation and logistics. Not only has the cost of international shipping and insurance risen, causing inflationary pressures, but there is also a potential that conflict would threaten the open and free sea lines, generating challenges and modifications to UN regulations. The second main impact of the two interconnected conflicts, considering their effects on the global economy, is the redefining of land trade routes since freight flows over old Eurasian routes have decreased dramatically since 2022. The Northern Corridor, or New Eurasian Land Bridge, has long functioned as the principal freight artery connecting Asia and Europe. This transcontinental railway system stretches from China through Kazakhstan, Russia, and Belarus, offering a cohesive infrastructure due to a unified track gauge and regulatory alignment under the auspices of the Organization for Cooperation of Railways. These harmonized technical standards and coordinated governance mechanisms have historically reinforced the corridor’s strategic dominance in Eurasian trade flows. But the Ukraine war resulted in sanctions and uncertainty, and transportation along the route decreased. In 2023, westbound shipping volumes along this route decreased by 51 percent compared to the previous year and eastbound volumes to China were 44 percent below 2022 levels. As a result, both the Southern Corridor (which begins in China, crosses Central Asia, Iran, and Turkey to reach the Mediterranean and Europe) and the Middle Corridor (which starts in China, crosses Kazakhstan, the Caspian Sea, Azerbaijan, Georgia, Turkey, and the Black Sea) have emerged as critical trade routes between Europe and China, reshaping the global dynamics of transport and trade. While China has reallocated much of its commercial traffic, Russia has, since 2022, accelerated its investment into operationalizing the International North-South Transport Corridor (INSTC), linking the Northern ports of Russia to the ports of Iran through the Caucasus and the Caspian Sea. The INSTC is also a shorter and more cost-effective alternative to traditional routes like the Suez Canal. When considering the geography of these corridors, various observations may be made. First, Turkey seems to be a common denominator for the Middle Corridor and the Southern Corridor. Second, while one of the variants of the Middle Corridor does not include Turkey, instead relying on an open and free Black Sea, both the Middle and Southern Corridor are part of China’s Belt and Road Initiative. Third, Iran is at the crossroads of the Southern Corridor and the INSTC. Furthermore, given the rising coordination between CIRN’s members, Tehran sees a chance to collaborate with both Russia and China in constructing the North-South Corridor and expanding its participation in what China refers to as the Silk Belt and Road Initiative. After all, Iran has been looking to establish parallel trade networks and systems for years before 2022 because of its own economic problems coming from being sanctioned by the United States and some other Western states due to its nuclear program. In the summer of 2024, Moscow and Tehran were set to invest about $25 billion into developing internal waterways and railways to link Saint Petersburg to the ports of Chabahar and Bandar Abbas. Also this summer, Iran inaugurated its first freight train to China, as part of what it referred to as the China-Iran-Europe rail corridor. On its way to China, the Iranian train will pass via Kazakhstan and Turkmenistan, being part of the Southern Corridor project. In this sense, Iran becomes a natural link in the CIRN informal alliance, providing a logistical foundation for informal coordination and allowing the counter-influence regional network to more effectively push back against the West. While this may be seen as a Russian reaction to Western sanctions and a means for China to continue cooperating with Russia for economic reasons, their investment in new trade and investment corridors has a long-term strategic goal. Making these pathways operational and successful means not only (literally) creating new methods to collaborate, but also making their own decoupling from the West simpler and, in the process, laying the groundwork for more formal multidimensional collaboration, which will encourage more actors to join them. The development of new trade corridors can be seen as a strategic step in advancing a broader global movement to counterbalance Western dominance. These discussions revolve around debates calling for non-alignment, a greater role for south-south cooperation and BRICS. Although BRICS has yet to deliver significant economic results, it has functioned effectively as a political magnet, attracting countries eager to explore potential economic benefits beyond the group’s political summits. Turkey, notably, has shown interest in joining BRICS since 2018, in a move that was meant to showcase the country’s growing regional power along with its multidimensional foreign policy approach. Most recently, in September 2024, reports emerged that Turkey had formally applied to join BRICS, with Russian officials confirming the application. However, Turkish officials have been ambiguous, stating that the process is ongoing without confirming a formal application, and as of November 2024, Turkey’s membership status remains uncertain, with no official confirmation of acceptance into the BRICS group. Turkey’s non-alignment with the West in sanctioning Russia and its posturing in the Black Sea as a key negotiator between Russia and the West on Ukraine has challenged its alliance with the West, even if it is a NATO member. At the same time, Turkey and China have grown closer as bilateral commerce and investment have developed and high-level visits have become more frequent in recent years. Moreover, the Chinese consortium comprising COSCO Pacific, China Merchants Holdings International, and CIC Capital acquired a 65 percent stake in Kumport in 2015, marking the most important Chinese investment in a Turkish Black Sea port—back then part of the Belt and Road Initiative and now effectively part of the Middle Corridor. Turkey’s strategic balancing act between Russia, China, and the West, along with its position along vital East-West trade routes, has significant implications for alternative corridors. Turkey’s role could strengthen these routes’ capacity to facilitate non-Western trade flows, aligning with CIRN’s broader objectives. Given its complex relationship with the United States, Turkey has long leveraged its ties with Russia—and now its expanding relationship with China—to bolster its strategic influence with Washington. Observing the US pivot away from Eurasia and the Middle East, which Ankara interprets as a weakening American presence in the region, Turkey sees the opportunity to use its ties with China and Russia not only for economic interests but also to ensure it remains aligned with the region’s strongest emerging powers. Turkey is not alone in the Black Sea region in welcoming Chinese investments aimed at enhancing trade corridors. In recent years, China has deepened its economic footprint in Georgia, prioritizing infrastructure and strategic projects with significant regional implications. In May 2024, a Chinese-led consortium secured the contract to develop the Anaklia deep-sea port on Georgia’s Black Sea coast: a project poised to bolster Georgia’s role in the Middle Corridor and China’s Belt and Road Initiative. Alongside this, Chinese firms have undertaken major infrastructure projects, such as constructing the Kvesheti-Kobi tunnel, the largest in Georgia, which further integrates the country into China’s growing trans-Eurasian trade network. These ventures underscore China’s strategic interest in positioning Georgia as a critical transit hub, in line with its broader goals of strengthening connectivity and influence across Eurasia. China’s strategy to expand its presence along Eurasian trade corridors hinges not only on constructing these routes but also on ensuring they are competitive and attractive to transporters. Assessing the competitiveness of these corridors—essential for understanding which routes are most viable for Asia-Europe transit—a July 2024 study evaluated various corridors based on current operational characteristics. The findings revealed that the Traditional Maritime Corridor leads in performance with a competitiveness index of 0.7203 (on a scale from 0 to 1). Following this are the Trans-Siberian Corridor at 0.4056, and then the Middle and Southern Corridors, with similar performance indices of 0.2864 and 0.2662, respectively. To counter China and the CIRN informal alliance in their bid to expand influence across Eurasia—and potentially reshape global trade dynamics through corridors like the North-South route, which Russia is developing and which links the East-West networks to global maritime pathways—the West must actively work to bolster its presence along these strategic routes. Achieving this would require not only increasing Western investments in these transit corridors, but also strategically prioritizing routes less vulnerable to CIRN influence. Investing in these corridors offers a strong return, not only because there is a clear business rationale for alternatives to the Northern Corridor—which is likely to remain under-utilized, given that even after the Ukraine war ends, Russia’s reintegration into European trade will face substantial challenges—but also because such investments enable the West to maintain influence in the rapidly evolving infrastructure landscape, ensuring a balanced role in shaping global economic and trade routes. From a geostrategic standpoint, China’s central role in all trade routes connecting Asia makes disrupting CIRN dependent on Western investment in alternative corridors that bypass Iran and limit reliance on Turkey. Turkey’s approach, balancing alliances and prioritizing immediate gains, has led it to align more closely with China and, at times, accommodate Russia, adding a layer of uncertainty. While Europe may tolerate this ambiguity, given its lower exposure to the impacts of a functional CIRN alliance on open global trade routes, the United States cannot afford such leniency. The United States relies on the smooth functioning of global maritime routes, which is one of its key geopolitical imperatives. Therefore, the United States needs to be aware and mitigate against any shift CIRN might introduce to current trade norms. The intersection between Russia’s North-South Corridor and the Middle and Southern Corridors, where China is expanding influence, poses a challenge not only for Eurasia but for the entire international trade system. Given China and Russia’s stated long-term goals to reduce Western influence in global markets, the design of these corridors highlights their intent to establish a foundation toward that objective. Though not intended for the short or medium term, should these new corridors establish rules that undermine the existing norms of open, free navigation—currently upheld by Western standards—the impact would reverberate across global trade. It is therefore likely that the West—both Europe and the United States—will explore ways to counter the influence projected by the CIRN alliance in Eurasia, including close examination of the development of current trade corridors. The Middle Corridor has two variants: one that reaches Europe via Turkey and the Mediterranean, and another that connects to Europe through the Black Sea, accessing Romanian and Bulgarian ports. Alongside the Southern Corridor, these routes can be grouped as Middle Corridor A and Middle Corridor B, with a comparison highlighting the regions and countries they traverse. This analysis shows that the most favorable East-West corridor for the West, in terms of control and minimal complications, is Middle Corridor B. This route stretches from China through Central Asia and the Caucasus, then across the Black Sea directly into Europe, offering a reliable pathway with reduced geopolitical risks. The trade corridor variant that bypasses both Iran and Turkey goes through the Black Sea, an area currently at risk of escalating conflict. Russia’s strategic aim to control Ukraine’s southern coast, underscored by increasing attacks on the port of Odesa in recent months, heightens the security concerns surrounding this route. While currently the Middle Corridor is slightly more competitive than the Southern Corridor considering the current operational status of multi-modal infrastructure, sustained Western support for investment could make it more feasible. At the same time, it may be that, through the process, and as the war in Ukraine ends in a favorable way to the West, the Black Sea is getting back to an open and free sea, considering the interest of allowing for trade passage. Western efforts to develop the Middle Corridor and promote an 'open Central Asia' that welcomes investment beyond Chinese and Russian influence are already showing results. The EU-Central Asia Strategy and US involvement in regional connectivity projects have contributed to Kazakhstan’s decision not to join BRICS in 2024, instead encouraging it to focus on its economic growth. Instead, the West’s emphasis on regional cooperation without explicit bloc politics aligns well with Kazakhstan’s independent foreign policy stance. Kazakhstan has expressed interest in the EU’s Global Gateway initiative, which funds infrastructure projects, reflecting its openness to Western-backed development. The development of Middle Corridor B—the route that reaches Europe via the Black Sea—could play a pivotal role in keeping the South Caucasus open to Western-backed growth, even amid its engagement with Russia and China. This potential rests on two factors. First, as long as Central Asia, particularly Kazakhstan, remains receptive to collaborating with the West on infrastructure projects, the South Caucasus stands to benefit from this openness. Second, the expansion of Middle Corridor B aligns with the Western 'containment line' that spans from the Baltic Sea to the Black Sea and the Adriatic. This initiative, also known as the Three Seas Initiative, aims to enhance infrastructure for both economic and military purposes and has become increasingly important since the war in Ukraine has started. This strategic focus has already spurred substantial investment in key port facilities like Gdansk and Constanta, along with the development of a railway connection between them. Looking ahead, these efforts may also support transforming the Danube into a commercial corridor with dual-use potential for military logistics. Simultaneously, the Via Carpathia, a transnational highway network linking the Baltic Sea to the Aegean and Black Seas to strengthen north-south transport and regional trade, remains a high priority for the Three Seas Initiative. While many projects receive EU funding, they also attract significant private investment, sustaining the idea that return on investment is higher than most other classic infrastructure projects. The success of this vision rests on the West’s, particularly the US ability to grasp the challenge posed by the informal CIRN alliance of China, Iran, Russia, and the support from North Korea, and on its commitment to formulating effective counterstrategies. At its core, much will depend on whether the Black Sea remains an open and accessible maritime area. If the conflict in Ukraine escalates in the coming months and Russia secures more of Ukraine’s coastline, the Black Sea could take on a new strategic character, quite different from a scenario where Russia is forced to withdraw, allowing Ukraine to reclaim its exclusive economic zone there. In the first case, the CIRN alliance would gain not only territory but also a stronger influence over the definition of 'free and open' trade corridors—an outcome with potential repercussions for maritime trade not only in the region but worldwide.

Impediments In Global Quantum Technology Collaboration – Analysis	By Prateek Tripathi The quest to develop quantum technology (QT) has been picking up steam across the world. Given its cost-intensive and specialised nature, international collaboration has been and will continue to be a key factor in QT’s evolution. However, cooperation in the field has been limited by a variety of causes—export controls, intellectual property (IP) protection and supply chain constraints are the chief factors. Export controls Export control restrictions present a significant challenge to global collaboration and the seamless exchange of knowledge in QT, particularly those pertaining to the transfer of technology and hardware components. Nations around the world including the United States (US), China, the United Kingdom (UK), and multiple European Union (EU) member-states like France, Spain and the Netherlands have enacted export control regulations on QT. The primary reason for this stems from the potential military application of quantum communication and quantum sensors, which subjects exports to heightened government scrutiny and regulation. Quantum computing (QC) also raises security concerns because a large-scale quantum computer is capable of breaking current encryption protocols. China’s growing prowess in QT is also an added concern, particularly for the US, which has already been a victim of multiple Chinese cyber espionage operations. The prospect of China possessing a quantum computer is, therefore, a serious security concern for the US. In September 2024, the US Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS) issued an interim final rule, expanding export control on emerging technologies such as QC, advanced semiconductor manufacturing, Gate All-Around Field-Effect Transistors (GAAFET) and additive manufacturing. With QC, the rule imposes export controls on quantum computers possessing 34 or more physical qubits at a specified error rate, which 'represents a high level of technological sophistication warranting national security, regional stability, and anti-terrorism controls.' Additionally, while deemed exports and reexports are mostly exempt from these controls, some restrictions do still apply. The UK, France, Spain, the Netherlands and Canada have also enacted almost identical export control regulations. Due to the military applications of quantum sensing, such as a quantum sensing-based Global Positioning System (GPS), the US International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR) also presents a similar barrier for cross-border investments and collaboration, particularly with regard to technology transfer. While certain restrictions on the export of QT are certainly warranted from a security point-of-view, the export regulations enacted by most countries on QT thus far seem to be quite arbitrary. For instance, though large-scale quantum computers are certainly capable of breaking current encryption protocols, they require millions if not billions of physical qubits, which will likely take more than a decade to achieve. Thus, it is quite unclear why restrictions are currently being imposed on them. Intellectual property protection IP protection has also been a major hurdle in QT collaboration. This is displayed prominently in the US, where most developments in QT have been led by the private sector, which is particularly wary of IP protection. The situation has been exacerbated by certain Chinese initiatives like its 'Thousand Talents Plan,' wherein scientists from around the world were offered hefty salary hikes to entice them to bring their research to China. This led to scientists illicitly providing China with technology and research findings, leading to the US accusing the country of IP theft. The multifaceted and diverse nature of QT poses a challenge. Different technologies like QC, quantum communication, post-quantum cryptography (PQC) and quantum sensing require distinct IP provisions, thereby making harmonisation between them a problem. Coordinating IP rights across different nations is also a complex task due to variation in national laws and practices. Supply chain constraints Developing and manufacturing QT hardware often requires rare and exotic raw materials which are limited in supply. These include critical minerals like semiconductors and rare earth metals—silicon, germanium, cobalt, lithium and indium. This presents severe supply chain constraints since these minerals are found only in select locations around the world. Furthermore, China processes around 80 percent of the world’s rare earth metals. Each kind of QT also requires its own niche materials. For instance, quantum communication requires high-quality periodically poled nonlinear crystals such as KTP and LiNbO3, which are only produced in technologically advanced nations like China. It also requires components likesuperconducting nanowire single-photon detectors which are produced only in a handful of countries like Germany, Japan, the US and Russia. Superconducting qubit-based quantum computers similarly require certain specialised components which are only produced and assembled at specific locations. Quantum sensors employ the use of integrated photonics which utilise materials like nonlinear crystals and novel material wafers, which are, likewise, only produced by limited countries. Efforts to overcome challenges in QT collaboration Though the preceding issues do present a major obstacle to progress in QT, multiple initiatives have been undertaken to meet the challenge. The Quad has been successful in establishing a precedent in international collaboration on QT through initiatives such as the establishment of the Quad Critical and Emerging Technology Working Group (2021), the Quad Investors Network (QUIN) (2023) and the Quantum Center of Excellence in Quantum Information Sciences (2023). Organisations such as the Quantum Economic Development Consortium (QED-C) in the US and the Quantum Ecosystems Technology Council of India (QETCI) are working actively to enhance international collaboration in QT. The US CHIPS and Science Act of 2022 and the European Chips Act of 2023 have been implemented to strengthen semiconductor supply chains, which are also a critical element in the development of QT. The US-India Initiative on Critical and Emerging Technology (iCET) serves as a shining example of technology collaboration on multiple fronts including the setting up of semiconductor fabrication plants and extensive cooperation in QT. The future of QT collaboration QT lies at the intersection of vastly different disciplines like quantum theory, condensed matter physics and computer science engineering. This makes it particularly difficult to encourage and train talent in the field. Moreover, QT necessitates heavy investment due to the novel and niche nature of the technology it requires. Simultaneously, QT also presents a plethora of opportunities for the future of humanity, from enhancements in medicine, healthcare and agriculture, right up to unravelling the very fabric of the universe through simulations in quantum physics and chemistry. Therefore, the quest to develop QT is unanimously significant, regardless of national borders. However, due to the aforementioned impediments, it will be impractical for any country to pursue QT in isolation, making international collaboration an essential element to its development and propagation. This requires some changes in existing protocols and regulations. Harmonisation between export control regulations and IP laws across different nations will be key in this regard. Encouraging initiatives like the United States–India Initiative on Critical and Emerging Technology (iCET) and the CHIPS (Creating Helpful Incentives to Produce Semiconductors) Act will also be essential in strengthening supply chains. Organisations like the Quantum Economic Development Consortium (QED-C) and the Quantum Ecosystems Technology Council of India (QETCI) will continue to be important in coordinating efforts across multiple nations. The establishment of similar entities would be extremely useful in diminishing some of the barriers. Encouraging joint research and development (R&D) and publications across multiple nations through initiatives like the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue (QUAD), a grouping of Australia, India, Japan and the US initiated in 2007, would also be fruitful towards furthering collaboration. With the rapid progress in QT, this serves as a critical moment in time for its development. As technology evolves, so must the international norms and agreements regulating it. Though there have been attempts to reduce impediments in collaboration, they are by no means sufficient. Further effort in this direction will ensure that QT continues to grow at a desirable pace, thereby cementing its place as a valuable tool for humanity’s progress and well-being.

An Accidentalist’s Guide To Denying The Obvious – OpEd	There’s a peculiar comfort in believing that things simply happen by accident. That the powerful don’t conspire, that institutions don’t coordinate, that the crumbling pillars of society represent mere happenstance rather than design. I’ve come to call these people 'accidentalists' – those who find refuge in randomness, who dismiss patterns as paranoia. The Cost of Seeing Like the red pill in The Matrix, recognizing patterns changes everything. Many choose comfortable illusions over uncomfortable truths. As Hannah Arendt observed, 'The ideal subject of totalitarian rule is not the convinced Nazi or the convinced Communist, but people for whom the distinction between fact and fiction no longer exists.' For the professional class – academics, journalists, corporate managers – acknowledging these patterns means confronting their own complicity. Their success, their status, their sense of self – all are built on supporting rather than questioning power structures. The accidentalist mindset offers refuge from this self-examination. Better to dismiss than face one’s role in the machinery. The Death of Coincidence It requires impressive mental gymnastics to believe that those with power – who achieved it through careful planning and coordination – suddenly stop planning and coordinating once they obtain it. That they abandon the very tools that brought them success. That they become, somehow, passive observers of their own decline. When confronted with evidence of coordination – be it documented government censorship, institutional narrative control, or coordinated media campaigns – the accidentalist draws an arbitrary line. 'Well, that’s different,' they say. 'That’s not a conspiracy, that’s just…' And here they trail off, unable to articulate why some coordinated actions by the powerful count as conspiracies while others are merely business as usual. The Weaponization of Skepticism and Manufacturing Outcasts The term 'conspiracy theory' itself reveals institutional manipulation. The CIA’s 1967 dispatch (Document 1035-960) explicitly directed media assets to use this label to discredit Warren Commission critics. They transformed skepticism into pathology – making the very act of questioning power seem delusional. This weaponization of language worked brilliantly. Today, pattern recognition itself becomes suspect. In 2022, the New York Times published perhaps the most revealing example of instituem, make examples of them. The accidentalist never asks why questioning power triggers such coordinated attacks. Today’s Denials, Tomorrow’s Headlines Consider a revealing moment: In 2021, several of my friends eagerly recommended Dopesick, ('I think you would especially like this'), condemning the Sacklers’ manipulation of medicine for profit. Yet these same friends mocked me for questioning pharmaceutical companies today – despite their status as the most heavily criminally fined industry in human history. Those who recognized similar patterns were labeled ‘anti-vaxxers’ and ‘threats to public health.’ Scientists suggesting lab origins became ‘conspiracy theorists.’ The pattern repeats: identify skeptics, discredit them, make examples of them. Let’s examine three cases where 'conspiracy theories' transformed into acknowledged history: The Sugar Deception: In the 1960s, the sugar industry paid Harvard scientists to blame heart disease on fat instead of sugar. These industry-funded studies shaped dietary guidelines for decades, creating a massive public health crisis through 'low-fat' but sugar-laden foods. The accidentalist views this as an isolated historical incident rather than a template for corporate manipulation of science. The Tobacco Playbook: For decades, tobacco companies buried evidence linking smoking to cancer while funding research to create doubt. Their infamous internal memo stated, 'Doubt is our product.' The accidentalist sees this as a unique case rather than recognizing the same tactics in current corporate practices. The Vioxx Cover-up: Merck concealed evidence that their blockbuster drug caused heart attacks, leading to an estimated 60,000 deaths. Internal documents revealed executives strategizing to 'neutralize' critics. The accidentalist treats this as an aberration rather than standard operating procedure. The Pattern Repeats Consider the timing: A 342-page Patriot Act appeared weeks after 9/11. Operation Lock Step described pandemic measures in 2010. Event 201 simulated responses in October 2019 – the same day as the Wuhan Military Games. Months later, these exact measures were implemented globally. What are the odds? The patterns of control repeat at every scale: Globally: WHO/WEF coordination Nationally: Regulatory capture Corporate: Internal suppression of dissent Local: Community pressure to conform Power’s fingerprints are everywhere. Once you see them, they can’t be unseen. The Corporate Convergence Here’s where the accidentalist worldview truly fails: These weren’t separate conspiracies but a single system perfecting its methods. The tobacco giants that knowingly addicted millions didn’t disappear – they bought food companies (RJR Nabisco) and continued manipulating public health. Those same food conglomerates now merge with pharmaceutical corporations (Monsanto/Bayer), putting the same scientists who engineered addictive cigarettes and processed foods in charge of our medicine. These corporations don’t just share ownership – they share methods. The same tactics used to addict smokers were applied to processed foods. The same research manipulation that hid tobacco dangers now obscures pharmaceutical risks. The same media control that sold cigarettes as healthy now promotes untested medical interventions. The Reality Merchants Consider the current media response to Robert F. Kennedy, Jr.’s nomination as HHS Secretary. The coordinated messaging is impossible to miss – talking heads across networks uniformly label him a 'conspiracy theorist' and 'danger to public health,' never addressing his actual positions. These are the same voices that championed destructive pandemic policies, now attempting to discredit someone who questioned their wisdom. Or examine Dr. Jay Bhattacharya – a Stanford professor whose expertise was unquestioned until he challenged lockdown policies. Despite eventual vindication, the institutional response was swift: coordinated media attacks, academic ostracism, and algorithmic suppression. The pattern is clear: expertise is respected only when it aligns with institutional interests. Engineering Compliance The template begins with manufactured scarcity and enforced dependency. But understanding the mechanics of fiat systems is just the beginning. The real revelation is recognizing how this architecture extends beyond money into every domain of human existence. Covid-19 didn’t create new systems of control – it revealed existing ones. The infrastructure for rights suspension, narrative enforcement, and dissent silencing was already in place. The 'Great Reset' wasn’t conceived in 2020. The surveillance architecture wasn’t built overnight. The ability to coordinate global policy, control information flow, and reshape human behavior wasn’t developed in response to a crisis – it was waiting for one. Moreover, the selective enforcement of truth reveals power’s preferences. Regardless of what one thinks about Alex Jones’ Sandy Hook statements, his $900 million fine stands in stark contrast to the total impunity enjoyed by the New York Times and other media outlets whose WMD lies led to hundreds of thousands of deaths. This reveals how power protects its own while punishing outsiders, even when institutional lies cause far greater harm. The Psychology of Disbelief 'That can’t be true' becomes the mind’s defense mechanism against pattern recognition. This isn’t natural skepticism – it’s programmed rejection (as detailed in 'How the Information Factory Evolved'). The larger the pattern, the stronger the denial. They’ve weaponized skepticism against itself, creating a population that reflexively defends authority while attacking any challenge to it. We’re watching the early stages of converging control systems, with clear signs of what’s coming: Digital IDs linked to health records CBDCs enabling programmable money Social credit systems disguised as ESG metrics Surveillance capitalism merging with state control Artificial scarcity through controlled supply chains These aren’t predictions – they’re systems actively being built and tested across the globe, from China’s social credit system to Nigeria’s CBDC rollout. Understanding the Impossible 'But how could they pull this off without anyone knowing?' the accidentalist asks. The answer is simple: compartmentalization. Like the Manhattan Project, most people in global institutions are unaware of the larger plan they’re working on. Even in tech companies, the Gmail team has no idea what YouTube’s content moderators or Google Earth’s mapping division are doing. Each department serves its function without seeing the whole. Professionals across academia, corporate America, and media unknowingly serve a broader agenda, often believing they’re working for noble causes. The truth isn’t hidden – it’s protected by its own audacity. As Marshall McLuhan observed, 'Only the small secrets need to be protected. The large ones are kept secret by public incredulity.' This explains why major revelations often hide in plain sight: the scale of coordinated deception exceeds what most people can psychologically accept as possible. Breaking the Spell The ultimate revelation isn’t how powerful they are – it’s how fragile their control really is. Their greatest strength – total integration – is also their greatest weakness. Complex systems have more failure points. The more systems are interconnected, the more a disruption in one area can cascade through the whole. The solution isn’t fighting their systems directly – it’s building parallel structures that make them irrelevant: Local food systems over global supply chains Peer-to-peer networks over controlled platforms Direct exchange over surveillance currency Natural immunity over subscription immunity Real communities over virtual spaces The Choice The question isn’t whether power conspires – it’s why we’re so resistant to seeing it. What comfort do we find in believing in accidents? What fear do we harbor of seeing design? Perhaps it’s simpler to believe in chaos than to confront order. Perhaps it’s easier to dismiss than to engage. Perhaps the accidentalist position isn’t about truth at all – it’s about maintaining the comfort of ignorance in a world that increasingly demands awareness. Because once you see the pattern, you can’t unsee it. Once you understand that power coordinates, plans, and conspires by its very nature, the only wacky conspiracy theory becomes believing it doesn’t. The awakening isn’t something that happens to us – it’s something we choose. And that choice, multiplied across millions of individuals, will determine whether humanity enters a new dark age or experiences its greatest renaissance. The question isn’t whether you see it. The question is: what will you do once you can’t unsee it?

Don’t Trust The Cabinet, Trust The Market – OpEd	To the surprise of many, Donald Trump won the 2024 presidential election handedly. Even more are surprised by his rapid—and sometimes head-scratching—nominations ahead of taking office again. So far, he has appointed TV personality and physician Dr. Mehmet Oz to be the Center for Medicare and Medicate Services administrator, business woman and former professional wrestler Linda McMahon as secretary of the Department of Education, previous Governor of Arkansas Mike Huckabee as U.S. ambassador to Israel, and South Dakota Governor Kristi Noem to lead the Department of Homeland Security. Arguably, his most controversial nomination was selecting the controversial lawyer and politician Robert F. Kennedy Jr. (commonly shortened to RFK) to become the secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services. Our next president has placed lofty expectations and given considerable authority to tackle pressing U.S. public health concerns. As RFK remarked, President Trump has given me three instructions…He wants the corruption and the conflicts out of the regulatory agencies. He wants to return the agencies to the gold standard, empirically-based, evidence-based, science and medicine that they were once famous for. And he wants to end the chronic disease epidemic with measurable impacts on a diminishment of chronic disease within two years. As part of this effort, President-elect Trump also nominated Johns Hopkins Professor Dr. Martin Makary to be FDA commissioner. In his new role, Dr. Markay will work closely with RFK and, 'properly evaluate harmful chemicals poisoning, the country’s food supply and drugs [and] to finally address the Childhood Chronic Disease Epidemic.' Are these gentlemen up for these daunting and complicated tasks? Unlikely. Under the previous Trump Administration, then President-Trump appointed the similarly controversial Dr. Scott Gottlieb to become FDA Commissioner. His tenure was short, and is mostly remembered for beginning the FDA’s 'war on vaping.' Years later, countless efforts to crackdown on vaping producers and granting the agency newfound powers to curb teen vaping have been a spectacular failure. After resigning, Dr. Gottlieb began working on the advisory board for Pfizer, embodying the 'revolving door' corruption Trump’s second administration hopes to eliminate. Can we expect Dr. Makary to be any more successful in addressing childhood chronic disease? President-elect Trump had similar issues with appointing HHS secretaries during his first term. He first picked Congressman and physician Dr. Thomas Price, who resigned less than a year after his nomination due to financial scandals. His second pick, Dr. Alex Azar, was in a constant feud with the President. Both publicly criticized each other, with Dr. Azar coming very close to losing his jobduring the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic. Dishearteningly, both nominations were seen as reformers, hired to tackle pressing and longstanding problems within the U.S. healthcare industry. These missteps aside, there were several impressive and telling healthcare reforms made during the first Trump Administration. In 2018, national right-to-try legislation provided patients with terminal illnesses a way to bypass the FDA’s approval process to receive experimental treatment. Several states have since enacted an expanded version to help patients in dire medical circumstances. Emergency-use-authorizations were tremendously successful in providing quick and reliable treatment and testing during the COVID-19 pandemic. The overlapping approvalphases used during Operation Warp Speed to bring a COVID-19 vaccine to market proved it is possible to produce pioneering medicine quickly. The vital lesson here is that these successes were provided by markets, not government appointees. In each case, significant deregulation resulted in greater patient access. In many cases, these reforms saved, improved, and prolonged lives. What else could you ask for? Donald Trump will be President again soon, and the shock and novelty of who he nominates for his cabinet will wear off. When it does, let’s hope they remember their greatest chance of success is to empower the market, not themselves.

Self-Described ‘Austrian’ Is New Leader Of UK Conservative Party:...	By George Pickering Following their overwhelming defeat in the July 2024 general election, Britain’s Conservative Party recently elected Kemi Badenoch as its newest leader, meaning that she would become Prime Minister if the Conservatives win the next general election. It would be an exaggeration to describe Badenoch as a completely unknown political figure, but as a relatively early-career politician—she is 44 years old, was first elected to Parliament in 2017, and has never held any of the Great Offices of State—thus, she will be unfamiliar to most people who don’t follow British politics closely. However, advocates of sound economics may have been hopeful to hear that she once described herself as an adherent of the 'Austrian school' of economics, and lists Thomas Sowell amongst her personal heroes. Admittedly, such lip service to free market ideas was once commonplace as an empty gesture from mediocre, center-right American politicians, but given the seeming decline of interest in liberty amongst right-wingers over the past decade, especially in the UK, Badenoch’s comments still stand out. So who is Kemi Badenoch, how deep does her interest in 'Austrian' economics go, and how hopeful should advocates of free markets feel about her assumption of the leadership of the Conservative Party? Olukemi Olufunto 'Kemi' Adegoke was born in south London in January 1980 to Nigerian parents who had traveled to the UK for her birth, which gave her birthright citizenship under the laws of the time. She was raised mostly in Nigeria, where she described herself as having had a 'middle class' upbringing, although some have argued that her family were part of 'the elite strata of Nigerian society': her father was a doctor who ran his own hospital, and her mother was a professor at the University of Lagos. She moved to the UK for the first time at the age of 16, and describes herself as a first-generation immigrant, despite having been born in Britain. She became interested in politics at university, where she felt an instinctive opposition to the 'stupid Lefty white kids' she encountered there, and joined the Conservative Party in 2005 in reaction to the third consecutive general election victory of Tony Blair’s Labour Party. At around the same time, she began to develop an interest in free market economists including Thomas Sowell, whom she has repeatedly quoted and cited as one of her personal heroes, and the Austrian economist Friedrich von Hayek. As she later recalled in a 2017 interview: So the bit of me, the amateur economist who was just getting going, reading Road to Serfdom and stuff, that’s what I was doing when I was 25, 26, 27. And that was what was laying the foundation in its own way. So I’m very much probably an Austrian school supply-sider, free-marketeer, more than anything. Between 2005 and 2015, she became gradually more involved with Conservative politics, running unsuccessfully for Parliament in 2010, and for the London Assembly in 2012, while working in the financial sector. Interestingly, during her 2010 campaign she was asked, 'What was the last issue that made you shout at the TV?', to which she surprised the interviewer by answering, 'I hate identity politics'; this was long before that issue was catapulted into the mainstream of political discourse by the rise of 2010s pop feminism, Black Lives Matter, and the 2016 US Presidential election, and before the term 'woke' or even the antediluvian 'social justice warrior' entered common use. In 2012 she married banker and Conservative councilor Hamish Badenoch and, by mid-decade, her political career had begun to take off: she became a member of the London Assembly in 2015, and became digital director of the prominent center-right magazine The Spectator in the same year. She apparently failed to make a good impression on her colleagues during this period, who described her as 'rude,' 'inefficient,' 'aloof,' 'lacking in substance' politically, and more focused on moving up in her political career than on fulfilling the duties of those jobs. When she was finally elected to Parliament as Conservative MP for Saffron Walden in the 2017 general election, she occupied a number of minor government posts before putting herself forward in the July-September 2022 Conservative Party leadership election (the first of two such elections that year). She finished fourth in a field of eleven candidates, placing higher than a number of more prominent and experienced party figures. She was then appointed Secretary of State for International Trade in September 2022, Minister for Women and Equalities in October 2022, and Secretary of State for Business and Trade from February 2023. Given the expectation that MPs and especially members of the government vote with the party line, her voting record offers few insights into her own political or economic beliefs. She has voted against the majority of her own party only three times, including one occasion when she opposed making permanent certain temporary covid measures which had permitted women to self-administer early medical abortion pills at home without first having visited a doctor, despite the fact that Badenoch describes herself as 'very, very pro-choice.' Her tenures in the aforementioned government positions also provide few hints as to any economic principles she may have. Most notably, she angered members of her own party by altering a law which had promised to automatically repeal every EU law which had been retained after Brexit unless the government was able to review at least 4,000 such laws by the end of 2023. Badenoch lowered this threshold to 600 pieces of legislation to be reviewed, justifying this decision by saying, 'It is not the bonfire of regulations—we are not arsonists. I’m certainly not an arsonist. I’m a Conservative.' Aside from this, and a minor scandal in which she was accused of trying to improve the appearance of government finances before the 2024 election by delaying compensation payments to postal workers who had been wrongly accused of stealing due to an IT error, her time in government was largely unremarkable. Between her unsuccessful 2022 leadership bid and her recent ascent to the top of the electorally-humbled Conservative party, most news articles about her focused on her status as a rising star in on the British right, her prickly personality and public disputes with various figures within and outside her party, and her outspoken anti-woke stances on various culture war issues. Indeed, it seems probable that her admiration for Thomas Sowell could stem just as much from his trenchant opposition to affirmative action and other aspects of left-wing race ideology as from any of his economic views. However, even the anti-woke posture, which figured so heavily in Badenoch’s leadership campaign, only appears to go so deep: she recently criticized Prime Minister Kier Starmer for trying to 'mansplain' to her. Although Badenoch has frequently cited Sowell as one of her influences, she does not appear to have publicly commented on his views any more deeply than simply expressing her liking for his most famous book, Basic Economics, and quoting a number of his broad epigrams ('there are no solutions, only trade-offs,' 'if you want to help people, tell them the truth,' etc.) Likewise, it’s hard to find any examples of Badenoch having commented on Hayek other than her acknowledgement that she has read his most famous book, The Road to Serfdom. Non-British readers who might be tempted to be impressed by Badenoch’s acknowledgement of Hayek should remember that Margaret Thatcher’s well-known admiration of Hayek elevated him to the status of 'the one free market economist everybody has heard of' in Britain, in a similar way to how Milton Friedman’s frequent television appearances and association with the Reagan administration afforded him a quasi-celebrity status in the US. While Badenoch’s acknowledgement of free market economists is certainly welcome—and sets her apart from the majority of pragmatic, non-ideological Conservative MPs—it still falls far short of the deep appreciation of Austrian economics evinced by prior British political figures, notably Steve Baker, who sadly lost his seat in Parliament in the 2024 general election, and whose personal website contains recommendations and detailed reviews of economic and political works by the likes of Hayek, Ludwig von Mises, Murray Rothbard, Jésus Huerta de Soto, Roger Garrison, and many others. Indeed, it is difficult to shake the sense that Badenoch’s name-drops of Hayek, Sowell, and others exhibit a shallow 'Conservatism 101' quality which combined with her anti-woke stances to increase her appeal in the recent leadership election, which commentators widely expected to favor a candidate on the right of the party. Alongside Hayek and Sowell, Badenoch has also drawn attention to her admiration of Winston Churchill, Margaret Thatcher, and the philosopher Roger Scruton; all decidedly-safe choices unlikely to ruffle any center-right feathers. In this regard, it is difficult to disagree with an insightful recent article for The New Statesman by William Atkinson, appropriately entitled 'Kemi Badenoch is no philosopher-queen.' Atkinson argues that Badenoch’s 'Conservative Book Club' recommendations—and the older generation of Tory grandees who giddily took these as evidence that she is the next Thatcher—are unlikely to impress a younger generation of British right-wingers deeply frustrated by the lack of gains made after 14 years of centrist Conservative government. For these young conservatives who grew up in the information age and had already absorbed the ideas of Hayek and Sowell through books, podcasts, and YouTube videos in their teens, the shallow repetition of center-right truisms by Badenoch and her ilk seems hopelessly naive and insufficient in the face of the crises currently facing Britain and many other 'Western' mixed economy states. It might be tempting to see Badenoch’s acknowledgement of Hayek as a small victory for those who care about free markets—better than nothing—even if we acknowledge the seeming shallowness of her understanding and her apparent lack of difference in action from other contemporary British Conservatives. But if advocates of Austrian economics allow our ideas to continue being associated with the same moderate, center-right politicians who have consistently failed to increase the liberty and prosperity of their subjects, we should not be surprised when the younger generation begins to see free market ideas as just so many impotent, out-of-touch platitudes, nor when they begin to place their hopes in thinkers decidedly less liberal than Hayek.

Japan’s Economic Security Measures Are Immense But Ineffective – ...	By Ayaka Hiraki On 19 August 2024, major Japanese retailer Seven & i Holdings announced that it had received a buyout proposal from Alimentation Couche-Tard, a leading Canadian retail chain. If approved, this acquisition would create the largest convenience store operator in the world. Then in September 2024, Japan’s Ministry of Finance declared that Seven & i Holdings operates in a ‘core sector’ under the Foreign Exchange and Foreign Trade Act. This designation requires foreign acquirers to submit prior notification for any acquisition and undergo a national security screening to identify risks and vulnerabilities, which could result in the termination of the deal or further requirements posed toward the foreign investor. While these regulatory measures may complicate acquisitions, they also highlight Japan’s growing focus on economic security and the evolution of its regulatory framework. Japan’s foreign investment regulations have undergone significant changes. Under the revised Act, implemented in May 2020, foreign investors acquiring over one per cent of the shares in listed companies in designated sectors must submit prior notification and undergo the screening process. In December 2022, as part of the Economic Security Promotion Act, Japan introduced the concept of ‘critical products’, which are seen as essential for public welfare and the domestic economy, such as machine tools, industrial robots and semiconductors. Industries related to these products are subject to investment screening. These developments show that the government has expanded its conceptualisation of the economic security challenges related to incoming foreign direct investment. While previously it focused on direct risks, such as the erosion of defence industrial bases or military applications of technology, it has begun to include indirect risks, such as data leaks and economic vulnerabilities, in its screening process. But while the targets of inward direct investment screening have expanded to include a diverse array of firms, such as retailers and technology companies, the methods of investment screening have not been modernised to suit the new reality. Japan’s approach emphasises strict entry regulations through prior notification requirements. These case-by-case reviews often introduce uncertainties for foreign investors, potentially discouraging direct investments that are aimed at global expansion through the Japanese market. At the same time, Japan’s efforts to monitor the evolving risks of foreign ownership are very limited once investments are completed. For example, when Tencent, a major Chinese technology company, invested in Rakuten, a Japanese e-commerce and financial platform, the Japanese government imposed conditions to prevent Tencent from accessing confidential data. While Japan, in coordination with the United States, monitored this investment due to concerns over potential data leaks to China, the effectiveness of this monitoring and its ability to prevent unauthorised data access remain unclear. A further challenge arises from the fact that in complex shareholding structures, a privately-owned company headquartered in a jurisdiction that is not a noted economic security risk to Japan may be influenced through ownership stakes. These could be held by sovereign wealth funds and strategic partnerships with third country State Owned Enterprises, or have significant business interests in jurisdictions where such risks may be present. Future changes in ownership and exposure to third party influence may alter the economic security implications of foreign acquisitions deemed acceptable at the time of their completion. This highlights the need for robust post-transaction risk management. Both the United States and the European Union have adopted measures to enhance the effectiveness of investment regulations. In the United States, authorities have the power to mandate divestitures if national security risks are identified post-investment. Similarly, the European Union introduced foreign subsidy regulations in 2023, requiring transparency in subsidies and funding sources for transactions involving state-owned enterprises to ensure fairness and competitive integrity. These measures aim to address economic and security concerns and protect domestic markets more effectively by balancing pre- and post-transaction security considerations. But Japan’s implementation of screening and its monitoring activities have often been limited to ad hoc responses. While all of these screening approaches present significant hurdles and unpredictability to foreign investors, Japan’s current system is less effective in facing the changing nature of economic security challenges. Japan would benefit from improving the effectiveness and transparency of its investment regulations. Clearer screening criteria, along with more accessible guidance and examples, may comfort foreign investors. There would also be benefits to revisiting post-transaction monitoring and enforcement mechanisms. A ‘narrow scope, high walls’ approach could be effective. This strategy would focus on military–civilian dual-use technologies and competitive sectors critical to Japan’s economic growth, ensuring stringent monitoring of these areas while encouraging investment in less critical sectors. In addition to robust entry screening, continuous monitoring could deter investments with improper motives and enable timely interventions when necessary. Such measures would minimise economic security risks while fostering a healthy investment environment that supports Japan’s global competitiveness.

Erdogan’s Idlib Shock Shadows ‘Kursk’ – OpEd	‘Doomsters’ is an occasional Russian expression used to categorise commentators that only see the ‘dark side to events’ (a vice quite prevalent during the Soviet era). Marat Khairullin, a highly respected Russian military analyst, says, 'Today, a network of mercenary war bloggers has begun another round of moaning – this time about Syria, where apparently everything is lost for Russia'. 'Many see the events in Syria (and some add Georgia to the mix) as attempts to open additional fronts against our country. Perhaps that’s true. But in that case, it’s more appropriate to draw direct parallels with the reckless attack on Kursk, which left the Ukrainian armed forces in an almost hopeless position'. Khairullin views the activation of this jihadist insurgency in Syria as a similarly ‘desperate’ act. The background is that the Syria-Russia-Iran coalition had – thorough the Astana negotiations – 'cornered the remaining Syrian terrorists into a 6,000 sq. km enclave. Without delving into the details, it was a process reminiscent of the [Ukrainian] Minsk Agreements—both sides were utterly exhausted and thus agreed to a ceasefire. Importantly, all sides understood this was only a temporary truce; the contradictions were so profound that no one expected the conflict to end'. Aleppo fell quickly these past days, as 'one division of the Syrian National Army outright defected to the Islamists (read: Americans)'. The defection was a set up. Northern Aleppo was occupied by the Syrian National Army, fully controlled, armed and funded by Turkey, which dominates northern Aleppo. The key, Khairullin says, is this crucial point: The land is flat criss-crossed by few roads: ' … whomsoever controls the airspace controls the country. Last year, Russia formed a new aerial unit called the Special Air Corps, reportedly tailored for overseas operations. It consists of four aviation regiments, including a regiment of Su-35s. Currently, just two Su-35s are overseeing the entirety of Syria’s territory. Imagine the impact when 24 such aircraft are deployed. And Russia is fully capable of such a deployment'. The second crucial point is that 'Iran and Russia have drawn closer. At the start of the Syrian war, relations between the two were decidedly ‘neutral-hostile’. By late 2024 however, we now see a very strong alliance. Israel and the U.S., by violating the peace agreements through this Turkish insurrection, have provoked a renewed Iranian presence in Syria: Iran has begun to expand beyond its bases, redeploying additional forces into the country. This gives Assad and his allies a direct pretext to expel the American and Turkish proxies from Aleppo and Idlib. This isn’t speculation — it’s straightforward arithmetic'. Syria, however, is a key component to the Israeli-American plan to remake the Middle East. Syria is both the supply-line for Hizbullah, as well as a hub of resistance to Israel’s 'Greater Israel Project'. Now that the permanent ‘Anglo’ Security State unreservedly is backing Israel’s ambition to assert regional hegemony, the West has okayed Erdogan’s jihadist insurrection against President Assad. The aim is to split Iran from its allies, weaken Assad and to prepare for the putative Iran overthrow. Reportedly, the Turkish initiative was hurriedly brought forward, to fit with Israel’s ceasefire plan. Khairullin’s point is that this Syria ‘ploy’ is akin to Ukraine’s 'reckless attack on Kursk', which diverted Ukrainian élite forces from the beleaguered Contact Line, and then marooned these forces in an almost hopeless position in Kursk. Instead of weakening Moscow (as intended), ‘Kursk’ inverted NATO’s original objective – by becoming opportunity to eradicate a major portion of Ukraine’s élite forces. In Idlib, the Islamists (HTS), writes Khairullin, 'had gained dominance – imposing a strict Wahhabi regime and infiltrating the Turkish-backed Syrian National Army. Both groups are patchwork organizations, with various factions fighting over money, border crossings, drugs, and smuggling. Essentially, it’s a cauldron—not very combat-effective but highly greedy'. 'Our Aerospace Forces obliterated all command centres (bunkers) of Tahrir al-Sham …and there is a strong likelihood that the entire leadership of the group has been decapitated', notes Khairullin. The Syrian Army’s main forces are advancing toward Aleppo; meanwhile, the Russian Air Force is bombing relentlessly; its Navy held a large drill off the Syria cost on 3 December with test launches of hypersonic and Kalibr cruise missiles; and Wagner and the Iraqi Hash’ad forces (Iraqi PM forces that are now part of the Iraqi army) are grouping on the ground in support of the Syrian Army. Israeli Intelligence Chief’s lately have begun to scent problems with this ‘clever initiative’ that dovetails so exactly with Israel’s pause in the Lebanon fighting; With the supply route from Syria cut, Israel then – in theory – would be in a position to commence ‘Part Two’ of its attempted onslaught on Hizbullah. But wait … Israeli Channel 12 reports the possibility that events in Syria are creating threats against Israel 'where Israel would be required to act'. Shades of ‘Kursk’ – rather than Hizbullah being weakened, Israel adds to its military commitments? Erdogan too, may have wrong-footed himself with this gamble. He has infuriated Moscow and Tehran, and is being flailed at home for siding with the U.S. and America against the Palestinians. Further, he has drawn no Arab support (apart from a Qatari studied ambivalence). Yes, Erdogan has cards to play in the relationship with Putin (control of naval access to the Black Sea, tourism and energy), but Russia is an ascendant great power and can afford to play some hardball in negotiations with a weakened Erdogan. Iran also has cards to play: ‘You, Erdogan, equipped the jihadists with Ukrainian drones; We can deliver the same to the Kurdish Workers Party’. In the background is the bellicose language emerging from Team Trump, some of whom take harshly aggressive and hardline positions. These Israel-Firster and hawkish appointees by Trump likely emit their bluster as much to project an image of Trumpist strength to the American public, as to project a substantive project. Trump is known for waving a big stick – and when he has played that tune for a little while, he slips in from behind, to complete a deal. So we have had (from Trump): 'If the hostages are not released prior to January 20, 2025, the date that I proudly assume Office as President of the United States, there will be ALL HELL TO PAY in the Middle East'. In the ‘Middle East’? To whom exactly is this addressed? And what does it suggest? (No mention of the thousands of Palestinian detainees and prisoners held by Israel)? Sounds more like Trump has sipped at the Israeli Kool-Aid: ‘All problems derive from Iran’; Israel is the innocent adrift a sea of regional malignity. Trump’s disciples believe Trump will impose his will to achieve ‘quiet’ in the Middle East – and impose on Putin an end to the Ukraine War. They are convinced Trump can ‘cut a deal’ in the form of an offer to Putin that he cannot refuse. (For, ‘the current ‘owners of the world’ are never going to let China/Russia just waltz in, form BRICS and assume the position of World Hegemon’). It is a return to the old formula of Zbig Brzezenski: Promise Putin normalisation with U.S. (and Europe) and full sanctions relief, and pull Russia back into the western sphere – severed from a besieged China and Iran (with BRICS scattered to the wind under threat of sanctions). It fails, however, to take account of how much the world has transitioned in the intervening years since ‘Trump One’. Bluster simply doesn’t carry the effect it used to: America isn’t what it was; nor is it obeyed as it once was. Does Trump understand this accelerating global metamorphosis (as Will Schryver puts it), that 'the only deal to be made with Russia is that of agreeing to the terms Russia dictates': 'That’s what happens in the real world when you win a big war. And make no mistake, in this war, the Ukrainians have been slaughtered, the U.S./NATO has been humiliated, and the Russians are emerging from it indisputably triumphant, and more powerful on the world stage than they have been since the peak of Soviet strength decades ago'. In other words, ‘big stick; quick deal’ may not answer to the new world of today. Putin, in response to a questioner at Astana on 29 November, repeated an earlier warning: 'Let me underscore the key point: the essence of our proposal [on Ukraine, given at the Russian Foreign Ministry] is not a temporary truce or ceasefire, as the West might prefer – to allow the Kiev regime to recover, rearm, and prepare for a new offensive. I repeat: we are not discussing freezing the conflict, but its definitive resolution'. What Putin is saying – very politely – to the West is that: You still ‘don’t get it’. To seek a deal on Ukraine is to treat the symptom and to ignore a cure. The West has its policy back-to-front, in other words. Putin is clear: A definitive solution would be to delineate the frontier between Atlanticist security ‘interest’ and the security interests of the ‘World Island’ (in Mackinder’s terminology): i.e. to settle the security architecture between the ‘Heartland and the Rim-land’. Once that is done, Ukraine falls naturally into its place. It’s at the end of the agenda, not first. One highly-regarded foreign policy sage, Professor Sergei Karaganov, explains (original only in Russian): 'Our [Russian] goal is to facilitate the U.S.’s incipient retreat, as peaceably as possible, from the position of global hegemon (which it can no longer afford) to the position of a normal great power. And to expel Europe from being any international actor. Let it stew in its own juices …The conclusion is obvious. We must end the current phase of direct military conflict with the West, but not the broader confrontation with it. Trump will offer to ease pressure on Russia (which he cannot guarantee) in exchange for Russia refraining from a close alliance with China. The Trump administration will propose a deal, alternating threats with promises … but the U.S. already understands that it cannot win. America will remain an unreliable partner for the foreseeable future. Fundamental normalization of our relations with the U.S. should not be expected in the coming decade. Trump’s hands are tied by the Russophobia fanned by liberals for years. The inertia of the Cold War is still quite strong, and so are anti-Russian feelings among most Trumpists'. 'The foremost goal of the current war should be the decisive defeat in Ukraine of Europe’s rising revanchism. This is a war to ward off World War III and to prevent the restoration of the Western yoke. The initial negotiating position is obvious, it has been stated and should not be changed: NATO’s return to its 1997 borders. Beyond that, various options are possible. Naturally, Trump will try to up the ante. So, we should act pre-emptively', Professor Karaganov advises. Recall too, that Trump is, at heart, a sworn disciple of the cult of American primacy; American greatness. 'He will act accordingly … The Russians will dictate the terms of surrender in this [Ukraine] war because their strength affords them that privilege, and there is nothing the U.S. and its impotent European vassals can do to alter that reality. That said, a decisive strategic defeat is going to be a very bitter pill to swallow for this second Trump administration. Hopefully they won’t opt to set the world on fire in a fit of humiliated madness'.

How Republics Succeed, Falter, And Fail – OpEd	The United States today faces inherent challenges that have weakened the republic, making lessons from the Roman Republic even more necessary to avoid greater political instability. The U.S. enjoys many strengths that give it an edge over other republics, such as a decentralized and innovative economy that draws global talent and unmatched military strength. Yet the Roman Republic, which had its own comparative advantages, ultimately fell to autocratic rule, and the U.S. faces a similar fate if it fails to protect institutional integrity and unchecked power continues to grow. Reform is crucial to the continuity of republican governance, yet history shows it is often compromised by entrenched power. Political dysfunction and the growing influence of corporate interests threaten to undermine the foundational principles of the U.S., posing a risk to its long-term stability. From its inception, the United States has struggled to address its internal contradictions in ensuring fair treatment for its inhabitants. Autocratic tendencies also emerged early, with second President John Adams's Alien and Sedition Acts targeting political dissent, immigrants, and free speech. Abraham Lincoln later expanded executive power during the Civil War, bypassing Congress to preserve the Union and abolish slavery, the most contentious and significant political question since the country's founding. Despite such departures from Constitutional procedure—sometimes for good reasons—the system's checks and balances ultimately resisted later executive overreach, like FDR's failed Court-Packing plan. Individual political challenges to republican systems are concerning, but the erosion of republican culture also leads to irreversible shifts in the political framework. Political bribery, unchecked imperialism, and government serving corporate interests over citizens combine to steadily capture the system. A select group of actors has crafted a continuous, increasingly scripted cultural-political spectacle, contributing to civic decline. As a result, the public has reduced active participation in governance in exchange for the passive right to cheer or criticize from the sidelines. The fall of the Roman Republic, which endured for centuries before giving way to tyrants and emperors, offers useful context—lessons on not only what values to uphold but also on how reform attempts can backfire. Half-hearted efforts to fix inequality and instability often strained the system, pushing it closer to dysfunction and leading it to autocracy. Understanding Republican Rome's successes and failures offers lessons for addressing today's challenges. A balanced republican political system encourages elites to compromise, build consensus, and compete for public approval, qualities the early Roman Republic struggled to develop after its establishment in 509 BC. The Senate, dominated by the patrician aristocracy, functioned as an advisory body in theory, but in practice, it exercised significant control over finances, foreign policy, and much of the legislative process. Nonetheless, there was strong competition among patrician families for the two annual consulship positions. These roles, filled through the cursus honorum (course of honor), ensured that two capable leaders rose to the position in an established hierarchy, and shared short-term executive authority, limiting any concentration of power. Consuls often entered the Senate or assumed other political positions after their terms, where they could be prosecuted for misconduct. This rotation and accountability meant leaders' interests lay in the smooth running of the state, rather than amassing personal prestige for their role or for past glories. The design of Roman statues also supported this culture, celebrating the civic virtue of individuals over personal achievements. Statues portrayed aging and imperfections, in deliberate contrast to the idealized perfection of Greek art. The Republic also barred actors from government, viewing their imitation of life as deceptive and unworthy of public office. Like other effective republican city-states, Republican Rome thrived on political engagement, though participation was uneven. The Republic'sseasonal political process, shaped by agricultural cycles, military campaigns, and religious festivals, advantaged wealthy landowners who could afford to leave their estates for politics, perpetuating uneven and inconsistent efforts to address problems. Political advancement in turn often hinged on military successes, making military campaigns common and sometimes pursued for personal ambition rather than strategic necessity. Yet this seasonal structure still created predictable opportunities for many citizens to travel to Rome to participate in political affairs, ensuring concentrated and focused decision-making during key periods. It also provided ways to reduce the power imbalance between the patricians and plebeians, or commoners. The Conflict of the Orders (5th to 3rd centuries BC) brought about significant gains for plebeians. Mass strikes disrupted Rome's economy and soldiers refused to fight, forcing reforms such as the creation of another legislative assembly, the Concilium Plebis, alongside theComita Tributa. Additionally, after 451 BC, legal safeguards via the Twelve Tables and the establishment of the Tribunes of the Plebs—two annually elected magistrates with executive power to protect plebeian interests—were also won. During the 4th century BC, plebeians gained greater social mobility, including the right to intermarry with patricians, opening access to the consulship, Senate, and positions of religious authority. After 338 BC, the Latin Rights extended certain privileges to non-Roman communities in Italy, such as intermarriage and participation in commerce. While full citizenship came gradually, these measures integrated new populations while preserving the identity of Roman citizens. Despite the Republic's growing wealth and territories, inequality remained rife. Plebeians were the backbone of the army and bore the brunt of imperial expansion but reaped few rewards. Longer military service in support of campaigns left them unable to tend to their farms, indebting many. Patricians often capitalized on this by purchasing their lands, while the use of enslaved labor from conquests diminished plebeians' bargaining power as essential workers. Many moved to Rome, swelling the urban poor. Earlier republics, including Rome, had periodically erased debts and eased slavery to reset economic balances, but such measures waned in the Late Republic. Expansion also strained governance, as new territories were home to communities who had fewer rights than Roman citizens and paid heavily in taxes, further exposing the Republic's systemic inequities. Policies aimed at addressing inequality often ended up exacerbating it. The Lex Claudia (218 BC), for instance, barred senators and their sons from owning large commercial ships to prevent them from dominating Rome's expanding maritime trade. But this mostly benefited wealthy plebeians and other elites who could afford their own fleets, widening economic disparities. Richer plebeians also disproportionately benefited from privileges like access to higher office, enabling only some to join the senatorial elite. Meanwhile, the equestrian order emerged as a distinct wealthy class rooted in Rome's cavalry. Though largely lacking formal political power, members enjoyed elevated benefits and economic strength that deepened Rome's social stratification. Many new elites became populist reformers, or populares ('for the people') who were opposed to the senatorial elite, known as optimates ('best men'). Distinctions between the two groups were not always strict—the popularesincluded both new aristocratic elites and sidelined senatorial factions seeking to reclaim influence lost to dominant optimates. The motivations of populares-aligned politicians ranged from genuine reform to self-serving opportunism, and they used plebeian support to shift the power dynamic in their favor. Alliances were fluid, showing how Roman politics often prioritized status and influence over rigid ideology. Elite infighting further motivated the plebeians to demand greater equality by leveraging their numbers and citizenship powers. Political gridlock became more frequent, and violence escalated. Prominent pro-plebeian leaders like Tiberius Gracchus (133 BC), Gaius Gracchus (121 BC), and Publius Clodius Pulcher (52 BC) were assassinated, alongside many of their supporters. In this way, Roman politics devolved into a zero-sum struggle where the defeated often faced death. The use of violence and intimidation to damage plebeian interests, coupled with ongoing inequality, made them more inclined to break with political customs and precedents when it suited their cause. Power was increasingly extended in executive positions, with populares-aligned Gaius Marius holding seven consulships, and citizen soldiers showing increasing loyalty to individual commanders rather than the state. Marius's eventual defeat by patrician-allied Lucius Cornelius Sulla led to a dramatic overcorrection. During his dictatorship (82–79 BC), Sulla's constitution aimed to curb instability by empowering the old aristocracy and Senate, severely weakening the tribunes, and restricting the powers of citizenship. The emboldened aristocracy did little to address underlying economic inequality. Ambitious figures like Pompey, through military power, and Marcus Licinius Crassus, through immense wealth, exploited these tensions to consolidate power and play kingmaker. Sulla's reforms ultimately collapsed under Julius Caesar, whose plebeian-friendly policies bypassed the Senate by leveraging popular assemblies, exposing the new fragility of Rome's legal system. The growing glorification of individual leaders reached a turning point when Caesar became the first living Roman to appear on a coin, a stark departure from tradition. After being declared dictator for life, his assassination by senators angered the public and triggered a power struggle and civil war. This ultimately led to the rise of Caesar's adopted heir, Octavian, who centralized authority in 27 BC and later became known as Augustus. A facade of republican governance was maintained, but many Romans, associating it with chaos and instability, willingly traded their political rights to escape oligarchic rule, violence, and uncertainty. When rumors spread of Octavian relinquishing his special powers, public sentiment opposed the idea. With the establishment of the Roman Empire, an urban proletariat dependent on state-sponsored food distribution and entertained by spectacles like gladiator games became increasingly pacified under the strategy of 'bread and circuses,' solidifying the new order. A reshuffling of the nobility, suppression of opposition, and unchecked territorial expansion fueled instability in Republican Rome. However, persistent inequality remained the Republic's core weakness for its 500-year existence, coupled with flawed attempts to address it. These pose lessons for the U.S. today. Inequality remains a core challenge in the U.S. Once marked by strong social mobility, at least for white residents, ithas declined since the 1940s, initially due to the end of the post-war boom but now reflecting deeper systemic flaws. Compared to the EU, U.S. social welfare lags, while policies like corporate bailouts underscore how citizens bear the debt burden while large corporations profit from government intervention and lucrative contracts. A culture of consumerism encourages U.S. citizens to take on debt, mirroring the problems of the Roman Republic, instead of building a more efficient economic system. Though there are notable similarities between Republican Rome's challenges and those faced by the U.S., the latter faces its own unique set of issues. In Rome, the wealthy were directly involved in political life, using their influence to shape decisions. In contrast, U.S. elites exert control through representatives, who, while not typically from the uppermost of the wealthy social classes, are incentivized to serve their interests. This indirect control reduces the accountability of the elite, as their influence is masked by the modern U.S. political structure and hidden from public view. Though corrupt or inefficient politicians can be removed or prosecuted, those truly pulling the strings remain largely untouched, allowing the pay-to-play political system to continue unabated. Rome's political processes grew opaque and less respected, a trend increasingly seen in contested U.S. elections in recent decades. While skepticism arose among Democrats after George W. Bush's controversial victory in 2000 and Trump's 2016 win, these doubts remained within institutional boundaries. However, election denial escalated dramatically with Trump's response to Joe Biden's 2020 victory, and the ensuing 2021 insurrection marked a major challenge to the peaceful transfer of power and trust in electoral integrity. Restoring trust in the process requires clear rules on voting, role assignment, and transparency in procedures. Laws crafted through open processes rather than private deals are crucial, allowing citizens to view the electoral process and governance as fair, smooth, and rooted in mutual understanding. However, the dangers of unrelenting public political engagement have become more pronounced. Modern technology enables 24/7 politicization, and constant campaigning distracts from governance and risks citizen burnout. Public apathy allows organized elites to dominate politics, and,according to legal scholar Ganesh Sitaraman, expanding the electorate can even amplify factional power since only well-resourced groups can effectively mobilize and strategize. The U.S. judiciary remains distinct in its reliance on common law, a system shared by a few English-speaking countries, allowing adaptability through evolving precedents as new cases are brought forward. The use of juries places foundational responsibility on citizens' moral and legal judgment, ensuring public participation. However, this system is increasingly vulnerable to politicization, as judicial appointments and voting processes for judges and other judicial/law enforcement positions risk undermining impartiality and fairness. The Founding Fathers meanwhile opposed political parties, fearing factionalism would fracture national unity. Today, the two major parties and their supporters increasingly treat politics as a sports rivalry, prioritizing spectacle over policy debate. Both parties leverage entertainment for engagement—Ronald Reagan became the first actor-president in 1981, followed by entertainer Trump in 2017, while Democrats have consistently relied on the power of celebrity to attract voters. This reliance on high-profile public figures allows citizens to disengage, as these amplified individuals are granted tacit approval to shape policy—even when they lack the expertise to do so—reducing the public's role in democratic governance to passive spectatorship. Violent rhetoric undermines the culture of compromise essential to republics. While Trump is commonly associated with this trend in the U.S. (and remains its most persistent voice), Democrats have also contributed. Political violence, once largely directed at major figures in the U.S. in the 1960s and 1970s,now increasingly threatens local officials as well. Comments about the existential danger posed by political opponents have been consistently undercut by post-election embraces. President Obamawelcomed Trump to the White House after the latter's election victory in 2016, just as Biden did in 2024, while Trump also softened his tone toward them after victories. These radical shifts in messaging reveal the performative nature of politicians' language and weaken the credibility of political discourse. A healthy republic resorts to war as a last option, relying on public support and deliberation. Yet although Congress holds the constitutional authority to declare war, it has not done so since 1941. Instead, executive war powers have expanded through the abuse of emergency provisions, sidelining public influence in decisions of war and peace. Numerous presidents have labeled major recent wars like Vietnam, Iraq, and Afghanistan as mistakes, eroding trust in leadership to responsibly conduct war. The Trump administration now faces the challenge of addressing immigration and undocumented populations. Past policies like Reagan's Amnesty Bill and Obama's executive action for so-called Dreamers caused friction and had far-reaching political consequences. Immigration was a central issue in the 2024 election, with Trump likely to enjoy strong support for a crackdown on undocumented people. Solutions, however, must go beyond piecemeal fixes or mass deportations, which risk violating human rights and republican ideals. Similarly, less draconian approaches, such as those pursued under Biden, also fail to resolve the core issues of immigration reform and enforcement. Rome offers a cautionary tale: patricians and plebeians showed rare unity in the Late Republic when they united against Gracchus after he pledged to extend citizenship rights to other populations. The issue demonstrates the need to widen responsibility. The U.S. economy benefits from labor tied to undocumented populations, and the root causes of migration, includingdecades of U.S. intervention in Latin America, must also be acknowledged. The U.S. was originally founded as a republican league of states but quickly recognized the need for national unity to ensure defense and economic unity. Over time, the growing centralization of authority in Washington eroded the balance of this system and led to fears of ever-expanding executive power, particularly over matters of war. This consolidation of power enabled a more assertive and interventionist foreign policy, allowing the federal government to project power globally. Yet U.S. states retain significant rights, functioning in a federated system with distributed powers that allow states to experiment with their own agendas. The areas in which they can do so include health care reforms, voting rights, and working together to counterbalance federal authority. American citizens also benefit from strong protections enshrined in the Bill of Rights, which, despite historical flaws in terms of racial and gender equity, established safeguards against government overreach. However, a hesitance to fully leverage these rights remains, partly due to ignorance. Rights intended to benefit all citizens, such as the right to bear arms, or judicially determined issues like access to abortion, frequently evolve into sources of contention, framed as victories for one side rather than universal benefits. This risks turning benefits into partisan battlegrounds, undermining their broader societal purpose. Many rights Americans enjoy were secured not by courts interpreting the Constitution but through legislative action driven by social movements, showing that the true source of rights lies within the collective efforts of citizens and lawmakers. U.S. presidents have been generally unable to radically alter the nation's political system, though the Jacksonian era proves there are exceptions. Andrew Jackson's presidency (1829–1837), as well as the years immediately before and after, solidified the two-party system, expanded the use of veto power, and centralized executive authority, reshaping the role of the presidency. Jackson, a populist, challenged corrupt elites and the political establishment but also aggravated tensions between the federal and state governments. Democratic participation was broadened, but it was limited to white men, and resulted in officeholders being replaced with people loyal to individuals, with support for the continuity of slavery and the ethnic cleansing of Native Americans. Concentrating authority away from the executive in a few oversight bodies or enlarged bureaucracy can also backfire, often encouraging corruption rather than transparency. For example, legislative reforms for campaign finance in the 1970s, intended to increase transparency, inadvertently fueled an increase in lobbying, attack ads, and exploitation of the electoral process. This shift, intended to curb corporate influence, instead deepened it, allowing corporations and interest groups to find new ways to wield power. The Founding Fathers, while focused on preventing tyranny through checks and balances, could not foresee the enormous role that corporate interests would play in shaping political outcomes, creating a system where legal monetary contributions increasingly dictate policy. The U.S. faces a major struggle in adapting its republican system to the realities of the 21st century. While executive power has been pivotal in addressing monumental issues, such as the abolition of slavery, it also carries a risk of abuse. Efforts to forcefully reform republics from the top down, like those seen in Rome, often impose rigid systems that fail to meet society's evolving needs. On the other hand, an over-reliance on populist people power without the necessary safeguards can lead to impulsive decisions and destabilized governance. Rejecting populism does not equate to diminishing civic engagement; rather, it calls for more sophisticated participation for constructive political processes. U.S. citizens retain significant power, including the right to gather, protest, and exercise free speech and association. Realizing the full potential of these rights and their responsible use requires a deeper understanding of the political system and a commitment to responsible use. This can be achieved by learning from other countries that cultivate republican values through education and habits from a young age, supported by public funding, and promoting political legitimacy through transparency and participation. Ignoring the need to address the decline in civic culture and public understanding of the system of government will further weaken the foundation of democratic practices. Reforming the U.S. republic is essential, but institutions like the Bipartisan Policy Center, despite their efforts to bridge divides, have been criticized for being compromised by corporate interests, which exposes the system's vulnerability to such interference. Over time, bipartisanship has become entrenched as a long-term alignment in support of big-money interests and an imperialist foreign policy, sidelining efforts for systemic change and diverging sharply from the best aspects of the early U.S. vision. Contrastingly, the current discourse around reform is often filtered through partisan lenses, populism, or authoritarian impulses, with many advocating for quick fixes rather than substantive solutions. Meaningful reform, however, will be a slow and contentious process, and progress will remain elusive without addressing the root causes of major problems and accepting a collective responsibility to solve them.

Breaking Latin America’s Cycle Of Low Growth And Violence – Analy...	Violent crime and insecurity have a disproportionate impact on Latin America and the Caribbean, with severe consequences for socioeconomic development. Despite representing just 8% of the world’s population, the region accounts for nearly one-third of global homicides. This as well as other alarming statistics highlight the urgent need for comprehensive strategies to address the far-reaching effects of crime and violence. New research by the IDB and IMF highlights how crime, insecurity and low growth reinforce each other in a vicious cycle that stifles investment, reduces tourism, and accelerates emigration. Macroeconomic instability—recessions, inflation spikes, and rising inequality—is associated with increased violence. Easily available firearms and organized crime amplify these effects, undermining institutions and the rule of law. Quantifying the Costs of Crime A recent IDB paper quantifies the direct losses, estimating that crime and violence cost the region 3.4 percent of GDP annually. These costs stem from productivity losses due to lives lost, injuries, and imprisonment; private-sector expenditures on security; and public spending on police, justice, and prisons. This is equivalent to 80 percent of the region’s public education budgets and double its social assistance spending. But the impact of crime doesn’t end there. It discourages investment, reduces tourism, and drives emigration, further weakening economic resilience and constraining the region’s future growth. IMF research reveals that crime hampers innovation and reduces firm productivity, compounding economic stagnation over time. Leveraging geo-localized data on nightlights, the study finds that halving homicide rates in violent municipalities could increase their economic output by up to 30 percent. At the regional level, as shown in last year’s IMF research, reducing homicide rates to the global average could boost Latin America and the Caribbean’s annual GDP growth by 0.5 percentage points. Conversely, macroeconomic instability often fuels spikes in violence: a recession in LAC is associated with a 6 percent increase in homicides the following year, while inflation spikes above 10 percent are linked to a 10 percent rise in homicides the year after. Growing inequality further exacerbates the link between economic stagnation and crime. How can policymakers help break the cycle? Breaking this vicious circle requires a deeper understanding of its root causes and impacts. Rigorous research and better data are essential for designing public policies that effectively reduce crime. Institutions like the IDB and IMF can generate evidence, monitor crime dynamics, advise member countries, and facilitate discussions. As the topic has become macro critical in the region, the institutions brought together experts and policymakers in a joint conference a few weeks back. First, sound economic policy plays a preventive role. Stability, low inflation, robust social safety nets, and opportunities that reduce inequality and expand access to education and employment are critical to breaking the cycle of violence and stagnation. Financial authorities are also uniquely positioned to weaken criminal networks by addressing illicit markets, curtailing financial flows, and tackling money laundering—cutting off resources that sustain organized crime. Second, because the impact of crime extends far beyond direct economic costs, economic policymakers must adopt a broader role by targeting high-risk groups, improving crime monitoring, and enhancing interagency coordination. Effective interventions can deliver transformative results. With IMF support, Jamaica implemented reforms that protected public investment and social spending while successfully halving debt between 2012 and 2022. Community-based interventions supported by the IDB reduced gang violence in 68% of affected neighborhoods. In Rosario province, Argentina implemented a comprehensive strategy to combat crime, including territorial control of high-risk neighborhoods by the Federal Police, stricter prison systems for high-profile offenders, and collective prosecution of criminal groups under new legislation like the anti-mafia law. These efforts, alongside progress on a juvenile penal code to deter drug traffickers from recruiting minors, have led to 65% reduction homicides in 11 months. In Honduras, strategic security reforms contributed to a 14% decline in the homicide rate and an 8% increase in public confidence in law enforcement. Policymakers must prioritize using resources effectively, given the scope of the challenge. Public spending on security in the region is already high—around 1.9 percent of GDP, or 7.4 percent of total public expenditure—and may be even greater where the military and subnational governments are involved. Finance ministers and fiscal authorities need a full understanding of these costs, covering police, courts, prisons, and related institutions, to ensure funds are allocated efficiently to areas with the highest impact. They also need to monitor them in the same way they surveil other large spending tickets, evaluating their impact and pressing for results. Transnational Crime Demands Regional Cooperation Tackling crime solely at the national level isn’t sufficient. Criminal groups operate across borders, making isolated responses ineffective and fragmented. To address this shared challenge, countries must collaborate more closely to develop stronger, more coordinated solutions. Recognizing the transnational nature of crime, the IDB’s Alliance for Security, Justice, and Development seeks to unite governments, civil society, and private-sector actors. This alliance not only aims to strengthen institutions and enhance cooperation but also supports public policies and mobilizes resources to implement evidence-based solutions that effectively combat organized crime and violence. Regional collaboration is crucial for disrupting the sophisticated, interconnected networks of organized crime that undermine the rule of law and economic stability. By fostering unified efforts, institutions like the IMF and IDB alongside governments and civil society, have a critical role to play in this effort. With people's lives on the line, the true impact of these efforts must be felt on the ground—by creating safer streets, restoring hope in communities, and offering individuals a real chance to thrive economically in a future free from violence.

Why Is Trump Warning BRICS Nations Against De-Dollarization With ...	In a significant and provocative statement, President-elect Donald Trump has issued a stern warning to the BRICS nations—Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa—regarding their ambitions to reduce reliance on the U.S. dollar in global trade. This warning comes in the form of a threat to impose a staggering 100% tariff on goods from these countries if they pursue de-dollarization initiatives. As the BRICS bloc expands its membership and seeks to establish alternative currency frameworks, Trump's declaration underscores a significant clash in the international economic landscape. The Context of De-Dollarization De-dollarization refers to the process by which countries seek to diminish their dependence on the U.S. dollar as a reserve currency and medium of exchange. This movement has gained momentum in recent years, particularly among emerging economies that perceive the dominance of the dollar as a tool for American economic hegemony. The BRICS nations have been at the forefront of this initiative, exploring ways to facilitate trade in local currencies and even considering the establishment of a shared currency. The impetus for de-dollarization has been fueled by various factors, including geopolitical tensions and economic sanctions imposed by the U.S. The most notable example is the sanctions against Russia following its invasion of Ukraine, which prompted many nations to reconsider their reliance on the dollar for international transactions. The BRICS nations have discussed these issues extensively at their summits, aiming to create a more balanced global financial system that does not rely solely on U.S. financial mechanisms. Trump's Position and Threats In a recent post on his social media platform, Truth Social, Trump articulated his firm stance against any attempts by BRICS countries to move away from the dollar. He stated, 'The idea that the BRICS Countries are trying to move away from the Dollar while we stand by and watch is OVER.' He demanded commitments from these nations not to create or endorse any alternative currency that could rival the U.S. dollar. Trump's threats are not merely rhetorical; they reflect a broader strategy aimed at safeguarding U.S. economic interests. By imposing tariffs that could double the cost of imports from BRICS nations, he aims to deter these countries from pursuing de-dollarization efforts. This approach aligns with Trump's long-standing belief that maintaining the dollar's status as the world's reserve currency is crucial for American economic stability. Implications for Global Trade The potential implementation of 100% tariffs on BRICS countries would have significant ramifications for global trade dynamics. The U.S. economy is deeply intertwined with many BRICS nations; for instance, trade between the U.S. and China reached approximately $690.6 billion in 2022, comprising about $536.8 billion in imports from China and $153.8 billion in exports to China. Meanwhile, trade with India was around $191.8 billion in 2021, and it is expected to have increased in 2022, reflecting the growing economic ties between the two countries. A sudden increase in tariffs could lead to retaliatory measures from these countries, escalating trade tensions and potentially destabilizing global markets. Moreover, such a move could accelerate efforts among BRICS nations to establish alternative trading systems that bypass U.S. financial controls altogether. Countries like China and Russia have already begun developing their own payment systems—such as China's Cross-Border Interbank Payment System (CIPS) and Russia's System for Transfers of Financial Messages (SPFS)—to facilitate trade without relying on SWIFT or other Western-controlled financial networks. The Geopolitical Landscape Trump's threats come at a time when BRICS is expanding its membership, welcoming new entrants such as Iran, Saudi Arabia, Egypt, and Ethiopia in 2024. This expansion signifies a shift towards greater economic cooperation among non-Western nations, challenging the traditional dominance of Western powers in global finance. The geopolitical implications are profound; as emerging economies band together under the BRICS umbrella, they are seeking to assert their influence on global economic policies and reduce their vulnerability to Western sanctions and economic pressures. Trump's warning may serve as a catalyst for these countries to accelerate their de-dollarization efforts as they strive for greater economic autonomy. Economic Consequences for the U.S. While Trump's aggressive stance may resonate with his base and appeal to nationalist sentiments, it also risks alienating key trading partners and could have unintended consequences for the U.S. economy itself. The imposition of high tariffs could lead to increased prices for American consumers and businesses reliant on imports from BRICS nations. Additionally, if countries like China and India successfully establish alternative trading mechanisms that reduce their reliance on the dollar, it could undermine American economic power in the long run. The dollar's status as the world's primary reserve currency has afforded the U.S. significant advantages, including lower borrowing costs and greater influence over global financial systems. The Future of Global Currencies As we look ahead, several questions arise regarding the future of global currencies in light of Trump's threats against BRICS nations: Will BRICS countries continue their push for de-dollarization despite potential U.S. tariffs? Given their collective economic power and shared interests in reducing dependence on Western financial systems, it is likely that they will persist in exploring alternatives. How will other countries respond to Trump's threats? Nations outside of BRICS may also reconsider their reliance on the dollar if they perceive that U.S. economic policies are increasingly unilateral or punitive. What strategies will Trump employ if he faces resistance from BRICS? Beyond tariffs, potential measures could include export controls or accusations of currency manipulation against countries engaging in trade outside of dollar-denominated transactions. Trump's warning to BRICS nations encapsulates a broader struggle over control of global finance and trade dynamics. As emerging economies seek greater independence from U.S.-centric systems through de-dollarization efforts, they are likely to face significant pushback from an administration determined to maintain its economic hegemony. The evolving relationship between Trump's America and an increasingly assertive BRICS bloc will shape not only international trade policies but also geopolitical alliances in an era marked by shifting power dynamics. As both sides navigate this complex landscape, it remains crucial for policymakers worldwide to consider the long-term implications of their choices on global stability and economic cooperation.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWeolo_jpzVp5mNJ3VIbb4xz	2024-12-06T16:37:20-08:00	
Time For Truthful Narratives On Immigration – OpEd	The 'migrant crisis' was manufactured and is the fault of both Trump and Biden. We need to understand that the U.S. needs immigrants more than immigrants need the U.S. A quiet panic has broken out within immigrant communities across the United States ahead of Donald Trump's inauguration on January 20, 2025. Mixed-status families are expecting to be separated, DACA recipients foresee their status being revoked, those with Temporary Protected Status are pessimistic about the program remaining valid, and asylum seekers fear the worst. Indeed, if Project 2025's anti-immigrant agenda is fully enacted, the horrors of family separation that the nation witnessed in 2018 under Trump's first term will pale in comparison to what's coming. And yet, Trump might claim that this time, he's merely following the public's desires. The prevailing story of the 2024 presidential election is that voters were so fed up with immigration upending their lives that they picked a leader who promised to do something about it. Headlines such as this New York Times piece on Election Day claimed, 'Voters Were Fed Up Over Immigration. They Voted for Trump.' Indeed, polls showed likely voters ranking immigration as either the top issue, or second only to the economy. What has gone unsaid about public discontent over immigration and Trump's coming assault on immigrant rights is that the Biden administration paved the way for it, manufacturing a 'migrant crisis' and volleying it right into Trump's hands so he could lob it all the way to the White House. What's needed are not just better policies but a rewriting of the narratives about immigration and immigrants so that vulnerable human beings are no longer political scapegoats every four years. Gallup polls show that national anxiety over immigration significantly increased over the four years that Joe Biden was president. The fraction of Americans wanting lower levels of immigration had been slightly decreasing for years, landing at around 30 percent. In 2020 that number began rising, and by 2024, it had jumped to 55 percent. It's tempting to conclude that this trend is merely a matter of perception, the result of successful propaganda, of Trump's constant drumbeat that Biden opened the floodgates at the border, rolling out the welcome mat for millions of people with no papers. Indeed, far too many people hold false views of immigrants in the U.S., from assuming they are more prone to committing violent crimes—not true—to the idea that they are stealing jobs from native-born Americans and longtime residents—also not true. The adoption of such falsehoods is clearly Trump's doing. However, there are plenty of credible reports across the country, in small-town America and in urban centers, that demonstrate a real struggle with absorbing tens of thousands of newly resettled people from foreign nations. Such dynamics reinforced the notion that immigration is out of control and gave credence to Trump's lies about immigrants. What's going unsaid is that migrants from nonwhite nations in Latin America, the Caribbean, Africa, and Asia are being deliberately dumped into towns and cities with no plan for orderly absorption and assimilation—in direct contrast to how well the Biden administration welcomed Ukrainian refugees. A February 2024 in-depth report by Jerusalem Demsas in the Atlantic is one of the few analyses that explored what happened and why. 'Russia's 2022 invasion of Ukraine brought a separate influx of displaced people into U.S. cities that quietly assimilated most of them,' explained Demsas. The numbers of Ukrainian refugees and nonwhite immigrants in many towns and cities have been comparable, but the ways in which they were resettled have sometimes been starkly different. Based on interviews with mayors and municipal leaders, Demsas realized there were 'two major differences in federal policy' that explained the contrast. One policy difference was that Ukrainian refugees were allowed to work as soon as they arrived in the U.S., while subsequent waves of migrants were prohibited from working and then demonized for using government aid. The other difference was that the Biden administration carefully coordinated Ukrainian arrivals with local officials to ensure their proper assimilation. And it chose not to do so with groups arriving from across the Southern border. This meant that those local leaders who could politicize migrants did so by pointing to the chaos their presence seemed to provoke and by adopting policies that deliberately worsened the optics of immigration. 'To call this moment a 'migrant crisis' is to let elected federal officials off the hook,' concluded Demsas. If the federal government had treated nonwhite Latin American, Caribbean, African, and Asian migrants the same way it treated Ukrainian refugees, voters would likely not have been as swayed by Trump's lies as they were. A similar scenario played out with asylum seekers at the border. Rather than allowing those seeking asylum to make their case in an orderly way, the first Trump administration tried to break the entire system, creating chaos in order to blame asylees. Joe Biden's administration blithely allowed the restrictions to remain in place, breaking his campaign promise. The reality is that the undocumented immigrant population in the U.S. increased by only 800,000 people between 2019 and 2022 and remains below 2007 levels. In a nation of 335 million people, this is less than a quarter of a percent of the population. How can such a tiny fraction of people be the source of so many problems as Trump claims? Americans are not anti-immigrant. In fact, they are pro-immigration. A new Pew Research poll released on November 22, 2024, finds that nearly two-thirds of Americans are happy to have undocumented immigrants remain in the nation with legal protections provided certain conditions are met, such as security checks and lawful employment. The reason it appears as though Americans are anti-immigrant is because they're being told that hordes of people are breaking the rules, sidestepping order, and forcing their way in to cause chaos, commit crimes, and steal jobs. This is both Trump's fault, and Biden's. Migration is a large-scale phenomenon of vulnerable populations fleeing war, poverty, persecution, climate change, and more. When given accessible procedures to enter another nation legally, migrants, refugees, and asylum seekers will do everything possible to follow the rules. Because, why not? Why would they deliberately jeopardize their own long-term security when given the chance? It turns out, the system has been deliberately broken in order to manufacture a crisis and help gutless politicians claim they are being 'tough on immigration.' The U.S. desperately needs immigrant workers. This is true not only in low-wage industries but in such highly skilled fields as medicine where immigrants are disproportionately represented. For example, the Migration Policy Institute found that '[w]hile immigrants represent 14 percent of the Illinois population, they make up 37 percent of its physicians and 19 percent of its registered nurses.' There is a nationwide shortage of medical workers—physicians, nurses, technicians, and home health aides—a gap that could be filled by skilled new immigrants. As the U.S.'s elder population continues to live longer, needing more care, and as the national birth rate falls, immigrants have stepped in to provide care and pay taxes to fund services they aren't even allowed to access. Indeed, many nations in the Global South are struggling with the 'brain drain' of their most talented workers leaving to work in the U.S. and other Western nations. The stories we are telling about immigrants are fueling misplaced panic in the U.S. We cannot rely on Trump to fix what he sought to break. In the coming months and years, the devastation the incoming president will wreak on vulnerable populations will test our collective morality. What's needed before the next election are truthful narratives about immigrants, including the fact that the migrant crisis has been manufactured and the legal immigration system deliberately broken for political gain, forcing most people into untenable situations. Most importantly, we need to be clear that our nation needs immigrants just as, if not more than, immigrants need the U.S. About the author: Sonali Kolhatkar is an award-winning multimedia journalist.

Berlin Conference: Colonial Legacy Continues 140 Years Later – Op...	From 15 November 1884 until 26 February 1885, the Berlin West Africa Conference was held in Germany where numerous European states convened to carve up the continent based upon their own economic interests. By Abayomi Azikiwe Commonly known as the Berlin Conference, the gathering marked the consolidation of European imperialist rule on the African continent which lasted formally for more than a century. One artistic expression which emanated from the gathering was a portrayal of King Leopold II carving up a giant cake which represented the African continent. Africa had already garnered enormous wealth for several European and North American states through the Atlantic Slave Trade and the establishment of colonies in Western Hemisphere. Portugal was one of the earliest colonizers and enslavers in Africa and maintained a presence from the 15th through the 20th centuries. Spain and Portugal, the pioneers of European slave and colonial structures, were later overshadowed by the Dutch, British, French and the United States. The abolition of the Atlantic Slave Trade and eventually involuntary servitude in the Western feudal and burgeoning capitalist states did not usher in a renewed and more inclusive form of bourgeois democracy. Colonialism was a logical outcome of the slave system. As industrial production provided an enhanced rational methodology for the exploitation of labor, the colonial system with its reliance on land seizures, population displacement, forced taxation, cash crop production and mining reaped far greater profits for the ruling class. African enslavement was resisted internally from its early phase between the 15th and 18th centuries until its eventual demise in the 19th century. The successful slave rebellion which transformed into a revolutionary movement in Haiti between 1791-1804 signaled the rise of widespread resistance to human bondage. In the U.S. notable rebellions such as on the Louisiana German Coast of 1811; Denmark Vessey in Charleston, South Carolina during 1822; Nat Turner and his comrades in South Hampton County, Virginia in 1831; John Brown at Harper’s Ferry in Virginia in 1859; and the 200,000 Africans who joined the Union army in the Civil War were motivated by the desire to eliminate their enslavement. Interestingly enough it would be the territories initially colonized by Spain and Portugal which would be the last countries to abolish slavery in the late 1880s in Cuba and Brazil. However, despite the legal abolition of involuntary servitude, colonialism, racism and economic exploitation would continue. Codifying Colonial Exploitation The Berlin Conference was designed to utilize the knowledge acquired by the European explorers who traveled throughout areas of the African continent to assess their capacity for the domination of land and labor along with the extraction of its riches. Henry Morton Stanley, who was born in Wales and later immigrated to the U.S. where he served in both the Confederate and Union armies during the Civil War, was recruited by King Leopold II to map out areas of Central Africa for the exploitation of the land and its people. These imperialist designs on Central Africa by the Belgian monarchy conflicted with that of France which had deployed its own explorer, Pierre Savorgnan de Brazza, who proceeded to challenge Leopold II for his claim to the area. The connection between the exploration and mapping of Central and other regions of Africa, and the pursuit of profits was made clear in Leopold II’s instructions to Stanley when he said: 'It is not about Belgian colonies. It is about establishing a new state that is as large as possible and about its governance. It should be clear that in this project there can be no question of granting the Negroes the slightest form of political power. That would be ridiculous. The whites, who lead the posts, have all the power.' Consequently, the purpose of the Berlin Conference was to resolve these differences so that the total colonization of Africa could move forward rapidly. The entire process of colonization was an extremely violent affair. Between 1876 and 1908 in Congo, estimates are that 8-10 million Africans died due to the horrendous treatment from the Belgian ruling class. During this initial period the territory was run exclusively by the monarchy. After 1908 the Congo came under Belgian colonial rule where it remained until 1960. One source said of the 1884-85 Berlin meeting that: 'The conference, proposed by Portugal in pursuance of its special claim to control of the Congo estuary, was necessitated by the jealousy and suspicion with which the great European powers viewed one another’s attempts at colonial expansion in Africa. The general act of the Conference of Berlin declared the Congo River basin to be neutral (a fact that in no way deterred the Allies from extending the war into that area in World War I); guaranteed freedom for trade and shipping for all states in the basin; forbade slave trading; and rejected Portugal’s claims to the Congo River estuary—thereby making possible the founding of the independent Congo Free State, to which Great Britain, France, and Germany had already agreed in principle.' Nonetheless, this conference was not able to prevent violent disputes over the future of Africa and the world. The European imperialists in Congo and many other regions of Africa utilized repressive measures which were reminiscent of the period of enslavement where forced labor, coercion, detentions, exile, beatings and killings were routine. During the first decade of the 20th century, the German colonialists carried out genocidal onslaughts in South-West Africa (now Namibia) during 1904-1907 when 60-80 percent of the African population was wiped out. During the same time period in Tanganyika (now Tanzania) in East Africa, the German conquerors killed thousands of people between 1905-1907. These acts of genocide by Germany were in response to resistance wars launched by the Africans in Namibia and Tanzania when they rose up against the national oppression and economic exploitation inflicted by imperialism. World War I (1914-1918) and World War II (1939-1945) grew out of contradictions within the imperialist system. After 1945, the U.S. emerged as the undisputed dominant political and economic power in the capitalist world. The only real challenges to imperialism emerged from the socialist camp and the national liberation movements. Legacy of the Berlin Conference Colonialism remains in its various forms throughout the world. France has been exposed for its ongoing colonial project when recent rebellions have erupted in New Caledonia and Martinique. On the African continent, France relinquished most of its classical colonies and has exerted its influence through neocolonial structures which involve disadvantageous economic arrangements and the presence of military forces which guard the interests of Paris. In the early 1960s, the French government conducted nuclear weapons testing in the Sahara irrespective of the protests from the Ghana government under President Kwame Nkrumah. In recent years, the Sahel region of West Africa has been a flashpoint for anti-imperialist movements which have rejected French, U.S. and NATO military involvement. In Niger, where some of the largest deposits of uranium in the world exist, the long-term contract between the Committee to Safeguard the Homeland (CNSP) government for uranium extraction has been cancelled by the new administration. Reuters in a December 4 report pointed out: 'French nuclear firm Orano says the military authorities in Niger have taken control of its uranium mining operations in the West African country. After seizing power in a coup in July last year, Niger’s military rulers said they would revamp rules regulating the mining of raw materials by foreign companies. In June, they withdrew Orano’s permit to exploit one of the world’s largest uranium deposits. Orano then suspended production. This marks another escalation in the unravelling relationship between France and Niger, following the expulsion of French troops from its former colony.' These political shifts in the Alliance of Sahal States (AES) portend much for the future of imperialism in Africa and other geopolitical regions. African states were founding members of the Non-Aligned Movement (NAM) which recently condemned the Israeli airstrikes on the Islamic Republic of Iran. The African Union (AU) 55 member-states are participants in the Group of 77 Plus China which represents approximately 80 percent of the world’s population. The Brazil, Russia, India, China, South Africa Plus (BRICS) countries are seriously discussing de-dollarization and the building of a New Development Bank (NDB). With the statements made by the incoming U.S. administration of former President Donald Trump threatening large-scale tariffs not only against the leading trading partners of Washington which are Mexico and Canada, such measures are being weaponized as well against the BRICS countries seeking to break free from the dollar. These conflicting interests will intensify aggravating tensions over the direction of the world economic system. These divergent objectives will foster broader alliances among the peoples of the Global South and their counterparts among the working class and nationally oppressed within the imperialist states.

FIFA’s Cooked Findings: Saudi Arabia’s World Cup Bid – OpEd	FIFA has done it again. With its usual sparkle of inventive interpretation, amoral reasoning, and snappy bravura, the world football federation has deemed the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia fit for hosting the largest sporting event on the sporting calendar – not counting the Olympics. The FIFA Men’s World Cup will be hosted, yet again, in a desert country, where football is a most recent thing but cunning opportunism not. There are certainly many things going the way of Saudi Arabia, which submitted its official bid to host the tournament in July this year. For one thing, hosting such gargantuan events is crushingly costly to country, city and populace. Such discouragement tends to thin the field of contenders. (Saudi Arabia was the sole bidder for the 2034 tournament.) The country has also engaged in a sporting strategy that currently involves more than 900 sponsorship deals, one-third of which can be linked back to the country’s US$925 billion sovereign wealth fund. Football, in particular, has seen enormous investment from the Kingdom, be it through sponsorships, partnerships or investments. These measures are vital parts of the Kingdom’s 'Vision 2030' program. A report by the publicly funded Danish sports ethics institute Play the Game notes a degree of sophistication and versatility on the part of the Kingdom’s sporting leaders. 'Unlike many of their counterparts in global sports, Saudi sports leaders hold multiple roles that combine leadership in the sports sector with high-ranking positions within the state apparatus, granting them unparalleled political and financial authority.' These figures are chameleon in nature, simultaneously holding positions in the sporting field, vital ministries, state-owned enterprises, and the sovereign wealth fund itself. The authors of the report identify Yasir Al-Rumayyan as an example, a figure who occupies the position of governor of the Public Investment Fund and chairman of the state-owned oil and gas giant Aramco, in addition to being directly involved in sports. Doing so permits a seamless 'transition between acting as a sports leader, financial heavyweight, or a state representative, depending on the context.' Given the Kingdom’s extensive cultivation and fostering football, FIFA’s assessment of the bid was never going to be too harsh. Besides, football’s main governing body has its own partnership with Aramco, which was announced in April this year. 'This partnership,' stated FIFA President Gianni Infantino, 'will assist FIFA to successfully deliver its flagship tournaments over the next four years and, as is the case with all our commercial agreements, enable us to provide enhanced support to our 211 FIFA member associations across the globe.' Infantino went on to note Aramco’s 'strong record of supporting world-class events' while also taking an interest in 'developing grassroots sports initiatives.' The announcement did not impress over a hundred international women footballers who signed an open letter to the FIFA president decrying the Kingdom’s elaborate sportswashing exercise. 'Saudi authorities have been spending billions in sports sponsorship to distract from the regime’s brutal human rights reputation, but its treatment of women speaks for itself.' These included the imprisonment of Salma al-Shebab, Manal al-Gafiri, Fatima al-Shawarbi, Sukaynah al-Aithan and Nourah al-Qahtani. The letter also went on to lacerate the Saudi authorities for trampling 'not only on the rights of women, but on the freedom of all other citizens too. Imagine LGBTQ+ players, many of whom are heroes of our sport, being expected to promote Saudi Aramco during the 2027 [Women’s] World Cup, the national oil company of a regime that criminalises the relationships that they are in and the values they stand for?' These were merely rumblings to FIFA, whose assessment was almost embarrassingly glowing, coming in at 4.2 out of 5. The risk assessment for human rights was graded as 'medium'. The Saudi Gazette cooed with satisfaction at an evaluation that was 'the highest in the tournament’s history.' In its assessment, FIFA claimed to have 'consulted various sources, including the bidder’s human rights strategy, the mandated context assessment, as well as direct commitments from the host country and host cities, together with all contractual hosting documents, all of which notably contain provisions relating to respecting human rights in connection with the competition'. The governing body pushed the familiar and erroneous argument that the sport had 'good potential' to engender reforms and 'contribute to positive human rights outcomes'. Riyadh had also shown a 'good commitment to sustainability' though FIFA had to accept that the climate posed an 'elevated risk'. Many of the findings were reached on the basis of a report entitled 'Independent Context Assessment Prepared for the Saudi Arabian Football Federation in relation to the FIFA World Cup 2034'. (The term 'independent' in most reports suggests the contrary.) The assessments were always going to be favourably cooked. For one, it was authored by the Saudi arm of the Clifford Chance law firm. The report also failed to consider a range of relevant international human rights instruments given that the Kingdom had either not ratified them or because the Saudi Football Federation did not deem them relevant to the assessment. No mention, then, of freedom of expression, association and assembly, let alone discrimination against LGBTQI+ communities, the right to freedom of religion or certain labour rights such as trade union membership. Human rights groups have been busy trying to shift the focus back to the Kingdom’s spotty resume. In a October 28 statement, 11 organisations including Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch, Football Supporters Europe, labour organisations, Gulf human rights groups and a Saudi Arabian diaspora group warned that a poor human rights record had worsened 'under the de facto rule of Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, who has presided over a soaring number of mass executions, torture, enforced disappearance, severe restrictions on free expression, repression of women’s rights under the male guardianship system, LGBTI+ discrimination, and the killing of hundreds of migrants at the Saudi Arabia-Yemen border.' The Kafala (labour sponsorship) system, along with the prohibition of trade unions, continued to result in the exploitation of migrant workers. Not all has been smooth on the matter of endorsing FIFA’s decision, at least at the level of various football organisations whose approval is also sought. But even there, Saudi sporting strategy has been in evidence to ensure a lack of dissent. The Asian Football Confederation (AFC), for instance, was hardly going to disagree with the choice, given Riyadh’s embrace of the AFC as a global partner between 2021 and 2024, a relationship that was renewed in July 2024 for a further five years. At this writing, the Football Association remains uncertain on whether an official endorsement will be forthcoming. While the BBC has been told that FA officials are troubled by the human rights dimension, there is also a concern that accusations of hypocrisy will follow should the organisation then participate in the tournament. No one, it seems, wants to miss out on the party. And the Saudi authorities know this all too well.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWeolo_jpzVp5jdsBh3dql-L	2024-12-06T16:25:08-08:00	
Russia’s Invasion Of Ukraine And Its Impact On Nuclear Proliferat...	By Luke Coffey Russia’s large-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 has led to numerous unintended global consequences. Among these are heightened concerns about food insecurity, especially in vulnerable regions, and an acute energy crisis in Europe, which is only now being addressed through a complete restructuring of the continent’s energy imports. Economic uncertainty and inflation have surged, particularly in Africa and the Middle East. However, one consequence that has escaped widespread discussion is the impact on efforts to prevent nuclear proliferation. To understand this issue, it is essential to examine the recent history of nuclear weapons in the former Soviet Union. When the Soviet Union collapsed in 1991, 15 newly independent states emerged, three of which —Ukraine, Kazakhstan and Belarus — found themselves in possession of sizable numbers of Soviet nuclear weapons. While Kazakhstan and Belarus quickly transferred control of their nuclear arsenals to Moscow, Ukraine’s situation was different. At the time, Ukraine unexpectedly became the world’s third-largest nuclear power. This triggered an internal debate about the country’s nuclear future. On the one hand, many of these weapons were nearing the end of their operational life, and Ukraine lacked the resources to modernize and maintain them. On the other hand, there was significant support for retaining a nuclear deterrent to ensure the nation’s security and defense. Ultimately, after significant international pressure, Ukraine agreed to relinquish all its inherited nuclear weapons in exchange for substantial economic support and security guarantees from Russia, the US and the UK. This agreement culminated in the signing of the Budapest Memorandum on Security Assurances on Dec. 5, 1994. This week marks the 30th anniversary of the agreement. According to the memorandum, Russia, the UK and the US agreed to 'reaffirm their obligation to refrain from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of Ukraine, and that none of their weapons will ever be used against Ukraine except in self-defense or otherwise in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations.' However, as time went on, the Budapest Memorandum became fraught with ambiguities. It meant different things to different parties. Since Russia’s annexation of Crimea in 2014 and its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, Ukrainians have accused their Western partners of failing to honor the memorandum’s security guarantees. From the US perspective, the Budapest Memorandum was a memorandum — not a legally binding treaty. For the US, obligations under such agreements require Senate ratification to carry the force of law. While the US and UK argue that it is Russia, not them, that has violated the memorandum, this distinction remains a sore point for Ukraine. This week, during a NATO foreign ministers’ meeting in Brussels, Ukraine’s Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha held up the country’s original copy of the Budapest Memorandum, as a symbolic reminder to the world of the commitments made three decades ago. In light of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, three significant consequences for global nuclear nonproliferation efforts have emerged. First, no country currently in possession of nuclear weapons — or close to developing them — will willingly give them up. Ukraine’s experience has underscored the risks of disarmament. Had Ukraine retained even a limited nuclear deterrent, it is unlikely that Russia would have invaded in 2014 or 2022. This lesson will not be lost on other countries. States with nuclear ambitions will be emboldened to develop and maintain their arsenals, making global nuclear disarmament a distant goal. Secondly, the war in Ukraine has inadvertently strengthened the nuclear capabilities of Iran and North Korea. Facing unexpected setbacks in its campaign, Russia has relied on material and manpower support from these allies. North Korea, for example, has provided Russia with artillery shells and ballistic missiles. Recent reports even suggest North Korea has sent thousands of soldiers to fight alongside Russian forces. This support has not come without a price. It is widely suspected that Russia has offered nuclear or missile technology in exchange. Speaking in Brussels, NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte warned that 'there’s every reason to believe that nuclear and missile technology is flowing into North Korea.' Finally, the possibility of Ukraine pursuing a nuclear weapons program cannot be dismissed. With trust in the Budapest Memorandum shattered and the prospect of NATO membership — and its accompanying security guarantees — still remote, President Volodymyr Zelensky has hinted that Ukraine may have no choice but to reconsider its nuclear options. While there is no evidence that Ukraine is actively pursuing nuclear weapons, experts agree that the country has the technical expertise and resources to do so in the future. It would be a tragic irony if the Budapest Memorandum, designed to reduce the number of nuclear-armed states, ended up accelerating nuclear proliferation. The memorandum highlights how partial solutions to complex security problems can lead to unintended and far-reaching consequences. As President Donald Trump prepares to enter the Oval Office next year, he has expressed a desire to negotiate a settlement between Russia and Ukraine. Any such deal must include robust and enforceable security guarantees for Kyiv. Ukraine, understandably skeptical of diplomatic assurances, will demand more than cleverly worded agreements with little practical enforcement. Historians may one day look back on the Budapest Memorandum and the subsequent war as the moment the global nonproliferation regime began to unravel. Without credible commitments and enforcement mechanisms, efforts to curb the spread of nuclear weapons may prove futile, leaving the world a far more dangerous place. In this context, the lessons of the Budapest Memorandum should serve as a cautionary tale. Only comprehensive and enforceable security agreements can prevent the next crisis of trust — and proliferation—from happening in the future. Luke Coffey is a senior fellow at the Hudson Institute.

Reports Detail Forced Youth Conscription In Ethiopia	Tedla Hirigo, 17, worked as a street vendor in Adama city in Ethiopia’s Oromia region on November 11 when police detained him. 'When I visited the station in the evening, officers told me that he would be sent to a military training camp unless I paid 30,000 birr for his release,' Tedla’s mother told Ethiopian newspaper The Addis Standard. She said Tedla was her family’s primary source of income. 'He was raised without a father, and we don’t have the financial means to pay such a large sum.' Multiple sources report that the federal government is forcibly conscripting people to bolster its military strength for the intensifying Amhara region conflict. 'Youths are being rounded up and sent to military camps in many places in Addis Ababa,' Meseret Media reported on October 28. 'Our sources told us that after they take these children who do heavy work to the police station, they keep them in prison for some time and then take them to the military camp.' Another source told The Addis Standard on condition of anonymity that authorities in Fital town and surrounding villages announced an effort to have young people voluntarily enlist for military training. The resident said that no one volunteered, and 'government forces, in collaboration with local administrators, began rounding up individuals.' The Standard reported similar stories in Sheger city, which surrounds the federal capital, and of the detention of more than 20 Oromians who were threatened with military conscription at the Setema district police station in the western Jimma zone, several hundred kilometers southwest of Addis Ababa. In a November 15 statement, the Oromia regional government refuted allegations that security forces are abducting people for ransom, describing them as 'unfounded propaganda' and 'defamation.' The Amhara region conflict has escalated significantly since the Ethiopian National Defense Force (ENDF) launched an offensive that it called a 'final operation' against an Amhara militia known as Fano. An additional 40,000 troops reportedly were deployed. Calls for peace have 'fallen on deaf ears,' ENDF spokesperson Col. Getnet Adane said on October 1, according to Voice of America. 'The only language they understand is force,' he said. 'From now on we will talk to them in that language. For peace to prevail they need to be met with force. They have to be targeted, hit.' Members of Ethiopia’s security forces have been implicated in kidnapping and extortion cases, according to a late September report by the state-appointed Ethiopian Human Rights Commission. 'It is being done in broad daylight, especially in Sheger city,' an Oromia government source told Meseret Media. On the same day that the ENDF announced its military offensive, human rights group Amnesty International accused the army of conducting 'mass arbitrary detentions' in the Amhara region. Tigere Chagutah, the organization’s regional director for East and Southern Africa, alleged that hundreds have been held, including members of the academic community, in major towns across the Amhara region since September 28. 'The Ethiopian army and police’s ongoing campaign of arbitrary mass detentions in Amhara region is yet more evidence of the government’s total disregard for the rule of law,' he said in a statement. 'Eyewitnesses have stated that authorities came with a ‘list’ and failed to obtain arrest and search warrants before detaining hundreds of civilians across the region. Those detained have largely not been brought before a court of law within 48 hours, as required by the country’s national laws and constitution.' Amnesty International urged Ethiopian authorities to halt the use of arbitrary arrests and detentions as tools of repression. 'Immediately end these arbitrary arrests, press charges against those detained for internationally recognized crimes and follow due process, or release them without further delay,' the group said.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWeolo_jpzVp5knurwHCmMdU	2024-12-06T16:17:58-08:00	
Putin Says Oreshnik Missile System Will Be Deployed In Belarus	(RFE/RL) -- Russian President Vladimir Putin has announced that Oreshnik missile systems, recently combat-tested in a strike on Ukraine, will be deployed in Belarus simultaneously with their introduction into the Russian Strategic Missile Forces (RVSN). Speaking on December 6 after a meeting of the Supreme State Council of the Russia-Belarus Union State in Minsk, Putin said that the Oreshnik systems could be stationed in Belarus as soon as the second half of 2025. The statement opens a new phase in the military strategy and development of relations between Russia and Belarus. The decision underscores a further deepening of military integration between the two countries and underlines Russia's increasing military footprint in Eastern Europe. Russia launched an Oreshnik ballistic missile against Ukraine on November 21 in a strike targeting the city of Dnipro. Putin said at the time it was part of Moscow's response to Ukrainian attacks on Russian soil with U.S.-supplied Army Tactical Missile Systems, known as ATACMS, and British-supplied Storm Shadow missiles. Putin said the Oreshnik system would have highly accurate, long-range missiles that could pierce advanced missile defense systems. The specific technical details of the Oreshnik remain classified, but it is reportedly designed to increase the survivability and effectiveness of Russia's nuclear arsenal, particularly in the context of evolving global security challenges. Belarus, a close ally of Russia, has been part of a broader geopolitical and military partnership, formally enshrined through the Union State agreement signed in the 1990s. Over the years, this alliance has been deepening, especially after 2014, following the annexation of Crimea and the subsequent deterioration of relations between Russia and the West, especially over Moscow's ongoing full-scale invasion of Ukraine, which started in February 2022. For Russia, the placement of advanced missile systems in Belarus indicates its willingness to develop military capabilities close to NATO's eastern flank. Belarus's proximity to NATO member states, particularly Poland, Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania, makes it a very strategic location for Russia's missile deployments. Aside from missile deployments, Russia and Belarus are performing joint military exercises and integrating their air defense systems and defense coordination strategies. In general, the coordination shows a continuously intensifying comprehensive military integration, which many analysts suggest would take the relationship one step further to a fully political-military union in the framework of the Union State. To Belarus, the alliance with Russia is an influential factor in its security strategy, particularly when tensions have risen between Belarus and the West. Belarus's authoritarian ruler, Alyaksandr Lukashenka, has long relied on Russian support, both political and military, as a guarantor of his regime's stability.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWeolo_jpzVp5h2gyrfXWndR	2024-12-06T16:14:10-08:00	
South Korea’s Yoon Faces Impeachment As Key Conservative Turns Ag...	By William Gallo The head of South Korea's ruling People Power Party has announced support for suspending the duties of President Yoon Suk Yeol – a stunning, last-minute move to abandon his fellow conservative leader that analysts say greatly increases the chances of Yoon's impeachment over his failed attempt at martial law. At a party meeting on Friday, PPP leader Han Dong-hoon called for the 'swift suspension' of Yoon's duties, citing 'newly revealed facts' that suggest Yoon had attempted to use intelligence agencies to arrest prominent lawmakers, accusing them of being 'anti-state forces.' 'President Yoon has not acknowledged that the illegal martial law was a mistake. If President Yoon continues to carry out his duties, there is a significant risk of a recurrence of such extreme actions … which could pose a great threat to the Republic of Korea and its people,' Han said, using South Korea’s formal name. Yoon, frustrated for months by what he saw as opposition attempts to obstruct his governance, declared martial law late Tuesday, claiming it was necessary to 'crush anti-state forces' and 'protect constitutional order.' Within hours, South Korean lawmakers overturned the decree, after fighting their way through police and military personnel who had been sent to the National Assembly Building. The opposition, which holds a majority in the National Assembly, plans to vote on Yoon's impeachment late Saturday. Tensions building Adding to the urgency, South Korean media on Friday reported unconfirmed rumors that a second attempt at martial law was being planned, though the reports were quickly denied by the military. In a live-streamed interview on YouTube, Kwak Jong-geun, the head of South Korea’s special warfare command, said he would not enforce a second martial law decree, should he receive such orders. Kwak also said that during the first short-lived martial law, he refused orders to clear lawmakers from the National Assembly, viewing such a move as illegal. South Korea’s Ministry of National Defense later suspended Kwak and two other senior military commanders who were involved in the first martial law declaration, according to the Yonhap news agency. At the country’s legislature, tensions were briefly high on Friday, amid rumors that Yoon was set to visit and meet with lawmakers in an attempt to find a path forward that does not involve impeachment. In preparation for Yoon’s rumored visit, hundreds of opposition lawmakers and officials gathered at the entrance, warning Yoon to stay away. Democratic Party lawmaker Kim Min-seok told a public gathering that his party had informed the presidential office that Yoon would not be allowed to enter the grounds. Yoon’s office later said that he had no plans to visit. PPP leader a key figure South Korean police on Thursday announced they have opened an investigation into charges that Yoon and other senior leaders committed treason related to the events of Tuesday night. On Friday, South Korea’s Chosun Ilbo reported that Yoon ordered South Korea’s spy agency to arrest Han, the conservative party leader who had once been a close ally and colleague of Yoon during their earlier careers as prosecutors. Han, who had previously served as Yoon’s justice minister, has played a key role in the political drama unfolding this week. Immediately after Yoon declared martial law, Han opposed the effort, and 18 members of his conservative party voted to overturn the decree. However, on Thursday Han and his fellow conservatives began to rally around Yoon, saying they would oppose the impeachment, which they claimed would paralyze the country. Han changed his stance again on Friday, saying he had obtained 'credible evidence' that Yoon was trying to arrest senior lawmakers. 'I firmly believe that now is the time to think solely about the nation and its citizens,' he said. Constitutional court uncertainty To succeed, at least eight members of the PPP must support the impeachment motion. So far, only two conservatives have publicly said they will vote to impeach Yoon. But after Han’s reversal, many observers say it now appears likely that the impeachment will pass. If Yoon is impeached, he would be immediately suspended while the Constitutional Court deliberates on whether to remove him from office, a process that could take weeks or even months.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWeolo_jpzVp5maXoVfxaADz	2024-12-06T16:10:50-08:00	
Romania: Presidential Elections Cancelled By Constitutional Court	By Charles Szumski (EurActiv) -- Romania's Constitutional Court has annulled the country's presidential elections, including the first round and the upcoming runoff initially scheduled for Sunday (8 December) between far-right candidate Călin Georgescu and liberal Elena Lasconi. The unanimous decision announced on Friday (6 December) voids the entire electoral process, citing irregularities that require a complete restart. A new election date will be set by the government following the decision's publication in the Official Gazette. 'In accordance with Article 146(f) of the Constitution, the entire electoral process for electing the President of Romania is annulled,' stated the court's official communiqué. The cancellation comes amid legal disputes over the elections' fairness, with various petitions submitted to the court before the runoff. Călin Georgescu, a far-right candidate with pro-Russian sympathies, has faced allegations that his candidacy benefitted from disinformation campaigns and coordinated promotion on TikTok during the first round of the presidential elections. Romanian authorities have called for an investigation into the platform's role in amplifying his message, raising concerns about foreign interference and social media's influence on democratic processes. The government now has up to 90 days to organize new elections, with speculation suggesting they could take place in February or March. 'This moves the process back to the very beginning', Siegfried Muresan from the conservative PNL party (EPP) told Euractiv. 'It will be up to the candidates to decide if they submit candidacies and the authorities will be looking into whether those can be validated. 'Certainly authorities will make sure that foreign interference is tackled', he added. Meanwhile, Romanian President Klaus Iohannis’ term, set to expire on December 21, will likely be extended due to the state of necessity created by this unprecedented situation. The ruling has ignited debate about the role of the Constitutional Court in validating elections. Critics, including former Constitutional Court Judge Petre Lăzăroiu, argue that the court's role is to validate results based on clear evidence, not suspicions. 'Decisions must be based on clear, undeniable proof, not speculation,' emphasized Augustin Zegrean, another former court president on TVR Romania. With the electoral process now back to square one, Romania faces uncertainty as it prepares to reorganize its presidential race under intense legal and public scrutiny. *Nicholas Wallace contributed reporting.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWeolo_jpzVp5sLHTWZQzrvG	2024-12-06T16:07:29-08:00	
Myanmar: Kokang Rebels Execute 6 After Public Trials In Shan Stat...	Ethnic Kokang rebels in northern Myanmar have executed six people following a public trial in front of hundreds of people that was filmed and posted on social media, including murder, the group confirmed Friday. The six were among 14 individuals tried on Thursday by the Myanmar National Democratic Alliance Army, or MNDAA, which had been fighting the junta since a military coup in early 2021, until agreeing to a ceasefire earlier this week. In the video, which appeared to be professionally produced -- including a militaristic soundtrack and drone shots -- the convicted individuals in blue jumpsuits are held by guards as authorities in uniforms read out their crimes in Mandarin Chinese, the Kokang’s main language. As the crimes are read out, MNDAA soldiers draw red X’s over signs displaying their names and that they were convicted criminals. One of the accused, a woman, was convicted of murdering her husband, sources close to the MNDAA said via their social media accounts. The other male suspects were charged with the murder of a female driver, the killing of a friend, and plotting to kill the owners of a construction and natural gas company. Eight other individuals, accused of other crimes, were sentenced to prison terms ranging from 10 to 20 years. The event took place Thursday in northern Shan state’s Laukkai township. On Friday, the MNDAA’s Kokang Information Network confirmed that the group had executed the six in a post to its social media page. The video concludes with the six being paraded around the township in the back of pickup trucks as they are driven to what appears to be an execution site, before being led off by soldiers. 'After the public trial, police officers from the judicial branch escorted the criminals, who had been sentenced according to the law, through the streets for a public display,' the post said. 'Then, the convicts were brought to the execution ground to be executed.' It was not immediately clear how the six were executed. Attempts by RFA to contact MNDAA officials for comment on the sentences went unanswered Friday. The MNDAA has executed individuals it convicted of crimes in staged trials before. In April, another similar video showed several convicted people being publicly condemned for crimes, including three to death. On May 2, 2023, the MNDAA executed four individuals for their involvement in murders, robberies, and 25 kidnappings in northern Shan’s Lashio township. ‘No way consistent’ Legal experts have expressed concerns over the MNDAA’s actions, noting that the practice of public executions, which occurred during Myanmar’s British colonial era, has long been abolished. RFA spoke with a lawyer who noted that the Kokang, who speak Mandarin Chinese and share ethnic characteristics with their northern neighbors, 'follow the Chinese legal system, as they are subordinate to China and must adhere to its directives.' The lawyer, who asked to remain anonymous due to security concerns, said that denying the six an appeal of their conviction and publicly executing them, 'is in no way consistent with or acceptable under Myanmar’s current legal system.' 'In Myanmar, there are only two ways the death penalty can be carried out: if a civilian court issues a death sentence, the execution takes place in prison, while if a military court issues a death sentence, it is carried out by prison authorities within the prison, or by relevant military commanders,' he said. 'There is no provision in our laws that mandates public executions.'	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWeolo_jpzVp5mqHR2pT8OjE	2024-12-06T16:05:40-08:00	
Houman A. Sadri: A Passion for International Politics And Central...	Dr. Houman A. Sadri, a man of high integrity, dedicated to the study of international politics and development, has distinguished himself as an outstanding administrator and promoter of public diplomacy in many professional settings. As the director of the Information and Policy Analysis Center (IPAC), Dr. Houman Sadri has interacted with organizations including for-profit, non-profit as well as governmental agencies. He is a proven leader with valuable people skills. He excels at motivating, managing, and interacting with individuals from diverse cultural, racial, and religious backgrounds. Dr. Sadri has served as a project manager for several local and national corporations with international aspirations and further promoted their presence abroad. I have known Dr. Sadri during my participation at the annual meeting of The Florida Political Science Association (2024) where he demonstrated high levels of organizational skills and a deep knowledge on American political system and International Affairs. His knowledge on International Politics is admirable and profound, young scholars can find many useful information through his writings and research. Dr. Sadri earned a Ph.D. from the University of Virginia and a fellowship at the Hoover Institution of Stanford University. He is the author of several books and numerous articles. He is a frequent presenter and keynote speaker at professional and community meetings both in the United States and abroad. His rare ability to combine academic and real-world experience make Dr. Sadri a public speaker of high demand. His wealth of experience in International Development and international security have earned him an unparalleled reputation and prestigious awards. As an Associate Professor of Political Science at the University of Central Florida, Houman Sadri, Ph.D., received a medal dedicated to the 20th Anniversary of the Assembly of People of Kazakhstan. On August 4, 2016, the Embassy of Kazakhstan awarded Dr. Sadri with the medal in recognition of his important contribution to the promotion of Kazakhstan’s model of peace and harmony, and for his indispensable role to foster friendly relations between the two nations. According to Ambassador Kairat Ermekuly Umarov, this award reflects and recognizes the constant hard work that Dr. Houman Sadri has demonstrated towards strengthening the bilateral cooperation between Kazakhstan and the United States of America. In his impressive professional career, Dr. Sadri has also harnessed his leadership ability by serving as coordinator of the United Nations Association at UCF, leading the team to victory each year at regional, national, and even international competitions. Additionally, Dr. Sadri has introduced a course on Central Asia at UCF and has published a book about the Assembly of People of Kazakhstan. According to Dr. Sadri: 'Kazakhstan is a middle state trying not only to mediate conflicts and seek compromising positions in different conflicts but also expanding its influence in the Central Asian region as well as in global affairs.' During his meeting with Ambassador Kairat Umarov, Dr. Sadri spoke on the importance of the Kazakhstan model of interethnic accord and advocated for the international community to learn more about this phenomenon. The Assembly of People of Kazakhstan plays an important role in the formation of a unique model of social unity. Its main goal is to implement the national policy, ensure social and political stability in Kazakhstan and increase the efficiency of cooperation between state institutions and civil society in the field of interethnic relations. Furthermore Dr. Sadri has emerged as a prominent voice of Kazakhstan’s institutions in the international arena, and his valuable contributions have shed light on the interethnic dialogue and tolerance that has taken place throughout the Central Asian nation. Today the Assembly of People of Kazakhstan contributes not only to strengthening interethnic accord and tolerance in the country, but also assists the government in combating extremism and radicalism. In this context Dr. Sadri has conducted extensive research and published various papers about the relations between the European Union and Kazakhstan. In one of his publications he states: 'The European Union is Kazakhstan’s most important trade and investment partner, accounting for half of Kazakhstan’s foreign trade turnover and attracted foreign capital in the economy. Since Kazakhstan’s independence, the EU has been one of its leading political and economic partners, but in December 2015 they strengthened their ties, signing the Enhanced Partnership and Cooperation Agreement (EPCA). This is the first such agreement signed by the EU with a partner in Central Asia.' Dr. Sadri’s research in European Union’s Commercial Policies and trade priorities with Central Asia, have placed him among the very few U. S. Scholars that are exclusively focused on the economic and trade partnerships that have recently flourished between EU and Kazakhstan, a highly important country in the geopolitics of Eurasia.
