Modern Slavery And Cyber Fraud: The Growing Crisis In Myanmar – A...	By Windia Soe Imagine being lured by a dream job only to be trapped in a nightmare. This is the grim reality for thousands in Myanmar's vast cyber scam industry. Key Takeaways: Political instability has made Myanmar a center for cybercrime and human trafficking, with criminal syndicates exploiting the lawlessness for online fraud. Myanmar-based scams, like 'pig butchering,' are responsible for billions in global losses, targeting victims worldwide through romance, investment, and cryptocurrency fraud. Urgent international cooperation is required to dismantle criminal networks, with enhanced intelligence-sharing among neighboring countries to curb the crisis. The Explosive Rise of Cyber Scam Syndicates in Myanmar In recent years, in 2021, China has intensified efforts to combat cybercrime by enacting the Personal Information Protection Law (PIPL) and Data Security Law (DSL) to reinforce China’s commitment to data security. Additionally, the Chinese government banned cryptocurrency trading, mining, and advertisements while implementing stricter anti-money laundering measures and crackdowns on telecom and online fraud. These regulatory shifts have made it increasingly difficult for cybercriminals to operate within China. As a result, many cybercriminal syndicates adapted new methods and relocated their operations abroad to exploit stolen personal data for fraudulent schemes. Among their top destinations, Myanmar—already grappling with post-coup instability—emerged as a prime hub for cyber fraud and organized crime. Using lawlessness, economic turmoil, and the country’s strategic location, transnational crime syndicates have established large-scale scam operations. These operations not only cause significant financial damage but also involve human trafficking. The Kokang Region and Myawaddy, located on Myanmar's borders with China and Thailand, have historically been hotspots for illicit activities due to their strategic locations, ethnic armed conflicts, and weak central government control. From 1950-1990, Kokang was central to the Golden Triangle's opium trade, while Myawaddy facilitated drug trafficking. By 2000-2020, both areas shifted toward gambling and underground financial schemes, fueled by cross-border investments and Special Economic Zones. Since 2020, they have become centers for large-scale online scams, supported by SEZ infrastructure and armed group protection. Myanmar’s endemic corruption and lawlessness have further enabled these criminal networks, making these border regions major players in transnational crime. Additionally, widespread unemployment has pushed many into these illicit enterprises as direct participants or middlemen. The digital shift accelerated by the COVID-19 pandemic has further fueled this crisis as more people engage with online platforms, making them easy targets for cyber fraud. The Rise of Cybercrime-Driven Human Trafficking in Myanmar Myanmar faces a severe crisis of cybercrime-driven human trafficking, as evidenced by its top ranking in the Global Organized Crime Index. The surge in human trafficking within the country, reaching 8.50 in 2023 from 6.50 in 2021, underscores the escalating prevalence of forced labor and sexual exploitation. Beginning around 2020, criminal networks across Myanmar, Cambodia, Laos, and Thailand have rapidly adapted to technological advancements, significantly expanding their reach and effectiveness. These syndicates utilize social media and sophisticated cryptocurrency scams to deceive victims and evade law enforcement. Cybercrime syndicates have refined their recruitment strategies to fuel these operations, deploying deceptive job offers that promise lucrative salaries and professional advancement. They strategically target young, educated, multilingual individuals with IT skills, recognizing their value in executing complex scams. Job advertisements for positions in customer service, online marketing, and tech support are widely disseminated across ASEAN nations, China, Africa, Latin America, and the Middle East, demonstrating the global scope of their recruitment efforts. The scale of this forced criminality is vast. According to the 2022 Global Report on Trafficking in Persons, 10.2% of reported trafficking cases are linked to forced criminality. In Cambodia alone, crime networks have lured between 50,000 and 100,000 people into slave-like conditions, and it is assumed that the numbers are significantly higher in Myanmar. Credible sources estimate that over 120,000 individuals in Myanmar may be trapped in forced online scam operations. The global scale of this crisis is further underscored by a 2023 UNODC report stating: 'Overall, international NGOs have identified over 40 nationalities of trafficking victims in scam compounds in Southeast Asia.'. The Twin Horrors of Cyber Scams: Life Inside the Fraud Factories and Financial Fraud The reality for those recruited is a stark contrast to the promises made. Once victims arrive at the supposed workplaces, they are subjected to horrific conditions. Their passports and personal belongings are confiscated and confined to heavily guarded compounds. Under constant threats of violence, they are compelled to participate in fraudulent schemes, such as romance scams, investment fraud, and cryptocurrency deception. Notably, romance scams surged by one-fifth in 2023, disproportionately targetingmen aged 55 to 64, who accounted for 52% of reported cases. Many victims were financially stable professionals or retirees seeking companionship online. A 2023 survey found that 66% of respondents in India encountered online dating scams. In Europe, 1%–3% of the population reported being victims (2020), while nearly 70,000 cases in the U.S. in 2022. The notorious 'pig butchering' scam involves deceiving victims before exploiting them financially, resulting in staggering losses. Between 2020 and 2024, Southeast Asian-based cyber scams led to global losses of approximately $75 billion and an estimated annual loss of $43.8 billion in Southeast Asia. In the U.S. alone, Americans suffered estimated losses of $2.6 billion in 2022 due to pig butchering and cryptocurrency fraud. Those who fail to meet financial quotas result in brutal punishments, including beatings, starvation, and further trafficking into other forms of forced labor and sexual exploitation. While the financial impact is devastating, the human cost—marked by psychological trauma, exploitation, and shattered lives—is immeasurable. Myanmar's Cyber Scam Crackdown: Operation 1027's Ripple Effect Fueled by China's growing frustration with cyber-scam operations targeting its citizens along the China-Myanmar border and following a reported massacre at a Shan State scam center, the Three Brotherhood Alliance launched Operation 1027, a coordinated offensive against the Myanmar military junta in northern Shan State. With multiple objectives, including dismantling online fraud, this operation gained momentum due to tacit Chinese support. This offensive led to the rescue of thousands of trafficked victims, primarily Chinese nationals. By late November 2023, a major milestone was achieved, with over 31,000 suspects handed over to Chinese authorities. Despite the significant disruptions in Shan State, cybercrime syndicates have proven highly adaptable, relocating operations southward to Karen State along the Thai border. Furthermore, cybercriminals are increasingly leveraging AI and advanced translation tools to streamline their scams, reducing reliance on trafficked workers fluent in specific languages. As these networks relocate, fueled by recent reports of the trafficking of Chinese model and actor Wang Xing at the Myanmar-Thai border, Thailand has responded by cutting electricity, internet, and fuel to Myanmar’s border areas to dismantle cross-border scam compounds. Meanwhile, the impact on local communities is evident, with many facing power cuts while Chinese businesses, including scam centers, continue running on generators. Thailand's Department of Special Investigation (DSI) is also seeking warrants for three Karen BGF leaders—Saw Chit Thu, Tin Win, and Mote Thone—accused of profiting from transnational crimes through land control and real estate linked to scams. However, prosecutors rejected the request due to insufficient evidence. In an exclusive interview, Saw Chit Thu denied involvement, claiming he only leases land, has no ties to scam operations, and emphasized cooperation with Thai authorities. Despite these legal hurdles, this crackdown is intensifying. Still, the long-term question remains: can these deeply entrenched criminal networks be fully dismantled, or will they evolve and resurface elsewhere? Myanmar's Cybercrime Inferno: A Global Call for Stakeholder Action Myanmar's surge in cybercrime, human trafficking, exploitation, and abuse has created an urgent crisis demanding immediate action. However, with the military focused on consolidating power and suppressing internal conflicts, it remains unable and unwilling to tackle these issues. Moreover, its Border Guard Forces, militias, and allied groups are not just turning a blind eye but are directly implicated in facilitating and securing these scam operations. Recognizing the dire need for action, the NUG outlined plans for self-governing territories to combat cybercrime in its January 2025 Joint Statement, calling for enhanced intelligence-sharing between neighboring countries to address these transnational crimes. In this context, international collaboration has never been more critical, but Myanmar’s political isolation and ongoing sanctions severely hinder effective cooperation. Without decisive regional and global intervention, these criminal enterprises will continue to thrive, further undermining Myanmar’s security and governance while exposing citizens worldwide to devastating threats.

Moscow Warns Oslo On Svalbard But Suggests ‘Deal’ With US On Arct...	In the last ten days, Moscow has dramatically raised tensions with the West through conflict in the North Atlantic and Arctic Oceans. The Kremlin, however, is offering U.S. President Donald Trump 'a way out' by means of a more comprehensive 'deal.' On March 14, the Russian foreign ministry summoned Norwegian Ambassador Robert Kvile to inform him that Moscow views Oslo’s efforts to strengthen its defenses on Svalbard and the Spitzbergen archipelago as a violation of the 1920 Svalbard Treaty, which recognizes Norway’s sovereignty over those islands but precludes their military use. Russia, as a signatory, considers itself a defender of that treaty and has the right to take action to defend its provisions (EurAsia Daily, March 14). Only a day earlier, Nikolai Patrushev, a close aide to Russian President Vladimir Putin long known for his hardline views, declared that the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) was threatening Russian national interests in the Atlantic and Arctic oceans. Furthermore, he claimed that Moscow has the right, and even the duty, to take immediate action to defend itself against such threats (Natsional’naya Oborona, March 13). These two moves were compounded with a classic Russian tactic of misdirection with Kirill Dmitriyev, an influential Russian businessman and official at the center of talks between Moscow and Washington over Ukraine, simultaneously insisting that now is not the time for a new 'cold war' in the Arctic but rather for a comprehensive 'deal' between Moscow and Washington, precisely the kind of language likely to appeal to Trump (The Barents Observer, March 12). The summoning of Kvile was only the latest in a string of Russian moves over the last several years concerning Spitzbergen. Such actions have led some defense analysts to conclude that it and other islands in the Baltic and North Atlantic may be Russia’s first targets if it decides to attack NATO countries (see EDM, July 7, 2022, May 30, June 11, August 15, 2024). Among the reasons for their worries are that these islands are lightly defended and, in the case of Spitzbergen, subject to treaties that limit their militarization. Simultaneously, Moscow’s ability to use the People’s Republic of China to build up its own presence on that archipelago, taking measures behind the façade of international support (Window on Eurasia, September 30, 2024). Norway has refused to be intimidated and instead has taken steps to expand its defense capability in the Spitzbergen archipelago (Window on Eurasia, July 11, September 8, 2024). Oslo’s staunch position has provoked two reactions in Moscow. Patrushev has viewed it as evidence that the West is working to undermine Russian interests in the North Atlantic and Arctic, which must be combatted (Natsional’naya Oborona, March 13). Dmitriyev, however, has concluded that the best course for Moscow, especially at a time when Trump is talking about acquiring Greenland, is to ignore European opposition and to make 'a deal' with Washington that will divide that region, including Spitzbergen, into well-defined spheres of influence (Window on Eurasia, December 27, 2024; The Barents Observer, March 12). Both positions have support in the Russian capital in part because, superficial appearances notwithstanding, they are complementary rather than opposed, as together they allow Moscow to weaken Europe, further divide the United States and Europe, and expand Russian influence and presence beyond where it has been up to now. Patrushev reflects the more traditional Russian approach. In an interview with the Moscow military journal National Defense, he says that Western countries now, as in the past, are carrying out a concerted campaign against Russian interests in the Baltic Sea, the Arctic, and the North Atlantic regions to weaken Moscow (Natsional’naya Oborona, March 13). To prevent the West from succeeding, he calls on the Kremlin to respond by strengthening and building up its naval forces, for which he personally is responsible, and challenging all such Western 'provocations,' including in places such as Spitzbergen, where they are, in his view, particularly unacceptable. Many in Moscow share his view, but due to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, its resources are spread too thin to fully project power in the region without losing ground in Ukraine. Dmitriyev’s approach is intended to achieve the same goal Patrushev—the expansion of Russian influence at the West’s expense—but by another means, 'a deal with Trump' rather than by the use of military force (The Barents Observer, March 12). Writing on X, Dmitriyev argues that 'the Arctic is too important for Cold War-style politics' and instead must become part of 'a rapprochement' between Russia and the United States. They 'must find common ground to ensure stability, resource development, and environmental protection.' In his words, 'cooperation is not a choice—it’s a necessity' X/@kadmitriev, March 8). Dmitriyev has promoted this theme before. Trained at Stanford and Harvard Universities, he rose to prominence as a Russian businessman and Putin ally during the first Trump Administration when he was among the first Russian officials to meet with U.S. leaders. At the time, he sought to work closely with the then-Secretary of State Rex Tillerson to reach an agreement on the Arctic that would allow for joint oil and gas exploration and development (The Barents Observer, December 15, 2016). These plans never panned out, but now Dmitriyev and his ideas are at the center of Kremlin thinking and action. Dmitriyev was a member of the Russian delegation that met with U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio and National Security Advisor Michael Waltz in Saudi Arabia on February 18 to try to reach a U.S.-Russian agreement on Ukraine. Putin clearly believes that Dmitriyev is someone who understands Trump and has mastered 'the art of the deal' and may be able to craft an even broader agreement between Moscow and Washington than just on Ukraine. For now, appealing to the U.S. president to further Russian engagement in the Arctic and North Atlantic Oceans without the exertions and risks that the Patrushev approach would certainly entail. If no such 'deal' is reached, however, Patrushev’s words are a reminder that Moscow has another approach in reserve and to be used when it judges it to be advantageous.

The Jaffar Express Hijack And Shrinking State Writ In Balochistan...	By Dr Ashish Shukl Since the forced annexation of Kalat in 1948, Baloch ethno-nationalists have rejected integration into Pakistan, waging a persistent armed struggle for independence. Over the decades, this resistance has unfolded in at least five distinct phases, each aimed at securing an independent Balochistan. The all-powerful security establishment along with the political leadership of the country has unsuccessfully tried to crush the movement at every stage, even with brute military force. The present phase of the armed resistance is remarkably different from all other phases in terms of the leadership, coverage, scope, determination, commitment, intensity, and most importantly, the tactics employed to challenge the writ of the state of Pakistan.Pakistan’s response has remained largely unchanged—it relies on superior firepower to suppress dissent and sporadically enlists tribal Sardars to quell unrest. While this approach has yielded temporary reprieves, it has failed to deter young Baloch individuals from joining armed groups like the Baloch Liberation Army (BLA), led by Bashir Zeb Baloch, and the Baloch Liberation Front (BLF), under Dr Allah Nazar Baloch. These two outfits along with other smaller groups have been giving the security establishment quite a tough time in the rugged mountainous terrain of Balochistan. Pakistan Security Report 2024 claims that Balochistan witnessed an 84 per cent rise in attacks compared to the previous year. There were at least 202 attacks in the province in which 322 people lost their lives, while another 354 got injured.[1] The attacks by BLA and BLF saw a significant 119 per cent rise in 2024. There were at least 171 incidents in the province in which 261 people died and 412 got injured.[2] The Hijacking of the Jaffar Express The year 2025 has proven no less turbulent, with the BLA claiming responsibility for six major attacks, including the audacious hijacking of the Jaffar Express on 11 March.[3] This train, linking Quetta, Lahore, Peshawar and Islamabad via Sindh, serves as a vital artery for Balochistan’s residents and a key transport route for off-duty security personnel to travel to their homes and posting stations. Possibly, due to this very reason, this rail-route has always been a prime target of Baloch armed groups. However, it was for the first time that an entire train was hijacked and all the passengers were held hostage. About 450 passengers, including a sizeable number of security personnel, were on board when BLA fighters attacked the train closer to railway Tunnel No. 8, between Paneer and Peshi railway stations in Balochistan.[4] The BLA issued a press release on 11 March 2025, which inter alia stated that the mission was led by its Fidayeen Unit, Majeed Brigade with full operational support from the Fateh Squad, Special Tactical Operations Squad (STOS) and its intelligence wing Zirab.[5] It added that six military personnel were killed during the operation, whereas over 100 passengers including active-duty personnel from the Pakistan military, policy, Anti-Terrorism force (ATS) and Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) were taken into custody.[6] The BLA released a good number of women, children and Baloch passengers possibly to claim a moral high ground. The operational viability of keeping such a large number of people hostage for longer period may also have been the reason behind the move to release them unharmed. In another press release, BLA gave Pakistan a 48-hour ultimatum for the release of ‘Baloch political prisoners, forcibly disappeared persons and national resistance activists’ in exchange for the 214 hostages, while claiming to have killed 30 enemy personnel and injured many more.[7] On 12 March 2025, BLA issued yet another press release claiming complete control over the train as well as the hostages. It reiterated the 48-hour deadline for prisoner exchange and underlined that: If Pakistan does not make practical progress on the prisoner exchange within the given ultimatum, all hostages will be presented before the Baloch National Court. There, they will be tried on charges of state atrocities, colonial occupation, genocide, exploitation and involvement in war crimes in Balochistan.[8] High Level Rescue Operation The attack of this magnitude sent a shock-wave throughout the country prompting the Pakistan military to launch a high-level rescue operation to free the hostages. It took Pakistan more than 24 hours to free the hostages. There were significant casualties of active-duty personnel on board the fateful train. The Zarar Company of the Pakistan Army carried out the assessment and planning and finally, its snipers engaged the BLA fighters on 12 March 2025 which led to some hostages slipping away.[9] The hostages were segregated in different groups based on their ethnic profile and association with the government and security forces. These groups were surrounded by BLA fighters, including suicide bombers. Drone footage released by Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) clearly shows hostages sitting on the ground in at least three separate groups. As per Director General (DG) ISPR, Lt Gen Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry, the Zarar Company first identified the suicide bombers and then the snipers killed them in one go.[10] After this, the rescue team entered into the area from the engine side and started clearing train coaches one by one. Soon, they were able to eliminate the BLA fighters present on the ground and rescued the remaining hostages. Inconsistent and Exaggerated Claims The claims made by both the BLA and the Pakistan Army indicate factual inconsistencies and exaggeration. There is a mismatch of the casualty figures given out by both. BLA first claimed that it had taken over 100 active duty personnel and then it went on to revise the figure to 182 and finally claimed to have executed all 214 hostages as Pakistan did not accept their demands.[11] In a joint press conference of DG, ISPR and Chief Minister Balochistan on 14 March 2025, it was claimed that a total of 354 hostages including 37 injured were rescued, whereas 26 got killed by BLA including 18 armed forces personnel.[12] DG, ISPR also claimed that 33 BLA fighters were killed during the operation. This was strongly countered by BLA through its press release issued on 14 March 2025. Contrary to Pakistan Army’s claim, the BLA press release categorically stated that it executed a total of 214 enemy personnel and lost 12 of its fighters including five Fidayeen belonging to Majeed Brigade.[13] Given the history of secrecy maintained by the state apparatus in Pakistan, Balochistan is considered by many analysts as an information black-hole due to which it is quite difficult to arrive at a definitive number of casualties each side suffered during the train hijack by BLA and the rescue operation launched by the military. However, as per interviews conducted by BBC Urdu with a few hostages, who somehow escaped from captivity, BLA’s claim in terms of casualties of hostages appears to be closer to the reality compared to that of Pakistan Army. One of the interviewees, Allah Diya, who had fled with few others, told that as the darkness fell upon the area, BLA fighters started killing hostages in groups of 10, 15, 20, and three,[14] confirming the fact that there were a lot of armed forces personnel among the hostages. One personnel pleaded with the BLA fighters to leave him because he had small girl child at home, but he was not spared. After this, many hostages ran away and did not even look back, as the Baloch fighters went on spraying bullets on them. Another interviewee, Mahboob Hussain stated that there was a blast after which the train got derailed and this was followed by a 30-minute armed engagement between BLA fighters and security personnel deployed on the train. After some time, the passengers were asked to come out of the train and a number of BLA fighters left for the mountains, saying that their job was done.[15] Afterwards, those on the ground started killing hostages in groups of five and 10, which continued throughout the intervening night of 11–12 March. This suggests that casualty figures may have been much higher than what Pakistan has officially accepted. The Blame Game There is hardly any doubt that Pakistan’s deepening internal security crisis has a direct link with its policy of using non-state actors as strategic assets and foreign policy tools against neighbouring countries in the region including India and Afghanistan. Whenever there is any significant internal security challenge, Pakistan’s politico-security elites habitually point fingers outside. Instead of introspection, they resort to ‘Blame Thy Neighbour’ approach to divert public attention from their own failures. Pakistan Foreign Office Spokesperson, Shafqat Ali Khan in his weekly media briefing on 13 March categorically stated that 'India is involved in sponsoring terrorism against Pakistan…We have evidence of calls being traced to Afghanistan.'[16] On 14 March 2025, in response to media queries, the spokesperson of the Ministry of External Affairs (MEA), Randhir Jaiswal rejected the 'baseless allegations' and stated: ‘… The whole world knows where the epicenter of global terrorism lies. Pakistan should look inwards instead of pointing fingers and shifting the blame for its own internal problems and failures on to others.[17] Conclusion The Jaffar Express hijack and subsequent killing of active-duty armed forces personnel have exposed the fact that as far as Balochistan is concerned, the writ of the Pakistani State has shrunk. This is happening at a time when a resurgent Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) has already upped the ante and announced its Al-Khandaq Opertions. In such a situation, instead of adopting diversionary tactics and putting the blame on neighbours for its own failures, Pakistan needs to seriously introspect and adopt necessary measures to deal with the deteriorating internal security situation.

A New Military-Industrial Complex Arises: The Secret War Within T...	By Michael T. Klare Last April, in a move generating scant media attention, the Air Force announced that it had chosen two little-known drone manufacturers — Anduril Industries of Costa Mesa, California, and General Atomics of San Diego — to build prototype versions of its proposed Collaborative Combat Aircraft (CCA), a future unmanned plane intended to accompany piloted aircraft on high-risk combat missions. The lack of coverage was surprising, given that the Air Force expects to acquire at least 1,000 CCAs over the coming decade at around $30 million each, making this one of the Pentagon’s costliest new projects. But consider that the least of what the media failed to note. In winning the CCA contract, Anduril and General Atomics beat out three of the country’s largest and most powerful defense contractors — Boeing, Lockheed Martin, and Northrop Grumman — posing a severe threat to the continued dominance of the existing military-industrial complex, or MIC. For decades, a handful of giant firms like those three have garnered the lion’s share of Pentagon arms contracts, producing the same planes, ships, and missiles year after year while generating huge profits for their owners. But an assortment of new firms, born in Silicon Valley or incorporating its disruptive ethos, have begun to challenge the older ones for access to lucrative Pentagon awards. In the process, something groundbreaking, though barely covered in the mainstream media, is underway: a new MIC is being born, one that potentially will have very different goals and profit-takers than the existing one. How the inevitable battles between the old and the new MICs play out can’t be foreseen, but count on one thing: they are sure to generate significant political turbulence in the years to come. The very notion of a 'military-industrial complex' linking giant defense contractors to powerful figures in Congress and the military was introduced on January 17, 1961, by President Dwight D. Eisenhower in his farewell address to Congress and the American people. In that Cold War moment, in response to powerful foreign threats, he noted that 'we have been compelled to create a permanent armaments industry of vast proportions.' Nevertheless, he added, using the phrase for the first time, 'we must guard against the acquisition of unwarranted influence, whether sought or unsought, by the military-industrial complex. The potential for the disastrous rise of misplaced power exists and will persist.' Ever since, debate over the MIC’s accumulating power has roiled American politics. A number of politicians and prominent public figures have portrayed U.S. entry into a catastrophic series of foreign wars — in Vietnam, Cambodia, Laos, Iraq, Afghanistan, and elsewhere — as a consequence of that complex’s undue influence on policymaking. No such claims and complaints, however, have ever succeeded in loosening the MIC’s iron grip on Pentagon arms procurement. This year’s record defense budget of approximately $850 billion includes $143.2 billion for research and development and another $167.5 billion for the procurement of weaponry. That $311 billion, most of which will be funneled to those giant defense firms, exceeds the total amount spent on defense by every other country on Earth. Over time, the competition for billion-dollar Pentagon contracts has led to a winnowing of the MIC ecosystem, resulting in the dominance of a few major industrial behemoths. In 2024, just five companies — Lockheed Martin (with $64.7 billion in defense revenues), RTX (formerly Raytheon, with $40.6 billion), Northrop Grumman ($35.2 billion), General Dynamics ($33.7 billion), and Boeing ($32.7 billion) — claimed the vast bulk of Pentagon contracts. (Anduril and General Atomics didn’t even appear on a list of the top 100 contract recipients.) Typically, these companies are the lead, or 'prime,' contractors for major weapons systems that the Pentagon keeps buying year after year. Lockheed Martin, for example, is the prime contractor for the Air Force’s top-priority F-35 stealth fighter (a plane that has often proved distinctly disappointing in operation); Northrop Grumman is building the B-21 stealth bomber; Boeing produces the F-15EX combat jet; and General Dynamics makes the Navy’s Los Angeles-class attack submarines. 'Big-ticket' items like these are usually purchased in substantial numbers over many years, ensuring steady profits for their producers. When the initial buys of such systems seem to be nearing completion, their producers usually generate new or upgraded versions of the same weapons, while employing their powerful lobbying arms in Washington to convince Congress to fund the new designs. Over the years, non-governmental organizations like the National Priorities Project and the Friends Committee on National Legislationhave heroically tried to persuade lawmakers to resist the MIC’s lobbying efforts and reduce military spending, but without noticeable success. Now, however, a new force — Silicon Valley startup culture — has entered the fray, and the military-industrial complex equation is suddenly changing dramatically. Along came Anduril Consider Anduril Industries, one of two under-the-radar companies that left three MIC heavyweights in the dust last April by winning the contract to build a prototype of the Collaborative Combat Aircraft. Anduril (named after the sword carried by Aragorn in J.R.R. Tolkien’s The Lord of the Rings) was founded in 2017 by Palmer Luckey, a virtual-reality headset designer, with the goal of incorporating artificial intelligence into novel weapons systems. He was supported in that effort by prominent Silicon Valley investors, including Peter Thiel of the Founders Fund and the head of another defense-oriented startup, Palantir (a name also derived from The Lord of the Rings). From the start, Luckey and his associates sought to shoulder aside traditional defense contractors to make room for their high-tech startups. Those two companies and other new-fledged tech firms often found themselves frozen out of major Pentagon contracts that had long been written to favor the MIC giants with their bevies of lawyers and mastery of government paperwork. In 2016, Palantir even sued the US Army for refusing to consider it for a large data-processing contract and later prevailed in court, opening the door for future Department of Defense awards. In addition to its aggressive legal stance, Anduril has also gained notoriety thanks to the outspokenness of its founder, Palmer Luckey. Whereas other corporate leaders were usually restrained in their language when discussing Department of Defense operations, Luckey openly criticized the Pentagon’s inbred preference for working with traditional defense contractors at the expense of investments in the advanced technologies he believes are needed to overpower China and Russia in some future conflict. Such technology, he insisted, was only available from the commercial tech industry. 'The largest defense contractors are staffed with patriots who nevertheless do not have the software expertise or business model to build the technology we need,' Luckey and his top associates claimed in their 2022 Mission Document. 'These companies work slowly, while the best [software] engineers relish working at speed. And the software engineering talent who can build faster than our adversaries resides in the commercial sector, not at large defense primes.' To overcome obstacles to military modernization, Luckey argued, the government needed to loosen its contracting rules and make it easier for defense startups and software companies to do business with the Pentagon. 'We need defense companies that are fast. That won’t happen simply by wishing it to be so: it will only happen if companies are incentivized to move' by far more permissive Pentagon policies. Buttressed by such arguments, as well as the influence of key figures like Thiel, Anduril began to secure modest but strategic contracts from the military and the Department of Homeland Security. In 2019, it received a small Marine Corps contract to install AI-enabled perimeter surveillance systems at bases in Japan and the United States. A year later, it won a five-year, $25 million contract to build surveillance towers on the US–Mexican border for Customs and Border Protection (CBP). In September 2020, it also received a $36 million CBP contract to build additional sentry towers along that border. After that, bigger awards began to roll in. In February 2023, the Department of Defense started buying Anduril’s Altius-600 surveillance/attack drone for delivery to the Ukrainian military and, last September, the Army announced that it would purchase its Ghost-X drone for battlefield surveillance operations. Anduril is also now one of four companies selected by the Air Force to develop prototypes for its proposed Enterprise Test Vehicle, a medium-sized drone intended to launch salvos of smaller surveillance and attack drones. Anduril’s success in winning ever-larger Pentagon contracts has attracted the interest of wealthy investors looking for opportunities to profit from the expected growth of defense-oriented startups. In July 2020, it received fresh investments of $200 million from Thiel’s Founders Fund and prominent Silicon Valley investor Andreessen Horowitz, raising the company’s valuation to nearly $2 billion. A year later, Anduril obtained another $450 million from those and other venture capital firms, bringing its estimated valuation to $4.5 billion (double what it had been in 2020). More finance capital has flowed into Anduril since then, spearheading a major drive by private investors to fuel the rise of defense startups — and profit from their growth as it materializes. The Replicator initiative Along with its success in attracting big defense contracts and capital infusions, Anduril has succeeded in convincing many senior Pentagon officials of the need to reform the department’s contracting operations so as to make more room for defense startups and tech firms. On August 28, 2023, Deputy Secretary of Defense Kathleen Hicks, then the department’s second-highest official, announced the inauguration of the 'Replicator' initiative, designed to speed the delivery of advanced weaponry to the armed forces. '[Our] budgeting and bureaucratic processes are slow, cumbersome, and byzantine,' she acknowledged. To overcome such obstacles, she indicated, the Replicator initiative would cut through red tape and award contracts directly to startups for the rapid development and delivery of cutting-edge weaponry. 'Our goal,' she declared, 'is to seed, spark, and stoke the flames of innovation.' As Hicks suggested, Replicator contracts would indeed be awarded in successive batches, or 'tranches.' The first tranche, announced last May, included AeroVironment Switchblade 600 kamikaze drones (called that because they are supposed to crash into their intended targets, exploding on contact). Anduril was a triple winner in the second tranche, announced on November 13th. According to the Department of Defense, that batch included funding for the Army’s purchase of Ghost-X surveillance drones, the Marine Corps’ acquisition of Altius-600 kamikaze drones, and development of the Air Force’s Enterprise Test Vehicle, of which Anduril is one of four participating vendors. Just as important, perhaps, was Hicks’ embrace of Palmer Luckey’s blueprint for reforming Pentagon purchasing. 'The Replicator initiative is demonstrably reducing barriers to innovation, and delivering capabilities to warfighters at a rapid pace,' she affirmed in November. 'We are creating opportunities for a broad range of traditional and nontraditional defense and technology companies… and we are building the capability to do that again and again.' Enter the Trumpians Kathleen Hicks stepped down as deputy secretary of defense on January 20th when Donald Trump reoccupied the White House, as did many of her top aides. Exactly how the incoming administration will address the issue of military procurement remains to be seen, but many in Trump’s inner circle, including Elon Musk and Vice President J.D. Vance, have strong ties to Silicon Valley and so are likely to favor Replicator-like policies. Pete Hegseth, the former Fox News host who recently won confirmation as secretary of defense, has no background in weapons development and has said little about the topic. However, Trump’s choice as deputy secretary (and Hick’s replacement) is billionaire investor Stephen A. Feinberg who, as chief investment officer of Cerberus Capital Management, acquired the military startup Stratolaunch — suggesting that he might favor extending programs like Replicator. In a sense, the Trump moment will fit past Washington patterns when it comes to the Pentagon in that the president and his Republican allies in Congress will undoubtedly push for a massive increase in military spending, despite the fact that the military budget is already at a staggering all-time high. Every arms producer is likely to profit from such a move, whether traditional prime contractors or Silicon Valley startups. If, however, defense spending is kept at current levels — in order to finance the tax cuts and other costly measures favored by Trump and the Republicans — fierce competition between the two versions of the military-industrial complex could easily arise again. That, in turn, might trigger divisions within Trump’s inner circle, pitting loyalists to the old MIC against adherents to the new one. Most Republican lawmakers, who generally rely on contributions from the old MIC companies to finance their campaigns, are bound to support the major prime contractors in such a rivalry. But two of Trump’s key advisers, J.D. Vance and Elon Musk, could push him in the opposite direction. Vance, a former Silicon Valley functionary who reportedly became Trump’s running mate only after heavy lobbying by Peter Thiel and other tech billionaires, is likely to be encouraged by his former allies to steer more Pentagon contracts to Anduril, Palantir, and related companies. And that would hardly be surprising, since Vance’s private venture fund, Narya Capital (yes, another name derived from The Lord of the Rings!), has invested in Anduril and other military/space ventures. Named by Trump to direct the as-yet-to-be-established Department of Government Efficiency, Elon Musk, like Anduril’s Palmer Luckey, fought the Department of Defense to obtain contracts for one of his companies, SpaceX, and has expressed deep contempt for the Pentagon’s traditional way of doing things. In particular, he has denigrated the costly, generally ill-performing Lockheed-made F-35 jet fighter at a time when AI-governed drones are becoming ever more capable. Despite that progress, as he wrote on X, the social media platform he now owns, 'some idiots are still building manned fighter jets like the F-35.' In a subsequent post, he added that 'manned fighter jets are obsolete in the age of drones anyway.' His critique of the F-35 ruffled feathers at the Air Force and caused Lockheed’s stock to fall by more than 3%. 'We are committed to delivering the world’s most advanced aircraft — the F-35 — and its unrivaled capabilities with the government and our industry partners,' Lockheed declared in response to Musk’s tweets. Over at the Pentagon, Air Force Secretary Frank Kendall had this to say: 'I have a lot of respect for Elon Musk as an engineer. He’s not a warfighter, and he needs to learn a little bit more about the business, I think, before he makes such grand announcements as he did.' He then added, 'I don’t see F-35 being replaced. We should continue to buy it, and we also should continue to upgrade it.' President Trump has yet to indicate his stance on the F-35 or other high-priced items in the Pentagon’s budget lineup. He may (or may not) call for a slowdown in purchases of that plane and seek greater investment in other projects. Still, the divide exposed by Musk — between costly manned weapons made by traditional defense contractors and more affordable unmanned systems made by the likes of Anduril, General Atomics, and AeroVironment — is bound to widen in the years to come as the new version of the military-industrial complex only grows in wealth and power. How the old MIC will address such a threat to its primacy remains to be seen, but multibillion-dollar weapons companies are not likely to step aside without a fight. And that fight will likely divide the Trumpian universe. The views expressed in this article are the author’s own and do not necessarily reflect Fair Observer’s editorial policy.

Corruption And Crisis Define Nepal’s 2024 – Analysis	By Anil Sigdel Nepal’s 2024 news headlines were dominated by political instability, geopolitics and corruption. The limitations of the grand ruling coalition — made up of the Communist Party of Nepal–Unified Marxist–Leninist (CPN–UML) and Nepali Congress party — internal feud in the CPN–UML, relations with China and fund misappropriation cases by executives and popular leaders are key issues that gripped society. Economic and financial health indicators do not show encouraging improvement either. In July 2024, CPN–UML Chairman Khadga Prasad Sharma Oli became Nepalese prime minister for the fourth time. Oli decided to end his support for the Communist Party of Nepal–Maoist Centre government led by former Nepalese prime minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal ‘Prachanda’, instead joining hands with the Nepali Congress’ Sher Bahadur Deuba. The grand coalition between the two largest parties promised to yield a ‘national consensus’ government for constitutional amendments in a power-sharing arrangement in which the prime minister position alternates between Oli and Deuba. But as of March 2025, the coalition has failed to garner a common framework with major stakeholders for possible constitutional amendments. On the contrary, Oli has issued back-to-back executive orders despite the coalition having a comfortable majority — enough to follow the parliamentary procedure. The coalition’s ordinance to amend the Land Act in February 2025 drew strong criticism from the opposition, with speculation about the ruling coalition’s effort to bribe some parliamentarians to break their opposition. This strong criticism led the coalition to not push ahead with the ordinance. As Oli has hijacked the democratic practice, collective decision-making and leadership selection within the CPN–UML, efforts are again underway by some leaders to undercut Oli’s hold on power. Not to mention — as an injured tiger — former prime minister Prachanda is relentless in his efforts to break the Oli–Deuba coalition. The growing displeasure in Nepali Congress against the CPN–UML was also apparent when Oli signed a Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) agreement in China, especially regarding the investment modality. Congress emphasised receiving ‘aid assistance financing’, not loans. Oli has not yet visited India this term, he has reportedly not been invited. Oli instead went to Beijing in December 2024 and signed a BRI Cooperation Framework with China that mentions specific infrastructure projects for Nepal. The BRI agreement uses the wording ‘aid financing’, leaving room for interpretation about the nature of Chinese finance. In fact, Nepal and China had signed a Memorandum of Understanding on BRI cooperation in 2017, where China later emphasised Nepal’s Pokhara Airport as part of the BRI — a claim which Nepal denied. There is no big-ticket project so far that officially carries a BRI label. But this time, the US administration is halting funding from the US Agency for International Development. A vacuum created by this may encourage stakeholders to implement BRI projects. US President Donald Trump’s approach is clearly leading to a new geopolitical dynamic for Nepal. While there will be more a favourable environment for China–Nepal ties to deepen further, the growing India–EU strategic convergence will try to balance Chinese influence in Nepal. On the trade front, the trade deficit is huge, apart from slight changes in the export–import scenario. There are hardly any signs of long-term improvement. The youth exodus abroad is putting pressure on policymakers to get investment to provide employment at home. The foreign currency surplus is at a good level because of the youth exodus for foreign employment and the remittance that generates. Though some indicators show an increase in liquidity and the interest rates are lower, loan defaults are also very high and borrowers are hesitant given the environment of overall uncertainty. Haphazard urbanisation, sub-standard roads and means of transportation, a lack of quality public services for citizens, corruption and rent-seeking are among the perennial problems that citizens continue to face, stifling growth and development. Any effort by governments is a short-term fix to show good numbers for public consumption, but lacks vision and capacity to change the lived reality of a person in Nepal. There are sectors where growth is possible but given these negative factors, investment growth and employment creation is unlikely. It seems that 2025 will not be very different from 2024 — politically, economically or otherwise. In terms of political stability, one estimate shows 68 per cent of Nepalis think Nepal is heading in the wrong direction. Several political forces seem to be preparing to launch a movement and even the former Nepalese King Gyanendra Shah gave an announcement asking people to support his reinstatement. As old problems persist and new problems arise, 2025 offers little hope for real change in Nepal. About the author: Anil Sigdel is Lecturer at the University of Vienna, Austria.

Ex-Philippine President Duterte’s ICC Arrest Ups Stakes For May P...	By Camille Elemia Former Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte’s arrest on a world court warrant over alleged crimes against humanity has raised the stakes for May midterm elections amid an already volatile political climate, analysts said. His March 11 arrest and transfer to the custody of the International Criminal Court in The Hague took place in the run-up to the May 12 polls and a month after Philippine lawmakers impeached his daughter, Vice President Sara Duterte. The upcoming midterms were already shaping up to be a battle between the Dutertes and Marcoses – two of the most powerful families in Philippine politics – but the elder Duterte’s arrest throws an X factor into the rivalry between the feuding clans that were once formidable allies, according to observers. 'The Dutertes will do their best to win [in the elections]. But the Marcos camp may actually still double the efforts to end or subdue the [Duterte] dynasty,' Jean Franco, a political analyst from the University of the Philippines, told BenarNews. 'They’re also scared of the revenge of the Dutertes,' she said, referring to the Marcoses. The political alliance between the two families led to a big win in the May 2022 national polls, but it ended acrimoniously amid pressure on the Marcos administration to allow an ICC investigation into former President Duterte’s bloody drug war. But President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. has an advantage, according to Franco: His administration has all the resources and machinery for the upcoming polls. The Dutertes are gunning for top posts in their stronghold Davao City, with the former president running for mayor, his youngest son Sebastian running for vice mayor, and oldest son Paolo running for congressional reelection. On the national stage, Marcos is supporting 12 senatorial candidates, while several allies of the Duterte family are campaigning to run for the Senate in a bid to protect the vice president during her impeachment trial scheduled to begin in July. Sara Duterte was impeached for alleged constitutional violations and other high crimes, including plotting to assassinate President Marcos. 'It’s an electoral cycle, nothing is off the table,' said Aries Arugay, chair of the political science department at the University of the Philippines. Sara Duterte, who accused unidentified Marcos allies of undermining her prospects in the 2028 elections, is seen as a top contender for the 2028 presidential race, according to some surveys and analysts. For political analyst Ronald Llamas, there is a possibility of an 'uprising and mutiny' backed by the Dutertes against the Marcos administration. 'They have no other option [but] to bring down Marcos,' Llamas told BenarNews on Wednesday. Last week, authorities said military branches remained united amid reports that Rodrigo Duterte’s arrest had divided the ranks. The Philippine National Police also tightened security measures countrywide after Duterte was sent off to The Hague. Recent pre-election surveys show that Duterte’s longtime aide, Sen. Christopher 'Bong' Go, is the most preferred candidate. Also included in the possible winning circle is Sen. Ronald 'Bato' dela Rosa, the enforcer of Duterte’s drug war, who is among those implicated in the ICC case. Go and Dela Rosa, two of the staunchest allies of the former president, are seeking reelection in the Senate. The battle will be over for dela Rosa if and when the ICC issues a warrant against him within the year, Llamas said. Dela Rosa said he was considering hiding and not surrendering should authorities arrest him on an ICC warrant. 'If you don’t see any justice in this country, then why surrender?' Dela Rosa told reporters on Wednesday. 'That’s one of the courses of action we are considering.' Candidates gauge political winds But analysts said other election candidates were still hedging as they tried to gauge public sentiment over the arrest of Duterte, who left office in 2022 as one of the Philippines’ most popular presidents. 'Many candidates are still on the fence, trying to see where political winds are blowing,' Arugay told BenarNews on Wednesday. 'They are waiting for big rallies around the country, the emotional outrage that will pour out in the streets. But so far, aside from Mindanao [the political bailiwick of the Dutertes], not much.' For Arugay, the critical point is the arrest of Dela Rosa because 'if the candidates see it’s not just Duterte, it will be hard for them to stay on the fence.' There are no surveys yet on the public sentiment on Duterte’s arrest. But in previous years, surveys by the Philippine pollster Social Weather Stations showed dominant public approval for the ICC case against Duterte. 'The gross approval was between 49 and 59 percent, while gross disapproval was between 21 and 27 percent,' wrote SWS president Mahar Mangahas in his March 15 column in the Philippine Daily Inquirer. Mangahas said that while the former president was very popular during his term from 2016 to 2022, 'public opinion about Duterte’s War on Drugs was consistently unfavorable to him.' Sara Duterte’s fate in 2028 As for the presidential elections in 2028, analysts said it was too early to predict. Arugay and Llamas said a lot could still happen over the next three years. Llamas said that three swords of Damocles were hanging over the vice president’s head. Aside from her father’s ICC arrest, Sara Duterte’s impeachment trial in July and possible criminal complaints against her may disqualify her, if she’s convicted. 'Even if just one [sword] will fall on her head, it will be her political annihilation,' Llamas said. Meanwhile for Arugay, while the vice president’s popularity ratings remain high, it is not yet within the range of assured victory. 'We have yet to see whether or not [the issues affecting her] will chip away from the supposed Teflon likability and the invincibility of the Duterte dynasty.'	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWcYSmgfKIdQobV-1WYAVZsL	2025-03-20T16:59:23-07:00	
The Impact And Risks Of AI On Financial Investment – Analysis	By Yang Xite In recent years, artificial intelligence (AI) has been infiltrating various areas of financial investment at an unprecedented speed. From its initial role in assisting analysis to today's algorithmic trading and personalized asset allocation, AI has not only greatly improved efficiency but also brought about several potential risks. Compared to traditional financial tools, AI has advantages such as fast data processing, complex logic, and automated decision-making. However, it is precisely because of these strengths that the risks it hides are often more profound, hidden, and difficult to foresee. If financial regulatory authorities fail to respond to these risks in a timely and effective manner, once a major risk event occurs, they can only attempt to remedy the aftermath, which could lead to huge economic losses and severely damage market confidence. Therefore, it is crucial to take proactive 'preemptive regulation' measures as soon as risks begin to emerge, to prevent the issue from evolving into an uncontrollable financial crisis. This is especially true considering that the application of AI in the financial sector is no longer limited to simple data analysis and risk monitoring; it is profoundly changing the entire industry's operating model. However, because AI systems rely on vast amounts of data and complex algorithms, their inherent 'black box' nature also presents significant challenges for regulatory work. First, there is the 'black box' risk of AI models and the difficulty of tracing them. Once an AI model makes an error or exhibits bias, its decision-making results are often hard to trace or explain. Some high-frequency trading algorithms, in extreme market conditions, may make erroneous judgments due to failing to identify abnormal data in time, leading to a chain reaction that causes the entire market to panic. This phenomenon is not an isolated case, but has been repeatedly verified in multiple instances. Once such risks explode in the market, the consequences could be unimaginable, and the cost of prevention is far lower than the cost of remedying the situation afterward. Second, there are issues related to data dependence and privacy protection. While AI can predict market trends through vast amounts of data, its accuracy and predictive capabilities are highly reliant on the quality and completeness of the training data. In reality, data often contains biases, lags, or even risks of being manipulated. At the same time, in financial investment, the collection and processing of large amounts of sensitive information raises serious concerns about data security and privacy protection. If the data is maliciously tampered with or leaked, it could not only lead to incorrect investment decisions but also trigger a crisis of trust among users, ultimately threatening the stability of the entire financial system. Third, there are ethical and fairness risks. With the widespread use of smart investment advisors and automated trading platforms, the gap between ordinary investors and large institutions in terms of technology application is widening. Large institutions with abundant funds and advanced technology can use high-frequency trading and complex algorithms to gain huge profits, while ordinary retail investors may find themselves at a disadvantage due to the lack of corresponding technical tools. Moreover, AI algorithms, due to the limitations of training data, may unintentionally introduce bias against certain groups, leading to unfair practices in areas like credit evaluation, loan approvals, and other financial processes. Behind these risk factors, insufficient financial regulation has become an urgent issue that needs to be addressed. The existing regulatory system often struggles to keep up with the rapidly developing AI technologies. In many cases, when financial institutions use AI for trading and risk management, regulatory authorities, due to insufficient understanding of the technology, may experience regulatory gaps or inadequate oversight. Even more concerning, once a major risk event occurs, regulatory bodies can only intervene hastily afterward, and the remedial measures are both delayed and come with enormous economic and social costs. In this regard, a senior researcher at ANBOUND pointed out that financial regulatory authorities need to fundamentally shift their regulatory approach, take proactive action, and establish a 'preemptive prevention' regulatory mechanism. First, there should be a focus on strengthening in-depth research and understanding of AI tools. Regulatory bodies should not only focus on the economic benefits AI brings but also thoroughly analyze its risk points and potential vulnerabilities. Regulation should start with simple, low-risk AI applications that are easy to monitor, and gradually expand to more complex and higher-risk areas. Along the way, interactive feedback should help refine and improve the framework. This approach allows regulatory authorities to accumulate experience and data in the early stages, providing a scientific basis for more detailed regulation in the future. At the same time, regulatory bodies can draw on mature international regulatory experiences and models, collaborating through cross-border communication and cooperation to develop AI regulatory standards that are suitable for the global financial market. This can help prevent cross-border risk transmission caused by inconsistent regulatory standards. Second, a comprehensive AI regulatory evaluation system needs to be established. For different application scenarios and risk levels, corresponding evaluation indicators can be designed to monitor and provide real-time warnings about the risk levels of AI systems. For instance, in the case of algorithmic trading platforms, a monitoring system could be created based on factors such as trading volume, market volatility, and abnormal historical data. If any abnormal trading patterns are detected, the warning mechanism should be immediately triggered, requiring relevant institutions to conduct self-assessment and rectification. For financial investments, the focus should be on data privacy protection and algorithmic fairness. This can be ensured through third-party audits and publicly transparent regulatory reports, safeguarding users' legitimate rights and interests. By implementing a methodical and rigorous evaluation system, it becomes possible to achieve the early detection and prevention of AI-related risks. Third, financial institutions should be encouraged to develop comprehensive internal control mechanisms. While external regulation plays a vital role, financial institutions must also take a proactive approach by establishing their own internal risk management systems when implementing AI technology. Specifically, they can adopt measures such as conducting regular internal audits of AI models to ensure transparency in decision-making and the reliability of data sources. Additionally, institutions should establish multi-layered risk assessment and intervention mechanisms to enable swift human intervention when anomalies are detected. Moreover, enhancing training for both employees and management will improve their ability to identify and address AI-related risks. By fostering collaboration between internal and external mechanisms, these institutions can create a strong, unified approach to mitigating systemic risks posed by AI applications. Fourth, it is crucial to promote relevant legislative work to provide legal protection for the application of AI in the financial sector. At present, many countries' legislative processes regarding AI regulation are lagging behind and lack clear legal foundations. The situation is even more pressing in the financial sector. Financial regulatory authorities should work closely with legislative bodies to quickly introduce specialized regulations for AI technology, clearly defining the responsibilities and rights of all parties involved, and providing a solid legal foundation for preemptive regulation. Through legal constraints, if issues arise, relevant authorities can swiftly intervene in accordance with the law, minimizing losses and preventing the spread of risks. In fact, investor education is also a crucial aspect. As the ultimate participants in the financial market, ordinary investors often lack sufficient risk awareness when facing AI and can easily be misled by the apparent high returns. Regulatory authorities and financial institutions can use various channels to educate the public about the basic principles of AI technology, its application scope, and potential risks, helping the public develop a comprehensive understanding of risks. AI has indeed brought about transformative changes in the financial investment sector. Its advanced data processing capabilities and accurate predictive potential are reshaping the industry landscape. However, these opportunities are accompanied by complex, multi-layered risks, ranging from model errors and market instability to ethical and privacy concerns, which indicates that one has to be cautious when adopting the technology. Through a collaborative approach that combines technological innovation, strengthened regulation, and comprehensive risk management, there can be a safer and more sustainable application of AI in financial investment. The future integration of AI and finance will undoubtedly present both significant opportunities and considerable challenges. Final analysis conclusion: The application of AI in the financial sector presents both unprecedented opportunities and significant risks. Financial regulatory authorities should enhance the regulation of AI tools, following the principle of starting with simple, low-risk applications and gradually refining the approach. This should involve initially focusing on a smaller scope, expanding over time, incorporating interactive feedback, and continuously improving the regulatory framework. Such an approach will facilitate the gradual development of an efficient AI regulatory framework to effectively mitigate financial risks. This constitutes 'preemptive regulation', as opposed to 'post-event regulation', which, if triggered by a major incident, the latter would inevitably incur substantial costs and consequences.

Back To Tried Failures: The New Offensive On Gaza – OpEd	If at first you don’t succeed, failure may be your only option. This is proving very much to be the case with the resumption of savagely lethal strikes on Gaza by the Israeli Air Force on March 19. In a matter of hours, over 400 Palestinians were slaughtered. The resumption of the attacks by Israel terminated a fragile, often qualified cease-fire that had seen the first phase hold, for the most part, through March. Attempts to negotiate the freeing of the surviving Israeli hostages, and further Palestinian prisoners, and concluding the conflict with a lasting ceasefire and the withdrawal of Israeli forces from Gaza, however, proved fruitless. Israel and the United States have justified the resumption of hostilities on Hamas’ reluctance to release more hostages prior to commencing negotiations on ending the war. This consisted of a US proposal in which Hamas would release half the remaining Israeli hostages in return for a seven-week prolongation of the truce, with a nebulous undertaking to launch negotiations over a more durable ceasefire. This did not form the basis of the original ceasefire agreement, though it did lead to Hamas offering to return the bodies of four hostages and the American-Israeli soldier, Edan Alexander. Rather predictably, Israel has also accused Hamas of readying itself for further attacks, though evidence of this is scanty at best. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has always been lukewarm to any notion of a durable ceasefire agreement. 'We are committed,' he explained in an interview last June, 'to continuing the war after a pause, in order to complete the goal of eliminating Hamas. I’m not willing to give up on that.' On January 18, just as the guns were meant to fall silent, Netanyahu was adamant that Israel reserved 'the right to return to war if necessary with the backing of the United States.' The approach taken by Netanyahu has therefore been one of bombing while simultaneously negotiating with Hamas. It’s a recipe that is idiosyncratic and irreconcilable, suggesting a holding pattern of failure. While the PM promises that 'This is just the beginning,' and that, 'We will keep fighting to achieve all of the war’s objectives', it remains questionable how many of these have been achieved. Hamas, however weakened, continues to operate in the Gaza strip. Palestinian civilians continue to be butchered. For Netanyahu, a sense of crisis is important. Peace would be dangerous for him, allowing the wheels of Israeli justice to conclude legal proceedings against him on charges of fraud, bribery and breach of trust. War is his reassurance, instability an antidote. Alon Pinkas, former Israeli ambassador and consul general in New York, reasoned on Al Jazeera that the new round of attacks on Gaza was a matter of 'survival politics' and had 'zero military significance [and] no political end.' Giving him an incentive to resist talks of peace in favour of an annihilatory agenda are also such individuals of the far-right as Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich. The waspish politician has repeatedly threatened to leave the coalition if further negotiations with Hamas are pursued instead of resuming the war. Similarly, Itamar Ben-Gvir of Otzma Yehudit (Jewish Power) and former national security minister has rejoined the coalition government after exiting in protest at the ceasefire agreement in January. This took place despite concerns at his conduct as cabinet minister, notably expressed by Attorney General Gali Baharav-Miara. The return of the extreme pro-settler group to the fold prompted a lamentation from from Knesset member Naama Lazimi (The Democrats): 'It’s a strange world. A faction resigns from the government because lives are being saved, and the same party returns to the government when they are being abandoned.' Netanyahu’s savouring of a good crisis is also evident in his desire to remove Shin Bet chief Ronen Bar, the first instance in Israeli history of a government seeking to fire the head of a security agency. 'The prime minister’s expectation of a duty of personal loyalty, the purpose of which contradicts the public interest,' Bar observed in a statement, 'is a fundamentally illegitimate expectation. It is contrary to the Shin Bet law and contrary to the patriotic values that guide the Shin Bet and its members.' True to authoritarian form, this effort has been undertaken without the necessary recommendation of the Senior Appointments Advisory Committee. It has also prompted protests across the country. In Israel, those seeking the release of the hostages are aggrieved. Yet again, their position remains subordinate to the whim and cynicism of Netanyahu. But beyond that, the basis for an even more murderous phase in the conflict against the Palestinians, one encouraged by the United States, has begun.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWcYSmgfKIdQoX8W0jyQToUO	2025-03-20T16:56:15-07:00	
Invisible Barriers: How Castes Shape India – Analysis	India is a unique country with an extraordinary level of social and cultural diversity. More than 1.4 billion Indians speak approximately 780 languages (22 of which are official). India is home to some of the world's oldest civilizations, such as the Indus Valley Civilization and the Vedic Civilization, and it also houses sacred sites for Hinduism, Buddhism, and other religions. In addition to being the world's largest democracy, India has become a global center of innovation, particularly in the IT sector. The Indian film industry, Bollywood, is the largest in the world and holds a significant place in global popular culture. Furthermore, the country is known for its unique cuisine and fast-growing economy, which is becoming an increasingly important international player. The Caste System – An Invisible Apartheid However, one of the things India is known for that is not positive—or at best controversial—is its caste system. Although the caste system is invisible to foreign observers at first glance, it is a deeply embedded element of Indian society that continues to have a significant impact on everyday life in the 21st century. It is a social structure that strongly resembles apartheid in South Africa during the latter half of the 20th century, despite being legally prohibited in the secular Republic of India. The history of the caste system is not a recent development. On the contrary, it is a socio-religious system that originated from Hinduism and has roots going back approximately 3,500 years. The Manusmriti is the most prominent book of Hindu law (written between 200 BCE and 200 CE) and considers the caste system the pillar of social order. The book prescribes a rigid hierarchy based on birth and occupation. People are expected to remain within their respective castes and perform jobs associated with their social status. Each group has specific duties and roles in society. Caste Divisions According to the book, Hindus are divided into four hierarchical groups (varnas): Brahmins, Kshatriyas, Vaishyas, and Shudras. Brahmins are named after the god of creation, Brahma, and according to Hindu belief, they originate from God's head. They are designated to engage in education, the propagation of faith, and other intellectual activities. Brahmins enjoy high social status and are considered spiritual leaders in Hindu society. In addition to interpreting sacred scriptures, they are responsible for performing rituals, ceremonies, and religious rites, ensuring spiritual purity and social balance. Kshatriyas originate from God's arms and are tasked with being warriors and rulers to protect society. They are responsible for maintaining law and order and for fighting in the name of justice and the community. They are entrusted with governing the state and making strategic military decisions. Their duty is to ensure the safety and stability of society. Vaishyas originate from Brahma's loins and are designated to engage in trade and agriculture. Their role is to ensure economic prosperity. They are key drivers of economic activity and are responsible for managing resources such as farming, livestock, and trade. The role of the Vaishyas is to promote development for the benefit of all social strata. Shudras originate from God's feet and, as the lowest caste, must perform the hardest labor as servants and workers. Their duty is to serve the higher castes, and their social mobility is highly restricted, leading to societal marginalization. These four categories are further divided into 3,000 castes and 25,000 sub-castes. The 'Untouchables' Outside of this system exists a distinct group of people who were once referred to as the 'Untouchables' but are now mostly known as Dalits, meaning 'broken people.' Although all castes are subordinate to those above them—especially to the Brahmins—Dalits are in the worst position. Since they are outside the caste system, they are considered impure beings. Dalits perform the hardest and dirtiest jobs, such as sweeping the streets, removing dead animals from roads, cleaning sewers, and burying the dead. This system is deliberately structured to ensure that they perform the most degrading tasks. Dalits, particularly Dalit women, are frequent victims of various crimes such as rape, robbery, beatings, and murder. Punishments for crimes against Dalits are generally significantly more lenient compared to those involving other members of the population. In many rural areas, Dalits are still forbidden from entering Hindu temples or collecting water from public places such as wells and springs. The System of Superior and Inferior Beings The caste system has created a divided society in which some social strata enjoy privileged status, while others face discrimination. Simply put, some groups are considered superior beings, while others are regarded as inferior and impure. Mixing is strictly forbidden, and everyone must adhere to their predetermined place in society. Merely belonging to a particular caste can prevent individuals from getting employed, receiving an education, moving freely, and accessing adequate healthcare. They are excluded from social life, face political discrimination, and endure numerous prejudices and stereotypes that have no basis in reality. While privileged castes live normal lives or even lives of luxury, the oppressed castes live in poverty. In many cases, birth within a caste still determines a person’s future profession. Even if lower-caste individuals attain higher education, they may still end up working as street sweepers or sewer cleaners. This unjust system creates deep social and economic inequalities, making the abolition of the caste status quo nearly impossible. Since 1931, India has not conducted a caste-based census, making it difficult to determine the exact numbers of caste members. The proportions of different castes vary by region, but approximate estimates suggest: Brahmins make up about 5% of the population, Kshatriyas around 4%, Vaishyas about 8–10%, and Shudras about 50%. Dalits constitute approximately 20–25% of the population. Strict Caste Separation The caste system somewhat resembles medieval feudal Europe, where society was divided into classes: peasants, nobles, clergy, and rulers. However, that division was primarily political rather than religious and eventually collapsed with industrialization and urbanization. This has not been the case in India. Castes must remain separate. Most importantly, inter-caste marriages are strictly prohibited to prevent the mixing of bloodlines and the birth of children whose parents come from different castes. In 21st-century India, this means that neighborhoods, schools, hospitals, factories, cafes, and restaurants are segregated, with minimal interaction between members of different castes. This rigid social division is maintained across generations, and any attempt to break caste rules can lead to serious consequences, such as social ostracization or violence. While caste barriers are somewhat weaker in urban areas, they remain strong and strictly enforced in rural regions. Many parents actively ensure their children marry within their caste, often relying on intermediaries or caste networks to find suitable partners. Those who attempt to defy caste norms frequently face pressure to 'return to their place' in society. Biological Differences Due to the strict separation regime that has persisted for millennia, different castes have developed distinct biological differences, such as skin color. A 2016 genetic study by the Centre for Cellular and Molecular Biology in Hyderabad found that class structure has a 'strong impact on skin pigmentation,' with higher castes generally having lighter skin. This difference in skin tone has reinforced social prejudices, as lighter skin is often associated with higher social status and beauty in many parts of India. As a result, there is still a thriving industry for skin-whitening products, and fair skin is often preferred in marriage, business, and social standing. Castes – An Indispensable Part of India The caste system is one of India's defining characteristics. The father of modern India, Mahatma Gandhi, belonged to the Vaishya caste (merchants and artisans) and the Modh Bania subcaste. He once stated: 'I believe that Hindu society has survived because it is founded on the caste system… The destruction of the caste system and the adoption of the Western European system would mean that Hindus must renounce the principle of hereditary occupation, which is the essence of the caste system. The hereditary principle is eternal. Changing it would create chaos.' However, Gandhi later radically changed his rhetoric, fiercely criticizing caste discrimination and advocating for the rights of Dalits, whom he called Harijans ('Children of God'). He believed that all people are equal before God and fought against the injustices stemming from the caste system. Nonetheless, he continued to defend the idea of varna – social classes. He argued that everyone has a hereditary calling they should follow but rejected the notion of class superiority. Positive Changes Since India is a secular rather than a theocratic Hindu state, formal discrimination based on caste is legally prohibited. However, because the government is often led by higher-caste individuals, laws are frequently not enforced at the local level. Although Brahmins make up at most 5% of the population, they hold influential positions in government, the military, the judiciary, education, healthcare, and the media. Many politicians lack the motivation to enforce anti-discrimination laws, as doing so could cost them the votes of higher castes. Nonetheless, in recent decades, there have been improvements, with Dalits and other marginalized groups gaining more protection and opportunities for social advancement. Some lower-caste individuals have reached high-ranking positions in government. For example, K. R. Narayanan, the tenth President of India (1997–2002), was a Dalit. He became the first Indian president from the Dalit community, symbolizing progress in the fight against caste discrimination. The current Indian Prime Minister, Narendra Modi, also comes from a historically marginalized lower-caste group. Specifically, he belongs to the Teli caste, traditionally associated with the oil trade. Although not from a high caste like the Brahmins or Kshatriyas, Modi rose to the top of Indian politics, emphasizing his humble origins to appeal to the masses. However, the success of lower-caste individuals has provoked resentment among the upper castes, leading to an increase in violence against Dalits in recent years. A Persistent Problem In the 21st century, India is one of the most important countries in the global community. It is the world's largest democracy, the most populous country, a BRICS member, the fifth-largest economy, and a nuclear power. India is a dynamic and youthful country that has fully embraced sophisticated technologies. However, numerous problems hinder its progress. Aside from poverty, the caste system may be its most significant issue. Despite modernization and legal bans on discrimination, caste remains a powerful force shaping social, economic, and cultural processes. According to some analyses, dismantling the caste system could take several more decades.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWcYSmgfKIdQofCYcDJWKrMG	2025-03-20T16:53:06-07:00	
Commercial Real Estate Is In Serious Trouble – OpEd	By Douglas French While the financial press is attempting to cover Trump’s frenetic bipolar tariff policy, the ponderous commercial real estate market continues to deteriorate. Bisnow.com reports, citing CoStar, 'US banks reported delinquencies hit 1.57 percent at the end of last year, a rate not seen since the fourth quarter of 2014.' Putting a number to the percentage, 'The 1.57 percent delinquency percentage means more than $47.1B of loans would have been delinquent at the end of the year,' writes Billy Wadsack for Bisnow’s Dallas-Fort Worth bureau. That’s an 88 percent increase from a decade ago. Delinquencies in CMBS (Commercial Mortgage-Backed Securities) are setting multi-year highs with $38B in arrears at year-end 2024, a 41 percent increase from the previous year end. In the face of troubling news, those who work in real estate are taking a rosy view, as usual. James Robertson, Jr. writes in the latest Grant’s Interest Rate Observer, 'Optimism in the industry is the highest it has been in eight years.' This industry he calls 'illiquid and slow-moving' with cycles that can 'drag on for years.' There has been little transaction volume and sellers have held tightly to the valuations and cap rates experienced during days of ZIRP. Likewise, bankers have extended and pretended, hoping the never-before-seen low rates will miraculously return to lift all boats (and buildings). Fitch Ratings’s Melissa Che told Robertson, 'As more lower-quality assets, some of which have significantly deteriorated in performance, come to market and trade at relatively low prices, this may trigger an overall reset and further price discovery across various property quality segments.' Distressed market sales nearly doubled to 6 percent in last year’s fourth quarter, according to Newmark Group, Inc. Banks are growing more impatient with loan extensions and modifications raising the amount of 2025 debt maturities to $957 billion from $659 billion from 2022. Newmark believes a third of CMBS loans fail to cover debt services. Robertson focuses on bridge loans (REBLs) whose issuance ballooned in 2021 to $45 billion from less than $9 billion the year prior. Artis Shepherd of Patterson Capital, LLC told Robertson, 'Bridge lending shifted around this time into a fairly aggressive product. Some lenders were offering credit at 80 percent-85 percent loan-to-value ratios and underwriting loans based upon proforma rather than actual net operating income.' Shepherd goes on to explain that 2021 bridge lender’s loose underwriting included debt service coverage of just 1.0 or 1.05 to pro forma numbers rather than the traditional 1.25 DCR (Debt Service Coverage Ratio). This has come back to bite lenders and REITs. Borrowers whose loans are maturing must confront interest rates which are 300 bps higher than what they are paying. If they are paying at all. In Robertson’s piece he gives the example of the Starbucks Seattle HQ building. The current rate is 2.3 percent. However, the loan matures in August and Harsh Hemnani of Greenstreet told Robertson 'If spreads and rates stay the same, it’s going to be somewhere around 5.5 percent. The owners will have to eat the difference. I think that pain is definitely going to happen.' If Starbucks is your tenant, you take the hit. Owners with lesser quality tenants (or none at all) will likely walk away. Office properties are not the only problem. Overbuilding of multi-family projects has put pressure on rents. Community banks hold $629.7 billion in apartment loans with $6.1 billion being 30 days or more delinquent. This is the most since 2012 the tail-end of the Great Financial Crisis. Researchers at the NY Fed are on high alert concerning the coming CRE maturity wall, believing banks are undercapitalized. 'For example, regulators, credit rating agencies and providers of funding might scrutinize bank maturity extensions more closely, thus forcing banks to accept defaults rather than granting more maturity extensions.' These defaults could lead to deposit runs and/or 'trigger a wave of foreclosures or sales of loans in secondary markets, imposing fire-sale externalities on other intermediaries by depressing the market valuations of CRE debt and underlying CRE properties.' Wall Street has a close eye on the banks with the Regional Bank ETF (KRE) having fallen 18 percent since hitting a high around last Thanksgiving. The President says his favorite word is 'tariff.' As an ex-real estate developer, his least favorite is likely 'maturity.'

Erosion Of The Norm Of Using Chemical Weapons – Analysis	By Rani Chor (FPRI) -- The global norm against chemical weapons, bolstered by international disarmament initiatives and the Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC), stands as a pillar of modern arms control. This treaty has achieved remarkable successes, including the elimination of 97 percent of the world’s declared chemical weapons stockpiles. Yet, this progress masks an unsettling reality: There are high-profile violations by states like Russia, Syria, and North Korea and mounting efforts by terrorist organizations and insurgents to acquire chemical weapons, which reveal challenges to their complete elimination and the norm against their use. Unlike nuclear weapons, chemical agents are relatively accessible to produce and deploy, making them an attractive option for actors willing to defy international law. These breaches not only threaten global security but also undermine the stability of the liberal international order. Addressing these challenges demands renewed focus on the CWC’s limitations, the persistence of noncompliance, and the broader implications of an eroding taboo against chemical warfare. The global ban on chemical weapons—once a universal red line—is eroding fast. To halt this dangerous slide, the United States and its allies must bolster enforcement under the CWC and the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW), preserving the norm against these inhumane weapons. The Norm Against Chemical Weapons: Are They Contested? The CWC is the primary tool to prevent the spread of chemical weapons to states and non-state actors, and the agreement paved the way for the destruction of the vast majority of chemical weapons on this planet. The OPCW plays a crucial role in monitoring compliance and overseeing the destruction of chemical stockpiles. At the same time, multilateral export control regimes, like the Australia Group, aim to restrict the materials and technology necessary for chemical weapon production. A key drawback of the CWC is its uneven enforcement. While some states have complied with the treaty’s stringent requirements, others have been reluctant to declare their stockpiles or destroy their chemical arsenals. Compliance is often seen as overly burdensome and helps explain why signatory states have violated the spirit of the agreement and why non-signatories may now be willing to use these weapons. The CWC clearly defines the prohibition against chemical weapons use, possession, and proliferation. Yet, unlike the norms surrounding nuclear weapons—on use, proliferation, and testing—chemical weapons norms seem less ingrained in international security frameworks. This may be due, in part, to the historical perception of chemical weapons as 'second-tier' threats compared to nuclear arms, making them more susceptible to violations by state actors. The Geneva Protocol of 1925, an earlier treaty, prohibited the use of chemical and biological weapons in war but did not extend to their possession. Consequently, during the Cold War, chemical weapons continued to be developed and stockpiled, particularly by the United States and the Soviet Union. The CWC was later established as a more comprehensive non-proliferation and disarmament treaty when chemical weapons no longer held high utility amongst major powers, as they were redundant to the nuclear question. While necessitating the destruction of chemical arsenals, CWC enforcement has not always been consistent, with violators facing varying levels of international response. For instance, chemical weapon use in the Syrian civil war, while condemned globally, has been met with inconsistent enforcement, and geopolitical dynamics often complicate intervention efforts. The once-robust global norm against chemical weapons is under threat as nations increasingly flout regulations enshrined in the CWC. To address this erosion, it is critical to examine three case studies—Syria’s use of chemical weapons to maintain power amid civil war and North Korea’s and Russia’s deployment of these weapons as tools of assassination—each illustrating distinct motivations behind this dangerous trend. Case Study 1: Russia’s Novichok Agents The most serious example of the erosion of chemical weapons norms can be seen in Russia’s use of Novichok agents to assassinate dissidents. Although Russia is a signatory to the CWC, it has exploited loopholes in the treaties to develop Novichok, a nerve agent that was not declared to the OPCW. This may have been on purpose. Due to uncertainty surrounding their chemical structures, the chemical precursors used to make Novichok were excluded from control regimes. This has allowed Russia to continue producing and stockpiling them, which violates the spirit of the treaty, even if Russia has exploited a well-known loophole. The danger is that now, Russia has used the weapon to undermine the norm Moscow had helped to create against its use. The most notable use of Novichok occurred in 2018 when Sergei Skripal, a former Russian spy, and his daughter were poisoned in the United Kingdom. The attack also affected British police officer Nick Bailey and a couple who mistakenly handled the substance. Despite Russia’s denial of responsibility, the UK government attributed the attack to Novichok, which it claimed was stockpiled by Russia. Although Russia had destroyed nearly 40,000 metric tons of its declared chemical weapons stockpile by 2017, the attack demonstrated its continued use of chemical weapons, signaling the erosion of norms that were once strongly upheld. Case Study 2: North Korea and VX Nerve Agent In 2017, assassins violated chemical weapons norms by killing Kim Jong-nam, the half-brother of North Korean leader Kim Jong-un, with a VX nerve agent at Kuala Lumpur airport. The public assassination, sanctioned by the North Korean regime, showcased North Korea’s blatant disregard for international norms against chemical weapons use. Despite global condemnation, North Korea’s weapons of mass destruction program remains a significant threat to international security. State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert highlighted that 'this public display of contempt for universal norms against chemical weapons use further demonstrates the reckless nature of North Korea.' The assassination sent a clear message that North Korea is willing to challenge international norms with impunity, further weakening the global stance against chemical weapons. Case Study 3: Syria’s Use of Chemical Weapons in Civil War The Assad regime relied on chemical weapons to deter war with Israel. Hafez al-Assad, former President Bashar al-Assad’s father, started the program tracing back to the 1970s, when Syria sought assistance from the Soviet Union to develop nuclear energy capabilities for ostensibly peaceful purposes. After his death, his son used these weapons to stave off collapse early on in the country’s civil war. He eventually reached an agreement with the United States and Russia to destroy them after a large-scale Sarin attack in 2013 prompted US debate about striking the regime. Assad relented and destroyed large numbers of his chemical precursors but held some weapons back and used them in small-scale ways to retain power. Despite Syria’s commitment to disarm in 2013, the OPCW’s Investigation and Identification Team attributedthree chemical attacks in 2020 directly to Assad’s forces. These attacks have been largely ineffective in achieving military objectives but have caused significant civilian casualties, further eroding the norm against chemical weapons used in warfare. Assad was ultimately ousted from power in December 2024, and the remnants of his stockpile are now scattered throughout a war-ravaged country. The history of the conflict underscores challenges in enforcing chemical weapons norms in regions plagued by civil strife and geopolitical entanglements. While the international community has condemned these attacks, efforts to hold the Assad regime accountable have been limited, raising questions about the effectiveness of the CWC in preventing such violations. The Future of Chemical Weapons Norms Despite significant progress in non-proliferation, including the 2023 destruction of the last chemical weapon in the US stockpile, the persistence of chemical arsenals in states like Syria, Russia, and North Korea reveals enduring challenges. These challenges are twofold: ensuring the complete elimination of chemical weapons and preventing their proliferation. The relative ease with which these weapons can be produced and deployed underscores their threat, particularly in volatile regions where authoritarian regimes routinely disregard international norms. Syria, for instance, retained chemical weapons initially intended as a deterrent against Israel, only to turn them inward during its civil war—a chilling reflection of their use to sustain regime stability. Russia and North Korea have similarly flouted the CWC, deploying these weapons in recent, albeit poorly executed, assassination attempts. These cases highlight the fragility of international agreements and the audacity of states willing to exploit loopholes and evade accountability. The global norm against chemical weapons—a tier of destruction so abhorrent that nations once universally agreed to regulate them—is at risk of further erosion. The issue merits importance not only because of the sheer brutality of these weapons but also because their use signals a dangerous precedent: a return to an era where such atrocities were committed with impunity. To prevent this dark regression, the United States and its allies should work to strengthen enforcement mechanisms under the CWC and the OPCW. The international community’s collective response will shape the future of chemical weapons norms, influencing both state behavior and the threat posed by non-state actors. Without renewed commitment and cooperation, the world risks undermining decades of progress, allowing chemical weapons to once again wreak devastation on civilians and combatants alike.

Serbia Angered By Defence Pact Linking Croatia, Albania And Kosov...	By Vuk Tesija and Xhorxhina Bami A defence agreement signed between Croatia, Albania and Kosovo has sparked a diplomatic spat with neighbour Serbia, which still sees Kosovo as part of its territory and does not recognise its independence. Serbian President Aleksandar Vucic accused Croatia and Albania of starting an 'arms race' in the region by signing the concord with what he called the 'provisional institutions' in Kosovo, meaning the country’s government. 'It is a difficult situation for us but we have understood their message. And we will protect our country, deter them, and always successfully defend it from any potential aggressor, even this powerful one,' Vucic said on Wednesday. But Croatia said it did not need Serbia’s permission to sign anything. Defence Minister Ivan Anusic said the time when Zagreb sought Belgrade’s approval for its actions was long gone and would never return. 'We have been an independent state for 35 years and have endured five years of aggression and policies that promoted such a narrative,' Anusic said, referencing Croatia’s 1990s independence war against the Serbian-led Yugoslav army. 'Cooperation with Albania and Kosovo focuses on knowledge exchange, collaboration between military industries and support for the Euro-Atlantic aspirations of Albania and Kosovo,' Anusic explained on X. The row erupted after Croatia, Albania and Kosovo signed the Declaration on Strengthening Defence Cooperation on Tuesday. The declaration, which other countries may also join, calls for joint responses to security challenges, hybrid threats and other risks that could threaten regional stability, the Croatian Defence Ministry stated following the agreement’s signing. But Serbia’s Defence Minister Bratislav Gasic called it a 'provocative initiative' by the neighbouring countries. The signing of the memorandum 'without consultation with Belgrade represents confirmation of the correctness of the strategic investment in the strengthening and modernisation of the Serbian Armed Forces,' Gasic said. 'It is a provocative initiative of neighbouring states that is in contradiction with efforts to strengthen regional security,' he added. Kosovo’s Foreign Minister Donika Gervalla-Schwarz responded by writing on X on Wednesday that she 'strongly condemns Serbia’s threatening statement' and accused Belgrade of seeking to continue 'its hegemonic policies in the region. Gervalla-Schwarz added 'Without recognising Kosova, Serbia cannot be a factor of stability.' Kosovo’s Foreign Ministry also urged Serbia to implement existing agreements. The two countries reached a normalisation of relations deal, facilitated by the EU, in February 2023. The agreement said they were to 'develop normal, good-neighbourly relations with each other on the basis of equal rights' and be guided by mutual 'respect for their independence, autonomy, and territorial integrity, the right of self-determination, the protection of human rights, and non-discrimination'. It remains mostly unimplemented so far.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWcYSmgfKIdQoQSZKFnNiohg	2025-03-20T16:47:35-07:00	
Government Shutdown Theater Gets A New Plot – OpEd	The scheduled spring performance of government shutdown theater didn’t go as planned this year. The performance was set up just before Christmas 2024, when lame duck President Joe Biden signed a short-term spending bill that would keep the U.S. government’s lights on for about another three months. The bill did that by increasing the U.S. government’s debt limit to $36.1 trillion. By design, that increase wouldn’t be enough to cover all the U.S. government’s spending previously approved by Congress for its 2025 fiscal year, which lasts through September 30, 2025. Because the departing Biden administration was going out in a blaze of excess spending, the U.S. government smacked into that debt ceiling on January 22. As it did, the U.S. Treasury Department was forced to once again turn to 'extraordinary measures' to allow the U.S. government to continue operating. However, these measures only delayed the potential shutdown of the U.S. government. As it was, the Treasury Department could borrow time by playing its shell game with the nation’s debt until mid-March. Unless an increase in the debt limit was passed, large parts of the government would be forced to shut down as its borrowed time ran out. Writing the Plot Members of the then-Democratic Party majority in the Senate wanted that outcome so they could have leverage in budget negotiations. Leverage they needed because they would be in the minority in the upcoming new session of Congress. Because the majority Republican Party had fewer than 60 members in the Senate, they would need the votes of Democratic Party members to pass measures raising the debt limit to keep the federal government running. They counted on having the ability to shut down the government to force the incoming Trump administration into accepting their spending priorities. Their top priority is no limits or reductions in spending on their political priorities. The Democrat’s Plan Becomes a Losing Strategy Three things came together to undermine the Democrats’ strategy. The incoming Trump administration launched a serious assault on waste, fraud, and abuse within government spending. President Trump rebranded President Obama’s U.S. Digital Service as the U.S. Department of Government Efficiency Service (DOGE). But rather than continuing its track record of fiscal impotence, it was retooled. Now, it would aggressively identify and go after government spending waste to zero it out. While that early initiative quickly gained success, President Trump also succeeded in placing his appointed officials into their new positions. Most importantly, the U.S. Senate approved the appointment of Russell Vought as director of the White House Office of Management and Budget. Vought’s appointment gave President Trump full control over which government operations would remain open or be closed in the event of a government shutdown. The third thing was the unlikely unity of Republicans in passing a continuing resolution in the House of Representatives. This one big spending bill would avoid any shutdowns through at least the end of September. All Pain, No Gain for Democrats With the action now in the Senate, only the resistance of Senate Democrats could produce a government shutdown. But instead of having the leverage they sought to gain, they faced two choices, both painful. They could approve the Republicans’ one big spending bill that would support President Trump’s agenda, or they could vote against it and shut the government down. But wait, there’s more. If the spending bill passed, it would open the door for the Senate to proceed with spending rescission bills. These bills only require the approval of a simple majority of Senators to come to a vote rather than the three-fifths majority needed for the continuing resolution. For example, spending cuts identified by DOGE could now easily be given the force of law through simple votes of Congress. Votes that would proceed without any possibility of filibuster by the minority Democrats. However, with a government shutdown, President Trump’s team would be able to achieve spending cuts immediately. The people responsible for that outcome would be the Senate Democrats. Not only would they lose on spending, but they would also be sure to feel the political pain from their supporters from now through the next elections. No Way Out With no way out and their strategy in tatters, the Senate Democrats’ leadership crumpled like a cheap suit. In the end, ten Democratic Party senators made the passage of the Republicans’ one-big spending bill bipartisan. What matters next is what Republicans do with their victory after this episode of government shutdown theater. They have the chance to put the U.S. government on a more sustainable fiscal path. Will they take it? This article was published at The Beacon	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWcYSmgfKIdQoe020_4b1Z_e	2025-03-20T16:45:44-07:00	
Ukraine’s Shrinking Foothold In Kursk – Analysis	By Can Kasapoğlu 1. Battlefield Assessment The Ukrainian Armed Forces have withdrawn from Sudzha, a town in the Russian region of Kursk. Thus far no open-source intelligence has indicated that Russian or North Korean units have enveloped Ukrainian formations. Still, this makes sustaining a presence in Kursk even more difficult for Ukraine. A joint offensive by North Korean and Russian combat formations repelled Ukraine’s incursion. Evidence shows that fighters from the former Wagnerprivate military company also played a role in the Russian offensive. As Russian and North Korean troops breached Ukraine’s lines of defense, Russian President Vladimir Putin visited the Russian military headquarters for the Kursk region. After months of downplaying the significance of Ukraine’s incursion, the Kremlin capitalized on the moment to emphasize this operation as an important success. Beyond being a defeat in the ongoing war for the narrative, losing Kursk could have three major consequences for Ukraine. First, with ceasefire negotiations looming, the loss would deprive Ukraine of precious diplomatic leverage in a territory swap. Second, removing Ukraine from Kursk could allow the Russian military to move the tens of thousands of troops it has fielded there to other fronts. Third, the loss of Kursk increases the likelihood that the Kremlin could invade Ukraine’s neighboring Sumy Oblast. In a positive development for Kyiv, the Ukrainian military seems to have defended and stabilized the front lines in the battle-worn town of Pokrovsk following the appointment of General Mykhailo Drapatyi to lead troops there. Nonetheless, Russian offensives in this sector have made small tactical gains. Toretsk also remains heavily contested, with Ukrainian and Russian combat formations engaged in strenuous fighting. Ukraine faces a serious threat from Russian first-person-view drones equipped with fiber-optic cables, a threat the author witnessed firsthand on a recent Hudson Institute field tour of Ukraine. In another drone warfare development, the Ukrainian militaryhas begun to use unmanned ground vehicles to deploy concertina wire. In the air, Russia continues to batter Ukraine. Moscow has launched drone barrages involving over 100 Shahed loitering munitions each, often followed by ballistic missile salvos. Russia’s high rate of drone usage suggests it has boosted production capacity at its Iran-supported drone plant in Tatarstan, a finding that Ukrainian officials confirmed during the author’s field tour.

Ukraine’s Deep-Strike Campaign Continues to Harm Russian Oil Revenues On March 14 the Ukrainian military successfully hit the Tuapse oil refinery in Russia’s Krasnodar region, hundreds of miles from the Russia-Ukraine border. Imagery from the impact zone indicates large fires raging in the Tuapse compound. Ukraine struck the refinery at least three times. The incident marked another successful attack in a series of long-range Ukrainian salvos directed at Russia’s energy infrastructure, which is critical to the Russian economy. In the first few months of 2025, Kyiv disrupted at least 10 percent of Russian refining capacity with air strikes. To hit the refinery, Ukraine used long-range Neptune missiles—the land-attack variant of the anti-ship missile that sank the Russian Black Sea Fleet’s flagship Moskva. Early in the war, the Neptune was key in deterring Russia from staging an amphibious landing to capture the Ukrainian city of Odesa. Since then Kyiv has worked to modify the projectile to enhance its deep-strike operations. The anti-ship version of the Neptune has a range of roughly 120 miles, but sources claim the long-range version can hit targets over 600 miles away. Both versions use mobile launchers to boost battlefield survivability. The new deep-strike variant’s increased operational range and highly destructive warhead are a vital boost to Ukraine’s conventional capabilities.

Ukraine Says It Hit 3 North Korean Artillery Guns In Russia’s Kur...	By Taejun Kang Ukraine said its military struck three long-range artillery guns supplied to Russia by North Korea, underlining the extent of the authoritarian Asian nation’s involvement in Russian efforts to defeat the Ukrainian counteroffensive in Kursk. The Ukrainian military said Wednesday that an aerial reconnaissance unit from the 14th Separate Drone Regiment identified the M-1978 howitzers hidden among trees and coordinated fire from Ukrainian rocket artillery. 'The M-1978 Koksan self-propelled artillery system is North Korea’s longest-range tubed artillery. Equipped with a 170mm gun, it has a range of up to 60 kilometers,' the unit said on its official Telegram channel. 'The system was originally designed with the capability to strike Seoul from the north of the demilitarized zone. Now, the Russian Armed Forces are using it in the war against Ukraine to offset their artillery losses,' it said. As many as 12,000 North Korean soldiers are in Russia to fight Ukrainian forces who occupied parts of Kursk in an August counterattack, according to the U.S. and Ukraine. Neither Pyongyang nor Moscow has acknowledged their presence. Evidence also has mounted that impoverished North Korea has supplied weaponry to Russia, likely to offset Russian artillery losses. In February, Ukraine reported that its drone squad struck a North Korean self-propelled howitzer in the Luhansk region of Ukraine. The Khortytsia, or east, group of forces said it was the first time since the start of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in 2022 that a 'very rare' North Korean M-1978 Koksan howitzer had been hit by a Ukrainian drone. A troop formation with North Korean equipment was spotted in Russia’s Tyumen region in December. It had 10 modernized Koksan howitzers known as the M-1989. South Korea said in October that the North had sent about 7,000 containers of weapons to Russia over the previous two months, bringing the total number of containers at that point to 20,000. The Washington Post this week cited Ukrainian soldiers and officials as saying that a fresh influx of North Korean troops along with air superiority, and overwhelming numerical advantage enabled Russia to recapture the town of Sudzha last week, Ukraine’s final stronghold in Kursk. The heavy reliance on North Korean forces and equipment to reclaim nearly the entire Kursk region after seven months of Ukrainian control highlights the Kremlin’s determination to regain lost territory at any cost, the newspaper reported on Tuesday. Since the signing of a mutual defense treaty in Pyongyang in June, North Korea and Russia have deepened relations across various sectors. A Russian delegation, led by Deputy Foreign Minister Andrey Rudenko, visited North Korea last week, holding meetings with North Korean Foreign Minister Choe Son Hui and Vice Foreign Minister Kim Jong Gyu. The North’s state media did not provide details, but the two sides were expected to discuss defense matters related to North Korea’s troop deployment to Russia amid a U.S.-proposed ceasefire for the war.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWcYSmgfKIdQobwW2N6rpCd5	2025-03-20T16:43:01-07:00	
Deporting Non-Citizen Protesters Sets Dangerous Precedent Of Puni...	At a time when non-citizens are being targeted and deported for engaging in lawful, nonviolent political speech protected under the First Amendment, The Rutherford Institute is warning American citizens who criticize the government that they could be next in line for punishment and retaliation. In a joint amicus brief in Mahmoud Khalil v. Donald Trump, The Rutherford Institute, FIRE and a coalition of leading civil liberties groups are challenging the Trump Administration's detention of Mahmoud Khalil, a permanent U.S. resident who was arrested, transported to a private prison, and is pending deportation based solely on his involvement in nonviolent, anti-war protest activities at Columbia University, which is protected political speech under the First Amendment. The legal coalition argues that the government's actions directly contradict the U.S. Supreme Court, which ruled in 1945 that freedom of speech is accorded to citizens and non-citizens alike who reside in the U.S., and deporting Khalil based on his peaceful, nonviolent, political speech would violate the Constitution. 'If non-citizens can be deported for engaging in lawful, nonviolent political speech, who's next? The case of Mahmoud Khalil—a lawful U.S. resident facing deportation for peaceful protest—sets a dangerous precedent for free speech rights. The First Amendment protects everyone in the U.S., but this case threatens to undermine that fundamental freedom,' said constitutional attorney John W. Whitehead, president of The Rutherford Institute and author of Battlefield America: The War on the American People. 'In other words, a threat to Khalil's rights is a threat to the rights of anyone who dares to disagree with the government.' On March 8, 2025, agents from the Department of Homeland Security ('DHS') arrested Mahmoud Khalil with no prior notice at his apartment, and initiated proceedings to deport him from the United States. At some point in the night, DHS transferred Khalil, a lawful permanent resident of the U.S., to New Jersey and later to Louisiana. Khalil, a recent graduate of Columbia University in New York City who was born to Palestinian refugees in Syria and is married to a U.S. citizen expecting their first child, was targeted by the Trump Administration because of his moral and vocal stance in opposition to Israel's military operations in Gaza. As part of his pro-Palestine advocacy, Khalil had led several Palestine-focused student groups and organized educational events about Palestine, publicly denounced antisemitism, and called on Columbia to divest from its financial ties to Israel. Notably, while the Trump administration has defended its actions by claiming that Khalil's views are contrary to America's foreign policy interests, it has not alleged that Khalil engaged in any acts of vandalism, physical violence, or unlawful occupations of buildings, which are not forms of protected speech, nor has it accused him of breaking any laws. The legal coalition's amicus brief was filed in support of Khalil's Petition for Writ of Habeas Corpus, asking for release from custody while the proceedings are pending. The amicus brief argues that deporting any non-citizen whose views are considered to be against America's foreign policy interests, as determined by the subjective judgment of a current or future Secretary of State, places free expression in mortal peril, and is similar to laws of censorial regimes in China, Russia, and Saudi Arabia. Ronnie London, Conor Fitzpatrick, Will Creeley, and others at FIRE (the Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression) advanced the arguments in the Khalil v. Trump amicus brief.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWcYSmgfKIdQoS19VPxQfGs8	2025-03-20T16:41:56-07:00	
Brazil: Central Bank Raises Interest Rate To 14.25% Per Year	By Wellton Maximo Amid rising food and energy prices and global economic uncertainties, Brazil’s Central Bank raised interest rates again. The Monetary Policy Committee (Copom) unanimously increased the Selic rate—the economy’s basic interest rate—by 1 percentage point to 14.25 percent per year. In a statement, Copom noted that external uncertainties, mainly driven by the country’s trade policy, raise doubts about the stance of the Federal Reserve (Fed—the US Central Bank). With regard to Brazil, the text states that the Brazilian economy is heating up, despite signs of moderation in growth. Copom reported that both overall and core inflation, driven by volatile prices like food and energy, are still climbing. It warned of the risk of persistent inflation in services and pledged to monitor the government’s economic policy closely. 'The committee remains attentive to how fiscal policy developments affect monetary policy and financial assets. Perceptions of the fiscal regime and debt sustainability continue to significantly influence asset prices and expectations,' the statement said. Future Selic For the upcoming meetings, Copom indicated it will raise the Selic rate 'to a lesser extent' at the May meeting, without providing further guidance on future decisions. 'Beyond the next meeting [starting in June], the Committee emphasized that the overall magnitude of the monetary tightening cycle will be determined by a firm commitment to bringing inflation to the target and will depend on the evolution of inflation dynamics,' it said. This marks the fifth consecutive Selic rate hike, bringing the rate to its highest level since October 2016, when it stood at 14.25 percent per year. The increase consolidates the ongoing cycle of monetary tightening. The basic interest rate is used in government bond trading on the Special Settlement and Custody System (Selic) and serves as a benchmark for other interest rates in the economy. Inflation The Selic is the Central Bank’s primary tool for controlling official inflation, as measured by the Broad National Consumer Price Index (IPCA). In February, the IPCA, the official inflation measure, reached 1.48 percent. As a result, the indicator has accumulated a 12-month increase of 4.87 percent, exceeding last year’s target ceiling. Under the new continuous target system, effective this month, the Central Bank’s inflation target, set by the National Monetary Council, is 3 percent, with a tolerance range of ±1.5 percentage points. This means the target’s lower limit is 1.5 percent and the upper limit is 4.5 percent. In the continuous target model, the target is calculated monthly based on inflation accumulated over the past 12 months.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWcYSmgfKIdQoU7HwURIRBmD	2025-03-20T16:39:18-07:00	
Zelenskyy Says Ukraine To Send Team For Talks With US In Saudi Ar...	(RFE/RL) -- Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said a delegation from Kyiv will hold talks with US officials in Saudi Arabia next week amid intense diplomatic efforts to bring an end to Europe's largest and deadliest conflict since World War II. During a visit to Norway on March 20, Zelenskyy said Ukraine would prepare a list of buildings and facilities to make clear what it considers to be civilian infrastructure after Kyiv and Moscow agreed to partial cease-fire During a phone call with US President Donald Trump on March 18, Russian President Vladimir Putin agreed to halt strikes on Ukrainian infrastructure, only to violate it hours later. 'I don't want to have a different understanding of what the parties would agree to,' Zelenskyy said, adding the Ukrainian delegation would not hold face-to-face talks with a Russian group of officials who will also be in Saudi Arabia on March 24. Trump and Zelenskyy spoke on March 19 to discuss the outcome of the US president's call a day earlier with Putin. Trump sought to get the Kremlin leader to agree to a 30-day cease-fire after having secured Zelenskyy's backing on condition that Russia do the same. Putin rejected a full cease-fire but accepted a halt in strikes on Ukrainian energy and civilian infrastructure, according to a US readout of the call. During his call with Zelenskyy, Trump promised to look into acquiring more Patriot air-defense missile systems for Ukraine. Meanwhile, Zelenskyy agreed not to target Russian energy assets for 30 days. Ukraine has struggled to protect its cities from Russian attacks due to a lack of air defense, and Zelenskyy wrote that another wave of strikes overnight showed Putin's comments were just 'propaganda.' 'Russian strikes on Ukraine do not stop, despite their propaganda claims. Every day and every night, nearly a hundred or more drones are launched, along with ongoing missile attacks. With each such launch, the Russians expose to the world their true attitude towards peace,' Zelenskyy wrote in a post on X on March 20. Ukraine's air force said on March 20 that its air defenses shot down 75 out of 171 drones launched by Russia in an overnight attack, with 63 other drones redirected from their targets with the use of electronic warfare. Ukraine's National Police said that at least 10 people were injured in an overnight air attack on the central Ukrainian city of Kropyvnytskiy, including four children. The strike damaged residential buildings and private homes. Several of the injured were hospitalized after receiving emergency medical care. Russia, meanwhile, said that it had downed 132 Ukrainian drones overnight, with authorities in the Saratov region confirming that an airfield close to the town of Engels, which hosts a strategic bomber base, had been set on fire. Ukraine's military confirmed it had launched an attack against the base. Russia's aviation authority Rosaviatsia also said arrivals and departures at the Samara and Saratov airports had been temporarily suspended. Zelenskyy arrived in Norway as the intensity of peace talks continues to gain momentum. 'Norway supports Ukraine in its fight to defend itself and is contributing to the effort to achieve a lasting, just peace in the country. I look forward to constructive discussions on how Norway can best provide assistance to Ukraine in both the short term and the long term,' Norwegian Prime Minister Jonas Store said at a press conference with Zelenskyy. Trump suggested during his call with Zelenskyy that the United States take ownership of Ukraine's power plants as he seeks to bridge a wide divide between Moscow and Kyiv and secure a full cease-fire. Trump told Zelenskyy that US ownership of Ukraine's electrical supply and nuclear power plants 'would be the best protection for that infrastructure,' according to a White House readout of the March 19 call. The proposal reflects Trump's belief that US ownership of Ukrainian assets would effectively serve as a security guarantee for the embattled country because Russia would presumably refrain from targeting them out of fear of escalation with the United States. Zelenskyy said he and Trump discussed the Russian-occupied Zaporizhzhya nuclear power plant in southeastern Ukraine during the phone call. He said he told Trump that Kyiv would be ready to discuss US involvement in modernizing and investing in the plant if it is returned to Ukraine. Zelenskyy, however, on March 20 dismissed the idea that the plant could be owned by the US, adding that the critical facility is officially a property of the Ukrainian people. 'If it's not under Ukrainian control, it wouldn't work for anybody. It's illegal [...] If the Americans want to take it from Russia, invest in it, and modernize it -- that's a different question,' he told journalists in Norway. Kyiv's demand for security guarantees lies at the heart of the shuttle diplomacy between Ukraine, Russia, and the United States to secure a peace deal. Zelenskyy wants any final peace deal to include Western security guarantees for Ukraine to deter Russia from invading again, but Trump has so far refused to commit the United States to the country's defense. Zelenskyy Has 'Positive' Contact With Trump Trump has made ending the war in Ukraine, which has killed or wounded more than a million people, a top priority for his administration. However, Moscow and Kyiv remain so far apart on key issues -- such as land exchanges and security guarantees for Ukraine -- that the Trump administration will need to use various carrots and sticks if it hopes to bring them together. In a social media post, Trump said the goal of his call with Zelenskyy was 'to align both Russia and Ukraine in terms of their requests and needs.' Putin has agreed to continue talks with the United States toward achieving a full cease-fire. US negotiators will meet with Ukrainian and Russian counterparts in the coming days to work on extending the partial cease-fire to the Black Sea. In a show of good faith by both sides, Russia and Ukraine on March 19 each swapped 175 prisoners in one of the largest exchanges of the war. Experts say that Putin has not given up on his goals of subjugating Ukraine and will seek to drag out the talks while his forces have the advantage on the battlefield. Russia wants to fully control the four regions of Ukraine it claims to have annexed in 2022. It would fall short of that goal were it to agree to a full-cease fire now. Trump has threatened to impose tough sanctions and tariffs on Russia if it obstructs the path toward peace deal, but experts question whether the US president would come down hard on Russia considering he values his relationship with Putin. 'Trump has shown that he can pressure Zelenskyy. Is he willing and able to pressure Putin? If not, then what is he going to do? Putin is making it clear that he’s not changing his goals,' Mark Katz, a Russia expert and professor emeritus of government and politics at George Mason University, told RFE/RL. Russia has regularly targeted Ukraine's power infrastructure with missiles and drones in an attempt to break the will of the Ukrainian people by denying them light and heat in the winter. Ukraine has often retaliated against the strikes on its power system by targeting Russian oil assets, such as refineries and storage facilities. Russia's war machine is heavily dependent on oil export revenues, which account for about a third of federal budget revenues. Residents of Kyiv told RFE/RL that they did not put much faith in the agreement between Washington and Moscow. Zelenskyy has said Ukraine is ready to send a team for further cease-fire discussions with the United States, while reiterating Kyiv will not recognize Russian sovereignty over any occupied Ukrainian territory -- a condition for any peace agreement that Putin has voiced several times.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWcYSmgfKIdQoScTq3AwOrFJ	2025-03-20T16:35:42-07:00	
How Artificial Intelligence Can Boost Productivity In Latin Ameri...	Latin America and the Caribbean has long been a region with one of the most informal labor markets. A large part of the workforce is outside of the formal economy, leaving many people without access to benefits and protections. Informal businesses are typically small, have limited access to financial and legal systems, and struggle to attract investment. They are also less likely to adopt new technologies because they lack the talent and scale that makes such innovation viable. As the Chart of the Week shows, less than half of the region’s jobs are likely to be highly impacted by AI. This is lower than for advanced economies like the United Kingdom or United States, and is mostly due to the large size of the informal sector. Overall in the region, more than half of all jobs are informal. In some countries, like Bolivia, Peru and Honduras, the share of informal jobs exceeds two-thirds, according to International Labour Organization data. The relatively low exposure to AI may help the region avoid more immediate disruptions, but countries also risk missing out on the full benefits of AI-driven economic growth, as we show in a recent working paper. Among exposed jobs, about half, such as those in healthcare, would gain from AI-enhanced productivity without major job losses. Others, like call center jobs, would face a high risk of displacement. Bringing more people into formal work will help the region fully harness AI’s potential for growth. Formalization would help more users enjoy the benefits of AI and allow workers and businesses to leverage AI for growth. Countries can encourage relatively new businesses to transition into the formal sector by expanding access to finance and streamlining regulation. Easing regulatory burdens such as occupational licensing restrictions can reduce the costs of operating in the formal sector. Providing enhanced education, training and social safety nets will equip workers to adapt to an AI-driven economy and ensure that they are not left behind. About the authors: Bas B.

Hezbollah Must Not Be Allowed To Destroy Lebanon – OpEd	By Khaled Abou Zahr The clashes that took place on the border between Syria and Lebanon this week were not the first of their kind. But the announcement of a ceasefire between the two countries following two days of deadly cross-border clashes had a different tone to it. Historically, the Lebanese Armed Forces have rarely shelled Syrian positions directly, even less those of the Syrian army. This time, the clashes were direct. We live in a rapidly changing world. Between 2012 and 2014, Syrian artillery and airstrikes hit Arsal and other Lebanese border towns, with Damascus accusing them of harboring rebels. This time, the Syrian artillery was firing because of Hezbollah. Syria accused Hezbollah of abducting and killing three Syrian soldiers near the border west of Homs. According to the Syrian authorities, the soldiers were kidnapped, taken across the border and then executed. In the past, when Bashar Assad was in power, the Lebanese army focused mainly on containing any spillover and 'policing' the situation. It would secure villages and sometimes clash with the rebels the Syrian army was targeting. It would seldom engage the Syrian forces. There was minimal retaliatory fire. But this time was different. There is a new regime in Syria and a new leadership in Lebanon. The ceasefire was brokered by Lebanese Defense Minister Michel Menassa and his Syrian counterpart, Murhaf Abu Qasra, who ensured the bodies of the three Syrian soldiers were returned to the Syrian authorities. The clashes had resulted in at least 10 deaths over the preceding days. It was Lebanese President Joseph Aoun who ordered the Lebanese army to respond to the sources of fire. And there is no doubt that preserving and defending the sovereignty of the country is his duty. The same resolve and determination now need to be applied domestically, including arresting and bringing to justice those that conducted the raid into Syria. Even if, as some reports suggest, the Syrian soldiers had crossed the border into Lebanon, it would be the responsibility of the Lebanese Armed Forces alone to act. And President Aoun has shown his will and capacity to act. Moreover, there is no doubt that the army would have dealt with any incursion professionally and lives would have been spared. This is why it is important to bring order within the borders of Lebanon. As Aoun declared in his inaugural speech, there can be only one sovereign voice in the country. Hezbollah cannot be left to operate unchecked, as it is now clear that not only can the group create destruction from the south, but also from the north. There is animosity among the new Syrian leadership and the Syrian people against Hezbollah. Let us not forget that, during the Syrian civil war — on the orders of Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps — Hezbollah played a key role in supporting the Assad regime and committed war crimes and human rights violations along the way. It was implicated in massacres and sectarian killings in Al-Qusayr in 2013. Hezbollah also participated in prolonged sieges, notably in Madaya and Zabadani, where starvation tactics were used against civilians. Moreover, it was involved in the forced displacement of Sunni-majority populations. The group engaged in torture as well as indiscriminate shelling, with a will to hit civilians. This is why, despite the ceasefire, tensions will remain high. And the same can be said of Lebanon’s south. In recent weeks, Israel has conducted multiple airstrikes, targeting Hezbollah fighters and infrastructure. According to reports, several Hezbollah members have been killed, including in drone strikes near Kfar Kila and Borj El-Mlouk. It is now clear that Hezbollah is cornered and is trying to do the same to Lebanon once again. It is also clear to Hezbollah and the IRGC that their capacity to act has been destroyed. With their supply lines from Syria closed and any air support under closer surveillance, the group is facing decrepitude. It is no longer able to conduct any meaningful, long-term military campaigns. But it can still bring meaningful, long-term destruction to Lebanon. Moreover, the risks of a spillover and outside interference grow every day. If Hezbollah is left unchecked, then we may have to ask — in this changed geopolitical environment — how long it will be before local groups seek foreign support to face it. This would lead to a new civil war that could destroy Lebanon once and for all. This is why Aoun needs to build national support and a clear path needs to be laid out for the surrender of Hezbollah’s arsenal. There can be only one army; there can be only one sovereign voice. Moreover, Hezbollah and all collaborators with the Assad regime need to be brought to justice. Lebanon needs to do what it failed to do in 2005, when Syrian troops exited the country: an equivalent of the Vichy trials in France following the Second World War. Lebanon has a new leadership, but in reality it needs a new political system. And this can only be done if those responsible for treason and violent crimes are brought to justice. What is clear for now is that the dangers circling the country will not wait for too long. And Hezbollah cannot be allowed to draw Lebanon into the equation of 'upon me and upon my enemies.' Moreover, it is for Lebanon’s leadership to act swiftly against Hezbollah, as this is the only way to impose full sovereignty and warn others of the country’s resolve.

He is CEO of EurabiaMedia and editor of Al-Watan Al-Arabi.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWcYSmgfKIdQoazgFHcqJhfS	2025-03-20T16:31:24-07:00	
Spain: A Buoyant Economy, Marred By An Overheated Property Market...	By William Chislett Spain had a good 2024, earning it the accolade of the ‘best-performing rich-world economy’ from The Economist, based on its GDP growth, the rise in share prices, inflation, unemployment and the primary balance. This year also looks healthy except for the growing crisis over the lack of housing. The economy grew more than 3%, four times the euro zone average, the IBEX-35 share index rose 14.2% (almost double that of Euro Stoxx), inflation was 2.8%, the jobless rate of around 11% was the lowest in 17 years (but almost double the euro-zone average) and the primary balance (the difference between government revenue and its non-interest spending) was only slightly negative. In short, the year turned out not only to be far better than the opposition and doom mongers had confidently predicted, but also much better than expected by independent observers. The strong growth was fuelled by: another record year for tourism, with 94 million arrivals, nine million more than in 2023; a high level of household savings, built up since the COVID pandemic, now deployed for consumer spending; a real increase in wages (the minimum monthly wage of 14 payments rose 54% between 2018 and 2024 to €1,134) and the arrival of large tranches of the EU’s Next Generation funds. The current account, buoyed by both tourism and non-tourism services, has been in surplus for more than a decade, and is only surpassed by Germany among the EU’s largest economies. Bond yields dipped below those of France for the first time since 2007. Carlos Cuerpo, the Economy Minister, believes Spain will achieve its first primary surplus since 2007 this year. The Bank of Spain forecasts lower but still brisk growth this year of 2.5%, with domestic demand still strong (see Figure 1). Figure 1. Macroeconomic forecasts, 2024 and 2025 (%) 20242025GDP growth3.12.5Domestic demand (contribution to growth)2.62.6Net external demand (contribution to growth)0.5-0.1Consumer inflation2.92.1Unemployment rate11.510.8Fiscal balance-3.4-2.9Current account balance4.14.2Public debt (% of GDP)103.1102.6Source: Bank of Spain, 17/XII/2024. But for the rise in the working population the unemployment rate would have dropped below 10% for the first time since the first quarter of 2008 at the height of the last economic boom. That ended with the spectacular bursting of an immense real-estate bubble and an ensuing recession which saw unemployment peak at 27% in the first quarter of 2013. Spain’s jobless rate is now less than half that dreadful figure, although the 2.5 million people registered as unemployed at the end of 2024 still accounted for 19% of the EU’s total. Spain’s population surged from 47.4 million in 2021 to 48.8 million in July 2024, almost entirely due to immigration as the country’s fertility rate of 1.3 children per woman is far short of the 2.1 at which existing population levels would be maintained. Foreigners now account for more than 15% of the work force in 20 of Spain’s 50 provinces, and for more than 20% in five of them. In the face of Spain’s rapidly ageing population, the government plans to legalise around 300,000 undocumented migrants per year over the next three years, even as other EU countries such as Germany and Italy seek to tighten border controls. ‘Spain needs to choose between being an open and prosperous country or a closed-off, poor country’, said Socialist Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez. ‘It’s as simple as that’. The reform, set to come into force as of May, aims to simplify legal and administrative procedures for work and residence permits. Immigrants, however, have become one of Spaniards’ main concerns: 57% said there were already too many, according to the pollster 40dB. The rise in the foreign-born population to more than 9 million (19% of the total population) is exerting pressure on an already tight housing market. Other factors are tourist demand, lower interest rates for mortgages, greater job creation and more disposable income. Far outstripping the growth in real wages, average house prices have risen 56% since 2014, by when Spain had recovered from its Great Recession. The lack of housing at affordable prices, now one of Spaniards’ main concerns, is the result of more than a decade of both the conservative Popular Party and the Socialists, when in power, paying little more than lip service to the problem. The Bank of Spain’s 2023 annual report said there were a staggering four million empty properties including those not sold, those in a bad state and those which were second, third or more properties that were hardly used and which the owner preferred not to rent because of legal uncertainty. With the population rising by more than 500,000 a year, an estimated 250,000 new homes are needed every year but fewer than half this number are being built. Many construction companies went to the wall after the bursting of the real-estate bubble as of 2008. Those that survived or restarted are now much more cautious. At that time, the housing offer far exceeded demand. In 2006 the number of housing starts (664,923) was more than that of Germany, France and Italy combined (it dropped to 29,232 in 2013 and then began to rise slowly). Now, with Spain’s population 2.4 million higher than in 2008, demand far exceeds the offer, overheating the real-estate market mainly in urban areas. The lack of offer has sparked protests in parts of the country hit by overtourism, notably the Canary and Balearic Islands and Málaga, where young adults are angry at being priced out of the property market because more and more flats and shops are being converted into accommodation for exclusive use by tourists. The rise in rents has produced an increase in flat shares. According to the real-estate portal Idealista, close to 50 people in Málaga compete for each advertised room. ‘Demand will remain strong and this will be reflected in prices and in widespread discontent’, said Santiago Carbó, professor of Economics at the University of Valencia. Spain’s stock of social rental dwellings (estimated at around a paltry 2.5% of the total housing stock) is almost the lowest among the 38 OECD countries. In the Netherlands it is 35%. Spain is the country with the highest percentage of tenants at risk of poverty or social exclusion in the EU. The proportion of homes owned by those under 35 dropped from 15% in 2002 to 7% in 2022. Largely because of this, Spaniards only leave home on average at the age of 30 (the EU average is 26). The government is to set up a public housing body to manage and build social rental dwellings. It will take over the 40,000 properties from Sareb, the company created in 2012 to manage and sell the troubled assets of the many rescued and collapsed banks. The financial cost of the 2008-14 banking crisis is estimated at around €80 billion. The government has also scrapped the so-called ‘golden visa’ scheme, started in 2013, granting residency rights to non-EU citizens who invested at least €500,000 in real estate. Other proposed measures include a 100% tax on real-estate purchases for buyers from non-EU countries, higher taxes on Airbnb-style holiday rentals, a programme to refurbish vacant housing and public guarantees for landlords who provide ‘affordable’ rentals. ‘In 2023 alone, non-residents from outside the EU bought 27,000 houses and flats’, said Sánchez. ‘Not to live in them, but mainly to speculate. Something that, in the context of the shortages we are experiencing, we cannot afford.’ The 27,000 purchases account for a miniscule 0.1% of the total 27 million homes. The Bank of Spain says 1.5 million social rental dwellings are needed to bring the country up to the EU average (7% of the housing stock). Providing them will be a Herculean task. It will also require much closer cooperation between the central, regional and municipal governments. The housing policies of the conservative Popular Party, which controls 11 of the 17 regional governments, are much less interventionist than those of the Socialists. Equally demanding will be meeting the incoming US President Donald Trump’s call to boost defence spending to a whopping 5% of GDP. Spain’s spending (1.28%) is already far from NATO’s 2% target set in 2014 for 2024 (Spain aimed to reach that target in 2029). Its spending is the lowest among the 32 members of the alliance (see Figure 2). Figure 2. Defence spending, 2014 and 2024 estimates (% of GDP) 20142024Poland1.844.26US3.383.71UK2.142.28Germany1.192.12France1.822.06Italy1.141.49Spain0.921.28Source: NATO. As regards the green transition, Spain is quite advanced in the use of renewable energy (56% of electricity in 2024 was generated by renewables). But it is a laggard in adopting fully electric vehicles: only 5% of cars sold last year were electric compared with 16% in Portugal. Spain has just over 41,000 charging points, double the number of Portugal, but its population is more than four times greater and its surface area five and a half times larger. Portugal also offers greater incentives including a full VAT deduction for cars below a certain price. Lastly, negotiations between Spain, the EU, the UK and Gibraltar on the post-Brexit status of the British Overseas Territory within the EU, which started in October 2021, are still not concluded. Failure to achieve a solution could at some unspecified point mean a hard border between the Rock and Spain instead of the desired common travel area between Gibraltar and the EU’s passport-free Schengen area. Gibraltar voted overwhelmingly in favour of remaining in the EU. A major sticking point is Spain’s request to have its border police or similar on Gibraltarian soil. Gibraltar views this as an erosion of its sovereignty. As a deal envisages no more checks between the two sides, the Rock’s port and airport would effectively become gateways to Spain and the wider Schengen area. A foretaste of the impact of no agreement was seen last October when Spanish police briefly and erroneously re-established border controls. This caused long queues of rush-hour workers on foot, as well as cars, on both sides of the frontier as Gibraltar, in response, also asked to see passports and not just EU ID cards. Around 15,000 cross-border workers enter Gibraltar daily. It is very much in the interests of both parties to reach an agreement and not be caught between a rock and a hard place, leaving undesired consequences on both sides of the border.

RedNote Walks China’s Digital Tightrope – Analysis	By Xiangyu Ma and Jiawei Zhang RedNote, a once little-known app outside of China, gained international attention in January 2025. When the United States banned TikTok, one million US users flocked to the Chinese-owned platform in just two days. RedNote blends social networking with e-commerce and draws over 3.4 million daily active users. Unexpectedly, RedNote has become a bridge for US–China cultural exchanges. Under the hashtag ‘TikTok refugees’, US and Chinese netizens greet each other, exchange memes and swap outfit tips. Even after US President Donald Trump lifted the TikTok ban, many chose to stay. Experts warn of data and national security risks, but some brush them aside. To these users, Silicon Valley also has privacy abuses, and Washington’s digital Cold War rhetoric is under increasing scrutiny. RedNote’s novelty and rare sense of cross-border connection make it worth staying. In China, Western social media such as Facebook, Instagram and X are inaccessible. Even on Chinese platforms, large-scale interaction between Chinese and international users is nearly impossible. This results from China’s prevailing regulatory model for Chinese social media platforms — ‘one app, two systems’ — one version tailored for domestic users, another for the global market, such as TikTok/Douyin, WeChat/Weixin and Kwai/Kuaishou. The domestic versions adapt to China’s unique legal environment, featuring tighter censorship, screen time limits for minors and localised data storage. Some speculate that China will follow the old playbook, splitting RedNote into two systems to curb foreign influence. But Beijing might reconsider this approach. The ‘one app, two systems’ model is Beijing’s go-to strategy in regulating social media. On the one hand, the government places regime stability above all else. It has hardened information control by erecting internet firewalls, enforcing real-name registration and mandating the display of users’ locations. In doing so, it seeks to seal off domestic users from the global internet, where its reach is limited and uncensored narratives proliferate. On the other hand, China is eager to extend its influence abroad. Social media platforms such as TikTok are treated as cultural exports, subtly shaping how the world views China while advancing its technological and economic ambitions. RedNote is currently an outlier — both Chinese and US netizens are in the same system. But this is not how it was meant to operate. Originally aimed at domestic urban users and Chinese diasporas, RedNote had not developed an English version or a separate international system. The sudden influx of foreign users has already brought complications, including how best to respond to foreigners’ thorny questions about the relationship between mainland China and Hong Kong. These interactions, regardless of how small, tread on issues that Beijing wants to keep off the table. Lacking clear guidelines from above, RedNote has resorted to hiring more English-language moderators. Its real concern is how long, and to what extent, Chinese regulators will tolerate a borderless RedNote. Beijing’s ultimate goal is to restore the tightly controlled information cocoon woven for Chinese users. But how authorities plan to achieve this goal with RedNote remains an open question. Beijing’s most intuitive regulatory response would be to adopt the default model — split RedNote into two systems. But this time, the old formula collides with China’s latest rhetoric shift. With Trump back in office, Beijing wants to cast itself as a defender of globalisation. This shift was evident when Foreign Ministry spokesman Guo Jiakun responded to RedNote’s sudden surge abroad — ‘As a principle, China has consistently supported and encouraged cultural exchanges to foster mutual understanding worldwide’. Splitting RedNote would undercut this message. A more adaptive regulatory approach would use AI-enabled censorship to avoid splitting RedNote. By sorting users based on language and IP address, the platform could discreetly channel specific content to targeted users. This idea has already surfaced in Chinese policy discourse. At one of Shanghai’s annual political meetings in January 2025, a delegate called for expanding AI’s role in social media content control. This approach could also incorporate other subtle restrictions on foreign users’ content, such as disabling RedNote’s copy-and-paste function and translation tool. The adaptive approach aligns more with China’s current policy goals. China’s external propaganda machines have toiled to ‘tell China’s story well’. Yet state efforts to reshape its international image via Western social media have been largely unsuccessful, with persistent struggles overcoming scepticism. With RedNote connecting Chinese and international users directly, Beijing has a rare chance to demonstrate its self-claimed openness. A globally integrated RedNote also enables Beijing to sharpen its AI tools for information control. Over the past decade, China has been doubling down on algorithmic governance. A major part of such efforts is requiring AI-enabled content moderation to adhere to ‘core socialist values’. Such vague censorship guidelines demand continual adaptation of AI algorithms. RedNote offers a larger testing ground for AI-driven information control technologies. A more adaptive regulatory strategy — combining AI censorship with subtle restrictions — allows China to project its soft power while preserving its information bubble. Beijing might hesitate before opting to split RedNote. This mass user movement is also a wake-up call for both Beijing and Washington that users will always gravitate towards the platforms of their choice. Instead of controlling information flow, a better, more sustainable path forward is to foster a robust marketplace of ideas.

Does Germany’s ‘Whatever It Takes’ Fiscal Stimulus Come At The Co...	By Wei Hongxu Amidst the concerns over the possibility that the U.S. economy may fall into recession, European stock markets have performed better than U.S. stocks this year, despite the ongoing economic downturn. Market institutions believe that Europe has been shielded from the impact of U.S. President Donald Trump’s tariffs, which has led investors to turn to European stocks as a way to hedge risks and diversify. Recently, the new German government introduced a large-scale fiscal stimulus plan aimed at increasing defense spending and infrastructure development, which has sparked hope in the market about the future of the European economy. To stimulate the economy, newly elected German Chancellor Friedrich Merz has departed from traditional fiscal conservatism, vowing to do 'whatever it takes' and seeking to relax the restrictions of Germany's constitutional 'debt brake', increasing defense spending, and boosting infrastructure investment. This has led to market optimism regarding large-scale fiscal stimulus in European countries, with European defense industry stocks seeing significant rises. However, the European stock markets have not been able to maintain their previous momentum. European benchmark indices have been on a continuous decline, with the STOXX 600 index down 4.4% from its record high on March 3, although this decline is about half of the S&P 500’s drop since its February peak. Despite the differences compared to the U.S. stock market, the ongoing decline in European stocks reflects the impact of the U.S. economy’s drag and the potential for higher U.S. tariffs, which seem to be outweighing the positive effects of Germany's fiscal stimulus. According to researchers at ANBOUND, these changes in European stocks largely reflect the market’s expectations for Europe’s economic outlook. While Germany's unprecedented large-scale fiscal stimulus may provide short-term relief for the European economy, in the medium to long term, the debt 'gray rhino' facing Europe’s economy and capital markets still looms large. Considering the potential for a U.S.-EU trade war, Europe's economic outlook remains bleak in the face of both internal and external challenges. In fact, the European Central Bank’s (ECB) continued interest rate cuts and Germany’s large-scale fiscal stimulus are both a response to the persistent economic downturn in Europe. In February, the eurozone’s year-on-year CPI growth slowed to 2.4%, marking the first decline in five months. While inflation in the services sector remains relatively sticky, the overall decline in inflation indicates that demand is cooling. The ECB’s latest economic forecast for the eurozone has lowered its 2025 growth outlook from 1.1% to 0.95%, also revising down its growth projections for 2026 and 2027. ECB President Christine Lagarde has emphasized that, due to trade tensions, growth risks remain tilted to the downside. Particularly, Germany and France, as the two economic powerhouses of the eurozone, have seen poor economic performance in recent years, with Germany experiencing negative growth for two consecutive years. In this context, Germany has shifted its long-standing policy of fiscal conservatism and opted for large-scale fiscal stimulus. This decision, aside from security considerations, is largely driven by the aim to reverse economic stagnation. Some analyses suggest that fiscal expansion could boost Germany’s GDP by 0.7-1 percentage points in 2025. This would lift Germany’s GDP growth for 2025 from 0.3%, according to the Bloomberg consensus forecast, to above 1%. In 2024, Germany accounted for 28% of the eurozone's GDP, meaning that the country’s fiscal expansion could contribute 0.2-0.3 percentage points to the eurozone’s GDP growth in 2025. At the same time, this actually pushes up Germany's inflation by about 0.2 percentage points. As a result, the effectiveness of the policy is somewhat diminished. Crucially, half of the additional fiscal easing in Germany is allocated to defense-related spending, and Europe still relies on purchasing defense equipment from abroad. For instance, according to the Draghi report on EU competitiveness, 78% of the EU’s defense procurement comes from outside the EU, with 63% sourced from the U.S. While this helps reduce Germany's trade surplus with the U.S., it contributes little to Germany’s manufacturing sector. Similarly, the current political fragmentation in Germany, along with the rising geopolitical risks from the Russia-Ukraine conflict, has led to rising costs for businesses, labor shortages, and a decline in public services and government efficiency. These factors are contributing to the outsourcing of Germany's manufacturing industry. However, addressing these supply-side issues cannot be quickly achieved simply by 'spending money'. An article in the Financial Times on March 7 asked, 'Can Germany spend its way out of industrial decline?'. The article described how Germany, a country that has long adhered to conservatism, is now pushing for the most dramatic policy shift. It also mentioned that many are strongly skeptical of the reforms, believing that long-standing issues such as administrative inefficiency are deeply entrenched. Expanding expenditures while simultaneously pushing for structural reforms is likened to performing open heart surgery 'while it is pumping', which would put enormous pressure on German society. Moreover, Germany’s large-scale fiscal stimulus will influence inflation, which in turn affects the monetary policy. If inflation eases as the market expects, the ECB is likely to slow down its interest rate cuts. Additionally, the risk of stagflation narrows the policy space for the ECB, meaning it will adopt a more cautious approach going forward. At the same time, there are significant external factors, such as Trump’s tariff policies, adding to considerable uncertainty. If the structural imbalances in the economy are not effectively addressed, increased fiscal stimulus that drives up demand could lead Germany and the broader European economy toward a 'stagflationary' divide. These factors suggest that the policy effects of Germany’s fiscal shift may not be as optimistic as the market anticipates. A senior researcher at ANBOUND noted that Germany's productivity factors have not yet returned, and during the era of globalization, many businesses and industries have already shifted abroad. Relying solely on fiscal expansion now may have a limited impact. This fiscal monetization will eventually translate into debt, and its contribution to long-term growth is limited, as it lacks an industrial foundation. Unless these industrial foundations can be restored, which will undoubtedly take more than a few years, the long-term benefits will be minimal. A more serious issue is that Germany's increased fiscal stimulus and expanded deficits will largely rely on issuing sovereign debt to raise funds. The larger the stimulus plan, the more sovereign debt needs to be issued, which will inevitably lead to higher German sovereign bond yields. This not only increases future government interest expenses but also puts pressure on the European sovereign debt market, further complicating the already precarious financial situation of some EU member states that are burdened with high debt levels. On March 12, the yield on Germany’s 10-year government bonds rose to 2.93%, the highest level since October 2023. Since the beginning of this month, the yield on Germany's 10-year bonds has increased by a cumulative 53 basis points, and analysts have raised their forecast for German bond yields to 3%. Over the past week, the yields on Spain and Italy's 10-year bonds have rapidly risen by around 40 basis points. Financial institutions like Goldman Sachs believe that the rapid rise in European bond yields and fiscal expansion led by Germany may soon face a severe test. Indeed, the risk of European sovereign debt has become a long-term 'gray rhino'. Germany’s fiscal stimulus plan means that eurozone countries will ease fiscal constraints, leading to a continued widening of fiscal deficits and further loss of control over sovereign debt. The ECB previously issued a Financial Stability Review report warning that the sovereign debt risk in the eurozone is rising, threatening financial stability. The report highlighted that, due to some member states’ weak fiscal fundamentals, rising debt levels, and persistent budget deficits, along with low long-term growth prospects and increasing policy uncertainty, the market is becoming more concerned about the sustainability of eurozone sovereign debt. The report also pointed out that macroeconomic shocks could significantly increase government financing costs. It warned, 'interest costs are set to rise further and weigh on government finances for many years to come'. Data from the end of the second quarter of 2024 indicated that the EU’s public debt-to-GDP ratio was 81.5%. At the same time, the most heavily indebted EU countries were Greece (163.6% of GDP), followed by Italy (137%) and France (112.1%). According to EU estimates, by 2034, France’s interest payments will more than double, surpassing 4% of GDP, while Italy’s interest payments are expected to rise by nearly one-third, reaching 6% of GDP. Furthermore, rising geopolitical uncertainty could mean additional burdens for sovereign nations, making it more difficult for governments to meet rising defense needs and the investment required to address climate change. This is particularly challenging for countries with high levels of public debt, as these nations have less fiscal space to support the economy in the face of adverse shocks. Meanwhile, the U.S. government recently announced a 25% tariff on imported steel products, and the EU has since proposed retaliatory measures. The worsening of external trade conflicts can only make things worse for the European economy. On March 4, online media Project Syndicate published an article by economist Desmond Lachman titled 'Will Trump Trigger a Eurozone Debt Crisis?', which warns that in Italy and France, the ratio of public debt to GDP is currently higher than it was during the eurozone sovereign debt crisis from 2010 to 2012, making a sustainable path forward difficult. The U.S. government may realize that its tariff policy—part of the 'America First' agenda—could trigger an economic recession in Europe and a eurozone debt crisis. A senior researcher at ANBOUND had previously noted that a Greek-style debt crisis may be looming. European countries' debt repayment is subject to clear legal constraints, but now, due to political reasons and the need to fend off right-wing criticism, many governments are rolling out plans to increase fiscal spending, including boosting defense spending and infrastructure projects. These actions suggest that a debt crisis in Europe is likely to emerge in the future. In this context, Germany’s fiscal policy, with its massive stimulus approach, may come at the cost of increasing sovereign debt risks for the entire region. Final analysis conclusion: Germany's shift towards large-scale fiscal stimulus, while boosting short-term demand, will bring some negative consequences. Particularly for European countries that have long been plagued by sovereign debt issues, this could lead to the erosion of fiscal constraints across EU nations and drive up sovereign bond yields. Combined with the impact of Trump's tariff policy, this will further exacerbate the risk of sovereign debt in Europe, being one of the costs associated with Germany’s fiscal push.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWeQzS3TUXLMg38W0jyQToUO	2025-03-18T16:53:32-07:00	
Thailand: Efforts To Bring About Ramadan Ceasefire Fall Apart In ...	By Don Pathan When it comes to the conflict in Thailand’s far South, there may be no peace talks in sight but there’s been plenty of action. A spike in violence in the border region in recent days was a jolting reminder that the Thai government’s uncompromising position on the peace talks with Barisan Revolusi Nasional (BRN) rebels comes with a cost. Starting on the night of March 8, Separatist combatants launched a spate of attacks that left six people dead through March 10. The violence occurred just days after Malaysian Facilitator Mohd Rabin Basir forwarded BRN counter-demands for a Ramadan ceasefire to the Thai side. Some of the demands included the release of BRN prisoners, reducing the number of days for a truce to 15, appointing a team of international experts to monitor the truce, and permitting local NGOs to have a role in working on this initiative. Deputy Prime Minister Phumtham Wechayachai rejected all of them, insisting that BRN should display their goodwill gesture by standing down during Ramadan. The shuttle diplomacy to get the two sides to embrace a ceasefire started in mid-February when the National Security Council chief Chatchai Bangchuad met with BRN chief negotiator Anas Abdulrahman in Malaysia to discuss an NSC proposal that included a Ramadan-time ceasefire. Chatchai was appointed the chief negotiator for the peace talks by the government of Prime Minister Srettha Thavisin. But his position was automatically terminated after the Constitutional Court removed Srettha and his government from power. On Feb. 28, NSC issued a public statement saying their agency and the regional Internal Security Operation Command would do their utmost to create an atmosphere conducive for peace during this Ramadan. 'The government will adjust its work missions to focus on peaceful operations and facilitations as the main principle so that the people can fully practice their religious activities in the area,' the NSC said in the statement. According to a BRN source, who spoke on condition of anonymity, Thailand equates the Feb. 28 statement as their proclamation of a unilateral ceasefire for this year’s Ramadan. The source suggested that it was in BRN’s best interest to do the same. But this shuttle diplomacy didn’t start with the mid-February meeting in Kuala between Chatchai and Anas but through a December 2024 public statement by Nikmatullah Bin Seri, a senior member of the BRN’s negotiating team who criticized the Thai government for dragging its feet on the peace talks. Nikmatullah said BRN was prepared to walk away from the peace process and take back the group’s decision to negotiate with Bangkok under the Thai constitution. The BRN official said conflict resolution, including Ramadan ceasefire, needed to be discussed with a new government chief negotiator, which the Thai government has yet to appoint. However, Phumtham told reporters on March 12 that the new chief negotiator for the peace talks with BRN would not be appointed until a comprehensive strategic plan for the restive southern provinces was finalized. According to a Thai official working on conflict resolution for the far South, the government will not appoint a new negotiating team until BRN curbs the violence. BRN said that demanding them to put down their weapons before coming to the negotiation table was like putting the cart before the horse. Reduction of violence is something that has to be negotiated, preferably with a government-appointed negotiator, BRN said, according to the Thai official. Phumtham also plans to stop international peace and conflict experts from other countries from continuing to observe the high-level negotiations between Thailand and BRN, the Thai source said. Moreover, back channels will be eliminated, thus ending the role of international NGOs. Observers of the peace process said they were not surprised about why BRN refused to give in to the suggestions made to them by Thailand on Feb. 18. First of all, said Artef Sohko, president of The Patani, a political action group dedicated to the right to self-determination for the people of this historically contested region, Thailand has always tried to use a Ramadan ceasefire for short-term political gains. BRN feels that Thailand is using the peace talks as an intelligence-gathering exercise so they can go after these BRN leaders at a later date, Artef told me. BRN said they still recalled how the Thai Army belittled their unilateral ceasefire during the COVID-19 pandemic in response to a call for a global ceasefire from U.N. Secretary-General António Guterres. It was an opportunity missed; the Thai side could have reciprocated BRN’s gesture of goodwill and built on that, Artef said. Instead, the Thai Army in the far South unleashed search-and-destroy operations, taking down combatants in a series of lopsided standoffs as they were laying low in the home village during the unilateral ceasefire. What was astonishing in the view of the many security officials was that, despite being outnumbered by 60 to 70 to one, all but one of the combatants chose to fight to death rather than surrender, even though their chances of making it out alive were slim to none. A total of 60 BRN combatants were killed in the standoffs during that 2-year window, which covered early 2020 to early 2022. But not much came out of this brief episode during Ramadan 2022. Since then, BRN has refused to entertain Thailand’s proposals for a Ramadan ceasefire because they see it as something purely for Thai public consumption. While Ramadan carries a religious significance for Muslims worldwide, the Malays of Patani are reminded of the Tak Bai massacre, an incident during Ramadan in October 2004, when 78 young Malay Muslims died in the back of Thai military trucks, where they were bound and stacked up like logs after being rounded up during a protest. Another seven were shot dead by Thai security forces at the protest site in Tak Bai district, Narathiwat province. Just months before the 20-year statute of limitation expired, a Narathiwat court charged a group of Thai military officials for the death of unarmed demonstrators. But law enforcement officials were not able to bring any of the suspects to court and the statute of limitation for the case was permitted to expire. More than two weeks have passed since the start of Ramadan 2025. A truce is still nowhere in sight as the rebels crank up their campaign of violence to get the Thais back to the negotiating table.

The Nicaraguan Canal: A Potentially Revolutionary Maritime Passag...	After Donald Trump took office in January, the issue of the Panama Canal was once again brought to the forefront. Trump has, on multiple occasions, expressed his intention for the United States to regain control over the canal from Panama. It is worth recalling that under the Panama Canal Treaty of 1977, the U.S. relinquished control of the canal to Panama. The agreement was signed by U.S. President Jimmy Carter and Panamanian dictator Omar Torrijos and came into effect in 1999. According to the treaty, passage through the canal had to remain free, and the U.S. retained the right to defend its neutrality. Disputes Over the Panama Canal However, Trump has expressed a desire for America to take back control of the canal, arguing that U.S. ships are being 'heavily' taxed and claiming that China has effectively taken over the canal’s administration. This is not entirely true, as the canal is managed by the Panama Canal Authority (ACP), an agency of the Panamanian government responsible for operating and maintaining the waterway. Nevertheless, China does have significant influence over the canal. Chinese companies, such as Hutchison Ports, control key ports near the canal, increasing China's presence in the region. China is a major trading partner of both Panama and the U.S. The Trump administration, led by Secretary of State Marco Rubio, exerted considerable pressure to exempt U.S. ships from transit fees and to persuade Panama to withdraw from China’s Belt and Road Initiative. The question remains whether any of these proposals will materialize. It is possible that the fees for American ships may be reduced while Panama and China continue their cooperation, even if Panama formally withdraws from China’s grandiose project. Panama is a stable Latin American democracy and an important U.S. partner in the region. This was evident in Panama’s 2024 announcement to curb illegal immigration through the Darién Gap between Panama and Colombia. Additionally, Panama refused to recognize Nicolás Maduro as the president of Venezuela. However, the disputes over the Panama Canal open up the possibility of finally realizing an alternative maritime passage connecting the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans: the Nicaraguan Canal. Nicaragua – A Socialist Dictatorship of One Family Unlike Panama, Nicaragua is its complete opposite. While Panama is a democracy aligned with the U.S., Nicaragua is not. It is essentially a one-party state where absolute power is concentrated in the hands of President Daniel Ortega, who leans towards the East. The leftist president has been in power since 2007, and as of this year, he serves as co-president alongside his wife, Rosario Murillo. Many observers label Ortega a dictator, which he essentially is, given that he has consolidated control over all aspects of governance. The fact that his wife is co-president speaks volumes—it is a de facto family dictatorship. Ortega is a former Sandinista guerrilla who served as president from 1980 to 1985. During that time, he fought against the Contra rebels, who were financed and trained by the United States. In 1990, he lost the elections but returned to power 17 years later, securing a decisive electoral victory. Ortega’s triumph was part of the so-called 'Pink Tide,' led by Hugo Chávez. Nicaragua aligned itself with the leftist bloc of Latin American nations and joined organizations such as CELAC and ALBA. The positive aspects of Ortega’s regime include advancements in social programs, poverty reduction, and increased access to healthcare and education, which have improved the standard of living for many citizens. Infrastructure projects, such as new road construction and investments in the energy sector, have been key to the country’s development. Ortega has garnered support from parts of the rural population who have benefited from agrarian reforms and subsidies. Ortega’s Repression and Eastern Alliances However, over time, Ortega’s regime has become increasingly repressive. Waves of mass street protests erupted across Nicaragua from 2014 to 2020. The government violently suppressed these demonstrations, resulting in hundreds of deaths and injuries. Dissidents were imprisoned, and it is estimated that more than 30,000 citizens fled to Costa Rica and other countries. Ortega amended the constitution to ensure his political survival, and in 2021, he won another election—one widely condemned internationally for its lack of transparency and suppression of the opposition. Although Ortega frequently invokes socialist ideals, critics accuse him of personal enrichment and close ties to corporate interests. His government maintains strong relationships with Venezuela, Cuba, Russia, and China while distancing itself from traditional Western allies. In foreign policy, Ortega consistently opposes U.S. influence, while domestically, he controls most media outlets and restricts access to independent information. Despite these criticisms, Ortega’s regime continues to enjoy support from the country's poorer populations. Initial Attempts to Build the Canal The idea of a canal through Nicaragua has been considered for centuries but has never materialized. The U.S.-Panama conflict creates new opportunities, especially if Panama succumbs to U.S. pressure and restricts Chinese interests. The concept of constructing a canal through Nicaragua to connect the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans dates back to the colonial era. The earliest proposals for such a canal can be found as early as the 16th century. The Spanish colonial administration recognized that such a canal would facilitate trade between Europe and the western part of South America and strengthen control over colonial territories. Although the Spanish conducted surveys in the mid-16th and 18th centuries, construction never began due to Spain's financial difficulties. In fact, the Spanish crown was in severe financial distress. The Federal Republic of Central America drafted a canal route through Nicaragua in 1825 and sought funding from the United States. However, the U.S. refused due to the region's political instability and concerns that the British might seize control of the passage. In the mid-19th century, French ruler Napoleon III proposed constructing a canal using the San Juan River as an access route to Lake Nicaragua/Cocibolca. Around the same time, American businessman Cornelius Vanderbilt also considered building the canal, but the project was thwarted by civil war and the occupation of Nicaragua by American adventurer William Walker. In the early 1890s, an attempt to construct the Nicaraguan Canal was led by the American company Nicaragua Canal Construction Company. However, as workers cleared the land along the canal’s planned route, many fell ill and were hospitalized due to tropical diseases such as malaria. In 1899, the U.S. government established a Canal Commission to examine two possible routes—one through Nicaragua and the other through Panama. The commission's report, published in 1901, favored the Nicaraguan route. However, the U.S. Senate voted for the Panamanian route, largely due to the declining property value of land owned by the French company New Panama Canal. Additionally, the completion of the railway in Panama between 1904 and 1914 increased Panama’s appeal. Attempts to Build the Canal After 1914 The Panama Canal was opened in 1914, but this did not mark the end of plans for a canal through Nicaragua. It is not surprising, given that a Nicaraguan canal would shorten the maritime route between New York and San Francisco by approximately 800 kilometers compared to the Panama Canal. The geographical location of Nicaragua allows for a more direct route between the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans. The Nicaraguan route would reduce sailing time and fuel costs for ships traveling between the east and west coasts of the United States. By the late 1920s, the U.S. seriously considered constructing the canal, but the Great Depression ended that attempt. Between 1939 and 1940, while World War II was ongoing in Europe, a new study was conducted for the construction of a barge canal. Three variations were considered, with minimum canal depths of 1.8 meters, 3.0 meters, and 3.7 meters. The idea of a large-scale canal, with some excavation to be carried out using atomic bombs, was revived in the 1960s as part of the Plowshare project. However, this attempt was also abandoned. The HKND (Hong Kong Nicaragua Canal Development) project was an ambitious initiative proposed in 2013 under the leadership of Chinese entrepreneur Wang Jing. The plan called for the construction of a 278-kilometer canal connecting the Caribbean Sea to the Pacific Ocean via Lake Cocibolca. The project was also set to include additional infrastructure such as ports, airports, and free trade zones, with an estimated cost exceeding $50 billion. The Nicaraguan government granted HKND a 50-year concession, with the possibility of extending it for another 50 years, sparking controversy. The project faced strong opposition from environmental organizations, which warned of potential ecological devastation. Skeptics questioned the project's feasibility, arguing that Wang Jing lacked both financial resources and political support from Beijing. After years of stagnation, the HKND concession was revoked in May 2024. Although initial work on the route had begun, the canal was never built. The Latest Proposals In mid-November, President Daniel Ortega presented the idea of constructing a transoceanic Nicaraguan Canal at the 17th China-Latin America and Caribbean Business Summit in Managua. The proposed 445-kilometer canal would serve as an alternative to the overburdened and politically strained Panama Canal. Approximately 6% of global maritime trade passes through the Panama Canal, which has been struggling with low water levels and ship congestion. These issues have resulted in significant delays and increased costs. The Panama Canal recorded a 29% drop in traffic in the last fiscal year due to drought. Specifically, from October 2023 to September 2024, only 9,944 vessels passed through the canal, compared to 14,080 in the previous year. At the major summit attended by representatives from 29 countries, Ortega presented the latest version of the canal project. The starting point would be a planned deep-water port in Bluefields on the Caribbean coast. The canal would then pass through northern Nicaragua via Lake Managua/Xolotlán before reaching the port of Puerto Corinto on the Pacific coast. This ambitious project represents a significant departure from the previous initiative, as the HKND company had planned a route through Lake Cocibolca. As part of the new proposal, the Chinese company CAMC signed an agreement with Nicaragua’s Ministry of Transport and Infrastructure to build a port in Bluefields. The canal project would consist of four segments, and Ortega suggested that it could attract investments from both Chinese and American companies. This initiative comes as Nicaragua seeks to position itself as a key link in global maritime trade. Details regarding financing and environmental impact assessments have not yet been disclosed. Obstacles to Construction Skeptics have long questioned the feasibility of the canal due to its uncertain environmental and financial sustainability. Lake Cocibolca, the country's main source of drinking water, would be at risk. The habitats of many plant and animal species would be destroyed. Geological activities, such as earthquakes and volcanic activity, could jeopardize the long-term stability of the infrastructure. Forced displacement of local populations, including indigenous communities, could trigger social unrest and lead to a loss of cultural identity. There is also the risk of financial unsustainability, as the project's cost is enormous (with estimates ranging from $50 billion to even $80 billion), and the return on investment is uncertain due to competition from the Panama Canal. The cost is high due to the construction of ports, roads, bridges, and potential compensation for displaced residents. Therefore, it is clear that only a major financial backer—such as a state like China—could undertake the project. Advantages and Risks of Construction The construction of the Nicaraguan Canal could bring numerous benefits. Nicaragua's economy could significantly profit from transit fee revenues, job creation, and the development of related industries such as tourism and transportation. The Panama Canal would gain a desirable alternative, especially in times of congestion or droughts. The canal would enhance Nicaragua’s geopolitical and maritime significance, positioning it as a key hub for international trade. If China were to build the Nicaraguan Canal, it could significantly increase its geopolitical influence in Central America—a region that the U.S. considers its backyard. Washington would perceive this as a threat to its regional dominance, potentially worsening relations between the two superpowers. This could lead to new forms of trade, maritime, and/or cyber warfare. The Chinese would further strengthen their Belt and Road Initiative, establishing a critical trade route. In response, the U.S. might seek to expand the Panama Canal. Nicaragua would become even more politically and economically aligned with China and BRICS, setting an example for other regional countries with leftist and anti-American governments. It is worth noting that Beijing and Managua only established official diplomatic relations in December 2021. Until then, Nicaragua recognized Taiwan. A completed Nicaraguan Canal could prompt other nations to reassess their regional alliances and determine which partnerships offer the most benefits. Ultimately, in the 21st century, tangible interests prevail over ideology. Ideology largely serves to justify these interests.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWeQzS3TUXLMg9HLR7dNQCii	2025-03-18T16:50:56-07:00	
Declining Caspian Water Levels Threaten Russian And Chinese Corri...	Declining water levels in the Caspian Sea are reducing the amount of cargo ships this body of water can carry, as well as the functioning of major ports. This decline threatens both Russia’s North-South corridor and the People’s Republic of China’s (PRC) One Belt, One Road initiative (Caspian Herald, March 15). Although Russia is the more profoundly affected of the two due to problems moving cargo east and south in the Caspian, the PRC has also increasingly relied on the Caspian to ship container traffic across to Central Asia, which it then transports via train (seeEDM, April 11, 2023). The water levels of the Caspian have been declining for years, leading to an expanding shoreline, which has sparked academic debate about whether this is a permanent issue or one that can be reversed in the coming decades (Window on Eurasia, March 27, 2024; September 21, 2024). Declining water levels have also led to political discussions about whether the Caspian could be developed to serve as the primary route for Russian President Vladimir Putin’s North-South corridor (see EDM, April 11, August 8, 2023). It only emerged as a high-level political issue, however, when Moscow found that the falling water levels meant it could no longer move its Caspian Flotilla across the Caspian and through the Volga-Don canal to take part in Russia’s war against Ukraine (Window on Eurasia, March 27, 2024). The issue further gained importance in August 2024, when Putin focused on how the declining water levels could affect his North-South trade corridor during a meeting with the Governor of the Astrakhan Oblast, which borders the Caspian (URA.ru, August 27, 2024). During a meeting in Baku earlier this month, Russian, Central Asian, and Caucasian officials raised the latest and most alarming concerns about the declining water levels’ effects on the North-South route and the PRC’s One Belt-One Road initiative (Caspian Herald, March 15). The participants, who included senior officials and experts from across the region, were unanimous in declaring that declining water levels in the Caspian have reduced the cargo ships’ load capacity by 20 percent or more over the past year. Still worse, this trend is restricting both the capacity of sea lanes and the operations of major ports, even leading to the closure of some smaller ports—most affected is the North, but ports are increasingly closing throughout. According to one report, speakers even suggested that the declining water levels’ effect on trade is now so serious that Kazakhstan, which has seen its coastline retreat more than 50 kilometers (~31 miles) in recent years, would be forced to 'drop out' entirely of both Russia’s north-south and the PRC’s east-west trade networks, at least as far as the Caspian route is concerned (Caspian Herald, March 15). Such predictions are perhaps overblown and simply intended to attract more attention to this problem. While the capacity of ships and ports on the Caspian has declined, a substantial amount of shipping continues to take place. Ships and ports serving the two interregional trade networks are still working, albeit with less capacity than before. The routes’ current capacity could be maintained by increasing the frequency of sailings or building new ships, although Russia and the PRC face problems in doing so. On the one hand, Russia has major difficulties in its shipbuilding industry, with ships breaking down because they are overused and inadequately serviced. The PRC, on the other hand, is only beginning to get involved in shipbuilding for that body of water, although that is likely to change (Nezavisimaya Gazeta, May 11, 2023; see EDM, July 23, 2024; Window on Eurasia, January 24). Consequently, both Russia and the PRC are probably already considering other routes for their north-south and east-west trade. The PRC has multiple options, including land trade through South Asia and the use of the Northern Sea Route in the Arctic, meaning it can pivot in various directions. If Russia is forced to turn away from the Caspian, however, it will be confronted by exactly the same problems in the Caucasus and Central Asia that prompted it to look to the sea in the first place. These problems include political instability; inadequate networks of railways and highways, including their absence in some places and their single-track nature in many others; difficulties building new transportation infrastructure due to the topography; and financing problems for the sector of Russia’s North-South Corridor in Northern Iran (Window on Eurasia, January 24, December 1, 2022, October 16, 2024). Recognition for this issue is growing in Moscow, and its expansive hopes for developing trade and projecting power to the south may not be achieved anytime soon (Window on Eurasia, January 5; see EDM, January 16; Caspian Herald, March 15). In the short term, Moscow will likely attempt to expand its dredging operations in the Caspian, perhaps with the involvement of Iran and the PRC, as it has already done for the Volga-Don Canal (Window on Eurasia, March 23, 2022; see EDM, November 14, 2022). Russia will also probably try to strengthen its Caspian Flotilla to ensure that ships making the transit across the Caspian can do so without interference (see EDM June 24, 2021; Window on Eurasia, November 20, 2024). Rather than admit defeat in the southern direction, something Putin is reluctant to do, Moscow will probably increase pressure on countries in the Caucasus and Central Asia to expand train and highway networks to replace shipping routes that declining water levels are jeopardizing. Such projects will be enormously expensive and take years to complete, but the Kremlin may conclude it has no other choice. Such pressures are likely to be directed, in the first instance, against Kazakhstan but also toward Uzbekistan and Turkmenistan. Kazakhstan is already alarmed by Moscow’s moves. It will only become more so if Russia increases its pressure. Kazakhstan may welcome Russian assistance, however, in helping it to keep its ports open and its own Caspian shipping going (Window on Eurasia, December 28, 2023, October 25, 2024). Other countries, including Azerbaijan in the Caucasus, will be significantly less welcoming of Russian pressure in this regard, as recent increases in tensions between Moscow and Baku highlight (Ritm Eurasia, December 29, 2024; see EDM, January 28). Consequently, as happens more often than is commonly recognized, changes in the natural environment, such as the Caspian’s declining water levels, have far larger economic and political consequences and can even quickly become the triggers for conflict than the initial academic discussions might suggest.

China’s Growing Interest In Bangladesh In Aftermath Of 2024 Monso...	The geopolitical trajectory of Bangladesh experienced a paradigm shift during the Monsoon Revolution in August 2024, as Sheikh Hasina was removed from power and replaced by an interim government led by Nobel laureate economist Dr. Muhammad Yunus. Dhaka’s foreign policy approach during the interim government is broadly characterized by ‘Hasina’s increasing dependence on India’ to ‘emphasis on developing relations with the United States (US) and the European Union as well as within the region’. Scholars are observing a visible shift in the balance of power and geopolitical reconfiguration in South Asia as a result of the change of regime in Bangladesh, located in a critical geostrategic position of South Asia. A substantial facet of this reconfiguration was the Hasina administration’s growing reliance on India contributed to China’s discontent. This frustration was evident during her July visit to Beijing, coinciding with at the onset of opposition movements against her rule in the country. Expecting billions in aid, she was instead met with China’s refusal, prompting her early departure. The visit revealed the Hasina government’s growing estrangement from China, despite its unwavering support in three consecutive controversial elections—2014, 2018, and 2024—due to increasing alignment with India. Amid regional tensions with India and the US in South Asia, China’s expanding engagement with Bangladesh is evident through various diplomatic, economic, and strategic strategies, particularly in the aftermath of the government’s fall in Dhaka. Since 2009, the phenomenon of Bangladesh’s foreign policy, ‘India-friendly diplomatic posture’, has been a matter of apprehension for the Chinese policy-making community. Therefore, one of the reasons for China’s increased attention to Bangladesh in the post-Hasina period is as a greater regional strategy to counter India’s dominance and influence in South Asia, a region traditionally dominated by India’s sphere of influence. In response to the fall of Bangladesh’s pro-India government, China is striving to bridge the diplomatic foothold in both Bangladesh and India, aiming to strengthen its presence in Dhaka. Unlike India and the US, which exercised caution, China welcomed the new Yunus-led interim government in Bangladesh immediately after its formation. At the same time, the Chinese Foreign Ministry’s regular briefing expressed a firm commitment to increase collaboration between the two governments, and to cooperate on all kinds of reforms of the interim government in the country. The Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP), as a key political entity, engaged with Islamists, other parties, and civil society, visited China hosted by the Communist Party to reinforce ties with Beijing amid shifting political landscapes. The visit aimed to exchange expertise on China's economic progress, technological innovations, education, government model, and cultural development to foster bilateral relations. Following the collapse of the ruling government, the Awami League, previously prioritized under Sheikh Hasina, saw a decline in influence due to its fragile political position. Diplomatic analysts note that both the BNP and Awami League have pursued parallel engagements with China for investment, while Beijing now prioritizes inclusive engagement with all parties irrespective of ideological divides owing to the absence of a democratically elected government in Dhaka. The Indo-Pacific region has emerged as a key geopolitical competition, while regional and global powers are intensifying their strategic focus. As the China-India and China-U.S. rivalries escalate, Bangladesh, as a Bay of Bengal littoral state has faced China’s concerns in multiple times. Since the launch of the U.S. Indo-Pacific Strategy and the formation of QUAD, China has recurrently urged Bangladesh to distance itself from joining to counter Chinese national interests in the region. Moreover, as a strategic partner in China’s Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) within the Indian Ocean region, Bangladesh is being diplomatically encouraged to align with China’s broader geopolitical goals, particularly through ‘infrastructure diplomacy’ initiatives such as CMEC, BCIM and MSR. China is deepening strategic engagement with Bangladesh’s new administration, prioritizing high-level dialogue. Bangladesh will join the Boao Forum for Asia this month, marking 50 years of ties, and Chief Advisor Dr. Yunus is set to meet President Xi Jinping. The special flight sent by the Chinese President as part of the visit conveys why Bangladesh is strategically important to China. This high-level bilateral visit marks a significant diplomatic milestone as the first direct engagement between China and chief of Bangladesh’s interim leadership. The agenda for the upcoming visit of the Chief Advisor encompasses several critical issues, including the expansion of Bangladeshi exports to China, attracting more foreign direct investment and extending the repayment period of loans. Besides trade, investment and economic cooperation, approximately a dozen memorandums of understanding (MoUs) are expected to be signed on infrastructure, energy and economic cooperation. Economically, China has been providing financial and engineering assistance to Bangladesh, especially in the implementation of numerous mega projects, including the Padma Bridge. Furthermore, China has made substantial investments in Bangladesh’s critical infrastructure, particularly in power generation, transportation, and connectivity. For the past two decades, China as a reliable partner has consistently maintained a long-standing commitment to foster economic and development ties with Bangladesh. Chinese firms operate within the country alongside Bangladeshi business entities, facilitating economic and infrastructural growth. During the visit of the interim government’s foreign affairs advisor, as part of the negotiations for restructuring the debt taken from China, a request was made to reduce the interest rate on both the Preferential Buyers Credit (PBC) and Government Concession Loan (GCL) from 2-3 percent to 1 percent, eliminate the commitment fee, and increase the repayment period from 20 years to 30 years. In response to the request, Beijing responded positively by increasing the repayment period of the Chinese loan by 10 years to 30; there was also an assurance that it would consider reducing the interest rate. Drawing parallels with Vietnam, when foreign advisor proposed the relocation of Chinese manufacturing plants to Bangladesh, particularly to the Special Economic Zones (SEZs) of China in Chittagong, along with the establishment of direct air connectivity between Chittagong and Shanghai. In response, Chinese policymakers affirmed their recognition of Bangladesh as a viable destination for industrial relocation. For almost two decades, China has maintained its position as Bangladesh’s largest trading partner. In a meeting with Bangladesh’s trade advisor, Chinese Ambassador to Bangladesh Yao Wen expressed hope that the two countries’ trade gap could be reduced. In 2020, China provided duty-free benefits to 97 percent of Bangladeshi products, which was increased to 98 percent in 2022. Moreover, China’s decision to grant 100 percent duty-free trade benefits starting from December 1 marks the anniversary of their diplomatic relations since December 1, 1975, reflecting a strategic move to deepen economic cooperation. Under the Awami League government, China’s concerns over Sheikh Hasina’s reliance on India intensifies, particularly after India secured Mongla Port’s management bypassing Chinese interest and blocked China’s Teesta River barrage proposal. After 12th controversial national polls, Sheikh Hasina’s visit to China, following her trip to India, highlighted economic cooperation, but China prioritized political engagement. However, the major loan agreement did not materialize due to this bargaining reality. Militarily, China has long been a major supplier of defense apparatus to Bangladesh’s armed forces, accounting for more than 70% of Dhaka’s military imports. The interim leadership correspondingly seeks to strengthen defense cooperation with Beijing. Concerning this matter, a group of Dhaka based diplomats contemplate that China will not take any strong steps in the military field unless an elected government is formed. Bangladesh has long been dependent on China for all categories of weapons, although there are doubts about China’s quality around the world. However, recently, several Western countries, including the US and Turkey, have been added to this list. The main reasons for buying military equipment from China depict cost savings, technical support, and long-term defense strategy. In addition, China provides Bangladesh with technical assistance and training, snowballing its weapons management capabilities in the long term. A group of security analysts have suggested diversifying to address long-term military dependency by ‘over-reliance on China for arms’. Essentially, China is keen on military arms trade with Bangladesh for strategic and economic reasons in South Asia. The recent diplomatic deadlock between ‘India-locked’ Bangladesh and India has presented a strategic opening for China, fostering a further strengthening of Dhaka-Beijing relations. India has traditionally considered China a threat to its strategic calculus in South Asia. As Dhaka’s largest trading partner and a key supplier of military equipment, Beijing’s growing influence has faced consistent objections from New Delhi since the Hasina administration. Given China’s close ties with the current interim government, Dhaka is experiencing mounting pressures from major powers in the Indo-Pacific Strategy and the QUAD alliance, including India and the US, to maintain its previous strategic hedging. China was hesitant to establish strategic alignment with Bangladesh due to Sheikh Hasina’s India-friendly foreign policy. China has now openly intensified its efforts to expand its influence in Bangladesh, especially through diversification of military and economic cooperation, which is scholarly regarded as a counterbalance strategy of India in South Asia. After the transfer of state power in Dhaka through mass movements, tensions caused by border killings and public protests on both sides of the border, the creation of public anger against India through various propaganda about Bangladesh in various Indian media, the violation of the Vienna Convention through the attack on the Bangladesh Assistant High Commission in Agartala, India, and the former Prime Minister’s asylum in India, various unequal agreements with India with the previous government came to light. Due to the widening divide between Dhaka and New Delhi, the previously preeminent relationship has deteriorated to its lowest level. Several issues can be identified as major obstacles to India’s diplomatic relations with the current interim government, such as the atrocities against religious minorities, including Hindus, in Bangladesh, the ‘gradual deterioration’ of the law-and-order situation in Bangladesh, and doubts about the ‘inclusive’ and ‘participatory’ nature of the next elections in Bangladesh. Moreover, Pakistan and Bangladesh have become closer since Sheikh Hasina was ousted, which is acting as a general ‘anti-India sentiment’ in the politics of both nations. Many New Delhi based analysts claim that Beijing prompted as a match-maker in crafting this new chapter in Dhaka’s relations with Islamabad. Meanwhile, regular briefings of the Indian Ministry of External Affairs emphasize that the prospect enhancing bilateral ties is contingent upon the formation of an elected government in Dhaka. In 2023, India’s ‘medical tourism’ sector generated about 9 billion US dollars in revenue, which plays a major role in the country’s economy. After August 5, the number of Bangladeshi patients has decreased significantly due to the 80 percent reduction in visas for Bangladeshis. Owing to this development, the total number of foreign patients in Indian hospitals has come down by almost half. Against this backdrop, China has welcomed Bangladesh’s proposal to build a 1,000-bed Bangladesh-China Friendship Hospital in Purbachal, Dhaka as an ‘alternative healthcare destination’ for Bangladeshi patients. Since the construction of the new hospital will take several years, considering the visa ban in India, the political situation and the needs of the people, China has agreed to Dhaka’s request to designate at least four hospitals in Kunming for the treatment of Bangladeshi citizens, while first group of Bangladeshi patients, doctors, travel agencies had already departed for China last week. While China’s growing involvement creates diplomatic, economic and strategic opportunities for Bangladesh, it also poses significant risks. Despite the ups and downs of Bangladesh’s diplomatic relations with India, Bangladesh’s relations with China have been positive under all democratic and military governments. A recent study by the Dhaka based think tank, the Center for Alternatives, highlights the China’s national image in Bangladesh, with approximately 90 percent of Bangladeshi respondents expressed a positive stance toward China. Moreover, there is a consensus among all political parties in Dhaka on establishing and maintaining all sorts of relations with China. Precariously, over-reliance on Chinese debt could increase the risk of falling into a ‘debt trap’ like Sri Lanka and Pakistan, which could weaken Bangladesh’s economic stability, state capacity and sovereignty. Since Bangladesh under Hasina has not joined any US-led alliance in the region to deter China’s dominance, created diplomatic obstacles with Western allies. In addition, efforts to increase military cooperation with China and Pakistan are increasingly distancing itself from its larger neighbor, India, which could increase regional tensions and pose strategic challenges for Bangladesh. Moreover, China’s regional geopolitical ambitions limit its involvement in resolving the Rohingya crisis, which may discourage major powers from supporting Bangladesh, particularly if Dhaka deepens its alignment with Beijing. In light of all these realities, Bangladesh should carefully navigate China’s diplomatic, economic and strategic interests and make foreign policy decisions wisely.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWeQzS3TUXLMg07HwURIRBmD	2025-03-18T16:46:47-07:00	
So What Did Putin And Trump Agree On? A Partial Ukraine Cease-Fir...	By Mike Eckel (RFE/RL) -- It’s a cease-fire. But what kind of cease-fire? More than three years into the Russia’s all-out invasion of Ukraine, the White House and the Kremlin on March 18 announced a broad agreement aimed at pausing a conflict that has killed and wounded more than 1 million men on both sides. The contours of the deal were announced after a roughly two-hour phone call between presidents Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin – the second such call of Trump’s presidency, and arguably the most consequential to date. Ukraine, under intense pressure from the White House that included an acrimonious Oval Office meeting with President Volodymyr Zelenskyy had already signed on to the US proposal for a 30-day pause in fighting, with the caveat that Russia had to as well. So What did Moscow Agree to Exactly? 'My main conclusion here is that Moscow is quite comfortable with Trump, but for reasons other than almost everyone discusses,' Nikolai Sokov, a former Russian diplomat who is now with the Vienna Center for Disarmament and Non-Proliferation, told RFE/RL. 'Moscow can bargain with Trump whereas Europe insists its position is right and should be accepted without bargaining.' Where actual military action is concerned, the agreement does nothing on the battlefield itself, where Russian troops have, until recently, been grinding down Ukrainian defenses along a 1,100-kilometer front line. Ukraine’s troops are withdrawing from Russia’s Kursk region, which it invaded nearly seven months ago in a bid to relieve pressure elsewhere on the front lines, and also gain a bargaining chip for future peace talks. Prominent in the deal announced March 18 is the focus on energy infrastructure. Since at least November 2022, Russia has pummeled Ukraine’s power grid: power stations, transmission lines, transformers, substations—a strategy aimed at exhausting and terrorizing Ukraine’s civilian population, sometimes attributed to the former top commander of the Russian invasion whose nickname is General Armageddon. (Attacking civilian infrastructure is also allegedly a war crime, for which the International Criminal Court has brought charges against two top Russian military officers.) In the face of those attacks, Ukraine has struggled to keep the lights -- and heat -- on, but has managed to muddle through with a mix of local ingenuity and large-scale Western support. At the same time, Ukraine has ramped up its homegrown industry of drones, and even cruise missiles, which has increasingly used to target Russia’s energy infrastructure: oil refineries, pipelines, and military facilities. Speaking at a news conference in Helsinki, President Zelenskyy, who in the past has signaled support for a cease-fire exclusive of ground actions, appeared to sprinkle cold water on the new deal. 'We always supported the idea not to hit energy targets, as well as targets at sea, food production and transport targets,' he said after the Kremlin-White House phone call was announced. 'Now, we need to understand what the details of this agreement are. We don't know that.' 'This could be a way to move towards a cease-fire,' Zelenskyy said. 'Step by step. The rest though is the statistics of the reality: hundreds of drones and missiles that keep raining not on the battlefield but all over.' The groundwork for the cease-fire was announced in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia after meetings of Ukrainian and US delegations. Two days after, Putin responded to the proposal with what amounted to a 'yes, but' reply. 'During the conversation, Donald Trump put forward a proposal for the parties to the conflict to mutually refrain from attacks on energy infrastructure facilities for 30 days,' the Kremlin said in its read-out of the March 18 call. 'Vladimir Putin responded positively to the initiative and immediately gave the Russian military the corresponding order.' A limited cessation of targeting on energy facilities in Ukraine – and in Russia – is a win for Kyiv. However, it may end up being more of a win for Moscow, Sokov said. 'Note that for 30 days Russia will be building weapons and will be able to resume large-scale strikes if necessary,' he told RFE/RL. 'Ukraine, however, will not be able to fully fix damage to energy infrastructure, of which it has lost between one-third and one-half according to different estimates.' Left Unsaid What was absent from the talks – at least in the public read-outs from the Kremlin and the White House was any mention of Ukraine’s Zaporizhzhya nuclear plant – Europe’s largest – which US envoy Steve Witkoff said might be on the table. Nor was there mention of US recognition of Russia’s claim to have annexed Ukraine’s Crimea peninsula, something else that was rumored to be possible. Nor was there reference to Ukraine’s ambitions to join NATO, something Moscow vehemently opposes, and even cited as a justification for its decision to invade in February 2022. The White House statement did mention broader geopolitical issues— a nod toward a position Moscow has leaning into: that any deal with Washington should be a wider deal touching on issues unrelated to Ukraine. That’s a recurring theme for Putin who’s used the term 'root causes' – shorthand for the Kremlin’s dissatisfaction with the entire post-Cold War international arrangement. But broadening talks beyond Ukraine itself was something that Trump’s predecessor, Joe Biden, resisted. 'The leaders agreed that the movement to peace will begin with an energy and infrastructure ceasefire, as well as technical negotiations on implementation of a maritime ceasefire in the Black Sea, full cease-fire and permanent peace,' the White House said. 'These negotiations will begin immediately in the Middle East.' 'They further discussed the need to stop proliferation of strategic weapons and will engage with others to ensure the broadest possible application,' it said. 'The two leaders shared the view that Iran should never be in a position to destroy Israel.' It was also unclear whether the subtle difference in wording between statements was significant: 'energy infrastructure' per the Kremlin versus 'energy and infrastructure' per the White House. And proliferation of strategic weapons – nuclear or otherwise– has in the past been an easy goal that Washington and Moscow have shared, until distrust and political suspicions seeped into the effort. The two countries – who hold the world’s two largest nuclear arsenals – are still bound by the last major arms control treaty between them, though it’s due to lapse next year, and there’s been no effort at all to start talks on a successor treaty. In the end, though, broadening the scope of discussions fits into the Kremlin’s wider hopes for a wider rework on international rules: Moscow’s desire to be treated as an equal by the United States—as it was during the Soviet Union.

The Feds Have Been The Main Source Of Racial Bigotry In Classroom...	We will not stand idly by while this regime pulls the wool over the eyes of the American people,' proclaimed Sheria Smith, the president of American Federation of Government Employees unit representing more than a thousand federal Education Department employees fired by the Trump administration. The New York Times frets that the layoffs could devastate the agency that 'tracks student achievement and enforces civil rights laws in schools.' But ever since it was created by President Jimmy Carter, the Education Department has done far worse than 'pull the wool' over Americans’ eyes. Federal mandates and bureaucratic meddling have helped mentally blight millions of children. More than 150 years ago, abolitionist Frederick Douglass declared, 'Once you learn to read, you will be forever free.' But federal education policymakers have prevented legions of kids from reaching that road to freedom. No modern American president did more than Barack Obama to canonize bigoted standards in federal education policy. President Obama championed subsidies for public schools so that 'the federal government can play a leading role in encouraging the... high standards we need.' But, as part of its convoluted plans to reduce the achievement gap, the Obama administration cajoled most states into setting lower academic goals for blacks and Hispanics. From 2009 onwards, the feds rubber-stamped official plans under which white and Asian students were expected to perform far better than black and Hispanic students. (I bashed the discriminatory policy in USA Today in 2014). The feds bankrolled the District of Columbia’s plan to boost the percentage of white students who passed reading tests from 88 percent to 94 percent while the percentage of black students who passed rose from 41 percent to 71 percent. At DC’s Wilson High School, the goal was for 67 percent of black students and 95 percent of white students to pass math tests by 2017. Cynical Washingtonians joked that Wilson High had a two-track system, and its graduates went either to Yale or to jail. The federal Education Department approved Tennessee’s plan to raise the passing rate for English III courses for white students from 45.6 percent to 65.4 percent between 2011 and 2018 while the passing rate for black students leaped from 17.6 percent to 47.6 percent. The feds approved Minnesota’s plan to achieve 82 percent proficiency in 11th grade math for white students, 66 percent for Hispanic students, and 62 percent for black students. Alabama’s goals for the 2013-14 school year called for 91.5 percent of white third graders and 79 percent of black third graders to pass math. Tim Robinson, the father of two black school children, complained to the Tuscaloosa News: 'I think having a low bar means they can just pass them on. I think it’s dumbing our race down and preparing our boys for prison.' The Virginia NAACP denounced the new scoring regime. State Sen. Mamie Locke, the chair of the Virginia Legislative Black Caucus, protested: 'We believe that education is the ‘great equalizer’ in our society…. The state’s new system of benchmarks for performance is antithetical to this goal.' Further south, the Florida PTA protested: 'By setting ethnicity-based goals, the door is open for continued discrimination.' In some states, the racial double scoring was simply bureaucratic finagling to keep federal cash flowing into state coffers. Elois Zeanah, President of the Alabama Federation of Republican Women, declared that there was, …no way would these standards, which have racial overtones, be accepted if there had been an opportunity for public debate. Parents have no idea that their elected state education officials, and the state superintendent of education, are forcing different standards on their children based on their family income and race. As historian Walter Russell Mead warned, 'In practical terms, this is setting up a system in which some teachers will think they’ve succeeded as long as the black kids in a class reach a certain low level of proficiency.' University of Michigan education professor Carla O’Connor complained that the tests schools used measure only 'basic-level skills and now we’re saying we don’t think certain populations of students can even meet those expectations.' The Education Department required states to specify exactly how far each racial and ethnic group of students at each school would progress over the following years. The spreadsheet with Washington State’s formal plan for each school contained more than 47,000 separate lines. That was a level of education planning akin to the Soviet central planners who pretended to foretell the yields for every crop on every collective farm in the next Five-Year Plan. In the same way that collective farms submitted grossly exaggerated harvest data to Moscow, many schools were caught falsifying student results to fulfill federal mandates. States missed most of the goals but that didn’t matter because federal funding kept flowing. If Lester Maddox—one of the most racist governors in the 1960s—had officially announced lower learning goals for blacks in Georgia’s schools, he would have been tarred by every editorial page north of the Mason-Dixon Line. Because Obama was usually portrayed with a halo, his racial profiling in the classroom was largely ignored. But the policies scorned the message of the 1954 landmark decision in Brown v. Board of Education. The Supreme Court stressed that segregation could 'generate a feeling of [black] inferiority...that may affect [children’s] hearts and minds in a way unlikely to ever be undone.' Maybe none of the Obama administration education policymakers read or remembered that 1954 decision? Obama’s racial profiling dismally failed. Despite soaring government spending on schools, the racial achievement gap 'is now 30 percent larger than it was 35 years ago,' according to Stanford University education professor Linda Darling-Hammond. But many Democrats and perhaps many laid-off Education Department bureaucrats still believe that a bigger federal iron fist can solve all problems. Luckily, millions of parents and some states are done waiting for Uncle Sam to fix schools. 'Mississippi went from being ranked the second-worst state in 2013 for fourth-grade reading to 21st in 2022,' the Associated Press reported. The 'Mississippi Miracle' is based on a return to phonics—a reading method that succeeded for generations until progressive reformers replaced it with new-fangled methods that guaranteed full-employment for learning disability consultants. Mississippi fourth graders have higher reading scores on the National Assessment of Education Progress than do fourth graders in Minnesota—a liberal state long known for high education standards (and now best known for wacky Governor Tim Walz). Forty-seven percent of Mississippi fourth graders are black while only 13 percent of Minnesota fourth graders are black. But the method of teaching reading mattered more than the race of the students. America can no longer afford a 'no-fault' federal education policy. Torpedoing the Education Department is one of Trump’s most encouraging reforms. Education Secretary Linda McMahon declared that the layoffs are only 'the first step of eliminating bureaucratic bloat' as part of a 'new era of accountability.' Expect endless caterwauling about how the mass firings at the Education Department will doom America’s future. But terminating that department is the best guarantee that the feds will not inflict more idiocy upon hapless kids across the land.

Angola Energy Profile: Economy Vulnerable To Crude Oil Price Swin...	(EIA) -- Angola was the second-largest total liquid fuels producer in sub-Saharan Africa, after Nigeria, in 2024 production. Angola's economy is largely based on hydrocarbon production, making it vulnerable to crude oil price swings. Angola primarily consumes hydroelectricity and fossil fuel-derived fuel sources to meet its domestic needs for power generation.1 In December 2023, Angola announced that it would leave the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) effective January 1, 2024, following OPEC’s decision in November 2023 to reduce Angola’s crude oil production quota from its June 2023 level of 1.3 million barrels per day (b/d) to 1.1 million b/d starting in January 2024. Angola had been a member of OPEC since 2007. Angola’s exit from OPEC could provide the government more flexibility to revitalize hydrocarbon upstream development to address declining production stemming from maturing fields and a lack of upstream investment.2 Petroleum and Other Liquids Angola held an estimated 2.6 billion barrels of proved crude oil reserves at the beginning of 2025, according to estimates by the Oil & Gas Journal.3 Angola’s oil fields generally produce light to medium crude oil, which has a relatively low-sulfur content (low-sulfur crude oil grades are classified as sweet). The qualities and characteristics of Angola’s crude oil grades are popular with refiners in the Asia Pacific region.4 Crude oil gradeAPI gravity number (degrees)Sulfur content (percentage)NotesCabinda32.00.12Medium, sweet crude oil grade Dalia23.70.49Medium, sweet crude oil gradeGirassol30.80.34Medium, sweet crude oil grade; produced at Girassol and Jasmin fieldsHungo28.50.71Medium, semisweet crude oil grade; produced at Hungo and Chocalho (Block 15)Kissanje28.20.44Medium crude oil grade; medium sulfur contentKuito19.00.68Heavy crude oil grade, medium sulfur content; produced at Block 14Nemba38.70.19Light, sweet crude oil grade; produced at Block 0Palanca37.20.18Light, sweet crude oil grade; blend of five different oil fieldsXicomba34.80.39Light, sweet crude oil grade; produced at Block 15Data source: Sonangol company website Angola’s total liquid fuels production steadily declined during the past decade. In 2023, total liquid fuels production was about 1.2 million b/d, down from 1.8 million b/d in 2014. The downward trend in total liquid fuels production is the result of a lack of investment in upstream development. Rapid reservoir depletion and the lack of enhanced oil recovery investments to extend the lifetime of maturing fields have also contributed to steep decline rates at some fields.5 Drilling activity in Angola by major international oil companies slowed significantly in 2020 as a result of reduced capital spending, in part because of the economic slowdown from the COVID-19 pandemic. As a result, many of Angola’s new field developments were delayed, and only a few of the new developments came online, such as the Cuica, Zinia Phase 2, and Cabaca Norte projects. Although these fields increased total crude oil production, the recent additions did not offset the declines in mature fields. According to Energy Intelligence, many of the larger sanctioned projects such as the Agogo, Begonia, and Kaminho development projects are expected to come online in the latter half of this decade and provide a boost to production. Established international oil companies such as TotalEnergies and Azule Energy (a joint venture comprising bp and Eni) operate many of these new field developments or expansions.6 Location of Angola. Source: CIA World Factbook. The Angolan government is aiming to attract international investors by launching a series of bidding rounds to develop its hydrocarbon resources. Angola’s upstream regulator, the National Oil, Gas & Biofuels Agency (ANPG), is planning to launch its latest bidding round in the first quarter of 2025 to spur upstream exploration and development, particularly in its offshore basins. Ten exploration blocks in the Kwanza and Benguela basins located offshore central Angola are on offer. ANPG has put up additional onshore and offshore blocks as well as marginal fields (which are located in exploration blocks licensed to other producers but are permitted to be awarded individually to smaller companies for exploration) on offer outside of the 2025 bidding round, enabling the government to attract investor interest outside of the traditional bidding round periods. A strong showing of international investors and a competitive bidding round may help revive Angola’s upstream exploration and development and potentially lead to additional new discoveries.7 Refining Angola has only one operating refinery, which is in the Luanda province. In July 2022, Eni completed an expansion and modernization project at the refinery that increased its gasoline production capacity by 450,000 metric tons per year (or approximately 9,000 b/d) as well as rehabilitated its power generation unit to reduce emissions pollution.8 Angola has three other refineries that are under development. The first phase of a two-phase greenfield refinery development project in Cabinda province is reportedly scheduled to begin commercial operations in the first half of 2025; the second phase will increase total nameplate capacity to 60,000 b/d and add a high-conversion unit that will enable the facility to produce diesel, gasoline, fuel oil, and jet fuel. Construction of the second phase is scheduled to be completed by the end of 2026, although a final investment decision for the second phase has not been reached. Plans to construct two additional refineries, the SonaRef refinery in Benguela province and the Soyo refinery in Zaire province, are currently under development; however, the timeline for completion of the projects is not yet clear, as issues regarding financing for construction of the SonaRef refinery have been reported and the Soyo refinery has not yet started construction.9 Refinery LocationStatusEstimated start dateNameplate capacity (barrels per day)Luanda Luanda Operating195872,000SonaRefLobitoUnder development2025200,000SoyoSoyoUnder development2025100,000Malongo (phase 1)CabindaUnder development202530,000Malongo (phase 2)CabindaUnder development202630,000Total 432,000Data source: International Trade Administration and Energy Capital & Power Natural Gas Angola held an estimated 4.6 trillion cubic feet (Tcf) of proved natural gas reserves at the beginning of 2025, according to estimates by the Oil & Gas Journal. 10 Angola produces small quantities of marketed natural gas, most of which is from associated gas produced at its oil fields offshore. In addition, a substantial amount of its natural gas production is flared as a by-product of oil operations or is reinjected into oil fields to increase oil recovery. Thus, natural gas production in Angola is constrained by both the volume of crude oil production and the lack of adequate infrastructure to commercialize natural gas flared from its oil operations. Angola produced an average of about 166 billion cubic feet (Bcf) of dry natural gas and consumed an average of 36 Bcf between 2014 and 2023.11 Angola is seeking to develop a number of offshore natural gas projects to boost its natural gas production, with two projects scheduled to begin operations in the near future. The Sanha Lean Gas Connection project, which achieved first gas production in December 2024, is a $300 million subsea natural gas pipeline system that is designed to transport natural gas from the offshore Sanha field to the Angola liquefied natural gas (LNG) terminal in Soyo. Chevron is the developer of the project, through its Angolan subsidiary Cabinda Gulf Oil Company, and the project aims to supply 600 million standard cubic feet of natural gas per day to the LNG terminal once it is fully operational. The Northern Gas Complex, which reached a final investment decision in 2022, is Angola’s first non-associated gas project. Eni is the operator of the project, and the project aims to develop two offshore platforms, an onshore natural gas-processing plant, and pipelines to transport natural gas from the Maboqueiro and Quiluma fields located in Block 1 offshore to the Angola LNG terminal. Eni has stated that the project is scheduled to begin production in 2026 and is expected to reach a peak production of about 141 Bcf per year.12 According to the latest estimates by the World Bank Group’s Global Flaring and Methane Reduction Partnership, Angola was the 15th-largest flaring country in terms of volume, flaring approximately 65 Bcf of natural gas in 2023. The top three flaring countries for that same year were Russia (1,003 Bcf), Iran (721 Bcf), and Iraq (624 Bcf. Although Angola still flares a significant amount of natural gas relative to its marketed production (about 31% of dry natural gas produced in 2023), Angola’s natural gas flaring has declined after reaching a decade high of about 156 Bcf in 2016. The commercial restart of Angola’s LNG export terminal in Soyo enabled the country to use natural gas that would normally be flared as feedstock for liquefaction and export.13 Coal Angola does not have any coal reserves, and it does not consume or produce any coal. Electricity The government of Angola has prioritized the development of the electricity sector to meet the growing energy needs of the population. Angola has set goals of reaching 9.9 gigawatts (GW) of installed generation capacity and increasing electricity coverage to 60% of the total population by 2025. Much of the planned increase in capacity is to come from natural gas and utility-scale hydropower, although the government has incorporated targets for developing 800 megawatts (MW) of renewable energy (500 MW in biomass and 100 MW each in wind, solar, and small-scale hydropower) into the goal.14 Angola has three independent transmission systems that provide electricity to different parts of the country: the Northern, Central, and Southern systems. The government hopes to link the three independent grids as part of a national grid system and then to eventually link its grid with neighboring Democratic Republic of Congo and Namibia, both of which are members of the Southern African Power Pool (SAPP). Angola is a non-operating member of SAPP, a group that promotes cooperation among member countries to create a common electricity market that aims to provide reliable and affordable electricity to the citizens of member countries.15 In 2023, Angola had an electricity generation capacity of 7.6 GW and generated 17.9 gigawatthours (GWh) of electricity, primarily from hydroelectric or fossil fuel sources.16 The latest estimates from the World Bank indicate that 49% of Angolans had access to electricity in 2022, which is an increase of about 11% from 2012. The disparity between urban and rural areas and their respective access to electricity is significant, with electricity access for urban areas estimated to be 76% in 2022 whereas the latest estimate for rural areas was at 7% in 2018. Much of the growth in power generation has come from hydropower projects that came online in the late 2010s, but providing reliable access to end users remains a significant challenge because the transmission and distribution network in the country has not been upgraded or expanded. The distribution network also suffers from significant power loss because of illegal connections and poor enforcement of revenue collection from un-metered end users. The government of Angola aims to increase the country’s total installed capacity to 9.9 GW and its electrification rate to 60% by 2025.17 Angola is seeking to channel more of its domestic natural gas production for power generation. The Soyo combined-cycle natural gas turbine (CCGT) plant added 750 MW of total installed capacity in 2017 after plant construction and the connecting pipeline from Angola LNG were completed. As of November 2024, an expansion project is under development to add another 500 MW of generation by 2025, but the project is likely to be delayed because it has not yet reached a final investment decision.18 Angola derives nearly half of its total installed capacity from hydropower, which is generated by a number of large-scale hydropower projects. The Laúca hydropower project and the Cambambe expansion project, which added four new turbines at an additional 700 MW of installed capacity to the Cambambe hydropower project and provided a substantial boost to hydropower capacity in the 2010s. Angola is seeking to bring online additional hydropower projects to boost electricity capacity. The Caculo Cabaça hydropower plant is currently under construction and, according to Power Technology, is expected to be commissioned sometime in 2026. In June 2024, Angola and Namibia reached an agreement to begin construction of the Baynes hydroelectric power plant in September 2024. The Baynes plant is a cross-border hydropower project with a planned capacity of 881 MW that will be situated on the Lower Kunene River near the Angola-Namibia border. The project aims to provide electricity to both countries; however, it is unclear when the project will be completed because it has not yet begun construction as of November 2024.19 Refinery LocationStatusEstimated start dateNameplate capacity (barrels per day)Baynes hydropower projectKunene RiverPlanningUnknown881Caculo Cabaça hydropower projectKwanza River BasinUnder construction20262,170Cambambe hydropower projectKwanza River BasinOperational1962972Laúca hydropower projectKwanza River BasinOperational20172,071Total 6,094Data source: International Trade Administration, Power Technology, and Energy Capital & Power Energy Trade Angola is a significant exporter of crude oil and does not import any crude oil, given its low domestic demand relative to its production. Angola exported an average of 1.4 million b/d of crude oil between 2014 and 2023. Crude oil exports declined about 550,000 b/d over the 10-year period as a result of Angola’s declining crude oil production. In 2023, Angola exported about 1.1 million b/d of crude oil and condensate, with the Asia Pacific region taking most of Angola’s imports by volume for the year. Over half of total exports went to China, at 603,000 b/d; India was the second-largest importing country in the region, receiving about 79,000 b/d. Europe imported nearly a quarter of Angola’s total crude oil and condensate, with Spain (84,000 b/d) and the Netherlands (76,000 b/d) being the largest and second-largest regional importers, respectively.20 Angola imports and exports petroleum products through its maritime ports. According to seaborne trade flow estimates by Vortexa, Angola exported an average of 57,000 b/d of petroleum products between 2020 and 2023; about 77% of this volume was liquefied petroleum gas (generally used for heating and cooking) and naphtha (generally used for blending and in petrochemicals). Angola also imported petroleum products averaging about 59,000 b/d during the same time. Most of Angola’s petroleum product imports (93%) were diesel and gasoil, or gasoline and gasoline blending components, reflecting a growing demand for transportation fuels in the country.21 Angola exports the natural gas it produces in the form of LNG. Angola does not import any natural gas. We estimate that Angola exported about 131 Bcf of natural gas on average between 2014 and 2023, with LNG exports growing significantly after Angola’s sole LNG facility began its commercial restart in 2016.22 Angola has one LNG export terminal in Soyo, which is in the northern part of the country and next to the Congo River. The LNG facility has a liquefaction capacity of 5.2 million metric tons per year, or about 250 Bcf per year, and Angola LNG Limited is the operator of the facility. Angola LNG Limited is a consortium composed of Chevron, TotalEnergies, Azule Energy (a joint venture between Eni and bp), and Sonangol. The LNG facility produced its first cargo of LNG in 2013, but it subsequently shut down as a result of technical failures and did not restart operations until 2016.The LNG facility uses associated gas produced at Angola’s offshore fields as feedstock but may also draw supplies from non-associated gas projects such as the Quiluma and Maboqueiro development once it is brought online.23 Angola exported about 175 Bcf of LNG in 2023, according to the Energy Institute’s estimates in its 2024 Statistical Review of World Energy. It exported about 130 Bcf of LNG (or about 75% of total annual export volumes) to the Europe. The Asia Pacific region received the remainder of Angola’s LNG exports (about 44 Bcf, or 25% of total annual export volumes), with India by far the largest single-country importer in the region, at about 35 Bcf for the year. Following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, Angola’s LNG export flows shifted significantly toward Europe starting in 2022, when European countries sought substitutes for Russia’s natural gas. Prior to 2022, most of Angola’s LNG exports went to the Asia Pacific region, primarily China or India.24 Angola currently does not import or export any coal or electricity. Angola plans to connect to the regional SAPP once joint construction of the Baynes hydroelectric power plant is completed.25 Endnotes U.S. Energy Information Administration, International Energy Statistics database, accessed February 4, 2025.

Chinese Nationals Found Guilty Of Human Trafficking In South Afri...	Authorities convicted seven Chinese nationals in late February in South Africa on nearly 160 charges related to human trafficking, kidnapping, debt bondage, labor law violations and breaches of occupational health and safety regulations. Sentencing is scheduled for late April. Officers arrested them in 2019 at the Beautiful City blanket factory in Johannesburg, where authorities said they employed 91 undocumented Malawians between 2017 and 2019, South African online newspaper TimesLIVE reported. Acting on a tip, the Hawks’ Serious Organized Crime unit, a branch of the South African Police Service; Tactical Response Team members and Department of Labor officials broke into the factory and found the victims, including 33 between 15 and 17. 'The workers didn’t look up when we entered,' Maj. Thabo Mokoena, who led the raid, testified at trial, The African Mirror reported. 'They had been conditioned to keep working regardless of what was happening around them. It was only when we started speaking in their language that they realized something was different.' National Prosecuting Authority spokesperson Phindi Mjonondwane said the workers were confined under inhumane conditions and monitored by armed guards. 'The victims were forced to work 11-hour shifts, seven days a week, without proper training or safety equipment,' Mjonondwane said in the TimesLIVE report. One worker reportedly lost a finger and was denied medical treatment. At trial, witnesses, mostly Malawian nationals and one South African truck driver, testified about being deceived into working at the factory with promises of a better life. Victims said communication was banned and they were made to operate defective machines without protective gear. The workers said they were routinely threatened by the armed guards. They were not allowed to use the restroom while on duty and were docked pay if they did. According to The African Mirror, the workers earned R65 ($3.55) per day, or R6.50 (35 cents) an hour, far below South Africa’s minimum wage. Many of them said they previously worked at Chinese-owned factories and were recruited under false pretenses. William, one of the Malawian workers, said he travelled from his home village after being promised decent work and education. He instead found himself sleeping on a thin mattress in a crowded room after grueling work shifts. 'They took our passports,' William said, The African Mirror reported. 'They said we owed them for bringing us here, for feeding us. But the debt never decreased, no matter how much we worked.' Teresa Mwanza, a survivor who testified at trial, sat quietly as the verdicts were read. Both she and William have joined a survivor advocacy group and share their experiences to help authorities identify and rescue others in similar situations. 'I speak because others cannot,' Teresa said. 'There are more factories, more hidden places where people like me are still trapped.' After authorities freed them, many of the victims were provided with temporary legal status, psychological support and skills training through coordination between government departments and nongovernmental organizations. 'What makes this case significant is that it exposes the connection between illegal immigration and labor exploitation,' Nomsa Ndlovu, a human trafficking researcher at the University of Johannesburg, told The African Mirror. 'Victims are vulnerable on two fronts — afraid of their captors and afraid of authorities due to their immigration status.' Maj. Gen. Ebrahim Kadwa, provincial head of the Directorate for Priority Crime Investigation in Gauteng, said the trial was an important step in the fight against human trafficking. 'This judgment sends a message to traffickers operating within our borders,' he said, according to The African Mirror. 'South Africa will not tolerate these crimes.' Still, analysts say South Africa has emerged as a source, transit point and destination for human trafficking victims. In January, South African Police rescued 26 Ethiopians who escaped from a suspected human trafficking ring in Johannesburg, where they were held naked in a bungalow. Three people were arrested on suspicion of human trafficking and possession of an illegal firearm. 'The signs that we have is this is a human trafficking matter, because they were actually escaping from that house and they were kept naked, almost as if it’s a modus operandi to keep them humiliated and not trying to escape,' Philani Nkwalase, a police spokesperson, told The Guardian. In August, authorities found 82 Ethiopians crammed into another Johannesburg house, without enough food or proper toilet and bathroom facilities. Nkwalase said it was not clear if the cases were related.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWeQzS3TUXLMg0ZWHIOukhKO	2025-03-18T16:40:53-07:00	
US Withdrawal From The WHO Shines Spotlight On Need For Reform – ...	Amidst the whirlwind of executive orders issued by incoming US President Donald Trump last week was the news that the US intends to withdraw from the World Health Organisation (WHO). The move has been met with widespread condemnation from experts citing concerns about the effects of budget cuts to the WHO, and the isolation of public health institutions in America. At the same time, the news has shone the spotlight on problems within the WHO that have until now been largely ignored, with the potential to trigger reform that could benefit the global health network. At roughly $600 million per year in contributions, the US provides about one fifth of the WHO’s $3.4 billion budget (USD), leaving a considerable shortfall that needs to be met either by other nation states or private donors in the absence of US membership. In a statement on X, the WHO urged the US to reconsider its withdrawal, highlighting the nation’s role as a founding member of the organisation in 1948, and decades of achievements through their global health partnership. 'For over seven decades, WHO and the USA have saved countless lives and protected Americans and all people from health threats. Together, we ended smallpox, and together we have brought polio to the brink of eradication,' said the WHO. This is President Trump’s second attempt at withdrawing from the WHO, after his first executive order signalling intention to withdraw in 2020 was revoked by the Biden administration in 2021. The executive order, issued on 20 January, sets the clock on a 12-month notice period for the US to leave the United Nations health agency. During this time, the US will cease negotiations on the WHO’s major pandemic reforms: a binding treaty, and amendments to the International Health Regulations. The US Government will now work to 'identify credible and transparent United States and international partners to assume necessary activities previously undertaken by the WHO,' according to the order. Much has been written in the past week about the potential impacts of this decision on the health of Americans, and the world: The withdrawal 'would undermine the nation’s standing as a global health leader and make it harder to fight the next pandemic,' wrote the New York Times. 'The loss could hinder the WHO’s ability to swiftly and effectively respond to infectious disease outbreaks and other emergencies around the world, among others,' wrote Politico, along with concerns that the US will lose access to the global network that sets the flu vaccine’s composition every year. Experts told ABC that, 'Trump could be sowing the seeds for the next pandemic,' and, 'the irrational withdrawal' will make 'the USA vulnerable to decreased human capital and quality of life on all health indicators, lack of guidance on informed health emergencies, depleted health literacy and increase in non-communicable and communicable diseases.' The news has already triggered budget cuts at the WHO, said Bloomberg, reporting a verified internal memo to staff from WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus in which he said that the US withdrawal 'has made our financial situation more acute,' necessitating 'cost reductions and efficiencies.' Projected cuts include a hiring freeze, curtailment of travel expenditure, and suspension of office refurbishments and expansions. Another executive order putting a freeze on foreign aid has brought the potential effects of US withdrawal from public health programs into stark relief, affecting the President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief program, which supplies most of the treatment for HIV in Africa and developing countries. The New York Times reported that patients are already being turned away from clinics, medications are being withheld, and US officials have been instructed to stop providing technical assistance to national ministries of health. However, notably missing from coverage of the US’s WHO withdrawal is robust discussion of the validity (or otherwise) of the Trump administration’s criticisms. The Art of the Deal Trump cited 'the organization’s mishandling of the COVID-19 pandemic that arose out of Wuhan, China, and other global health crises, its failure to adopt urgently needed reforms, and its inability to demonstrate independence from the inappropriate political influence of WHO member states,' as reasons for the US’s intention to withdraw from the WHO. Additionally, 'the WHO continues to demand unfairly onerous payments from the United States, far out of proportion with other countries’ assessed payments. China, with a population of 1.4 billion, has 300 percent of the population of the United States, yet contributes nearly 90 percent less to the WHO,' said the executive order. It is true that the US provides far more towards the WHO budget than China’s $80 million per annum. While China has the larger population, WHO member state contributions are assessed on the size of the nation’s economy, not the population, a fact which seems to be the basis of Trump’s complaint. However, the majority of the US’s contributions are voluntary, over and above the required member state ‘assessed contributions.’ While China’s assessed contributions are less than half ($45 million p.a.) than those of the US ($110 million p.a.), the significant difference is in the disparity between voluntary contributions made by the two countries. In this respect, it is possible that the withdrawal notice is a play in the hard-nosed art of dealmaking. 'I suspect this is the thinking behind Trump’s executive order – that it is intended as laying down the gambit to make a deal,' public health physician and former WHO medical officer, Dr David Bell told me over email. While this might involve angling for higher contributions from other countries and lower contributions from the US, Trump’s complaints against the WHO indicate that he may also be pursuing the goal of institutional reform. If a deal cannot be made, then the US will presumably follow through with the threat of leaving the WHO. Reforming International Public Health 'I think the administration believes international organizations are useful in health, but the WHO is clearly not fit for purpose,' said Dr Bell, whose extensive work with the REevaluating the Pandemic Preparedness And REsponse agenda (REPPARE) working group, in collaboration with the University of Leeds, has brought the WHO’s pandemic risk assessment and response plans into question. A trade-off for the US will be loss of influence. 'It will be unfortunate to leave the WHO more firmly in the hands of geopolitical rivals and private interest groups,' says Dr Bell, but 'the WHO needs a jolt, and if reform cannot happen, the US and many other countries should leave.' 'The best approach is to demand radical reform, and to replace the WHO if reform proves impossible.' In a recent article titled ‘Global Health Reform Must Go Far Beyond WHO’ for Brownstone Institute, Dr Bell described the 'institutional rot' of a 'vast and detached bureaucracy,' beholden to private donors who can dictate how their donations are spent, and engaging in luxury belief politics while exacerbating inequalities in developing countries. The WHO’s mandate is to promote health, which it defines as 'a state of complete physical, mental and social well-being and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity. Yet during the pandemic, wrote Dr Bell, the WHO’s promotion of extremist policies, '…helped force over a hundred million additional people into severe food insecurity and poverty and up to ten million additional girls into child marriage and sexual slavery. 'It helped deprive a generation of the schooling needed to lift themselves out of poverty and grew national debts to leave countries at the mercy of global predators. This was an intentional response to a virus they knew from the beginning was rarely severe beyond sick elderly people. 'The WHO helped orchestrate an unprecedented transfer of wealth from those it was originally tasked to protect to those who now sponsor and direct most of its work. Lacking any contrition, the WHO is now seeking increased public fundingthrough misrepresentation of risk and return on investment to entrench this response.' Instead of expanding its budget and control with new pandemic reforms, Dr Bell says that the WHO 'should be steadily downsizing as national capacity is built, and it should be concentrated on what makes us healthier and longer-lived, not rare outbreaks that are profitable but have very small mortality.' Here, Dr Bell points out that, given that Covid is almost certainly the result of a lab leak after gain-of-function research, it is irrelevant to the surveillance network being built by the WHO to mitigate pandemic risk. 'We have not had a major outbreak in over 100 years that is in the category of natural outbreaks that the pandemic agenda is designed for,' he said. This was confirmed with the release this week of a CIA analysis favouring (with low confidence) the lab leak as the origin of Covid. The FBI previously arrived at the same conclusion with moderate confidence. On this point, Dr Bell said the US withdrawal 'raises the importance of getting the truth regarding pandemic risk and funding more widely known.' US Withdrawal Opens Dialogue This is a silver lining also noted by the Aligned Council of Australia (ACA), a collective formed in opposition to the WHO’s pandemic treaties, representing over 1.7 million Australians across 39 member organisations. Like Dr Bell, ACA co-founder and lawyer Katie Ashby-Koppens suspects Trump’s executive order is more likely intended to 'negotiate a cheaper deal' than a committed withdrawal, but said that the order has opened the way for conversation about the WHO’s structure and conduct. 'The Trump administration’s WHO withdrawal notice puts a microscope on the organisation, whereas before it’s been like teflon – nothing would stick, and no one in authority would talk about it,' said Ashby-Koppens. 'This order gives credence to concerns that groups like ours have been raising about the WHO for a long time.' These concerns include conflicts presented by the private-public partnership model, centralisation of decision-making powers, bureaucratic bloat, disconnection from the lived experience of people on the ground who the WHO’s actions affect, and lack of transparency. Ashby-Koppens acknowledges that a mass exodus from the WHO is unlikely, and that Australia is committed as ever, providing an additional $100 million (AUD) in voluntary funding to the WHO for pandemic preparedness over the next five years over and above its assessed (required) contributions. A spokesperson for the Department of Health confirmed, 'Australia is committed to supporting the WHO and its unique mandate as the coordinating body on international health work, which helps to keep Australia, our region and the world safe. 'We will continue to work with partners, including the US, to strengthen global health cooperation to prepare for and respond to future health emergencies.' Accordingly, ACA is focusing on the points it has a chance of scoring. 'I think we need to question the amount of money we’re giving to WHO and where it’s going. $100 million in voluntary contributions is a phenomenal amount in a cost of living crisis,' said Ashby-Koppens. In 2024, one in eight Australians was living in poverty, more than half of low-income households experienced food insecurity, and 60% of Australians lived paycheck to paycheck. If upcoming WHO agreements are adopted, public spending on the international public health apparatus will only increase, said Ashby-Koppens. Negotiations over the international pandemic treaty have stalled, but Health Minister Mark Butler has previously signalled Australia’s strong commitment to seeing the negotiations through and adopting the treaty when finalised. New International Health Regulation (IHR) amendments have been adopted and will become binding this year, but Australia has until July 2025 to opt out formally rejecting them. The IHR amendments could essentially lead to 'perpetual pandemics,' said Ashby-Koppens, referring to the extensive surveillance networks that countries will be obligated to implement, whereby everyone, everywhere will be searching for new viruses all the time. When paired with the planned treaty, the WHO will not only get to define what a pandemic is (as it did with a controversially low bar with Mpox), it will define what treatments and prophylactics are acceptable, it will require member states to legislate to bring in directed health measures – which can include proof of vaccination, mandatory vaccination, medical examinations, contact tracing, and quarantine – and it can require that member states censor information that is deemed to be ‘misinformation.’ The costs are not always direct, either. According to a parliamentary report, the Australian Government granted indemnity to Covid vaccine manufacturers under the guidance of the WHO as a requirement of its participation in the WHO-led COVAX project. This has left member state governments to foot the bill for vaccine injuries, amounting to nearly $40 million in Australia thus far, and much more if over 2,000 Australians currently suing the government in a Covid vaccine injury class action are successful. Moreover, nation states participating in COVAX were pressured to fund vaccines for poorer nations, in addition to their regular WHO contributions. This is reportedly the main sticking point for the UK in its rejection of the WHO pandemic treaty in its current form, as it would allegedly force Britain to give away a fifth of its vaccines in a future pandemic. Last year, a small group of Australian politicians pressed the Prime Minister to rejectthe reforms on the basis that they posed 'a significant threat to Australia’s autonomy and independence on the global stage,' but the resistance has so far been ineffectual. However, ACA believes there is a real chance of community-driven opposition stopping the treaty and IHR amendments from going through Down Under. 'We encourage everyone who cares about Australia’s health sovereignty to join our campaign to make the rejection of the WHO’s pandemic reforms an election issue for 2025,' said Ashby-Koppens. What the World Needs Now Regardless of the future of the WHO, Dr Bell said he hopes the world can 'have a small, focused, and ethical international health agency that addresses needs of countries when requested and focusses on diseases of high burden.' While an estimated seven million people died with Covid during the first five years of the likely man-made pandemic, more than 600,000 people die of malaria and 1.3 million from tuberculosis every year, far eclipsing the cumulative mortality rate from pandemics over a longer time horizon. By far the biggest killers are non-communicable diseases like cardiovascular disease and cancers, which are responsible for half of all deaths worldwide. Causes of death globally in 2019, aggregated by Our World in Data 'Whether the WHO still exists in some form to be part of that depends on the willingness of its staff to do what they are mandated to do, rather than what is good for career-building and personal gain,' he said. 'I do believe there are still a lot of decent people there, but it needs radical change.' If radical change is not implemented, the WHO may find that its support continues to dwindle. Italy’s right-wing Deputy Prime Minister Matteo Salvini has already proposed a bill to follow the US withdrawal from the WHO. If more countries signal loss of confidence in the WHO, we may see splintering in the way international health is managed, from a centralised format (represented by the WHO) to several agencies preferred by different blocs of nations, or even something more decentralised. The WHO does important work that saves lives – supporting low-resource countries in dealing with endemic infectious diseases, assisting to reduce exposure to fake pharmaceuticals (one of the largest criminal industries on earth, says Dr Bell), and working to strengthen under-resourced health systems. The question is whether the WHO is the best agency to do this work, and whether it can stop the rot to do maximum good without causing collateral damage in train.

Uzbekistan: Ramadan Ban On Children At Mosques, Fasting By Nation...	By Mushfig Bayram At mosques across the country, including in Fergana and Tashkent, police have expelled children or prevented them from entering during the Tarawih night prayers since the Muslim holy month of Ramadan began in late February. 'Police officers caught children present during the prayer, and drove them out, scolding and threatening them with punishment,' one Muslim complained to Forum 18. 'The police are doing everything to alienate people from the Mosque,' the Muslim added. 'At the same time the media and television channels, which are all practically under government control, lie and propagate that everything in the country is fine and people have great religious freedom' (see below). Officials of Fergana Regional Police Department for the Struggle against Terrorism and Extremism as well as at the Interior Ministry's Department for the Struggle against Terrorism and Extremism in Tashkent would not explain to Forum 18 why children are banned from the mosque prayers (see below). Abdurahim Kadyrov, Expert of the State Religious Affairs Committee in Tashkent, adamantly defended the actions of the police expelling children from mosques. 'These children are under 18 and under the Law are not allowed to participate in religious activity,' he told Forum 18 (see below). Police attempts to prevent children attending night prayers during Ramadan come just after President Shavkat Mirziyoyev signed a law allegedly 'aimed at further strengthening the protection of the rights of the child'. The Law banned and introduced fines of over one month's average wages or up to 15 days in jail for parents or guardians who allow their children to receive 'illegal' religious education before the age of 18 (see below). The authorities have also banned the exercise of religion of religion or belief by police officers, military and National Guard officers. This in particular includes a ban on fasting during Ramadan (see below). Officials required all National Guard officers to sign an official declaration – seen by Forum 18 - pledging under oath that during service in the National Guard they will 'not perform religious rituals and ceremonies, including fasting during the month of Ramadan, in order to ensure constant combat readiness'. They also had to pledge not to organise religious rituals or have religious materials where they are serving. Any National Guard officer violating these promises would be dismissed (see below). An official of the National Guard Press Service (who refused to give her name) insisted to Forum 18 that abstaining from the fast during Ramadan is 'only a recommendation since the officer needs to be physically ready at all times'. She refused to say why National Guard officers cannot exercise freedom of religion or belief (see below). From mid-January 2025, police in Tashkent again stepped up their campaign against men wearing beards. They raided mosques to identify bearded Muslim men to warn them about beards and not to complain about state policies publicly. Imams of the mosques also lectured the men that it is not necessary in Islam to keep a beard. Police officers present in the Imam's office warned the men that they must shave their beard unless they want to be identified as extremists or terrorists (see below). A local police officer told one Muslim to go to the mosque. 'As I came to the Mosque, I saw that more than a hundred men in beards were assembled in the yard, and were waiting for the officials,' the Muslim – who asked not to be identified for fear of state reprisals - told Forum 18. The Imam told the men they 'must not complain about the authorities publicly'. He then added: 'It is not necessary to keep beards in Islam as long as we believe in Allah in our hearts' (see below). The police officer present in the Mosque, who observed the men during the Imam's lecture, then warned them that 'we must shave our beards unless we want to be identified as extremists or terrorists' (see below). Several Muslim men told Forum 18 that police officers 'sit in the Mosque and wait for any bearded Muslim men to visit so they can catch them' (see below). Regime surveillance of places of worship The regime has long kept places of worship under surveillance. From 2018 mosques had to pay for surveillance cameras controlled by the regime to be installed inside and outside mosques. In early 2022, the Interior Ministry also ordered non-Muslim communities to install the cameras. Muslim and non-Muslim religious communities and followers told Forum 18 in 2022 that some people stopped attending meetings for worship, for fear of being identified and then facing state reprisals. A Muslim commented that 'we want to concentrate on our meetings for worship, and not be afraid'. Earlier Ramadan restrictions Each year the regime imposes stricter than usual controls on Islamic communities during the Muslim holy month of Ramadan. Officials continue to express hostility to people – including children – attending mosques. Soon after the start of Ramadan in April 2021, the regime-controlled media broadcast a discussion between the then Interior Minister Pulat Bobojonov and Prime Minister Abdulla Aripov in which among other issues they discussed what they saw as a problem of people attending mosques, in particular people under 18. 'Two thousand mosques were attended by 800,000 people, and unfortunately 22,000 children attended Tarawih prayers [congregational night prayers in Ramadan],' Interior Minister Bobojonov told Prime Minister Aripov, who was seen to nod his head in agreement. Bobojonov added that 'we will gradually and significantly cut down the number of children attending not by ordering them but by explanatory work with their parents.' Muslim prisoners in at least one prison - Open Prison No. 49 in Olmalyk in Tashkent Region - were warned not to fast during Ramadan in 2023. 'They threatened prisoners that, if they fast, they will be accused of violating prison regulations and will be sent back to the prison camp,' one Muslim who asked not to be identified for fear of state reprisals told Forum 18. 'They also began to close the canteen for suhur, the morning meal before the start of the fast.' Neither Major Shukur Jurayev, the acting head of Open Prison No. 49, nor the Interior Ministry were willing to answer Forum 18's questions about why prisoners were banned from fasting during Ramadan, and why the prison closed the canteen for prisoners wanting to eat the pre-dawn meal. Police expel or prevent children attending Mosque Ramadan prayers At mosques across the country, including in Fergana and Tashkent, police have expelled children or prevented them from entering during the Tarawih night prayers as the 2025 Muslim holy month of Ramadan began, several Muslims from Tashkent and elsewhere complained to Forum 18. The Muslims did not want to identify Mosques or the children for fear of state reprisals. Forum 18 has also seen video footage on social media of police officers forcing children out of an unnamed Tashkent mosque and Fergana City's Okarik Mosque. Ramadan began this year at the end of February. 'Police officers caught children present during the prayer, and drove them out, scolding and threatening them with punishment,' one Muslim complained to Forum 18 in early March. 'The police are doing everything to alienate people from the Mosque. At the same time the media and television channels, which are all practically under government control, lie and propagate that everything in the country is fine and people have great religious freedom.' Police attempts to prevent children attending night prayers during Ramadan come just after President Shavkat Mirziyoyev signed a law on 20 February allegedly 'aimed at further strengthening the protection of the rights of the child'. The Law banned and introduced fines of over one month's average wages or up to 15 days in jail for parents or guardians who allow their children to receive 'illegal' religious education before the age of 18. Telephones at Tashkent City Police went unanswered between 10 March and 17 March. Forum 18 asked Fergana Police why officers raided mosques to hunt for children during Ramadan prayers. The duty officer at the Regional Police (who did not give his name) on 10 March referred it to Lieutenant Colonel Elyorbek Bababekov, Chief of the Regional Police Department for the Struggle against Terrorism and Extremism. Bababekov's phone went unanswered. The duty officer then gave the number for Numon Jurayev, Bababekov's subordinate at the Regional Police. Jurayev answered his phone on 10 March but put the phone down as soon as he heard Forum 18's name. He did not answer when called back multiple times the same day. Ravshan Shamshimetov, an Expert on 'religious extremism' at the Interior Ministry's Department for the Struggle against Terrorism and Extremism in Tashkent, refused to comment on why police force children out of mosques during Ramadan. He also refused to say why the authorities ban children from receiving Islamic or other religious education without state permission. 'Please, send us your questions in writing,' he told Forum 18 on 7 March. He also refused to put Forum 18 through to Mirjamol Miralimov, Deputy Chief of the Department, or other officials. Abdurahim Kadyrov, an Expert of the State Religious Affairs Committee in Tashkent, adamantly defended the actions of the Police expelling children from mosques. 'These children are under 18 and under the Law are not allowed to participate in religious activity,' he told Forum 18 on 7 March. Forum 18 asked whether the Religious Affairs Committee does not recommend to the state authorities to observe Uzbekistan's Constitution, which allows religious freedom, and Uzbekistan's international obligations in the area of freedom of religion or belief flowing from the international human rights agreements the country has signed. Kadyrov did not answer. 'Please, send your questions in writing,' he said. Muhammadolim Muhammadsiddikov, spokesperson of the state-controlled Muslim Board, on 7 March at first was adamant children are not being forced out of mosques during this year's Tarawih prayers. When Forum 18 insisted that it has seen video footage of Police in Fergana forcing children out of Okarik Mosque, he responded: 'You need to talk to the State Religious Affairs Committee and the Interior Ministry about these issues and not to us.' He further declined to talk or put Forum 18 through to other Board officials. The reason for the Law punishing parents for obtaining a religious education for their children and expelling children from mosques is that 'the state wants to show the people that they not only adopt such laws against religious freedom but that they are determined forcefully to execute those laws', one Muslim complained to Forum 18. 'Religious people are under close surveillance and the control of the state. The regime is now threatening religious people as in the time of [former president Islam] Karimov and Soviet times.' Police, military, National Guard officers banned from Ramadan fasting The authorities have also banned the exercise of religion of religion or belief by police officers, military and National Guard officers. This in particular includes a ban on fasting during the Muslim holy month of Ramadan, Muslims from Tashkent complained to Forum 18. Officials required all National Guard officers to sign an official declaration – seen by Forum 18 - pledging under oath that during service in the National Guard they will 'not perform religious rituals and ceremonies, including fasting during the month of Ramadan, in order to ensure constant combat readiness'. They also had to pledge that they would 'not organise religious rituals and ceremonies nor store religious materials or objects in the building or territory of the institution where their [military] service is performed'. Any National Guard officer violating these promises would be dismissed. An official of the Press Service of the National Guard (who refused to give her name) insisted to Forum 18 on 17 March that abstaining from the fast during Ramadan is 'only a recommendation since the officer needs to be physically ready at all times'. Asked why officers for instance cannot keep religious books like the Koran or other religious objects, cannot read religious materials, cannot participate in religious ceremonies like praying the namaz (Muslim prayers) or religious rites, she responded: 'Please, send your further questions in writing to the Foreign Ministry.' She declined to talk further to Forum 18. Tashkent police raid mosques, target bearded Muslim men Even before the start of the Muslim holy month of Ramadan at the end of February, police have again targeted Muslim men with beards. The regime has long launched nationwide campaigns against Muslims wearing the hijab or beards. When charges are brought against bearded men, they typically have been under Administrative Code Article 194, Part 1 ('Failure to carry out the lawful demands of a police officer or other persons carrying out duties to guard public order'), Administrative Code Article 183 ('Petty hooliganism'), and Administrative Code Article 184−4 ('Being in public places with the face covered to an extent that does not allow identification of a person'). From March 2024 onwards, Muslim men wearing long beards nationwide were arrested, had their beards forcibly shaved, and were fined. The fines imposed range between about one month's to just over a week's average wages for those in work. Some Muslim men told Forum 18 in October 2024 that since March 2024 they have kept their beards 'trimmed and very thin' to avoid such punishments. Police have claimed shaving beards stops young men being 'radicalised'. From mid-January 2025, police in Tashkent stepped up their campaign. They raided mosques to identify bearded Muslim men to warn them about beards and not to complain about state policies publicly. Imams of the mosques also lectured the men that it is not necessary in Islam to keep a beard. Police officers present in the Imam's office warned the men that they must shave their beard unless they want to be identified as extremists or terrorists. Police have also stopped bearded men on the streets to photograph them to check the length of their beards. Muslims believe that the raids, lectures and warnings are part of a bigger campaign by the authorities to reduce to a minimum the visibility and influence of Islam on society, so that society could have little or no resistance to their decisions or policies. Several Muslim men have posted online video complaints about being invited to the Mosque and warned by Police. They declined to comment to Forum 18. Muslim men who were subjected to police pressure were either individually targeted and invited to the mosques for a talk with the police or were caught at random when they attended prayers by police officers sitting in Mosques. The Muslims, who asked not to give their names for fear of state reprisals, complained to Forum 18 that these police officers were 'not security officers but came to the mosque specifically to catch Muslim men with beards and warn them'. Asked why State Religious Affairs Committee officials and police raided mosques in Tashkent to identify bearded men and warn them to shave their beards, a State Committee official Aziz (who refused to give his last name) did not answer. 'Wait on the line, and I will answer your question very soon,' he told Forum 18 on 17 March. Then he did not come back with any answer for several minutes it waited on the line, after which the call was cut off. Repeated calls on the same day went unanswered. Other officials of the State Committee did not answer their phones on 17 March. The Interior Ministry and Tashkent Police Department officials also did not answer their phones on 17 March. Officials of the state-controlled Muslim Board put the phone down as soon as Forum 18 introduced itself on 17 March. Police pressure Muslim to go to Mosque for lecture about beards, economy One Muslim man complained to Forum 18 that the local police officer came to his home in Tashkent and told him that he 'needs urgently to visit the Mosque for a talk'. The man immediately got dressed and went to the Mosque the same day. 'As I came to the Mosque, I saw that more than a hundred men in beards were assembled in the yard, and were waiting for the officials,' the Muslim – who asked not to be identified for fear of state reprisals - told Forum 18 in early March. 'Later we were told to enter the Mosque. The Imam began his lecture not about religion or our faith but about the sudden increase in prices, saying that this is happening all over the world and not just in Uzbekistan. He told us that we need to thank Allah that we are not the worst economy in the world.' The Imam then told the men that they 'must not complain about the authorities publicly'. He then continued his lecture about keeping beards. 'It is not necessary to keep beards in Islam as long as we believe in Allah in our hearts.' The police officer present in the Mosque, who observed the men during the Imam's lecture, then warned them that 'we must shave our beards unless we want to be identified as extremists or terrorists'. Police 'invite' another Muslim to Mosque twice in one week in February Another Muslim, who attends a different Mosque in Tashkent, complained that the local Police twice invited him to his local Mosque within one week in February. 'They told me in the presence of the Imam of the Mosque not to grow a beard,' the Muslim – who asked not to be identified for fear of state reprisals - told Forum 18 in early March. 'But at the second visit to the Mosque, I laughed at them and showed my very thinly trimmed beard, and told them that I have not grown my beard since they saw me the previous week.' Police then released the man. Police watching any bearded Muslim man that visits Mosque A third man from Tashkent complained that in late January he needed to visit his friend who works in a local Mosque. 'When I went to see him in the Mosque, I saw that our local police officer, another officer from the Police Department for the Struggle against Terrorism and Extremism in plain clothes and two representatives of the State Religious Affairs Committee were sitting in my friend's office,' the individual – who asked not to be identified for fear of state reprisals - told Forum 18 in early March. As the man's friend was not in the office, he decided to leave the room. 'When I turned around and stepped out of the room, the officer from the Police Department for the Struggle against Terrorism and Extremism jumped up and hurried after me.' The officer asked him whether he was invited for a talk. 'When I told him, No, and that I came to see my friend, he told me that in any case, I need to go back into the room and that they need to talk to me about my beard.' The officers wrote down the man's identity details. Then they began to tell him and another Muslim man in the office that Uzbekistan's economy 'will blossom and that we need to be patient for a couple more years. Everything will be in order soon.' When the man complained that he had many family chores to do and that he was in a hurry, the officers agreed to release him but warned that he should shave his beard. Several of these Muslim men told Forum 18 that police officers 'sit in the Mosque and wait for any bearded Muslim men to visit so they can catch them'. The Muslims said that they believe that the authorities are doing this 'because they want to bring the visibility of Islam to a very minimum since they are afraid that practicing Muslims can influence society against their decisions and policies'.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWeQzS3TUXLMg4GaAZ49YBuA	2025-03-18T16:37:11-07:00	
Devil In The Detail Of Kallas’s Multi-Billion Military Aid Plan F...	By Alexandra Brzozowski (EurActiv) -- EU countries are hashing out the details of a new multi-billion Ukraine military aid plan, but key sticking points on participation and calculating contributions remain. EU foreign ministers on Monday discussed the latest draft of the plan, circulated among EU member states and reported by Euractiv last week, under which between €20-€40 billion worth of military aid to Ukraine this year could be mobilised. 'There is broad political support for a €40 billion defence initiative, but of course, now the discussion is about the details,' the EU’s top diplomat, Kaja Kallas, told reporters after the talks. Kallas added that 'everyone at the table understood that we have to demonstrate our resolve right now and support Ukraine so that it can defend itself.' The plan, as pitched, includes spending €5 billion on 2 million rounds of large-calibre artillery ammunition and further spending on air defence systems, missiles, drones, fighter jets, and other lethal and non-lethal equipment. EU leaders are expected to discuss the initiative when they meet in Brussels on Thursday after they did not go into detail on the issue two weeks ago. An early version of the draft summit conclusions, seen by Euractiv, does not directly reference the Kallas initiative. According to EU diplomats, most countries – including Croatia, Germany, Netherlands, Finland, Sweden, Denmark, Czechia, Romania, Poland and the Baltics, among others – are in favour of moving towards a quick agreement and attaching a rather ambitious figure to the proposal. But a number of details remain unclear – including the total value of the package. EU diplomats have described the discussions as 'complicated' and said they do not expect an agreement this week. Contributing 'their fair share' One possible solution would be to seek a ’coalition of the willing’ for in-kind and in-cash contributions to the future fund, rather than a financial instrument based on the consent of the entire EU27. This would help bypass potential vetoes by Hungary, which is expected to uphold its long-standing opposition to providing any further military support to Ukraine. Foreign Minister Péter Szijjártó reiterated again on Monday that Budapest 'will not be dragged into this, nor will we let Hungarian taxpayers' money be used to finance arms supplies to Ukraine.' Slovakia, too, has said it will not participate in the fund. Kallas’ plan would also allow the inclusion of non-EU countries such as Norway or the United Kingdom, though it remains still unclear under which conditions they would be included. Even more difficult is the issue of how each participating country's contribution would be calculated. According to the latest proposal, contributions would be determined by using the gross national income (GNI) as a key indicator, which would ensure that countries provide donations according to their 'economic weight.' While this is seen as fair by the vast majority of smaller EU member states, which have often punched above their economic weight in supplying aid to Ukraine aid, larger countries – including France, Italy and Spain – remain reluctant. But this weighting would compel countries that have contributed less than northern or eastern European countries to 'contribute their fair share,' one EU diplomat said. Another sticking point remains the accounting of pledges. According to the latest proposal, support 'provided in-kind since 24 February 2025' will be taken into account in the figure attached to the fund, though some EU diplomats have raised the issue of countries double-pledging the same amount – once nationally and again as part of the EU-level fund. 'The [Kallas] initiative helps to structure and focus the mind, and all the talk about double counting or not (…) is a question of whether the cat is black or white [whether the money is fresh or not],' a second EU diplomat said. It remains unclear how future security guarantees to Ukraine, such as potential policing of the ceasefire with boots on the ground, would be accounted for if they would happen this year. EU member states have also asked for clarification as to how the €18 billion from the windfall profits from Russia's frozen assets would be taken into account.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWeQzS3TUXLMg-tp98OQTKrf	2025-03-18T16:35:36-07:00	
China Steps Up Air And Sea Incursions Near Taiwan	China has increased incursions by its aircraft and warships in the Taiwan Strait with 59 sorties reported from Monday evening to Tuesday morning, as it repeated warnings against any 'external interference' on the 'Taiwan question.' Taiwan’s ministry of defense said 43 of the sorties crossed the median line in the strait, which has long served as the de-facto boundary between the self-governed island and the mainland. Besides fighter jets, a number of unmanned aerial vehicles, or drones, were deployed, as well as two balloons. Taiwan’s armed forces 'closely monitor maritime and aerial activities,' and are conducting joint operations to track and respond to Chinese incursions, the island’s ministry said. Beijing considers Taiwan a breakaway province that needs to be 'reunified' with China, by force if necessary. China has waged a campaign against what it sees as 'separatist' efforts by Taiwan and warned other countries against 'meddling in the Taiwan issue.' Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Mao Ning told a regular press briefing on Monday that Beijing 'firmly opposes official interaction of any form between China’s Taiwan region and countries having diplomatic ties with China.' 'The Taiwan question is at the core of China’s core interests, which brooks no external interference,' Mao said, repeating a long-held position. 'The government of the People’s Republic of China is the sole legal government representing the whole of China,' the spokeswoman said. 'Taiwan is never a country, not in the past, and never in the future.' China often steps up incursions and warnings in response to visits to the island by U.S. legislators, or visits overseas by the island’s leader, but there was no obvious factor being this week’s activity apart from recent diplomatic efforts by Taiwan to reinforce cooperation with 'like-minded' countries and democracies. Taiwan immediately dismissed the Chinese spokesperson’s comments. 'Such clichés that contradict the facts, reverse right and wrong, and go against the will of the 23.5 million Taiwanese people are not worth refuting,' the island’s foreign ministry said. The ministry reiterated its position that Taiwan is 'a sovereign and independent country.' 'China has no right to interfere in the exercise of any legitimate rights of a sovereign state,' it said. Foreign ministers of the Group 7 world’s most developed countries emphasized at a meeting last week 'the importance of maintaining peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait.' The ministers reiterated in a statement their opposition to any unilateral attempts to change the status quo by force or coercion.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWeQzS3TUXLMgwSHmejqXhNe	2025-03-18T16:33:40-07:00	
How Russia Could Leverage A Ceasefire To Pressure Ukraine – OpEd	Russian President Vladimir Putin is once again playing a calculated game with the proposed ceasefire deal. Putin’s response has been predictably shrewd. He has not outright rejected the proposal, but his conditions—a Ukrainian renunciation of NATO ambitions and territorial concessions—make any deal rather tricky. However, one thing is certain. If a ceasefire does materialize, it will not be on terms favorable to Kyiv. Rather, it will serve as a tool for Putin to secure long-term strategic advantages. The Russian military has suffered significant losses, and a month-long pause could allow the Kremlin to replenish supplies, redeploy troops, and reinforce occupied territories. A ceasefire could serve as a tactical breather rather than a genuine step toward peace. Putin understands that Western support for Ukraine is not infinite. By agreeing to a temporary cessation of hostilities, he can test the resolve of Kyiv’s backers and potentially create fissures in the coalition supporting Ukraine. European nations, fatigued by war and economic strain, may be more inclined to push Ukraine into concessions after a period of reduced conflict. Russia can also use the ceasefire as a diplomatic weapon. By signaling a willingness to engage in talks while simultaneously setting impossible conditions, Putin could paint himself as the reasonable actor while framing Ukraine and the West as obstructing peace. This would play well in the Global South, where Moscow has already made inroads through energy and security partnerships. Finally, with Trump unlikely to unconditionally support Ukraine, Putin sees an opportunity to force Ukrainian leader Volodymyr Zelensky into a corner. Trump’s approach to Ukraine has been transactional at best. Reports suggest that Trump’s team has been squeezing Zelensky on a potential rare mineral deal, a clear indication that Kyiv cannot expect unwavering support from Washington. The recent pause in military support and intelligence-sharing was also a sign of U.S. fickleness. Without strong American backing, Zelensky may face increasing pressure to make painful compromises. Although Trump has voiced support for a ceasefire, his dealings with Putin suggest that he is far less interested in extracting serious concessions from Moscow than he is in pressuring Ukraine. During his recent meeting with Zelensky, Trump’s tone was more demanding than supportive. At the same time, Putin has been careful not to alienate Trump. This puts Zelensky in a precarious position. Ukraine could be forced to negotiate from a weaker stance, particularly on territorial issues. Despite Ukraine’s refusal to formally cede land, a de facto recognition of Russian control over certain regions could become an unavoidable reality. Furthermore, the rare mineral deal that Trump’s allies are pushing has broader implications. If the United States sees strategic economic benefit in working with Ukraine’s mineral sector, but only under certain conditions, then Zelensky’s negotiating power in any ceasefire deal could be further eroded. Putin, always adept at reading geopolitical currents, will see this as an opening to demand even more concessions. Putin’s long-term vision remains unchanged: he seeks to weaken Ukraine as a sovereign state, drive a wedge between Western allies, and solidify Russia’s geopolitical position. If Moscow ultimately backs a ceasefire deal, it won’t be out of a genuine interest in genuine peace but because it serves Russian interests. A ceasefire with Russian forces still in control of occupied areas will effectively cement Moscow’s hold on those territories, making it harder for Ukraine to reclaim them diplomatically or militarily in the future. The longer the conflict drags on, the more divided the West could become and the less support Ukraine can expect from its allies. If the ceasefire fails due to Russia’s demands, Putin can blame the West for refusing to make peace. This is particularly useful for bolstering Russian narratives internationally, particularly among nations that are ambivalent about the conflict. And if Trump continues to distance himself from Ukraine, other global powers such as China and India may deepen their economic and strategic ties with Russia, further insulating Moscow from Western pressure and sanctions. The UK’s Kier Starmer, France’s Emmanuel Macron, and other Western leaders are pushing for a durable peace. Putin’s track record, however, suggests that he is merely buying time for his next move while looking for ways to exploit any fractures in Western resolve. He is playing the long game. The real question is whether the West is prepared to counter him with equal determination over the long term, or whether Ukraine will be left to fend for itself in the face of Russian pressure and shifting U.S. priorities.

The Trauma Will Be Instagrammed: Wombat Handlings Down Under – Op...	The influencer might be defined as a modern, junked cretin of arrested moral and ethical capacity – with specific skills. Such an individual, for instance, is often able to use technological platforms with aptitude for two mundane purposes: to manipulate the gullible and rake in the cash. The essence of this effort lies in the technology. Drone drumming feeds, instant imaging, updates on the guff and drivel of a visit (probably false) to some venue or location, a product’s claimed merits (almost certainly false) and some scientific proposition (absolutely false). Sam Jones, who claims to be such an influencer, and a wildlife biologist and environmental scientist to boot, thought it wise to pick up a young wombat, thereby separating it from its distressed mother. The whole episode was, unnaturally, filmed. Even for someone of Jones’s sparse intellect, she at least observed the following: 'Momma’s right there and she’s pissed. Let’s let him go.' She makes some effort to beef up her credibility by claiming the following: 'I ran, not to rip the joey away from its mother, but from fear that she might attack me.' At the end of the now deleted video, she claims that she did reunite the mother and joey, though did so by essentially making them potential roadkill victims. Her account remains inconsistent and contradictory, something not helped by her record of images on Instagram displaying an evident, bloodthirsty delight for the hunt. Carcasses of slain animals feature, suggesting a desire to accumulate trophies rather than promoting any keen environmental interest. Jones remains, in that sense, rather traditional: the exotic, the bizarre or the dangerous shall be killed, snapped by camera or just teased for social media purposes. There is no evident awareness about the cruelty inherent in these measures. The response to Jones in Australia proved heated. A petition seeking deportation was launched, receiving over 40,000 signatures. The Wombat Protection Society expressed shock at the 'mishandling of a wombat joey in an apparent snatch for ‘social media likes’.' Even the Prime Minister, Anthony Albanese, thought it worth mentioning. 'It’s a shocker. You know, a wombat is a slow moving, peaceful animal, and to take a baby wombat from its mum was distressing, quite clearly,' he spoke in a radio interview. He also claimed to have found the video 'really distressing', wondering 'what the hell this woman thought she was doing.' Jones herself claims to have been threatened by 'thousands' of the irate. A number of academics from Australian universities tell us, in tepid language via The Conversation, that this sort of behaviour is becoming ever more frequent. 'Unfortunately,' they lament, 'we are seeing a rise in people directly interacting with wildlife through feeding them or taking risks to get close to them, often driven by the pursuit of social media attention. These interactions can hurt wildlife in many different ways.' They also note that Jones was fortunate not to receive injuries, given that wombats can 'weigh up to 40 kilograms and have teeth and claws they can use for defence.' Furthermore, she might (here, the delight is barely concealed) have gotten scabies, given the mange many wombats have caused by the relevant parasitic mite. The incident does give us some room for pause. Mighty moralism about Australia’s treatment of animals is certainly something to question from the start. Foamy indignation at the behaviour of a visitor offers mighty distraction given Australia’s less than comfortable relationship with its various species. Jones herself alludes to this by pointing out the 'treatment of its native wildlife', which includes the expenditure of 'millions of your tax dollars to mass slaughter native Australian animals, as well as Snowy River and Kosciuszko brumbies, wild pigs and numerous deer species.' Peter Singer, the noted Australian bioethicist and author of the seminal tract Animal Liberation, feels that Jones is on some sensible ground. He takes particular issue with harvesting kangaroos for commercial profit and reducing their numbers as competitors for pasture. He also notes, however, that the destruction of wombats remains less widespread, while also grudgingly conceding that culling pest species that pose a threat to native habitats and wildlife may be necessary. Jones could also count on partial agreement from Tania Clancy of Wombatised, a volunteer wildlife rescue and rehabilitation group. 'Thousands [of wombats] each year are shot, poisoned to suffer, and trapped legally,' she notes. 'Landowners rip up wombat burrows with heavy machinery, poison them with fumigation and shoot them whenever they can.' For a continent that tops the league table of species extinction, indignation at such acts of stupidity and exploitation requires some cooling. The animals of Australia are superficially revered for their singular qualities but their treatment by the human populace has been less than admirable. Be it debatable culling practices, expansive land clearing, the ongoing and insatiable hunger for exporting commodities and the unshakeable power of the mining industry in politics, Mother Nature Down Under has been, and continues to be roughed and violated. The current federal government also demonstrated an almost head-high contempt in abandoning the creation of an Environmental Protection Agency, something that arose, in large part, from state premiers worried about a puncture in mining profits. Besides, animal species don’t tend to go to the ballot box. At the very least, the insufferable, trophy craving simpleton who took that wombat joey from its mother for sporting shots brought some attention to the fraught relationship between humans and Australia’s beleaguered animal species.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWeQzS3TUXLMg7zYoWJ9HXPv	2025-03-18T16:29:33-07:00	
Palestinians’ Lives Blocked By Checkpoints – OpEd	By Yossi Mekelberg One of the most visible and disturbing symbols of the Israeli occupation of the West Bank, one that makes the hardships of the Palestinians living there even more unbearable, are the checkpoints. The long wait to cross them, or often to be turned back, hinders people from getting to work, from getting to a medical appointment on time, from seeing family and friends or from reaching school. But above all it creates a strong sense of humiliation. If you are a Palestinian, regardless of age or gender, you are at the mercy of young soldiers, often teenagers, who, after hours of making you wait, can decide whether you can continue to your destination. You can stand there for hours on end exposed to the elements — in the scorching summer heat or the cold and muddy conditions of the winter — enduring this routine that is at least as much about grinding the local population into submission as it is about security. To be fair, many soldiers see their time on checkpoint duty as the worst part of their service because they feel the mental burden that comes with these daily episodes of friction with the local population. I recall a conversation with a young soldier who told me that the thought of the power asymmetry between himself, armed to the teeth, and the civilians whose fear he could see in their eyes while they presented their IDs and begged him to let them pass kept him awake at night. It made it even more difficult, he said, if they were frail or sick or on their way to receive medical treatment, sometimes even for a lifesaving procedure, or if they were pregnant and on the way to give birth. However, there are also those soldiers who abuse this position of power — and they are usually able to do so with complete impunity. Above all, checkpoints represent the banal routine of an oppressive occupation that is a blight on the daily lives of ordinary people, as well as demonstrating the asymmetric power relations between the occupiers and the occupied. Nearly a quarter of a century ago, three Jewish Jerusalemite women of conscience, after encountering a military checkpoint in the West Bank for the first time, founded a nongovernmental organization and named it Machsom Watch (Checkpoint Watch). There are now 500 women activists who expose and document the ills of the occupation, but above all the mushrooming number of checkpoints and how they operate. For instance, they recently reported that on the first Friday of Ramadan, people who braved the wet weather from across the West Bank to reach the infamous Qalandiya Checkpoint, in the faint hope of reaching Jerusalem for prayers, were all turned back. Worse, they described the experience as follows: 'Unlike previous Ramadan Fridays, (on this day) no attempts were made to prettify toughness of heart, no holiday greetings from the ruler, no (relaxing of the rules) like humanitarian passage and/or lighter restrictions for women, children and the elderly. All people, rejected regardless of gender, age and state of health, no longer had the right to observe their faith and pray at their holy shrine.' In other words, not a semblance of pretense anymore that checkpoints are a necessary evil of Israel’s security within the Green Line; instead, they are simply about control and treating the entire Palestinian population as the enemy. The network of checkpoints, dozens of them permanent, others temporary, was spread out all over the West Bank well before Oct. 7, 2023, and since then many more have been appearing suddenly and with no warning, immediately disrupting lives. In early 2023, the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs documented 645 physical obstacles in the West Bank and East Jerusalem, ranging from 49 checkpoints constantly staffed by Israeli forces or private security companies to other occasionally staffed roadblocks, earth mounds, road gates, road barriers and trenches. This figure did not include the Israeli-controlled area of Hebron, where there are dozens more checkpoints and obstacles, many equipped with metal detectors, surveillance cameras and facial recognition technology, and with facilities for detention and interrogation. To ensure the security of about 1,000 ultra-extremist settlers, the movements of at least 30,000 Palestinians who live in the Israeli-controlled part of the city have been turned into a living hell. And all these restrictions and obstacles are for the benefit of those who declare that under no circumstances do they wish for peaceful coexistence between equals in this city. This extreme situation epitomizes the broader phenomenon of limiting the freedom of movement of Palestinians in the West Bank and the situation has worsened since the Oct. 7 attacks. Almost 100 more obstacles have been erected since then. This is in addition to the 712 km-long separation barrier, which Israel began building in 2002 and is the single largest obstacle to the free movement of Palestinians, but not Israelis. Admittedly, Israel began erecting this barrier during the Second Intifada, with the aim of containing terrorist attacks inside Israel, but this does not explain why it was not built along the Green Line. Instead, about 85 percent of the barrier’s route winds through the West Bank, which is occupied by Israel, and restricts and disrupts the freedom of movement of Palestinians either permanently or irregularly. The original idea might have been security, but with the influence of the leaders of the settlements and their political allies, it has become more an instrument to further a future annexation. By now, the enormous number of restrictions by checkpoints that prevent, for instance, farmers from cultivating their land and people from getting to work or to worship, let alone the danger of being arrested and even shot should they be suspected of not following the instructions of those guarding the checkpoints, suggests that the balance between security and oppression has long since tilted toward the latter. When ambulances are treated at checkpoints like any other vehicle, as some evidence suggests, this is deliberately reckless and is simply about demonstrating who rules the roost in this land. For most Palestinians, this is their only engagement with Israelis and it leaves with them an extremely bad taste in their mouth. While the morality, or more accurately the immorality, of this situation does not need much elaboration, it leaves open the question: How do those who design and impose these policies think that they could possibly be serving Israel’s interests? After all, they only increase resentment, damage the economy and leave many Palestinians feeling humiliated. But the messianic ultranationalists, in addition to satisfying their power trip, believe that all this expedites annexation and even transfer, leaving peace and reconciliation between the two peoples so much harder to achieve.

Russia: Xenophobic Crackdown On Central Asian Migrants – HRW Repo...	Central Asian labor migrants in Russia have been experiencing increased xenophobic harassment, hate speech, and violence since the deadly attack attributed to Central Asians on Moscow’s Crocus City Hall on March 22, 2024, Human Rights Watch said in a report released Tuesday. The 63-page report, 'Living in Fear and Humiliation: Rising Xenophobic Harassment and Violence towards Central Asian Migrants in Russia,' documents that Central Asian migrants, mostly from Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, and Kyrgyzstan working in Russia face ethnic profiling, arbitrary arrests, and harassment by police and private actors, including far-right nationalist groups. Migrants are also subject to new, often abusive administrative restrictions. Following the attack, Russian officials doubled down, fanning the fire of racist and anti-migrant public sentiments. Russian authorities should condemn any expression of xenophobia, including by their own officials, and work to ensure full compliance with the rights of migrants. 'As the first anniversary of the Crocus City Hall attack is approaching, our hearts go out to the victims and their family members,' said Syinat Sultanalieva, Central Asia researcher at Human Rights Watch and the report’s author. 'However, the heinous massacre cannot justify massive rights abuses against Central Asian migrants in Russia.' Human Rights Watch interviewed Central Asian migrants with experience of working in Russia, as well as lawyers, civil society leaders, and other experts from Russia and Central Asia. Human Rights Watch also analyzed relevant media including videos shared on social media of hate-motivated attacks on Central Asian migrants. Russia’s economy is heavily dependent on migrant labor. Close to 3.3 million migrant workers from Central Asia were in Russia in 2024. Before the full-scale invasion of Ukraine, Russian authorities largely succeeded in stifling ultra-nationalist groups, however a new generation of ultranationalists has recently emerged. On March 22, 2024, gunmen attacked Crocus City Hall in the outskirts of Moscow during a heavily attended concert, killing at least 144 people and injuring 551. Russian authorities detained 4 Tajikistan citizens as the main suspects, and at least 23 others, mostly of Central Asian origin, suspected of connections to the gunmen. Russian law enforcement brutally tortured at least two of the suspects, with Russian federal television broadcasting recordings of the torture. The suspects have yet to face trial. In the summer of 2024, Russian authorities amended laws regulating the legal status of foreigners in Russia to grant police broader authority to expel migrants without specific court orders. The authorities also created a 'registry of controlled persons,' a database of migrants with expired permits. Since taking effect in February 2025, these changes have prevented hundreds of migrants who were in the country legally from accessing their Russian bank accounts due to technical issues with the registry system. 'The life of migrants here today is mired in constant fear and humiliation to put it mildly,' a 34-year-old migrant from Tajikistan living in Moscow told Human Rights Watch. 'Every day we face discrimination, cruelty on the part of the law enforcement. The police start creating problems when they see an Asian-looking person.' Under legislation adopted in 2024, foreign children need to prove Russian language proficiency to enter public schools. The requirement effectively legitimizes the pre-existing practice of schools across Russia refusing admission to children of Central Asian migrants. Authorities in several regions of Russia have banned migrants from working in certain job sectors, including education, commerce, social services, public transportation, culture, and entertainment. As part of Russia's war in Ukraine, Central Asian migrants and naturalized Russian citizens of Central Asian origin have been increasingly targeted for military recruitment, with Russian authorities often using arbitrary detention and threats of deportation to force them to enlist. '[Police tell migrants:] ‘You've been working here for so many years, shame on you, now protect us, give back to the country that has fed you for so long!’' said Rakhat Sagynbek, a migration expert at Insan-Leilek, a Kyrgyz nongovernmental organization providing support to labor migrants in Russia. 'They give them [detained migrants] the ultimate choice of between being deported or serving [in the armed forces].' Human Rights Watch analyzed 17 cases from a database collated by Nazi Video Monitoring Project, a group of Russian anti-fascist activists, from Telegram channels run by xenophobic and neo-Nazi groups. The cases involve coordinated physical assaults by young Slavic-looking men on Central Asian men working in construction, maintenance, and service sectors. The attacks – beatings or with pepper-spray – were often accompanied by ethnic slurs or xenophobic statements in the captions to the videos filmed by the assailants. Although Russia has a criminal law banning 'incitement of interethnic hate,' it is rarely applied in connection with xenophobic violence against Central Asians. Most cases of xenophobic violence that make it to trial are prosecuted on charges of 'hooliganism' or other criminal charges without the 'hate' component. Human Rights Watch presented its research findings to appropriate authorities in Kyrgyzstan, Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, and Russia. The government of Kyrgyzstan is the only one that responded. Russia has obligations under international human rights law to protect the rights of everyone within their territory without discrimination, including on grounds of national or ethnic origin. Those rights include the rights to life and to security, freedom from inhuman and degrading treatment and arbitrary detention, freedom of movement, privacy, education, and equality before the law. Russian authorities should adopt and enforce a zero-tolerance policy for anti-migrant hate speech, effectively address xenophobic violence experienced by migrants, and retract abusive legislation that significantly curtails migrant rights, Human Rights Watch said. The United Nations and its member-states should work with governments in Central Asia to make a strong call on Russia to protect migrants’ rights. Central Asian governments should build on existing consular programs to support migrant workers in Russia by treating this issue as a core part of their bilateral relations with Moscow, including by urging zero tolerance of xenophobic violence and anti-migrant hate speech, and creating joint initiatives with their Russian counterparts to protect migrants’ rights. United Nations bodies and the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe should urge the Russian authorities to condemn and investigate all xenophobic attacks against Central Asians in Russia and to retract the new abusive legislation on migrants, including the 'expulsion regime.' 'Russia should protect migrant workers’ safety, recognize the important contribution they make to the country’s economy, and commit to investigating all incidents of xenophobic violence, and holding those responsible to account,' Sultanalieva said.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWeQzS3TUXLMg4uDkM6vvIW0	2025-03-18T16:26:05-07:00	
Why Saint Joseph Is Exactly What Our Families Need Today – OpEd	In our wounded world of family breakdown, what we need is not another self-help program or government initiative—we need Saint Joseph. As his feast day approaches on March 19th, I am convinced that this quiet carpenter from Nazareth offers something our families desperately lack: a model of steadfast courage in the face of seemingly impossible circumstances. Our Current Family Crisis Let us be honest about the state of families today. Look at India, where I have witnessed families torn apart by economic necessity—like the Kumars, whose father works construction in Delhi while his wife raises three children alone in Bihar. They represent millions living below the poverty line, where family relationships are sacrificed on the altar of survival. Or consider Julie, a single mother in Chennai who fled an abusive husband, now working night shifts while raising two terrified children. These are not isolated cases—they are symptoms of a global family breakdown that no policy alone can fix. The digital age has only accelerated this crisis. Children are raised by screens while parents drown in work demands. Extended families fragment as migration separates generations. And when did we decide that commitment was optional? The modern message that personal fulfillment trumps family obligation has left a trail of broken homes and wounded children. Something is profoundly wrong, and I believe we are looking for solutions in all the wrong places. Joseph's Radical Response to Crisis This is precisely why Saint Joseph's example is so revolutionary today. Consider his situation: his fiancée is unexpectedly pregnant, not by him. In his cultural context, this was catastrophic—grounds for public shame and even stoning. Yet Scripture tells us this 'righteous man' (Matthew 1:19) chose mercy over judgment, deciding to divorce Mary quietly rather than expose her to shame. But what happens next reveals why Joseph is the hero our families need. When an angel explains God's plan in a dream, Joseph does something radical: he believes. He takes Mary as his wife, embracing a child not biologically his own, accepting public misunderstanding and ridicule. In a culture obsessed with DNA tests and biological rights, Joseph's example is counter-cultural. He shows us that true fatherhood is not about genetics but about presence and sacrifice. I would argue that if more men followed Joseph's example of stepping up rather than stepping away when families face crisis, we would see transformation in our communities. Joseph offers an alternative to the epidemic of absent fathers and wounded homes. Protection Over Comfort Joseph's protective instinct is another quality our families desperately need to reclaim. When Herod threatens Jesus, Joseph does not form a committee or wait for perfect circumstances—he acts immediately, fleeing to Egypt in the middle of the night (Matthew 2:13-15). In our safety-obsessed culture where parents bubble-wrap childhoods but fail to protect against real spiritual and moral dangers, Joseph's vigilance is refreshing. I have seen too many parents who shield their children from every physical risk while leaving them exposed to digital predators, destructive ideologies, and moral confusion. True protection requires Joseph's courage to make difficult, counter-cultural decisions—like the Gaikwad family in Mumbai who limited screen time and prioritized faith formation despite ridicule from more 'progressive' relatives. We should be asking: Are we protecting what truly matters in our families? Or are we merely providing comfortable lives while neglecting the deeper protection our children need? Work as Love Made Visible I am particularly struck by how Joseph's work ethic challenges our culture's dysfunctional relationship with labor. As a carpenter, Joseph did not have a glamorous career or impressive title. Yet his simple trade supported the Holy Family and taught Jesus a skill. This stands in stark contrast to our status-obsessed culture where parents work punishing hours for lifestyle upgrades while missing their children's formative years. I have known families where both parents work sixty-hour weeks to maintain a certain neighborhood or private school, only to discover their teenager is struggling with addiction or depression due to their functional absence. Joseph reminds us that work should serve family, not the other way around. His example calls us to examine whether our careers have become idols demanding family sacrifice rather than tools supporting family flourishing. Mr. Patil's small shop in Mumbai exemplifies this priority—he could expand his business but chooses not to because it would cost him evening meals with his children. That is a Josephite decision our workaholic culture desperately needs. Education Beyond Academics Perhaps most relevant to today's anxious parents is Joseph's role in Jesus's formation. He did not focus narrowly on the equivalent of standardized tests or college admissions—instead, Scripture tells us Jesus 'increased in wisdom and stature' (Luke 2:52) under Joseph's guidance. I believe our educational obsessions are failing our children. We have reduced formation to test scores while neglecting character, wisdom, and spiritual development. The families I have seen thrive despite challenging circumstances—like immigrant families maintaining cultural and spiritual traditions while adapting to new societies—prioritize holistic formation over narrow academic achievement. Joseph taught Jesus not just carpentry skills but the Jewish Scriptures, cultural traditions, and moral framework. This challenges our over-specialized, outsourced approach to child development where soccer goes to the coach, math to the tutor, and moral formation to... well, often nobody. Joseph's comprehensive approach to formation offers a corrective to our fragmented educational vision. A Counter-Cultural Choice Let me be clear: I am not suggesting a nostalgic return to some idealized past. Rather, I am arguing that Saint Joseph offers a timeless counter-narrative to our culture's failed family experiments. His virtues of courageous protection, dignified work, comprehensive formation, and faithful presence are precisely what our wounded families lack. The families I have seen flourish despite adversity—whether in India's slums or America's struggling neighborhoods—share these Josephite qualities. They prioritize presence over convenience, protection over popularity, formation over entertainment, and commitment over personal preference. As Saint Joseph's feast approaches, we face a choice: continue down our current path of family disintegration or embrace Joseph's radical alternative. I believe our families do not need more freedom from commitment but rather the freedom that comes through commitment—the kind Joseph modeled in his quiet, steadfast care for Mary and Jesus. Our families are too important, and too fragile, to settle for anything less than Joseph's example of sacrificial love. In a culture that celebrates convenience over commitment, Joseph stands as a revolutionary figure—one whose feast day should inspire not just Catholic devotion but a profound rethinking of how we approach family life in our troubled times.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWeQzS3TUXLMg6sSSsc5qp0X	2025-03-18T16:24:20-07:00	
Bangladeshis Rise Against Mounting Lawlessness, US Intelligence E...	Mounting lawlessness in Bangladesh has triggered widespread street protests against the inaction and incompetence of the Muhammad Yunus-led Interim Government. US intelligence chief Tulsi Gabbard has expressed America's concern in no uncertain terms. Neighbouring India is helplessly watching the deterioration in governance at its very doorstep. While Bangladeshi politicians are interminably debating post-Hasina political reforms, elections, and ways to neutralize ousted Premier Sheikh Hasina, the average Bangladeshi is worried about the near-complete breakdown of law order, seen in a spate of mob lynching and mounting cases of rape and gender violence since the Interim Government led by Dr.Yunus took over in August 2024. According to the Human Rights Support Society of Bangladesh (HRSS), at least 119 people were killed and 74 injured in 114 mob lynching cases in seven months since the Interim Government took office. In January and February alone, there were 30 cases of mob lynching, resulting in 19 deaths and 20 injuries, the report added. The HRSS Executive Director Ijazul Islam, said that those lynched were suspected thieves, muggers, child kidnapers and violators of Islamic codes for females. Cases were filed, but few were fully investigated, with the result, the perpetrators went unpunished, Ijazul Islam added. Though mob lynching has been a long-standing issue in Bangladesh, it has intensified now given the deterioration in political conditions since August last year when there was a sudden change of regime. More groups are feeling empowered to take the law into their hands. Given the inherent weakness of the Muhammad Yunus- led Interim Government, a manifest disorganization in the police, judiciary and the bureaucracy, and with the army playing a mute spectator, it is now a free for all. 'Might is Right' in this state of anomie. As per the HRSS report again, in January and February 2005, there were 107 cases of rape, amongst which, child rape numbered 66 and gang rape 27. There was one murder after rape. However, the problem of rape is not new. Quoting statistics from the Law and Arbitration Centre, Reuters said that 3,438 child rape cases were filed in Bangladesh in the last eight years. Actually there were many more child rape victims than reported. At least 539 of them were under the age of six, and 933 between the ages of seven and twelve. Research showed that in most cases, children were sexually abused or raped by people they knew. Be that as it may, some of the recent cases are shocking. In Chittagong, a 52-year-old man was apprehended for raping a 10-year-old girl. In Dhaka, a 13-year-old child was admitted to the One-Stop Crisis Centre at Dhaka Medical College Hospital (DMCH) following a brutal sexual assault by her close relations. The girl died in hospital. A father was accused of raping his own daughter. A pregnant woman was gang-raped in Keraniganj. A stepfather in Narayanganj was arrested for filming and attempting to rape a teenage girl. According to police headquarters data, put out in the media, the cases of violence against women and children had surged by 19.5% from December 2024 to January 2025. Harassment of Modern Women On March 1, a man, Golam Mostakim Rintu, took offence to two young women smoking at a tea stall in Dhaka's Lalmatia area and abused them. An altercation that followed led to an assault on the women by the self-styled moral policeman and his gang. Golam Mostakim Rintu had grabbed the women's hair, slapped and kicked them. A bystander who had rushed to the aid of the girls, was beaten black and blue. A 11-second video footage of the incident went viral. What was more shocking, was the authorities' response to the incident. Instead of condemning the mob attack, Home Advisor Gen. Jahangir Alam Chowdhury focused on the 'offence of smoking in public spaces.' Mahiya Tabassum of The Daily Star pointed out that according to the Smoking and Use of Tobacco Products (Control) Act, 2005, the location where the incident took place—a roadside tea stall—did not qualify as a 'designated non-smoking public place.' Gen.Chowdhury's attempt to shift the focus from the violence to the act of smoking in a public place was but a blatant effort to justify the assault and absolve the perpetrators, Tabassum wrote. Chowdhury's stance only bolstered those who would use the religious card to 'justify' the moral policing of women. Tabassum wondered if religious sensitivities could be used as an excuse to harass and curb women's freedom to choose their lifestyle? She charged that the Interim Government of Muhammad Yunus is more interested in placating its religious fundamentalist partners (like the Jamaat-i-Islami and the Hefazat-e-Islam Bangladesh) than in protecting the rights of Bangladesh's women. Compromise Agreement Despite the clear violations of the law, no legal action was taken against Rintu and others who attacked the women smokers. Instead, the victims were pressured into entering into a 'compromise agreement.' The agreement was signed by the victims' parents and not the victims themselves, undermining their autonomy and legal standing as adults, Tabassum pointed out. The media also reported that 'someone identifying himself as a powerful individual' had called the father of one of the victims and coerced him into signing it, further complicating the issue. The fact that law enforcement agencies had facilitated this agreement instead of proceeding with legal action reflected a gross misuse of discretionary power, Tabssum said. She went on to say that police are resorting to such 'compromise agreements' to cover up Gender Based Violence (GBV) cases. The reluctance to hold male perpetrators of GBV accountable reinforces the prevailing culture of impunity, where women are expected to endure harassment and violence without any recourse to justice, she pointed out. Misogyny runs deep in Bangladesh and in the Indian subcontinent in general. 'The entire ecosystem—spanning government officials, the media, law enforcement, and political parties—continues to perpetuate abuse,' Tabassum noted. She also highlighted the nefarious role of the media in diverting attention from the crime to something else only to save the perpetrators. For example, some media outlets reported that the protests staged by women against the spate of rapes was an 'Indian conspiracy.' Laws Disregarded Bangladesh has strong laws to protect women, including the Women and Children Repression Prevention Act (2000) and the Domestic Violence (Prevention and Protection) Act (2010). But commentator Farzana Hoque asked, 'What good are laws if they are not enforced?' She points out that women who report rape, harassment, or domestic abuse often find that police do not take them seriously. Court cases drag on for years and many criminals walk away free. Survivors who seek justice are often shamed, threatened, or pressured into staying silent. Justice delayed is justice denied but in Bangladesh, justice is often never rendered at all, Hoque submits. Nothing explains the problem of gender bias better than what happened at Dhaka University (DU) recently. A female student was harassed just because her dupatta (scarf) was not in the 'right place.' The harasser, one Arnob Sardar, felt it was his right to police what she wore. But the girl student stood up for herself and filed a police complaint. Sardar was arrested, but only to be let off on bail soon. The rise of digital platforms has also created new dangers. Women now face cyber harassment, online threats, and blackmail. Here too, instead of taking action, authorities often advise victims to 'just ignore it,' Hoque points out. Public Outcry The case of an 8-year-old girl being raped by her relations set off a huge public outcry. Student groups organised protests and human chains to demand justice and greater protection for women. Several groups demanded the resignation of Home Affairs Adviser Lt Gen (retd) Jahangir Alam Chowdhury. In response, the police launched a special hotline to address cases of domestic violence, sexual harassment, and rape. Collection of statistics is important, but if no action follows the exercise will be futile. The 'Bangladesh against Rape and Abuse,' a platform consisting of female activists and concerned citizens, had burned an effigy of the Home Affairs Adviser Gen. Jahangir Alam Chowdhury condemning the inaction against Golam Mostakim Rintu. US Concern The Director of US National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard said in New Delhi on Monday that the situation in Bangladesh is a 'major area of concern' for the United States, citing the persecution of religious minorities. In an interview with NDTV World, when asked about the situation in Bangladesh, she said, 'The long-time unfortunate persecution, killing, and abuse of religious minorities—Hindus, Buddhists, Christians, Catholics, and others—have been a major area of concern for the US government, President Trump and his administration.' 'The talks are just beginning between President Trump's new cabinet coming in and the Government of Bangladesh but this continues to remain a central focus area of concern. The threat of Islamist terrorists, and their overall effort, the global effort of all of these different groups, are rooted in the same ideology and objective — which is to rule or govern with an Islamist Caliphate. This obviously affects people of any other religion, other than the one that they find acceptable, and they chose to carry this out with terror and very violent ways and means.' She further said, 'President Trump remains committed to identifying the ideology that drives Islamist terrorism, and working to defeat this ideology and their ability to exact that terror on people, the American people and others.'	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWdy721aTMN3jRTRL8PLYtsU	2025-03-18T09:48:41-07:00	
Fragmentation Of Media Reality – OpEd	By Steve Clemons There is a hubris and inappropriate self-confidence among mainstream media that their practices and approaches to media are sound, and new entrants are unsound. They purport to present fact-checked truths while pointing to new media as promulgators of disinformation, poor journalism, AI-assisted deep fakes, and propaganda. My ‘provocation’ for those of you today attending the OSCE’s conference on the state of journalism and media broadly is that progress in assuring a healthy, socially responsible media consistent with democratic norms cannot come from just clinging to past platforms and norms. Let me offer some perspective on the fragmentation of media and what it means for society. First, the fragmentation of media has been a multi-decade phenomenon, driven not only by new digital tools and platforms but, particularly in the United States, by changes in law that previously guaranteed 'fair use' of airwaves so that anything that gave air to one political party’s perspective required fair time for the other political party. The Supreme Court and U.S. legislators gutted those provisions of fair use requirements long ago, and thus the harnessing of TV, Cable and Radio airwaves, and later blogs, and even leading newspapers and journals by political perspectives took hold. This has helped fuel the tribalization of perspectives and has driven the 'filter bubble' phenomenon of individuals being surrounded and inundated by views that they want to have around them, rather than the generally objective, occasionally uncomfortable form of news that used to inform the body politic. Similar patterns seem clear in the rise of populist news platforms, blogs, and social media networks in Europe. Second, the eruption of social media networks, video, and digital tools enhanced not only by artificial intelligence that has been around for some time, but by generative AI, that has created a strategic leap in the power content creators has changed the power relationship between news providers and news consumers. Now many more players, many untutored in the skills and norms of journalism, have become content providers, and that content often seems like or mimics news. I started a successful political blog, The Washington Note, in early 2004, and my target was the mainstream news media as I saw them largely as homogenized, lazy, often missing key stories — and thus my blog at the outset was designed to shame and blame major news media for their own inadequacies and to provide better news and service to my own readers. Many blogs did this, and thus 20 years ago, the fragmentation of media, in my view, helped improve mainstream media which had to compete and re-establish itself as providers of quality news — a responsibility for which they had been lazy and inattentive. However today, the challenges to mainstream media are messier as the challengers do not necessarily fill the gaps left by a poorly performing mainstream media — they instead often create fake or ‘unreal’ media, deep fakes, memes, or engage in outright propaganda or perpetuate mistruths. Not all new media do this, but there is no doubt that lots of new media are up for sale, up for political harnessing, up for attention and celebritization of their platforms and content. So what to do? I feel that too many governments, think tanks, and public private foundations concerned with news quality have been clutching their pearls too much, lamenting the eroding quality of journalism and news rather than competing head-to-head with new content providers and low-quality new media outlets. It seems clear to me that for media to return to a healthier place and to become part of the solid social contract in democratic societies, they need to evolve. My belief is that the deep fake creations of some media are worrisome but only have impact on vulnerable societies if there is no competition with them. How are old media investing in new tools of story-telling? How are they embracing a less centralized approach to who their story tellers might be? How could they be promulgating and inculcating a younger generation of content makers with norms about sourcing, about real facts, about objectivity, about the importance of uncomfortable news and not just opinion-reaffirming news or perspectives? How are they experimenting with all of the new waves of technology coming online to make themselves the more attractive news and content option — thus stealing space and oxygen from those who are faking it and deceiving society. My sense is that some states, Russia being just one, are taking advantage of this gap between old and new media — and they are exacerbating the negative impacts created by a lack of modernization and vision of traditional media platforms. My sense is that for the old media to grow and compete, they need to be part of the media fragmentation wave, and rather than over-centralizing need to figure out how to disseminate quality news across a fragmented sphere of options. This is hard to do - and it challenges the way newspapers and TV networks of record organize their work. But I believe that the fragmentation is not going away, and thus news organizations that want to assure their place in healthy civil society need to adapt.

Idols & Idealism: Swami Dayanand Saraswati, The Militant Monk Of ...	Swami Dayanand declared (in the first Charter of the Arya Samaj) ‘the well-being of the whole humanity will be the objective of the Samaja’. Two years later, in 1877, he expressed among the principles of the Arya Samaj that of doing good to the whole world, while improving the physical, spiritual, and social conditions of humanity. April 2025 will mark 150 years of the founding of the Arya Samaj Kathiawad, the peninsular region distinguishing India’s western coast at its farthest north end, continues to remain in the news for Dwarka and Somnath, its ancient temple-towns and temples. In 19th century CE, Kathiawad is where several champions of Indian nationalism were born: namely, Swami Dayanand Saraswati (1824-1883), Pandit Shyamaji Krishnaverma (1857-1930) and Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi (1869-1948). Each one of them spent their lives working for ‘freedom’ from colonial rule and oppressive policies towards education, law and human rights. The impact they made has. without doubt, shaped and molded not only contemporary India but the modern world till date. A 150 years ago, on 10 April 1875, Swami Dayanand established in Bombay the ‘Society of the Men with Higher Principles’ or the Arya Samaj that was to spread out its influence across India. As a preacher-teacher-public speaker, Swami Dayanand was passionate as his ideological predecessors in Bengal - Raja Rammohun Roy and Keshub Chunder Sen, driven by a universal kindness of the kind which is rarely experienced in our globalized world. Swami Dayanand Saraswati Swami Dayanand declared (in the first Charter of the Arya Samaj) ‘the well-being of the whole humanity will be the objective of the Samaja’. Two years later, in 1877, he expressed among the principles of the Arya Samaj that of doing good to the whole world, while improving the physical, spiritual, and social conditions of humanity. And in the Satyartha Prakash (The Light of the Truth) he wrote: 'I believe in a religion based on all-embracing universal principles, that have always been accepted as truths by mankind and will continue to be obeyed down the ages to come. I call this the Eternal Primitive Religion: because it is above the hostility of all human beliefs. This alone I hold to be acceptable and worth believing by all people and down all times.' Satyartha Prakash was written in Sanskrit. When Dr Prithwindra Mukherjee – a poet, historian, musicologist, translator – was writing his magnum opus The Intellectual Roots of India’s Freedom Struggle (1893-1918), he highlighted that most people believe India’s struggle for independence to have begun with Mahatma Gandhi. 'Little credit goes to the proof that this call for a mass movement did not arise out of a void. For the past century and more, historians have overlooked the phase of twenty-five years of intense creative endeavour preceding and preparing for the Mahatma’s advent. The reason for this systematic omission has been the fundamentally radical nature of the revolutionary programme put to practice by Indian leaders of late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries,' it stated. Dr Prithwindra’s study carefully detailed the origins – philosophical, historical and religious and intellectual, so to say – of Indian nationalism. From Raja Rammohun Roy (1772-1833), Mahatma Rajnarain Basu (1826-1899), Bankimchandra Chatterjee (1838-1894), Bal Gangadhar Tilak (1856-1920) to Rabindranath Tagore (1861-1941), Swami Vivekananda (1863-1902), and Sri Aurobindo (1872-1950). Swami Dayanand was one among these intellectual giants, who stood on each other’s shoulders and acquired a ‘very sophisticated understanding of the contemporary political reality’. They became emblems of their epoch, its aspirations. Eternal truth: The chapter on Swami Dayanand is titled ‘The Quest of the National Soul’ and it takes the reader through the life, times and teachings of the militant monk: 'At a very young age, disillusioned by abuses of idolatry, by social practices based on ignorance of the true spiritual life and on colonial exploitation, Dayanand put at the people’s service all his encyclopedic learning of the Hindu scriptures to revive Vedic teachings in order to solve contemporary problems, religious, social, political, and cultural. Having sworn not to borrow anything from Western thought, Dayanand never learned any European language. This permitted him to define the true nationalist existence inspired by the principles of a strictly Indian tradition and to go beyond the ritualistic and mytho-centric interpretations of the Vedas. Dayanand chalked out the general principles sufficient to regenerate the Indian nation. He considered the Vedas as ‘something more: the very speech of the eternal Truth on which can be founded—in a sure and justified manner—the human knowledge of God and man’s relationship with the divine being as well as with the like.' The challenge for Swami Dayanand was to show the compatibility of spiritual life and the science of national government. It may seem strange for modern global netizens but the Swami in his ‘Introduction to the commentaries of the Rigveda’ (Rigvedadi-bhashya-bhumika), interpreted a section of the Vedic verses in the light of burning political issues of the time. Wrote Dr Prithwindra, 'Uniting, thus, the innate intuition of Aryan spirituality with an acceptable rational methodology by dialectic mentality, Dayanand established the fundamental unity of the Indian people where the plurality of languages, of sects, of behaviours and of customs only assumed a superficial but enriching role. According to Dayanand, whatever the excellence of a foreign government, it could never replace the qualities of a self-management. To acquire the political independence of India as a nation chosen to reveal a new spiritual light to humanity, Dayanand undertook a programme of fierce struggle. This struggle would require: The exclusion of all ideological debt to foreign sources and the institution of an obligatory educational system for all children and teenagers (boys and girls), based on the residential academies of Vedic type (gurukula). ‘Be they princes and princesses or children of beggars, they will be submitted to the same food, sartorial regime, to the same absolute law of continence.’ The teaching would be physical, aesthetic (music, dance, theatrical art and authentic diction of the Vedic hymns), ethical, intellectual and spiritual.' The arduous programme of intellectual studies that Swami Dayanand recommended, has been reconstituted by B.B. Majumdar, a scholar who dedicated his life deepening the understanding Indian political thought. Spread over twenty-two years, the academic programme included: a) Phonetics; the grammar of Panini, the Mahabhasya of Patanjali (3 years); (b) The Vedic lexicon as established by Yaska in the Nirukta (8 months); (c) Prosody by Pingala (4 months); (d) The Laws of Manu, the Epics (the Ramayana, entirely and important portions of the Mahabharata); (e) The six orthodox Schools (darshana) of Indian philosophy and the ten main Upanishads (2 years); (f) All the four Vedas and the supplementary Brahmanas (6 years); (g) The science of life (Ayurveda) including medical and surgical treatises (4 years); (h) Music, arithmetic, algebra, geometry, geography, geology and astronomy (3 years); (i) Economics and policies, containing civil and military protections (2 years). Vedic scholars believe that as strength and the physical activity grow, the intellect of students becomes subtle enough to seize the most abstruse and profound subjects, hence they should have access to the highest knowledge. As citizens and parents of future citizens, they would be able to discharge their responsibilities. National character: On the subject of degradation of national character caused by the centuries of slavery, there is considerable unity of thought between these iconic intellectuals of the 19th century CE from Raja Rammohun Roy to Swami Vivekanand, Rabindranath Tagore and Mahatma Gandhi. With Swami Dayanand Saraswati, his insistence was on: (1) The personal integrity and health of the teachers. Each of them by his or her example should awaken among their subjects ‘qualities required such as truthfulness in words, in acts and in thought, decorum, the self-control, sweetness of conduct’. Among the gurukula institutions which strived to develop education in India, Sabarmati (the educational community founded by Gandhi), at Santiniketan and the Vishvabharati (school and university founded by Tagore), at Pondicherry (the International Centre of Education founded by the Mother based on Sri Aurobindo’s teachings) exemplify these standards. (2) The acceptance of Hindi as the national language and of the Vedas as the source of the people’s religious life. (3) A conversion of the strata of population, unjustly oppressed by the ignorance and the intolerance of Hindu orthodoxy. (4) The end of all foreign government in India: Swami Dayanand would raise his voice to endeavour to fight, humiliate, and destroy unbelievers, even if they were sovereign over the world, even if they were powerful. (5) Electing a president of the sovereign republic by universal suffrage, since the people are sovereign. Fiercely opposed to the autocratic reign, conscious of the fallibility and corruptibility of an individual propelled to the supreme command, Dayanand insisted on the vast learning and on the human qualities of the future president. According to Vedic injunctions, the State should be composed of three colleges of elected citizens, all of them known for their integrity: (a) the legislative college; (b) the religious college; (c) the college of fine arts and sciences. As per the Arya Samaj website, there are approximately 2500 schools, colleges and universities in operation under the Arya Samaj; 400 Gurukuls running on residential education system; several orphanages are being managed for upbringing of more than 20000 orphans; almost 1500 hospitals and dispensaries are serving the people. Besides there are training centres, homes for the aged and sick, training centres for women and residential centres for the youth studying in colleges and universities. The vision of Swami Dayanand Saraswati has become a reality. Prime Minister Narendra Modi remarked, on 200th birth anniversary of Swami Dayanand Saraswati on 11 February 2024, 'Swami Dayanand was a saint who envisioned a bright future for Bharat. The belief that Swami ji had in Bharat, we must transform that same belief into our self-confidence during our ‘Amrit Kaal’. Swami Dayanand was a harbinger and a guide of modernity. Inspired by him, all of us need to lead Bharat towards modernity in this ‘Amrit Kaal’, to make our country a ‘Viksit Bharat’ (Developed India).'	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWdy721aTMN3jSCPTXDW2KOw	2025-03-18T09:41:47-07:00	
A National Asbestos-Exposure Registry Of Veterans Could Combat Mi...	Many U.S. veterans are suffering from asbestos-related illnesses due to past military exposure, highlighting the urgent need for a national asbestos-exposure registry to improve early detection, diagnosis, and access to VA benefits. In 1922, the U.S. Navy identified the naturally occurring asbestos mineral as the most efficient and cost-effective insulation, gaskets, and shipbuilding material. During World War II, asbestos was critical to the U.S. military, especially the Navy and the Air Force. Shipping and shipbuilding were essential, and parts of military aircraft and incendiary bombs also contained asbestos. Even as demand exceeded supply, in 1942, a presidential order banned the use of asbestos for non-military purposes until 1945. The application of asbestos-based material by the military and most U.S. industries continued to increase until the 1970s, when its carcinogenic nature came to light. The use of asbestos started to be regulated but was not banned. The extensive application of asbestos by the U.S. armed forces led to asbestos-caused conditions, such as mesothelioma, asbestosis, and lung cancer, among veterans who were exposed to asbestos dust during their service years. As asbestos-related malignant illnesses can take between 20 and 50 years to start showing symptoms, the number of asbestos-caused deaths in the U.S. has been increasing in the past decades, and veterans are disproportionately affected. This is well illustrated by medical reports, which show that about one-third of mesothelioma patients are veterans. Mesothelioma is a deadly and aggressive cancer that is exclusively caused by asbestos exposure. Timely and appropriate diagnoses are the only option to find suitable treatment, alleviate symptoms, and prolong life expectancy when it comes to conditions caused by asbestos contamination. Unfortunately, the misdiagnosis of asbestos illnesses, especially mesothelioma, is far too common in the U.S. According to a medical study, about 14 to 50 percent of mesothelioma diagnoses are incorrect. The problem could be alleviated by having a national database enlisting military members with known and suspected asbestos exposure during their service years. Such a database would be an excellent tool for veterans' referrals to regular and specialized medical check-ups. The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) and the Department of Defense (DOD) need to consider setting up such a registry. Early Detection Is Crucial Mesothelioma and asbestosis are exclusively caused by asbestos exposure when people inhale airborne asbestos fibers. The microscopic mineral particles attack the lungs and the membranes around them in the first place, causing permanent damage and, eventually, cancer. While asbestosis is a type of pulmonary fibrosis, the scarring of lung tissues, mesothelioma is a cancer that develops in the membrane around the lungs, abdomen, heart, or reproductive organs. Mesothelioma poses a significant challenge to the medical community. It is hard to diagnose because its initial symptoms resemble more common lung diseases. Moreover, it progresses rapidly after the first symptoms appear, which happen at a later stage of the cancer. Medical studies show that exposure to all types of asbestos increases the risk of lung cancer, the second most common cancer in the U.S. Similar to mesothelioma, its symptoms do not appear before the cancer is already at an advanced stage. However, if it is detected early, it can be treated successfully. The VA urges veterans to get tested for asbestos-related diseases, especially mesothelioma. However, a more systematic approach is needed because many veterans might not even be aware that their health is deteriorating due to exposure, which happened decades ago. Based on a national asbestos-exposure registry, veterans could be regularly reminded and called for specialized health check-ups, such as chest X-rays, CT scans, and pulmonary function (breathing) tests to reveal any damage caused by inhaled asbestos particles. The number of U.S. veterans has been declining and continues to do so. For example, in 1980, about 18 percent of the adult population were veterans, but by 2022, their proportion was only 6 percent. The decline in the number of veterans is primarily due to the overall veteran population aging, and many passing away. Illnesses, such as respiratory conditions and cancers, contribute to this process. Asbestos Takes Many Veteran Lives in All U.S. States While the number of asbestos-caused deaths has been increasing nationwide, some states are affected more than others. California is among the top three states with the largest veteran population in the U.S., with over 1.48 million veterans in 2023. California also has the most military installations in the country, with the Navy having a strong presence in the coastal state. Considering the military's decades-long extensive use of toxic asbestos, it is not surprising that California had 27,080 asbestos-caused deaths between 1999 and 2017, which is the most in the country. Many of these people whose lives were taken by asbestos-related illnesses were veterans. California used to mine and produce large amounts of asbestos, which was then used at its military bases. For instance, the former Mare Island Naval Shipyard, located northeast of San Francisco, was the first Navy base on the West Coast. During WWII, it was one of the busiest naval shipyards in the world. Over 500 naval vessels were constructed, and thousands were overhauled at the Mare Island yard while it operated. Los Angeles County had the most asbestos-related deaths between 1999 and 2017 (around 4,979 victims). The County was home to Long Beach Naval Shipyard (1943-1997), an important site for maintaining U.S. Navy surface ships. As of 2023, Texas had the highest veteran population in the country, with more than 1.5 million. Between 1999 and 2017, Texas was also among the top three states with the most asbestos-related deaths, with 15,348 individuals. Currently, the state is home to 15 active military installations, some of which are among the largest military facilities in the U.S. Approximately half of the Navy's strike pilots are trained in Texas at Naval Air Station Kingsville and Naval Air Station Corpus Christi. Veterans Should Know About Existing VA Support The military, as well as manufacturers, were aware of the hazards posed by asbestos years before its use started to be regulated and still exposed millions of veterans to its danger. Policymakers and some manufacturers have been trying to compensate for the harm caused by setting up asbestos trust funds and VA disability benefits and health care for veterans diagnosed with asbestos-linked conditions. The disability compensation application process with the VA has been more straightforward since 2022 when Sergeant First Class Heath Robinson's Honoring our Promise to Address Comprehensive Toxics Act (PACT Act) was passed. Asbestos and asbestos illnesses have been added to the list of presumptive conditions, and more than 1.4 million veterans have been approved for benefits nationwide thanks to the Act. Having a national asbestos-exposure registry to rely on would significantly improve not only the diagnostic outcomes, but also more veterans could receive the well-earned benefits. Having a disability, especially at an older age, is an enormous burden, not only mentally and physically, but financially, too. Veterans should claim what is rightfully theirs and offered by the VA and the trust funds. Our veterans who sacrificed so much for our country deserve all the effort and support they can get.

Neutral Paths To Peace: Alternative Peacekeeping Solutions For Uk...	In 2025, the geopolitical landscape surrounding Ukraine has grown increasingly complex as Russia categorically rejects the involvement of the United Kingdom and French peacekeeping forces in the region. This refusal, driven by longstanding historical grievances and current strategic interests, forces the international community to seek alternative avenues for stabilizing Ukraine. The thesis of this article contends that a successful peacekeeping solution in Ukraine requires the integration of neutral, multinational forces with the endorsement of both the United Nations and alternative regional organizations, as well as the careful incorporation of non-aligned nations whose military capabilities have been increasingly documented in the International Institute Peacekeeping Database of 2025. At the heart of this debate is the need for a peacekeeping mission that balances the imperatives of neutrality and legitimacy. The United Nations, with its decades of experience in deploying peacekeeping missions in complex conflict zones, offers one of the most viable options. The UN’s history of impartial mediation and the diverse composition of its peacekeeping contingents have often served as a stabilizing force in regions characterized by intense external rivalries. The International Institute Peacekeeping Database of 2025 highlights that missions sanctioned by the UN have achieved a success rate exceeding 65 percent in conflict de-escalation and ceasefire implementation. However, the necessity for approval from the UN Security Council, where Russia wields significant veto power, complicates this approach. Russia’s ability to influence the structure and the composition of such a mission may force the UN to consider a more inclusive and flexible mandate to secure consensus among all key stakeholders, including those who might be predisposed to oppose Western military involvement. An alternative to a UN-led mission is the deployment of forces under the auspices of the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE). The OSCE has already played a monitoring role in Ukraine, and its existing framework provides a platform for expansion into a more robust peacekeeping initiative. The OSCE’s membership, which includes both Western and Russian-aligned states, creates an environment where decisions are based on consensus, and mutual accountability is expected from all parties involved. Data from the 2025 Peacekeeping Efficiency Report indicates that missions operating under multilateral frameworks such as the OSCE tend to foster trust among conflicting parties by emphasizing balanced participation and transparency in operational mandates. Despite these strengths, the OSCE is hampered by limited enforcement mechanisms and relies heavily on diplomatic engagement rather than military might, which could be problematic if the situation in Ukraine escalates further. The involvement of non-aligned nations, such as India, Indonesia, Brazil, South Africa, Egypt, and Argentina, presents a third pathway to building a credible and acceptable peacekeeping force. These nations, known for their strategic non-alignment and historical contributions to global peacekeeping efforts, offer a less controversial alternative to Western-led contingents. The International Peacekeeping Database of 2025 reveals that these countries have consistently contributed to peacekeeping missions with operational effectiveness comparable to traditional Western forces, yet their participation is often viewed as a gesture of neutrality that can appeal to both Russia and Ukraine. In practice, a coalition of non-aligned nations could circumvent the deep-seated mistrust associated with NATO’s historical interventions, thereby reducing the likelihood of escalation. Nonetheless, the formation of such a coalition is not without its challenges. Coordination among nations with diverse military doctrines, logistical capabilities, and political interests could lead to operational inefficiencies. Moreover, the absence of a centralized command structure may further complicate rapid response efforts in volatile situations. The notion of a BRICS-led peacekeeping initiative, involving influential members such as India, Brazil, China, Indonesia, and South Africa, has also garnered attention in policy circles. While BRICS has played a key role in proposing alternative models of international cooperation, including China in this group may be counterproductive. Ukraine is particularly concerned about the indirect influence of major powers with competing interests. The data from 2025 underscore that while BRICS nations have robust military capabilities and extensive peacekeeping experience, the political dynamics within the group can result in divided strategic objectives. This inherent tension may impede the formation of a unified command structure, thereby reducing the operational effectiveness of any proposed mission. In addition to these alternatives, the idea of a joint peacekeeping force with rotating leadership deserves attention. This force, made up of multinational contingents with leadership roles rotating among neutral countries, could help reduce the perception of any single nation dominating the operation. The 2025 Global Peacekeeping Assessment indicates that rotating leadership models have proven effective in maintaining operational neutrality and promoting a sense of shared responsibility among participating nations. However, implementing such a model requires overcoming significant bureaucratic inertia and ensuring that all parties adhere to the agreed-upon rotation schedule without compromising the mission’s strategic objectives. Despite the potential benefits of these alternative frameworks, several problems and challenges persist. The primary challenge lies in achieving a consensus among a diverse group of international actors, each with its own strategic priorities and historical sensitivities. Russia’s entrenched opposition to Western-led initiatives continues to be a major impediment, and any alternative must be carefully structured to avoid perceptions of partiality or undue influence. Logistical challenges also abound; deploying a multinational force from countries with disparate levels of military technology, training, and operational readiness could result in inefficiencies that undermine the mission’s credibility. Furthermore, financial constraints and the need for sustained international commitment pose additional hurdles, as peacekeeping operations often require long-term investment beyond initial deployment. In conclusion, the evolving conflict in Ukraine demands a rethinking of traditional peacekeeping paradigms. With Russia firmly rejecting the participation of the United Kingdom and French forces, alternative approaches that incorporate the neutrality of UN-led missions, the inclusive framework of the OSCE, and the balanced involvement of non-aligned nations emerge as the most promising solutions. Each option, however, brings its own set of challenges—from the intricacies of UN Security Council negotiations to the operational complexities of multinational coalitions. The International Institute Peacekeeping Database of 2025 serves as a critical resource in guiding these decisions, providing empirical evidence of the efficacy of various models. Ultimately, a successful peacekeeping mission in Ukraine will depend on the willingness of all involved parties to compromise and commit to a collective vision of peace and stability, ensuring that the region is safeguarded against further escalation and that the voices of all stakeholders are given due consideration.

Balochistan: The State Is Inactive, The Terrorists Are Taking Con...	On March 16, 2025, a bomb explosion near a bus carrying security forces in the Noshki district of Pakistan's Balochistan province killed at least five officers and injured dozens of people, according to police authorities. The attack comes less than a week after a deadly train hijacking incident in the southwestern province. The Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA) claimed responsibility on Sunday for the attack in the Noshki area of Balochistan. This separatist terrorist group, known for its terrorist activities aimed at enforcing Islam, was also behind the train hijacking that killed dozens of people. Police officer Zafar Zamanani said the explosion caused severe damage to another nearby bus. The dead and injured were taken to a nearby hospital. Balochistan's Minister of State, Sarfaraz Bugti, condemned the attack and expressed his sorrow over the loss of lives. 'Those who play with the peace of Balochistan will meet a tragic end,' Bugti said in an official press statement. The Prime Minister of Pakistan, Shahbaz Sharif, also condemned the attack, which comes as Pakistan faces an increasing security crisis in its border areas with Afghanistan. Kamal Haider, a journalist for Al Jazeera, stated that the attack occurred on a convoy of at least eight buses transporting security personnel from Noski to Taftan, near the border with Iran. 'First, there was an improvised explosive device, and then a burst of gunfire from the attackers.' Local sources say they fear the death toll may rise, he added. The incident comes less than a week after the BLA ambush on the Jaffar Express, where they held approximately 400 people hostage and killed 26 of them, including soldiers, before security forces launched an operation and killed all 33 attackers. In recent years, the country has seen an increase in attacks, including those carried out by the TTP, which is ideologically aligned with the Taliban in Afghanistan. Last year, there were more than 1,500 deaths in the country due to these attacks. The Taliban have denied any role in the attacks. What exactly is happening right now with the army of the terrorist organization BLA that continuously carries out attacks in Pakistan, Afghanistan, and Iran, and who is behind it? Pakistan, engaging in false propaganda, stated on Friday that the train hijacking last week was carried out by 'terrorists' who were communicating with 'handlers in Afghanistan,' while claiming that India was the mastermind behind it. However, to get to the truth, we need to take a more substantive reading of the tense situation in Balochistan, which, due to Pakistan's flawed policies, operates as a haven for terrorists who cause terror in the surrounding areas. Initially, the issue of China's involvement in Pakistan must be addressed, as China is using it to promote its economic interests through the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI). Pakistan has been a significant economic and trade hub in China's effort to dominate Southeast Asia through the BRI. While the cooperation between China and Pakistan could have benefited the economies of both countries, in the end, Pakistan, as the weaker member of the equation, became a pawn in China's expansionist policy without receiving corresponding economic benefits as a country. A similar situation was experienced by other countries in crisis, such as Greece in 2011, which gradually sold its ports to the Chinese, but ultimately only the Chinese side benefited from this agreement, not the Greek. The situation in Balochistan, which has become a stronghold for Islamist terrorists, is largely a response from its dissatisfied residents to the continuous state indifference they feel. Living in poverty and lacking access to education, they are the most fertile primary material for being radicalized by the fanatical Islamist terrorists of the BLA. The living conditions in Balochistan are so dire that the deadlock experienced by the people easily turns into fanaticism. Despite being the most resource-rich province of Pakistan, Balochistan's natural wealth is primarily exploited for the benefit of the central government and other provinces, leaving the local population deprived of basic services. The persistent practice of enforced disappearances, targeting Baloch activists, students, and citizens, has drawn condemnation from international human rights organizations. This systematic oppression has intensified the sense of injustice among the Baloch. Ongoing military actions against the Baloch population, including indiscriminate killings and severe bombings, have driven many in the region towards armed resistance. The continued reliance on military force, rather than dialogue, has only exacerbated the bitterness and turmoil. Especially regarding women's rights, the police often refuse to record cases of violence against women while civil society in Pakistan remains indifferent. On the other hand, feminist movements in the country, such as the well-known Aurat March, rarely acknowledge the unique struggles of Baloch women. In this context, the Baloch Unity Committee (BYC), the leading civil rights movement in Balochistan, stands out from the dominant feminist movements in Pakistan. What needs to happen in Balochistan, in order to stop the vicious cycle of violence and terrorism, is for military operations in Balochistan to cease, as well as enforced disappearances and extrajudicial executions. A substantial dialogue between the state and Baloch leaders must be initiated immediately so that human rights protection for the people of Balochistan can begin. While the Pakistani government often tries to shift the blame for its shortcomings, the crisis in Balochistan undoubtedly stems from its flawed policies. If the state truly aims to restore stability, it must prioritize political, economic, and social justice over military solutions. Without such reforms, Pakistan will continue to struggle with a destabilizing crisis in Balochistan. Linguist Noam Chomsky stated, 'Everyone is concerned about the elimination of terrorism. Well, there is a very easy way. Stop participating in it.' To implement this saying, Pakistan must give the necessary importance to this province.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWdy721aTMN3jTz6UQInD2wU	2025-03-18T09:37:07-07:00	
Robert Reich: How To Fight The Trump Regime’s Use Of Fear And Int...	The major weapon of the Trump-Vance-Musk regime is fear that causes people to be intimidated into silence and submission. The regime is using fear — of being deported, job loss, loss of federal contracts, loss of access to sources of news, of arrest and imprisonment — to intimidate potential critics. This is what all tyrants do, but we are unaccustomed to it in the United States. I want to share with you three rules for fighting tyrannical fear and intimidation, gleaned from discussions I’ve had with a number of people who have lived in repressive regimes. 1. If at all possible, do not give into it. Fear works only if people are intimidated. Intimidation is effective only if people surrender to it. I cannot presume to tell anyone how to balance their personal well-being against their obligations to the nation or the world. I’m in no position to suggest that anyone sacrifice their livelihood or freedom to make a point. So if you’re a civil servant in the U.S. government, especially an attorney in the Justice Department, I can understand your fear that speaking out or refusing to follow Trump’s orders will get you fired. If you’re a journalist or editor, you may be justifiably fearful that if you report the truth you’ll be barred from Trump press briefings or may even lose your job. Likewise, if you’re in America on a student visa or even hold a green card, you may be understandably reluctant to speak your mind now. Trump has threatened that the recent arrest of Mahmoud Khalil, the Columbia University grad student who is a permanent resident of the United States and who peacefully spoke out against Netanyahu’s policies in Gaza, will be the first of 'many to come.' On the other hand, if you’re the president of Columbia University, you’re in a different position altogether. I can understand your concern that your institution will suffer loss of federal funds if you allow full freedom of speech on your campus, yet that doesn’t mean you should surrender to Trump’s tyranny. If you do not stand up to it, you and your institution and other American universities will sacrifice far more over the long term. If you’re a Republican lawmaker, you have every reason to worry that if you vote against Trump, you’ll be primaried in the next election. But that doesn’t justify your silence in the face of Trump’s tyranny, either. What’s the point of being in politics if you have no principles? If you’re a Democratic lawmaker, you might worry that if you speak out — as did Congressman Al Green during Trump’s address to Congress — you’ll be tagged by Trump as a radical 'left-wing' troublemaker. Good! Make good trouble, as Congressman John Lewis used to say. Stand up and speak out! Americans want to know there’s a loud and vital Democratic opposition to Trump. If you’re a partner in a law firm that Trump has targeted for punishment because your firm has represented clients he deems his enemy, you should not be intimidated from representing others he considers enemies. To the contrary, hold a press conference and announce that you will represent even more people Trump hates, and you’ll do it pro bono. At a time like this, people who occupy positions of power and visibility — members of Congress, university presidents, top editors and CEOs of major media enterprises, senior partners in major law firms — must not cow to Trump’s threats. Now is the time for them and their institutions to stand up to his tyranny — and be seen and heard by the public as exemplars of democratic courage. Giving in to intimidation only invites more intimidation. If the Trump regime can 'detain' a graduate student with a green card for peacefully protesting the policies of the Netanyahu government, what’s to stop the regime from 'detaining' full citizens who engage in such protest or in any protest against the Trump regime? If the regime can silence Republican lawmakers by threatening to finance opponents in primary contests, what’s to stop it from trying to silence Democratic lawmakers by threatening to finance opponents in Democratic primaries? If Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and other Democratic senators so easily surrender to Trump and Republicans on a continuing resolution to fund the government, how can they hold the line against Musk and Trump’s illegal impoundments and mass firings? If the Trump regime can intimidate law firms that have helped Democrats or other clients Trump considers to be his enemies, what’s to stop the regime from trying to intimidate anyone who funds Democratic candidates? If the Trump regime can remove money from New York City’s own bank account with Citibank, rescinding funds that Congress appropriated to house refugees (as has been recently reported), what’s to stop the regime from threatening to remove funds from your bank account if you criticize the regime? The fear and intimidation must be stopped. The most direct way to stop it is not to give in to it. 2. Join with others who are similarly situated to sue the regime and speak out. Sometimes there’s safety in numbers. When the Trump regime targets one institution or one group or one person, it may be difficult for that target to respond on its own. But when joined with others who are potentially threatened, the targets can fight back. Rather than Columbia University fighting the Trump regime solely on its own, Columbia should also join with other universities that have been targeted and sue the regime for violating their rights and the rights of their students under the First Amendment to the Constitution. The group should also sound the alarm about the regime’s attack on higher education and freedom of speech. (The American Association of University Professors would be one obvious vehicle for this.) Individually, public servants who lose their jobs or who are threatened with job loss have very little power. But when joined together under the auspices of, say, the American Federation of Government Employees, the UAW (which represents many public employees), or the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees, they have considerable clout. Together, they should sue the regime for violating the law and mount a major campaign to alert the public to what is happening. Individual law firms and individual attorneys are more likely to be intimidated than the American Bar Association, which should now be an active vehicle for uniting many firms and attorneys against the Trump regime’s threats. Individual journalists or media companies are more easily threatened than the American Society of Journalists, the Society of Professional Journalists, or PEN America. Now is the time for these groups to be heard as well. In sum, now is the time for a concerted and organized public response to the regime’s attempts to sow fear and intimidation. National organizations with the necessary breadth and status must stand up to the Trump regime — loudly and clearly rejecting his brazen attempts to sow fear and intimidate opposition. 3. The rest of us must support these efforts. All of us have a stake in stopping the regime’s fearmongering and intimidation. All of us can help targeted individuals, institutions, and organizations take a stand. To the extent we are able, for example, we can contribute to the legal defense of Columbia University graduate student Mahmoud Khalil, here. We can ensure that students and faculty know what to do if ICE comes to their campus, here. We can contribute to other universities now under the Trump regime’s gun — and encourage these institutions to stand up to Trump’s tyranny rather than submit to it. We can contribute to groups such as the PhD project, a nonprofit that helps students from underrepresented groups earn doctoral degrees in business — which the Trump regime absurdly claims violates the Civil Rights Act by discriminating against white students. We can support the American Civil Liberties Union, Common Cause, Indivisible, and other groups that are showing the leadership and courage needed these days to take on Trump. We can buy subscriptions to media organizations that are helping to lead the charge against the tyranny of the Trump regime (such as the nonprofit I helped launch and continue to work with, Inequality Media Civic Action). We can show up at town halls where our senators and representatives are appearing, tell them exactly what we think of the Trump-Vance-Musk regime, and ask them to join us in opposition. Finally, we can — and must — protect people who are being targeted by the regime. In addition to university students, this includes hardworking members of our communities who are being hunted down for not having the right documents to prove citizenship; LGBTQ+ people who are being demeaned and discriminated against because of their sexual identities or orientations; and public servants — public prosecutors, judges, and government workers — who are being hounded because they have done their duty. Tyranny is possible only if people submit to it. The Trump regime cannot control us through fear and intimidation if we’re energized, mobilized, and organized. This is a time for all of us — and every institution in America — to stand up to Trump’s tyranny.

Bangladesh Interim Govt Reacts To Tulsi Gabbard Interview – OpEd	Muhammad Yunus-led interim government in Bangladesh has reacted furiously over the remarks of Tulsi Gabbard, Director of National Intelligence for the US, on the situation in Bangladesh. In an interview with NDTV, Gabbard said the 'longtime unfortunate persecution, killing, and abuse of religious minorities like Hindus, Buddhists, Christians, and others has been a major area of concern' for the Donald Trump administration. She also reiterated Trump's commitment to fight Islamist terrorism in the world, including countries like India and Bangladesh. A spokesperson of Bangladesh's interim government said in a social media post: 'We note with deep concern and distress the remarks made by DNI Tulsi Gabbard, in which she alleged 'persecution and killing' of religious minorities in Bangladesh and that 'the threat of Islamic terrorists' in the country is 'rooted' in the 'ideology and objective' to 'rule and govern with an Islamist caliphate'. 'This statement is both misleading and damaging to the image and reputation of Bangladesh, a nation whose traditional practice of Islam has been famously inclusive and peaceful and that has made remarkable strides in its fight against extremism and terrorism.' The interim government spokesperson said Gabbard's comments are 'not based on any evidence or specific allegations'. 'They paint an entire nation with a broad and unjustified brush. Bangladesh, like many countries around the world, has faced challenges of extremism, but it has continuously worked in partnership with the international community, including the US, to address these issues through law enforcement, social reforms, and other counterterrorism efforts,' the spokesperson said. The interim government spokesperson said, 'groundlessly linking Bangladesh to the idea of an 'Islamist caliphate' undermines the hard work of countless Bangladeshis and their friends and partners around the world who are committed to peace, stability, and progress'. 'Bangladesh strongly condemns any efforts to link the country to any form of 'Islamist caliphate',' he said. 'Political leaders and public figures should base their statements, especially about the most sensitive issues, on actual knowledge and take care not to reinforce harmful stereotypes, to fan fears and potentially even stoke sectarian tensions. In support of our shared global efforts to combat extremism and terrorism, the Interim Government of Bangladesh remains committed to engaging in constructive dialogue based on facts and on respect for the sovereignty and security of all nations,' the interim government spokesperson said. Tulsi Gabbard's comments involving Bangladesh seems to have been influenced by three factors, says sources privy to her discussions with Indian leaders like Defence Minister Rajnath Singh and National Security Advisor Ajit Doval. One of those factors includes the release of convicted Islamist terrorists by the Yunus administration during the last seven months it has been in power, of which 290 Islamist militants, convicted for heinous crimes, have been released so far. This does not include militants who were freed forcibly or escaped through jailbreak. Inspector General of Prisons Brigadier General Syed Mohammad Motaher Hossain told a press conference sometime ago that while nearly 2,200 inmates broke out of different jails across the country, 700 of them are still roaming free and the rest returned to prisons to serve their terms or were rearrested by law enforcement agencies. 'Out of the 700-odd (jail breakers), 70 are extremists and death row convicts,' Hossain told a media briefing. The prisons chief said 174 known figures, including 11 top listed criminals, gangsters and extremist group leaders, obtained bail from courts after August 5, though police said they kept a vigil on their tracks. Indian leaders have conveyed their deep concern to Tulsi Gabbard during their discussion, insisting that the Islamist militants, freed or released, posed a 'direct threat' to India because the groups they are affiliated with groups that have sworn India to be their enemy. Gabbard's reiteration of Trump's commitment to fight Islamist radicalism was as much a statement of American policy as to placate raw nerves in India. But it came as a boost to secular forces in Bangladesh who are worried over the free run enjoyed by Islamist radicals in the country since Yunus took charge. Gabbard's flagging the issue surely puts the Yunus administration under increased pressure to rein in the Islamist radicals who have not only stepped up attacks on religious minorities ,but also Muslim women who don't follow orthodox religious norms like purdah and hijab. Some say Gabbard's lashing out was in response to the freedom of assembly enjoyed even by banned Islamist groups like the Hizb-ut-Tahrir, which recently organised a public rally in Dhaka. 'If this is not a clear evidence of Yunus administration's patronage of Islamist radicalism, what is,' said Awami League spokesperson Dr Selim Mahmud. Dr Mahmud said that the government spokesperson was recounting Bangladesh's counterterrorism efforts which is misleading. 'The counterterrorism efforts they are talking about happened when the Awami League government was in power. Our government had zero tolerance to terrorism, but Yunus are patronising the very elements we tried to crush,' said Dr Mahmud. He welcomed Tulsi Gabbard for 'calling out Yunus' bluff' and went on to allege that 'Yunus is deliberately trying to stay on power illegally by using the Islamist street power which has turned Bangladesh into a vendetta Republic ruled by mob power.' Major political parties in Bangladesh are calling for early elections to the national parliament since the interim government has no legal basis in the Bangladesh constitution.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWdy721aTMN3jQ8K4AmYGLKA	2025-03-18T09:32:01-07:00	
Baloch Rebellion Poses New Challenges To Pakistan – OpEd	The long-drawn out armed secessionist movement in Balochistan (Pakistan's largest and poorest province) is evolving into more dangerous and sophisticated forms, posing a significant challenge to the country's stability. In a daring and novel attack last Tuesday, the Baloch Liberation Army (BLA) hijacked the Quetta-Peshawar Jaffar Express, carrying nearly 400 passengers, near a series of mountain tunnels 160 km from Quetta. A firefight with security forces resulted in the death of 21 civilians and four paramilitary personnel. The rebels used passengers as human shields The year 2024 was particularly violent for Pakistan, with the BLA carrying out more than 150 attacks. However, Tuesday's incident was unprecedented, involving hijacking, hostage-taking, and prolonged combat. It was the first case of hijacking and hostage taking by the BLA. Political commentator Najam Sethi described the attack as a wake-up call for the Pakistani State, urging the military and political leadership to set aside differences and formulate a united strategy to eliminate the BLA. He also accused foreign powers of aiding the group and suggested Pakistan adopt an 'offensive-defensive' strategy, targeting BLA bases and supply routes in Afghanistan and Iran. To curb suspected Indian support for the BLA, he urged the restarting of 'Jehadist' (Islamic militant) infiltration into the India's Kashmir region. But Sethi regretted that despite frequent accusations, Pakistan has failed to provide credible evidence of Indian involvement, reflecting the incompetence of its military establishment. He acknowledged the political and economic roots of the Baloch rebellion but insisted that military suppression must come first before any political or economic concessions. Otherwise, he warned, the rebels would perceive negotiations as a sign of weakness. Afghanistan Factor The BLA's funding sources remain unclear, though analysts suggest extortion, smuggling, and drug trafficking from Afghanistan play a role. According to The Khorasan Diary, the BLA also benefits from weapons left behind in Afghanistan after the US withdrawal from that country in 2021. However, Pakistan's strained relations with Afghanistan limit its ability to take counter action. The trigger for the souring of Pakistan's relations with Afghanistan was Pakistan's air attacks against hideouts of armed groups including the outlawed Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) in Afghanistan. The TTP has been wreaking havoc in Pakistan by its attacks against the Pakistan army and civilians. A report by the Islamabad-based Centre for Research and Security Studies (CRSS) said that terrorist attacks killed around 500 civilians and a similar number of security forces in 2023. The Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan provinces bordering Afghanistan accounted for most of the terror attacks and the resulting casualties. Pakistan has repeatedly demanded from the Taliban government in Afghanistan effective management of 2,600-kilometer border. But so far, the situation has not been brought under control. In October 2023, Pakistan decided to expel illegal Afghan nationals staying in Pakistan. This decision further damaged the goodwill that some Afghans had for Pakistan. Iran Factor There have been military hostilities between Pakistan and Iran too. Iran's Shia theocratic regime has felt ideologically discordant with Sunni-majority Pakistan. Pakistani leadership has also at times viewed the relationship through a sectarian lens. Iran has had a negative perception of Pakistan due to its strong relations with geopolitical forces opposed to Iran: such as the US and the Gulf powers, especially the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia. For Pakistan, Iran has been a difficult and not very useful neighbour due to its bad relations with the US. Iran has also had a close relationship with Pakistan's arch rival India. Pakistani leaders have long suspected Iran of supporting and providing haven to anti-Pakistan ethno-nationalist groups on its soil. Internal Causes While external factors have had a role to play, the Baloch rebellion is primarily rooted in local factors. Though rich in natural resources like coal, gold, copper, and gas, Balochistan remains Pakistan's most underdeveloped province. Despite being home to the strategically important Gwadar port and the US$ 60 billion China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC), Balochistan sees little benefit from these projects. Since the mid-1970s, its share of the national GDP has declined from 4.9% to 3.7%. The province also suffers from the highest infant and maternal mortality rates, the highest poverty levels, and the lowest literacy rate in the country. The royalties from its natural resources are disproportionately lower than those received by politically powerful provinces like Sindh and Punjab. Moreover, economic opportunities in Balochistan are monopolized by non-Balochis, fuelling local resentment. A History of Rebellion Balochistan's struggle for autonomy dates back to Pakistan's formation in 1947 when it attempted to remain independent but was forcibly annexed. Since then, the province has witnessed at least five major separatist uprisings. The BLA, however, emerged only in the late 1990s, led by Baloch Marri, son of veteran nationalist Nawab Khair Bakhsh Marri. The BLA showed its teeth in 2006 after the military, under Gen. Pervez Musharraf, killed prominent Baloch leader Nawab Akbar Bugti. Unlike moderate Baloch nationalist groups seeking autonomy, the BLA has never pursued a middle ground and remains committed to an armed struggle for independence. Suicide Attacks, Educated Militants In 2010, the BLA launched its suicide squad, the Majeed Brigade. In 2018, BLA leader Aslam Baloch sent his own son on a suicide mission targeting Chinese engineers in Dalbandin. Later that year, the BLA attacked the Chinese consulate in Karachi, killing four locals. In 2022, the group gained global attention when a female suicide bomber, Shari Baloch, targeted Chinese nationals at Karachi University, killing four, including three Chinese. Malik Siraj Akbar, a researcher on the Baloch separatist movement, told Al Jazeera that the BLA's leadership has shifted from tribal chiefs figures to educated middle-class youth, many of whom were once part of the non-violent Baloch Students Organization (BSO). The group now attracts young, educated recruits who see armed struggle as the only path to survival. Many of the BLA's new recruits include professionals such as IT specialists and data analysts, allowing the group to expand its digital and strategic capabilities. Historical Mistrust and Military Suppression Government repression, enforced disappearances, and poor governance have further fuelled the insurgency. Mistrust between the majority Punjabi population and the Baloch minority was exacerbated by the 'One Unit Scheme' introduced by military ruler Gen. Ayub Khan in 1955. The plan merged Pakistan's four Western provinces into a single entity to counterbalance the larger Bengali population in East Pakistan. Baloch nationalists resisted, fearing reduced representation and resource exploitation. The One Unit scheme ended in 1970, but tensions persisted. In 1973, Prime Minister Zulfikar Ali Bhutto dismissed Balochistan's National Awami Party (NAP) government, accusing it of conspiring with foreign powers. This sparked a fresh violent insurgency. A temporary truce was established under military ruler Gen. Zia-ul-Haq in 1977, but autonomy demands remained unaddressed. Under the rule of Gen. Pervez Musharraf, military operations intensified. In 2009, Baloch militants carried out 792 attacks, resulting in 386 deaths. Violence escalated in 2010, with 730 attacks and 600 fatalities. No End in Sight Balochistan remains locked in a cycle of violence and repression. The Pakistani state continues its heavy-handed approach, while the BLA grows increasingly sophisticated. Without addressing the deep-rooted grievances of the Baloch people, Pakistan is unlikely to see lasting peace in its most restive province.

The Role Of Private Sector In Creating A Prosperous, Dynamic Viet...	The private sector in Vietnam has not only helped expand production, trade, and services but also made an important contribution to improving labour productivity, promoting innovation, and increasing national competitiveness, the Nhan Dan website reported. The strong rise of many Vietnamese private enterprises has not only enabled them to dominate the domestic market but also gained a foothold in international markets. General Secretary of the Communist Party of Vietnam (CPV) Central Committee To Lam has written an article about the development of the private economic sector, considering it as a lever for building a prosperous Vietnam. The Party chief said that the strong growth of many Vietnamese private enterprises has exceeded the domestic market to establish their brands on a global scale. 'This proves that with a favourable development environment, Vietnamese businesses can truly thrive and compete fairly with the world,' Lâm wrote. After nearly four decades of Đổi Mới (Renewal), Việtnam has transformed from a centrally planned, inefficient economy with an average income of only US$96 per capita in 1989, to the 24th largest economy in the world in terms of purchasing power parity (PPP). By the end of 2025, the country is expected to enter the group of countries with upper-middle income, equivalent to over $5,000 per person per year. Việtnam’s economic growth rate has always been twice the average of developing countries, despite global economic fluctuations. According to the Vietnam News website, Party General Secretary Lâm underscored that this achievement is not only the result of the development policies under the Party’s leadership with bold and decisive reforms in institutions, policies and integration, but also the result of the hard work, creativity, determination and tireless efforts of the entire nation. The private economy plays a significant role in these achievements, said the Party chief, adding that the private sector has become one of the key pillars of the national economy and has proven to be the most important driving force for the country’s economic growth. With nearly one million enterprises and around five million local businesses, the private economy now contributes about 51 percent of the national gross domestic product (GDP) and more than 30 percent of the State budget. The private sector has also created over 40 million jobs, accounting for more than 82 percent of the total labour force in the economy, and contributes nearly 60 percent of total social investment. However, the private economy still faces multiple barriers that hinder its development, preventing it from achieving breakthroughs in terms of scale and competitiveness, Lâm said in the article. He explained that the majority of Vietnamese companies are small and micro-sized, with limited financial capacity, management skills and innovation, as well as limited connections with each other and with foreign direct investment (FDI). Heading towards a vision for the country's growth, the private economy also needs to be conscious of its mission, according to Party General Secretary Lâm. He wrote: 'The private economy must be the pioneering force in the new era, successfully carrying out the mission of industrialising and modernising the economy, enhancing national competitiveness and embracing social responsibilities. 'A prosperous economy cannot rely solely on the public sector or foreign investment, but must be based on the internal strength of a robust private sector, which plays a leading role in innovation and national development,' Lam said. The goal is that by 2030, the private economy will account for about 70 percent of national GDP. The Party leader also stressed that the political system must re-position its viewpoint and awareness of the role of the private economy as the leading growth driver for the country. This requires a fundamental change in policy-making, overcoming limitations and leveraging the advantages of the market mechanism to support the private sector in improving productivity and fostering innovation, he wrote. The State also needs to develop and implement a strict legal framework for protecting property rights, including intellectual property and intangible assets, minimising legal risks and reducing sudden policy changes that could pose harm to businesses, the Party chief wrote. According to the Vietnam News, we are living in a historic moment, witnessing unprecedented technological advancements and a rapidly changing international landscape filled with both cooperation and competition where opportunities and challenges go hand in hand. Yet, with unwavering resilience, determination, and a burning ambition, Vietnam is fully capable of achieving new miracles in socio-economic development! The Party leader also stressed that the political system must re-position its viewpoint and awareness of the role of the private economy as the leading growth driver for the country. Party leader Lâm noted that private enterprises should actively embrace social responsibility, not just in terms of financial contributions or charity but also through responsible business policies that improve the living standards of workers, support community development and practice transparent and efficient governance. A strong economy is taking shape, led by a generation of bold, innovative, and passionate Vietnamese entrepreneurs filled with the business acumen and patriotism, writing new chapters of success. A bright future - a socialist Vietnam standing shoulder to shoulder with global powers, as envisioned by President Ho Chi Minh - is gradually becoming a reality in the near future. With the right policies and a favourable business environment, the private economy will not only help Việtnam achieve its high growth targets, but also turn into a high-income economy in the next two decades, the Party chief stated. 'This is the moment to act, to create a prosperous, dynamic Việtnam that will increasingly elevate its position on the global stage,' he wrote. The private sector in Vietnam has been contributing a lot for the country’s economy.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWdy721aTMN3jUc9vuLKzxCG	2025-03-18T09:27:22-07:00	
Diplomacy Or Deception? The Fragile Truce On The LAC – OpEd	In October 2024, India and China announced a landmark agreement to de-escalate tensions along their disputed Himalayan border, the Line of Actual Control (LAC). This pact, reached ahead of a rare formal meeting between Chinese President Xi Jinping and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, was seen as the most significant diplomatic breakthrough since the deadly 2020 Galwan Valley clashes. The agreement outlined measures such as troop withdrawals, dismantling temporary infrastructure, and restoring pre-2020 patrolling patterns in contested regions like Depsang and Demchok in eastern Ladakh. However, months later, the supposed breakthrough appears to be more symbolic than substantive. While both nations publicly advocate peace, their actions on the ground reveal a different reality—one of continued military preparedness and strategic maneuvering. Despite the agreement’s promise of de-escalation, both India and China continue their aggressive military build-ups along the LAC. China’s 'dual-use' infrastructure strategy has seen the construction of villages and military outposts near the disputed border. Though presented as civilian settlements, these facilities enhance China’s ability to quickly mobilize troops, reinforcing its hold over contested areas. India, too, has ramped up its infrastructure efforts. The construction of the Sela Tunnel, which ensures year-round access to northeastern border regions, is a clear indication of India’s determination to bolster its strategic positioning. Rather than a move toward genuine disengagement, these developments suggest that both nations are preparing for potential future conflicts. A critical flaw in the agreement is the fundamental difference in how India and China interpret the LAC. Previous attempts to clarify the boundary have failed, leaving room for both nations to claim adherence to the pact while continuing their strategic pursuits. The lack of a transparent and enforceable mechanism to verify troop withdrawals and patrol rights renders the agreement little more than political theater. For instance, the restoration of pre-2020 patrolling rights raises questions. If India and China cannot agree on where the LAC lies, how can they ensure mutual compliance? This ambiguity enables both sides to maintain their positions under the guise of following the agreement while making strategic gains on the ground. Beyond military tensions, China’s recent plans to build the world’s largest hydropower dam on the Brahmaputra River add another layer of geopolitical rivalry. The project, located near Arunachal Pradesh, gives China significant control over water flows that sustain millions of people in India’s northeastern states. Once operational, this dam could serve as a strategic tool for China, allowing it to exert pressure on India through water management. India has expressed concerns and is planning countermeasures, but the project underscores China’s growing leverage in South Asia’s water politics. The border dispute is just one facet of the broader India-China rivalry. Both nations are engaged in a wider strategic contest that extends beyond the Himalayas. India’s deepening ties with the West, particularly through initiatives like the Quad (comprising India, the US, Japan, and Australia), are seen by Beijing as part of a broader effort to contain China’s rise. Meanwhile, China’s expanding influence in South Asia, including its Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) investments in neighboring countries, is viewed with suspicion in New Delhi. As China consolidates its position in the region, India finds itself navigating a complex diplomatic landscape, balancing cooperation with its strategic partners while managing its contentious relationship with Beijing. The unresolved border tensions have also taken a toll on economic relations between the two nations. Bilateral trade remains significant, with China being India’s largest trading partner. However, the deteriorating political climate has led to growing calls within India to reduce economic dependence on China, particularly in critical sectors such as technology and infrastructure. India has imposed restrictions on Chinese investments and banned several Chinese apps, signaling its intent to counter China’s economic dominance. Yet, despite these measures, India continues to rely on Chinese imports, particularly in electronics and pharmaceuticals, highlighting the complexities of economic disengagement. At its core, the October 2024 agreement is a diplomatic maneuver rather than a genuine effort toward reconciliation. While it provides a temporary pause in hostilities, it does little to address the deep-rooted mistrust and strategic differences that define India-China relations. Real peace requires more than symbolic agreements—it demands actions that foster mutual confidence and address underlying grievances. Without a clear roadmap for conflict resolution and enforceable verification mechanisms, the agreement is unlikely to bring lasting stability to the Himalayan border. The India-China border pact of 2024 highlights the fragile nature of diplomatic efforts in an environment of deep strategic competition. Both nations remain locked in a precarious coexistence, with agreements serving as temporary bandages rather than genuine solutions. As long as both sides continue their military buildups and pursue conflicting geopolitical ambitions, the LAC will remain a flashpoint for potential conflict. Until a truly binding and enforceable agreement is reached, India and China’s uneasy truce will persist, shaped by a mix of diplomatic engagements and strategic posturing. For now, peace along the Himalayan frontier remains a distant dream, overshadowed by the harsh realities of geopolitical rivalry.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWdy721aTMN3jfjtOoivvswD	2025-03-18T09:25:21-07:00	
Pakistan: Hostage Nation – Analysis	By Ajit Kumar Singh 'The bickering nation'. This one sentence aptly describes the current state of Pakistan, where the two major terrorist/insurgent formations - the Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), an umbrella group of 56 terrorist outfits, and the Baloch insurgents - have created havoc. A third terrorist group - the Islamic State - is also on a rampage. Meanwhile, the political landscape is turbulent, while the economy is in complete disarray. Indeed, within a span of a week, between March 10 and March 16, 2025, Pakistan recoded at least 38 terrorist attacks, resulting in 104 confirmed deaths [including 14 civilians, 45 Security Force (SF) personnel and 45 terrorists). Unconfirmed reports, however, put the death toll to 406. In the deadliest attack during this period, one that was brazenly audacious even by the Pakistani standards, on March 11, militants hijacked a train, the Jaffar Express, with over 400 passengers-onboard, after they blew up the railway track between Quetta, Balochistan, and Peshawar, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP). The Baloch Liberation Army (BLA), which took responsibility for the attack at Dhadar in the Bolan area of Balochistan, according to varying media reports, freed around 80 passengers, mostly women and children, but held hundreds of other passengers, most of them Pakistani Army personnel, hostage. They were demanding that authorities release jailed militants. On March 12 the Pakistan Army launched an operation to end the crisis. On March 14, the Army declared that the operation had ended with the killing of all 33 militants involved in the attack. It further disclosed that 26 hostages, including 18 SF personnel, three railway officials and five civilians, were killed by the terrorists before the start of the Army operation. During the operation, apart from 33 terrorists, five Frontier Corps (FC) soldiers were also killed. The Army stated that a total of 354 hostages were rescued, including 37 injured passengers. The BLA, on the other hand, claimed that its fighters inflicted a 'devastating and unforgettable defeat' on the Pakistani military as it has executed all 214 Pakistani military hostages taken during the seizure of the train. Some of the other major attacks (involving three or more fatalities) during this week included: March 10: Seven FC soldiers were killed when Balochistan Liberation Front (BLF) targeted their vehicle with improvised explosive device (IED) in the Mehnaz area of Buleda tehsil (revenue unit) in the Kech District of Balochistan. While claiming responsibility for the attack, the BLF reiterated its determination to continue targeting Pakistani SFs and state-backed projects, declaring, 'We reaffirm our commitment to continue our struggle until Balochistan's liberation is achieved.' March 10: Three non-local people from Sindh were shot dead when unidentified assailants opened fire at a barbershop in Katagari area of Panjgur District in Balochistan. No group has claimed responsibility for the attack, so far. March 14: SFs thwarted a terrorist attack on a check post and killed 10 militants, following a suicide attack in the Jandola area of South Waziristan District in KP. March 16: Three FC personnel were among five persons killed when a vehicle-borne BLA suicide bomber targeted an FC convoy in the Rakshani Mill area of the Regional Corporate Development N-40 Highway in the Nushki District of Balochistan. However, the BLA claimed, 'Immediately after the attack, the Fateh Squad of the BLA advanced and completely surrounded another bus, systematically eliminating all military personnel on board, bringing the total number of enemy casualties to 90.' According to partial data compiled by the South Asia Terrorism Portal (SATP), Pakistan has already recorded at least 849 fatalities (120 civilians, 277 SF personnel and 452 terrorists) in 2025 (data till March 16). During the corresponding period of 2024, 369 persons (120 civilians, 115 SF personnel, 130 terrorists and four Not Specified, NS) were killed. Through 2024, there was a total of 2,236 fatalities (582 civilians, 754 SF personnel, 896 terrorists, four Not Specified). Significantly, terrorism-related fatalities are again surging in Pakistan since 2020, with 365 in 2019; 506 in 2020; 664 in 2021; 971 in 2022; and 1,513 in 2023. Though violence has been reported from across Pakistan, KP and Balochistan accounted for the maximum number of fatalities. According to SATP data, of the 849 fatalities recorded in 2025, 504 were reported from KP, followed by 336 in Balochistan, six in Sindh and three in Punjab. In 2024, KP recorded 1,363 fatalities, followed by Balochistan, 774; Punjab, 59; Sindh, 38; and the Islamabad Capital Territory and Gilgit-Baltistan, one each. The surge coincides with the ascendency of the Afghan Taliban since the February 29, 2020, Doha deal, and the subsequent capture of power in Kabul. Significantly, the return of Afghan Taliban has helped TTP regroup and has strengthened the outfit, which had been on a decline due to successive military operations that followed the June 8, 2014, attack on the Jinnah International Airport in Karachi, Sindh. With violence on a rise in KP, SFs had to divide their focus between Balochistan and KP, creating opportunities for the Baloch insurgents to intensify their operations as well. Reports indicate that efforts were also made to form some sort of 'working arrangement' between TTP and the Baloch separatists. Speaking during the United Nations Security Council briefing on Afghanistan in New York on March 10, 2025, Pakistan's Permanent Representative to the UN, Ambassador Munir Akram claimed that TTP was collaborating with other terrorist groups present in Afghanistan, including BLA and the Majeed Brigade, the BLA's 'special forces unit', adding that the latter sought to destabilise Pakistan's ties with China. Earlier, on June 26, 2024, the Balochistan government claimed that TTP and BLA were trying to establish a joint base for terrorist operations in Balochistan, but the attempt was foiled. During a press conference, Zia Lango, Balochistan Home Minister, observed that Nasrullah alias Maulvi Mansoor and 'Commander' Idris alias Irshad, who had come to Balochistan to plan terrorist acts in collaboration with BLA, had been arrested. Former Balochistan Chief Minister and President of the Balochistan National Party, Akhtar Mengal, wrote on X on March 12, 2025, There is not a single inch of Balochistan left where the government can claim authority. They have lost this war-completely and irreversibly. It is over. We warned them, just as those before us warned them. But instead of listening, they mocked us. They dismissed our words as empty threats, while they fueled a system of oppression, looting, and bloodshed. Every single government-without exception-has played its role in the systematic genocide of the Baloch people. This is the one issue where every institution, every administration, every so-called leader has always stood united-against us. And rather than acknowledge their crimes, they have done what they do best: shift the blame onto others. But today, I want to make something very clear. To the federal government, to the political parties, to the judiciary, to the establishment-you have brought Balochistan to the brink of destruction with your own hands. But this time, it is beyond our control. And it is beyond yours as well. Further, on March 14, National Party lawmaker, Phullain Baloch, claimed that the BLA is so heavily stocked with potential suicide attackers that it has suspended further recruitment. He warned that the security situation in Balochistan has deteriorated to the point where elected representatives can no longer visit their constituencies safely. He asserted that 'the voices of Balochistan's representatives are not heard,' and lamented that without genuine electoral and governance reforms, Balochistan's ongoing conflict will only intensify. Meanwhile, the Islamic State continues to operate in Pakistan as well. The Islamic State-Khorasan Province/Islamic State-Pakistan Province (IS-KP/IS-PP) claimed 29 attacks in the country in 2024, in which 58 persons, including SF personnel, were killed and 105 were injured. IS-KP/IS-PP have already claimed three attacks in 2025, in which one person has been killed and two injured. Meanwhile, the country's socio-economic condition remains dire. According to the World Bank's latest updates, Over one-third of school-age children across Pakistan were found to be out of school; nearly two-thirds of those in school in Financial Year (FY) 24 were learning deprived; and alarmingly high rates of stunting - 40 percent in FY23 - persist. Critical constraints, including recurrent fiscal and current account deficits, protectionist trade policies, unproductive agriculture, a difficult business environment, a heavy state presence in the economy, and a financially unsustainable energy sector, have remained largely unaddressed, leading to slow and volatile growth… The estimated lower-middle income poverty rate is 40.5 percent (USD 3.65/day 2017 PPP) for FY24 with an additional 2.6 million Pakistanis falling below the poverty line from the year before. And further, Downside risks to the outlook remain high, with the recovery expected to continue but predicated on the new IMF-EFF [International Monetary Fund/Extended Fund Facility] program remaining on track and on additional external financing inflows. Continued fiscal restraint will dampen aggregate demand, income, employment, and poverty alleviation. Heavy banking sector exposure to the sovereign, domestic policy uncertainty, federal-provincial government political misalignments and geopolitical instability pose significant risks. Political volatility continues as well, with the puppet civilian government, which came to power after heavily rigged elections and direct involvement of the Military Establishment in forming post-elections alliances. Meanwhile, the 'people's choice', Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf leader Imran Khan continues to languish in jail. Summing up the current situation in a tweet on January 9, 2025, Imran Khan stated, 'There is a plan to impose a ten-year dictatorship in Pakistan, of which two years have already passed. Judges or police officers who become a party to oppression are rewarded with promotions here… Economic prosperity requires investment, which is impossible without institutions adhering to their boundaries and responsibilities as defined by the Constitution. Surging terrorism in the country is causing irreparable damage to the confidence of the investors.' In an apparent reference to the military, Khan added, 'Tragically, those responsible for countering terrorism are using all their resources and energy to corner our party.' Pakistan is hostage, not only to multiple terrorist groups, but to the Military Establishment as well, which, unhinged by its weakening grip over the public, has intensified political manipulation and repression. Under the prevailing circumstances, the country can only look forward to a future in chaos.

Why Proposed Revisions To Indonesia’s Military Law Alarm Democrac...	By Tria Dianti Indonesia’s legislature has fast-tracked discussions on a bill to revise the country’s military law with provisions that may expand the armed forces’ role in civilian governance – a move critics warn could erode decades of democratic progress. The legislature, largely controlled by allies of President Prabowo Subianto – a former general with ties to Indonesia’s authoritarian past – has prioritized advancing the bill. Proposed revisions may expand the roles of active-duty military officers in civilian government agencies. BenarNews could not verify a Reuters report, which quoted the defense minister as saying that any military appointee would have to retire from the service to take a civilian position. Analysts and activists say the proposed changes could entrench military influence in bureaucracy, undermining civilian supremacy and weakening institutional checks on military power. Here’s what you need to know about the proposed changes and why they’re drawing strong reactions. What does the new bill propose? The proposed amendment to the 2004 Law on the Indonesian National Armed Forces (TNI) introduces several changes aimed at expanding the military’s role beyond defense. The 2004 law itself was a landmark reform that reduced the military’s role in civil affairs. It stripped the armed forces of their political representation in parliament and formally ended the long-standing 'dual function' (dwifungsi) doctrine, which had allowed the military to intervene in civilian governance.Prabowo Subianto, then an Indonesian presidential candidate, greets army chiefs during celebrations for the 67th anniversary of the Indonesian Army Special Forces in Jakarta, April 24, 2019. (Willy Kurniawan/Reuters) The revision expands the roles of active-duty military officers in civilian government agencies, adding institutions such as the Attorney General’s Office and the National Counterterrorism Agency to the list of eligible placements, according to a draft bill shared by Amnesty International Indonesia. However, Reuters quoted Defense Minister Sjafrie Sjamsoeddin as saying that a new provision had been added to draft bill, according to which any military officer assigned to a ministry or state agency must retire. 'We could only propose them to [be assigned to] a ministry or state agency after their retirement,' he told reporters, according to Reuters. Currently, military personnel are permitted to serve in only 10 specific ministries and state institutions, such as the Ministry of Defense, the National Intelligence Agency and the Search and Rescue Agency. A new clause would also grant the president the authority to appoint military personnel to other ministries as needed, according to the draft. It broadens the military’s non-combat functions, allowing members to serve in institutions that deal with cybersecurity, narcotics enforcement, and other domestic affairs. Why is this controversial? Indonesia has spent the past 25 years limiting the military’s involvement in politics and civilian governance. Under the late President Suharto’s New Order regime (1966–1998), the armed forces exercised a 'dual function' (dwifungsi), controlling both security and administrative affairs. Post-Suharto reforms sought to dismantle this structure, ensuring that military officers remained within the defense sector and under civilian oversight to prevent abuses of power. Critics argue that the proposed bill risks reviving military dominance in governance by giving active-duty officers more influence over civilian institutions. The proposed changes could affect military conduct or human rights violations cases where impartiality is crucial to ensuring justice, indicated Virdika Rizky Utama, a researcher at the Jakarta-based think-tank PARA Syndicate. 'How can active-duty officers in the Attorney General’s Office remain impartial when they are still bound by military command?' he asked. 'If the military gains influence over the justice system, who will hold them accountable?' Opponents also argue that the bill would increase military control over non-defense sectors, including food security and national infrastructure projects. How does this affect Indonesia’s democracy? The bill raises concerns about civil-military relations in a country that has worked hard to transition to democracy. Human rights groups warn that increased military involvement in governance could weaken civilian control and blur the lines between defense and law enforcement. A report by a Jakarta-based security and human rights watchdog group Imparsial found that, even before the bill’s revision, at least 2,569 active-duty officers were serving in civilian roles, some of them outside the legal framework. The concern is that formalizing this trend will make it harder to roll back in the future. 'This risks weakening the principle of civilian supremacy in governance and could lead to military dominance within the civil bureaucracy,' said Dimas Bagus Arya, a coordinator at the human rights group KontraS. Why is the bill being criticized for lack of transparency? One of the biggest criticisms of the bill is the way it has been discussed – behind closed doors, with little public input. The latest draft was introduced less than a month ago, following a letter to the House from President Prabowo endorsing the bill. Lawmakers fast-tracked discussions, meeting last Friday and Saturday at a luxury hotel in Jakarta – an unusual move given the government’s ongoing austerity measures. 'What’s the urgency?' asked Muhammad Isnur, chairman of the Indonesian Legal Aid Foundation. 'Why rush it? And why discuss it at an expensive hotel? People have every right to be suspicious.' During a protest on Saturday, two activists were forcibly removed from the hotel after attempting to disrupt the meeting. Amnesty International Indonesia condemned the incident, saying it violated the right to peaceful protest. ASEAN Parliamentarians for Human Rights (APHR) said on Monday that it had received accounts of security personnel at the hotel reporting some activists to the police for allegedly disturbing public order and resisting state officials on duty. 'APHR was also informed that the office of KontraS – one of the member organizations in the Civil Society Coalition for Security Sector Reform was subjected to terror tactics, actions that undermine democratic debate and erode public trust in government institutions,' the organization comprising Southeast Asian lawmakers said in a statement. On Sunday, a coalition of 186 civil society organizations started collecting signatures for a petition against the bill, gathering nearly 7,500 within 24 hours. How is the government justifying the bill? Minister of State Secretariat Prasetyo Hadi denied that the proposed amendments would roll back democratic gains. 'No, absolutely not. We can assure you that the revisions to the TNI Law will not bring back the dual function,' Prasetyo told reporters. The government and the House of Representatives argue that the bill is necessary for national security and modernization. The Ministry of Defense has said it is necessary to adapt to modern threats, such as cyber warfare and transnational crime. Sufmi Dasco Ahmad, deputy speaker of the House of Representatives (DPR), insisted that concerns over expanded military influence in civilian affairs were misplaced. 'The objections I’ve seen on social media misrepresent the actual content of the bill,' Sufmi told reporters on Monday. 'There’s been speculation about a revival of the military’s dual function, but if you look at the revisions, it’s clear that we at the DPR remain committed to upholding civilian supremacy,' he said. What happens next? Lawmakers plan to finish reviewing the bill before its recess on March 21, ahead of the Eid al-Fitr holiday. With the legislature largely controlled by Prabowo’s allies, critics worry it will sail through with little opposition. Civil society groups suspect the timing is deliberate, pushing the bill through when public attention is likely to be elsewhere. For many Indonesians, the debate is about the future of their democracy. Bivitri Susanti, a constitutional law expert at the Center for Law and Policy Studies, said that the proposed revisions allowing military personnel in civilian governance could reduce accountability and concentrate power. 'Placing a military mindset within a system meant to be democratic will inevitably have serious consequences,' Bivitri told BenarNews. 'It would lead to authoritarianism.'

Budget Scoring Of Legislation To Extend The Auction Authority Of ...	By Harold Furchtgott-Roth Wireless spectrum is an asset whose value has increased rapidly in the past few decades. But transferring control of spectrum from one entity to another has proven difficult. Coordination of wireless spectrum in the United States is divided between two federal agencies: the NTIA for federal spectrum, and the FCC for non-federal spectrum. Before 1993, the vast majority of spectrum was federal, used by federal agencies, and coordinated by the NTIA. Much spectrum remains either exclusively federal or shared between federal and non-federal users. Some federal spectrum has been efficiently used; other federal spectrum has not. Auctioning federal spectrum licenses to non-federal users was one of the most important innovations in spectrum policy. From 1994 through 2023, the FCC conducted approximately 100 auctions and raised hundreds of billions of dollars of receipts for the US Treasury. Beyond the revenue generated by these receipts, the auctions’ greatest economic contribution has been distributing wireless spectrum to higher-valued uses. Markets’ main benefit is their ability to allocate assets to the highest-value uses. Through FCC auctions, private entities bid billions of dollars for spectrum that previously was used by federal agencies. By willingly taking the auction receipts in exchange for spectrum, the federal government reveals that it values the receipts more than the spectrum. Private entities reveal that they value the spectrum more than the auction receipts. All parties to the auctions are better off. The greatest winners from FCC spectrum policy in recent decades are American consumers—and, indeed, consumers around the world. Over the past three decades, Americans have benefitted from a wide range of new services that rely on spectrum previously under federal control. Wireless service providers can offer new products thanks to both greater spectrum access and decreased government regulation. Other countries, seeing the enormous value of wireless services, have followed suit both by implementing spectrum auctions and limiting regulation. Imitation is not merely the sincerest form of flattery; it is also the basis for exporting innovative American technologies and innovative forms of American regulation. But American innovation both in wireless technology and wireless regulation has slowed. By 2021, the FCC had practically exhausted the supply of federal spectrum that was ready for transition to non-federal use. Despite substantial and growing demand for commercial wireless spectrum, the NTIA has added little, if any, to the pipeline for auction in recent years. So even if the FCC restarted auction authority today, there is little federal spectrum available. Some causes are below: Federal agencies are protective of the spectrum they use and generally lack incentives to free up frequencies for more efficient uses. The federal government has no market mechanism to assess which federal spectrum is worth keeping and which would be better transferred to non-federal use in exchange for auction receipts. On the other hand, non-federal customers pay annual spectrum fees, which continually demonstrates the value they ascribe to their spectrum use. Even when it receives federal spectrum, the FCC may decide not to auction it. The commission can instead allocate this spectrum for uses that are not assigned by auction, such as satellite services and unlicensed devices. Competing interests in the same band may cause substantial delays in auction decisions and substantial reductions in auction receipts. For example, the FCC recently initiated a notice of inquiry (NOI), rather than a notice of proposed rulemaking, for an FCC decision in the Upper C-Band. That entire band is currently under FCC control, but the NOI will delay the FCC’s decision. Moreover, the FCC is considering options for the Upper C-Band that may result in few to no auction receipts. If federal spectrum allocations become fixed and inflexible, FCC auctions will generate fewer receipts even if Congress extends FCC auction authority. More importantly, American consumers suffer when spectrum is not put to its best and highest-valued use as revealed through auctions. Alternative Legislative Language for Better Budgetary Results Congress is considering two approaches to restarting FCC auction authority. Under one approach, FCC auction authority would simply be restarted. But the NTIA would not be required to reallocate any spectrum from federal use, the FCC would not be required to auction any spectrum for full-power use, and neither agency would need to meet any timeline. The FCC has some non-federal spectrum ready for auction: the returned DISH spectrum and the Upper C-Band. But it is unlikely that the commission will transfer any federal spectrum to non-federal use. Under the other approach, as in S.3909, the Spectrum Pipeline Act of 2024,1FCC auction authority would be combined with the following requirements: Minimum threshold amounts of spectrum to be transferred to the FCC for auction. Under S.3909, the NTIA would identify 1,250 megahertz of spectrum currently allocated for exclusively federal or shared federal use between 1.3 gigahertz and 13.2 gigahertz to be transferred to the FCC for non-federal use. In the past four years, no spectrum has been transferred from federal to non-federal use. In the four years prior to that, as little as 100 megahertz of spectrum (3.45 to 3.55 gigahertz) were transferred to non-federal use. Without minimum requirements, the NTIA is not likely to transfer a meaningful amount of federal spectrum to the FCC for auction in a timely manner. A bill similar to S.3909—meaning, a bill requiring a defined minimum amount of spectrum to be auctioned under a specific timeframe—can expect substantially higher receipts in the next 10 years than a bill without required minimum amounts. Minimum threshold amounts of spectrum to be auctioned for full-power use.Of the spectrum transferred to the FCC under S.3909, at least 1,250 megahertz would be auctioned for full-power use. The FCC has the authority—and in recent years has preferred—to allocate spectrum for low-power purposes, unlicensed purposes, or satellite services. These are worthy allocations, but they generate fewer, if any, auction receipts. A bill similar to S.3909 would generate substantially higher receipts in the next 10 years than a bill without minimum threshold amounts of spectrum to be auctioned for full-power use. Tight timelines for the NTIA and the FCC. S.3909 would set tight timelines for the NTIA to identify federal spectrum to be transferred for non-federal use and for the FCC to auction much of that spectrum. Without these timelines, the NTIA might belatedly or never identify federal spectrum to transfer to the FCC. For the past eight years, it has identified little spectrum. The timelines would give the administrator of the NTIA substantial leverage to force recalcitrant agencies to identify spectrum in a timely manner. The timelines would also require the FCC to auction the spectrum within a few years. A bill similar to S.3909 would generate substantially higher receipts in the next 10 years than a bill without timelines for actions by NTIA and the FCC. Taken together, these provisions mean that a bill similar to S.3909 should receive a substantially higher budget score than a bill that would simply extend FCC auction authority.

Thomas Aquinas And The Subjective Theory Of Value – Analysis	By Federico Silva Thomas Aquinas is, without doubt, the greatest Roman Catholic philosopher and theologian when it comes to the depth of his thought and the degree of his influence. Although this is the case, it might seem strange at first to see him mentioned in relation to the history of the subjective theory of value. It was Rothbard nonetheless who first pointed out that the direct ancestor of the Austrian School is the Salamanca School, a Roman Catholic school of Scholastic philosophy and theology, rooted in and deeply indebted to Aquinas. It is necessary to keep in mind that Aquinas was not doing legal theory, nor economics (which did not even exist as separate disciplines by then), but rather moral theology and theory of justice. Under that light, commerce only appears as a subordinate topic to justice. In spite of this fact, I shall prove that we can extract some valuable insights regarding the history of the theory of value from the Thomistic theory of right. It is also somewhat useful, for the sake of the following discussion, to remember that the first Austrian. Carl Menger, was a lawyer, not a mathematician. The Austrians never forgot that the normative and positive aspects of our economic reality are deeply intertwined, although it was still necessary to distinguish between them. Normative disciplines, such as ethics or law, presuppose the validity of praxeological claims. Praxeology, as the general theory of human action, is therefore the real missing link between economics and law. This is my personal assessment that underlies everything I have to say about the relationship between Aquinas and praxeology. The Thomistic Theory of Right and Praxeology Aquinas definitely understood 'right' as involving some kind of human action. Some even argue, like the Thomistic philosopher Massini Correas, that 'right' belongs to the metaphysical category of action. Laws are not 'right' proper, but are a certain 'definition' of right (aliqualis ratio iuris), meaning that they establish certain rights and obligations, commands and prohibitions, to all the subjects involved, and therefore, they are a rule and measure of human acts. In his theory of right (ius), Aquinas takes 'right' as being synonymous to 'what is just' (iustum), and defines it as 'certain action (opus) adequate to another according to a certain mode of equality.' He then differentiates between natural right and positiveright. In another place, Aquinas explains that some positive laws are a direct application of natural law principles by way of mere logical deduction (per modum conclusionis), which is beyond the scope of this article. What I do want to focus on instead is his conception of 'positive right' as the regulatory domain that natural law leaves human freedom to determine (per modum determinationis), which is by far the biggest area to explore. Contrary to what some might expect, for Aquinas it is crystal clear that there is a positive right when 'somebody considers himself satisfied if he receives a certain amount' (aliquis reputat se contentum, si tantum accipiat). In other words, the primordial criterion to determine the 'fairness' of such commercial transactions, besides natural law itself, is the satisfaction of individual subjective preferences. This can be divided into two categories. There can be private right by private agreements (privatum condictum), when a contract is signed between private parties to have something 'adequate' and 'commensurate' to one another, or by public agreement (ex condicto publico), when all the people consents to having something adequate and commensurate to one another, or what the king (princeps) mandates. I do not believe it is forcing the interpretation if we assert that there is a praxeological truth implicit in his notion of contracts. He says that there is a private right if A considers himself satisfied with what he receives from B and B considers himself satisfied with what he receives from A. This does not simply point to the subjective theory of value, but also to the ordinality of subjective preferences. Both give up something to receive another thing that is subjectively more valuable according to their individual preferences. They give up a good that they value less for something that they value more. There is a mutual consent in giving up something in order to go from a less satisfactory situation to a more satisfactory one. Praxeological Aspects of 'Fair Price' When discussing 'fair price' (iustum pretium), Aquinas even goes on to say, following Aristotle’s Politics, that essentially 'buying and selling seem to have been introduced for the common benefit (communi utilitate) of both [parties], namely when one desires [indiget] the thing of the other, and vice versa.' Unfortunately, but not unexpectedly, he is completely blind to the law of supply and demand, not only because it was not yet discovered at the time, but because what he strives to prove in the referred section is that selling overpriced goods is a violation of 'commutative justice' (i.e., commercial fairness). The praxeological element to 'fair price' is mainly that price in general, and fair price in particular, is always established by the common utility of market participants. Exchanges, Aquinas argues, 'should not be more of a burden to one party than to another,' because there should always be a 'proportion' (aequalitas, lit. 'equality') between the quantity of the thing offered and its respective price. This might seem strange for people coming from a common law context, where freedom of contract reigns everywhere (at least in theory), and judges usually do not interfere with the content of contracts, even when one of the parties evidently made a 'bad deal.' In the civil law tradition, nevertheless, it is customary for judges to consider 'inequality of consideration' in contract law, especially when the initial conditions were unilaterally modified, making the contract disproportionately more burdensome for the party considered 'weak.' With this fact in mind, we have to distinguish what an exchange is, economically speaking, from what it should be from a moral or legal criterion. In other words, fair price for Aquinas is related not only to subjective preferences but to justice and common good as well. But the fact stands that the 'common utility' in the exchange is defined mostly by the subjective preferences of each party, as we have seen above. This is an important praxeological precedent found in proto-market thought. The Bottom Line The important takeaway here is that Aquinas says that I have a right to some other good when I agree with someone else to exchange some good of mine for some good of theirs, but only if both of us feel satisfied by the exchange, which matches the Austrian definition of market exchange almost verbatim. It is remarkable to go back to a 13th-century thinker and find insights reminiscent of modern praxeology.

The Other Side Of Success: The Suicide Pandemic In South Korea – ...	The sudden death of popular South Korean actress Kim Sae-ron on February 16 has drawn attention to one of South Korea’s biggest societal, and arguably general, problems—suicide. Despite South Korea’s extraordinary economic progress in recent decades and a relatively stable political system (with some exceptions, such as the recently ousted President Yoon Suk-yeol), the high number of suicides reveals that even successful nations have significant shortcomings. This alarming negative trend, unfortunately, is not abating but rather becoming more pronounced. Grim Statistics According to data from the World Health Organization (WHO) in 2024, South Korea has the fourth-highest suicide rate in the world and the highest among the member countries of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). While the global suicide rate is declining, South Korea is experiencing the opposite trend—the number of suicides has nearly doubled over the past two decades. Specifically, approximately 13,000 South Koreans take their own lives violently each year. Government statistics indicate that an average of 37.5 people die by suicide daily, meaning one violent death occurs every 39 minutes. With 25 deaths per 100,000 people, suicide is the sixth leading cause of death, just behind cancer and cardiovascular diseases. Interestingly, the suicide rate is highest among the elderly. The annual rate among those in their 80s is 69.8, while for individuals in their 40s and 50s, it stands at 48.6. However, the biggest concern is the rise in suicides among young people. Since 2011, suicide has been the leading cause of death for individuals aged 10 to 24. Suicides Among Celebrities The issue of high suicide rates among young people, including young celebrities, was highlighted by the death of actress Kim Sae-ron. Although detailed statistics are lacking, South Korea appears to lead the world in celebrity suicides. Due to the global success of the South Korean entertainment industry, news of suicides involving famous actors, singers, and other entertainers reaches every corner of the world. A few notable figures who have taken their own lives in recent years include Jonghyun, the lead vocalist of the boy band SHINee (aged 27, December 2017); singer and actress Sulli (aged 25, October 2019); singer and actress Goo Hara (aged 28, November 2019); and actor Lee Sun-kyun (aged 48, December 2023), best known for his lead role in the Oscar-winning film Parasite. Even politicians are not immune. In 2009, former President Roh Moo-hyun (aged 62) died by suicide when his family and he were under investigation for corruption. Similarly, prominent politician Roh Hoe-chan, founder of the liberal Justice Party, died by suicide in 2018 at age 61 while facing a scandal over illegal fundraising. The Case of Kim Sae-ron The death of Kim Sae-ron at just 24 years old is particularly tragic. The actress rose to fame as a child at the age of 10 in the 2010 film The Man from Nowhere and later starred in South Korean TV dramas (K-dramas). She was hailed as South Korea’s most promising actress, but everything changed overnight. In May 2022, she caused a car accident while driving under the influence, instantly becoming one of the most despised figures in the country. Kim was driving drunk in the Gangnam district of Seoul when she crashed into multiple objects, including a transformer, guardrails, and street trees. The accident caused a power outage for three hours at 57 locations, including various stores. Although she expressed deep remorse the very next day and paid a fine of 20 million won (approximately $13,900), the media and public never forgave her. On the contrary, they relentlessly attacked her. She became a target of media and online harassment, which continued until her recent suicide. She was forced to use almost all of her earnings from acting to compensate those affected by the accident, while her film production company, Gold Medalist, also had to pay damages. Film companies refused to offer her roles, and she was forced to work as a waitress for some time. Her attempts to make a comeback through theater led to more online abuse. In essence, Kim's suicide was the result of a public lynching. From the time of her accident until her death, the media published approximately 2,000 articles about her. Her father blamed YouTube for her death. Causes of the Media Lynching of Celebrities It is evident that South Korean society has certain shortcomings that contribute to the brutal public shaming of celebrities, which often leads them to see self-destruction as the only way out. Celebrity culture in South Korea is ruthless, with actors, singers, and models facing harsh scrutiny from both their managers and the public. While famous individuals have devoted fan bases, those same fans can turn against them overnight. There is a noticeable tendency among South Koreans to harbor jealousy and envy. However, there are somewhat rational explanations for these highly negative human tendencies. Professor of Sociology Huh Chang-deog from Yeungnam University in Gyeongsan stated: 'Due to the social problems currently present in Korea, such as high living costs, many Koreans tend to develop a feeling of being poor and wanting more, comparing themselves to celebrities. This puts celebrities at the center of admiration, but ironically, it also breeds jealousy and hatred toward them.' Another sociology professor, Choi Hang-sub from Kookmin University in Seoul, noted that the attention and popularity celebrities receive in Korea are a 'double-edged sword,' as emotions linked to jealousy can intensify when a celebrity makes a mistake. Following the deaths of major stars in 2019, politicians intended to introduce laws in the National Assembly to discourage online lynching. The proposed regulations would have required social media commenters to use their real names and be punished for spreading misinformation. However, such laws were never passed. The reason is clear—clicks on news portals generate revenue for their owners. Female celebrities face even harsher public scrutiny than their male counterparts. Professor Seol Dong-hoon from Jeonbuk National University observes that there is a significant difference between holding someone accountable for their wrongdoing and subjecting them to relentless harassment over a single mistake. He wisely concludes: 'Every individual deserves a chance at redemption, but South Korean society often refuses to grant it to those who have fallen from grace. Instead, it continuously amplifies their past misdeeds, making it nearly impossible for them to move forward.' Material Success Does Not Bring Happiness Unlike celebrities, ordinary people do not commit suicide, or rarely do so, as a result of social media lynching. However, 99% of suicides in South Korea are the deaths of more or less average citizens. This raises the question: why? Their country is one of the most successful nations in the world in terms of economic and technological development. From the 1960s to today, Seoul has made an impressive transition from a war-torn, impoverished country to an Asian economic powerhouse (G11). The secrets of its success lie in well-executed industrialization and privatization, continuous innovation, and a high-quality education system. Today, South Korea is a global leader in technology, electronics, and the automotive industry, while its soft power—K-pop and the film industry—is also strong. Politically, South Koreans have built stable democratic institutions and pursue a prudent foreign policy. Seoul has become an influential player in international relations, particularly concerning North Korea. Given all this, one would expect prosperity for ordinary people, reflected in happy lives. Yet, that is not necessarily the case. Causes of Suicide Among Ordinary People According to official data, in 86% of cases, the primary health conditions leading individuals to suicide are mental health disorders such as depression, addiction, anxiety, and sleep disorders. Family problems account for 61% of suicides, while marital issues contribute to 53%. About 59% of suicides are linked to economic difficulties, including an inability to pay off loans, income reduction, and poverty. Approximately 57% of suicides are associated with workplace problems (interpersonal conflicts, excessive expectations). In contrast, only about 31% of suicides are connected to physical health issues. The Background of South Korea’s Suicide Epidemic Given these statistics, the main reasons behind South Korea’s suicide crisis are: the negative effects of rapid economic development, societal pressure to achieve success, social inequality, increasing poverty, and rising youth unemployment. The mental health of the population has deteriorated due to the rapid national transformation from a traditional rural society to a modern urban society within a single generation. Despite economic prosperity, social challenges such as loneliness and an imbalance between work and private life have become serious problems. The intense societal pressure stems from a culture obsessed with competition and achievement. Long working hours and high competition in education and the job market have led to increased stress and depression. A culture that does not tolerate failure has contributed to alarmingly high suicide rates among teenagers and young adults. According to a 2023 study, nearly 43% of elementary and high school students in South Korea had considered suicide due to school-related stress. Social inequality is another significant factor driving the high suicide rate. The stark divide between the rich and the poor and limited access to stable employment create a sense of hopelessness among those unable to keep up with societal expectations. Many elderly citizens, lacking adequate social support, face financial insecurity and social isolation, which drives them to take fatal actions. This issue is compounded by rising poverty levels. In 2021, the relative poverty rate among elderly South Koreans exceeded 39%—the second highest among OECD countries. The most common reasons for suicidal thoughts among older adults were health and financial problems. Even working-age individuals struggle with financial pressures (e.g., debt) and an unstable job market, leading to stress and depression, which increase the risk of suicide. A Problem That Must Be Addressed Since the South Korean government launched its first suicide prevention program in 2004, both the government and NGOs have implemented various campaigns to reduce the country’s exceptionally high suicide rate. However, these efforts have not yielded significant success. While positive measures such as restricting access to lethal medications, installing safety barriers on railways and bridges, and improving mental health services have been introduced, societal and economic pressures remain powerful triggers for suicide. What should be done next? Systematic reforms are needed to reduce inequality, ensure social security, and promote a better work-life balance. Without structural changes, suicide will remain a severe challenge for South Korean society in the future—just like its record-low birth rate.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWdlwqxCPKbaWr9UNBIUD0HN	2025-03-17T17:15:48-07:00	
Hegseth Meets With Irish MMA Fighter McGregor, Discuss Impacts Of...	By C. Todd Lopez Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth met with Irish MMA fighter Conor McGregor today in the Pentagon. The two discussed, among other things, how the U.S. and Ireland are both struggling with the effects of illegal immigration. McGregor described the illegal immigration problem in Ireland as 'a threat of destruction from within.' 'That's what we feel is happening in Ireland at present. There's no support for the people of Ireland,' he said. 'It's almost like we're witnessing the destruction of Ireland in real time. It's being harbored by our own government. The illegal immigration racket is the biggest money racket that has ever been in Irish history.' McGregor said many rural towns in Ireland have become inundated with illegal immigrants, changing the character of those towns forever. With some 40 million Americans of Irish descent living in the U.S., he expressed concern those Americans would find their ancestral homes unrecognizable if they returned to Ireland for a visit. 'They take great pride in their Irish heritage,' McGregor said. 'Sooner or later ... there will be no place for these Irish Americans to come home and visit their native country, where they are from.' Hegseth highlighted U.S. efforts to get after the same problem. 'Now you look at what this president is doing ... last night they sent 250 Tren de Aragua gang members out,' Hegseth said. 'There's no other way to handle it.' 'Breathtaking,' McGregor said. 'There are Americans all over the country, the length and breadth of this country, who are breathing a sigh of relief because of President [Donald J.] Trump's administration efforts.' The U.S. has sent the military to the border to partner with the Department of Homeland Security to stop the flow of illegal immigration into the country, Hegseth said. 'We've spent 20 years defending other people's borders all around the world,' he added. 'And we let the world come in through our southern border – 20 million people, we have no idea who they are.' Like in Ireland, Hegseth said, it's not just big cities in the U.S. impacted by illegal immigration. It's small towns and cities as well. 'There are entire small towns that have been transformed by illegal immigration,' he said. One of Hegseth's priorities is increasing the lethality of the force by making troops stronger, fitter and more suited for defending the nation. As a mixed martial artist, McGregor knows something about preparing for a fight. 'You've got to train, you've got to train hard, you've got to be committed and dedicated every day,' he said. 'Mentorship every single day on defense and on security and on leadership.' Prior to his meeting with Hegseth, McGregor visited the White House and participated in a press conference there in the briefing room. Following his visit to the Pentagon, he returned to the White House for a meeting with Trump in the Oval Office. Before leaving the Pentagon, McGregor recorded a message to service members across the military. 'This is a message to the great troops of the United States of America,' he said. 'I'm here with your Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth. You're in good hands. Men, women, keep fighting the good fight. Fight, fight, fight, as the big man says. Let's go, troops of America. God bless.'	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWdlwqxCPKbaWnV8grC4GBnn	2025-03-17T17:14:30-07:00	
Riyadh And The New Halls Of Mediation – OpEd	By Mauricio D. Aceves Mediation has shaped diplomacy, from the Peace of Westfalia or the Congress of Vienna to the Taif Agreement or the Joint Trilateral Statement of Saudi Arabia, Iran and China. In the last decade, the Gulf states have emerged as pivotal actors in conflict resolution, leveraging economic strength, cultural acumen, and diplomatic neutrality. Their engagement in high-stakes negotiations reflects the shifting dynamics in an increasingly multipolar world and the redefinition of power structures. In this new order, 'Either you are with us or against us' is a phrase that no longer belongs to geopolitical realities or conflict resolution developments. Leaders who have worked with conflict know that each conflict is unique, shaped by its causes, duration, external support, and several other factors.[1] Peace processes are not immediate remedies but ongoing and complex endeavours. However, specific lessons can be identified and are worth analyzing. After a decade of direct conflicts between Ukraine and Russia since the Russian occupation of Crimea in 2014, a fresh round of talks began in Riyadh on February 28, 2025. Only two corners of the room were occupied. High-level delegations from Russia and the U.S. discussed various issues, including prospects for normalising bilateral relations and the war in Ukraine.[2] This event represents a milestone in finding an emergency exit from a labyrinth that has shaped international security understanding, including the conflict in Ukraine and the global domino effect of the geopolitical rivalry between the U.S. and Russia. Meanwhile, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky visited the White House and held talks with a biagreement,delegation from the U.S. Senate.[3] Afterwards, the U.S. Department of State announced a round of talks with Ukrainian counterparts in Jeddah on March 10-12.[4] There, representatives of the U.S. and Ukraine agreed to enact an interim 30-day ceasefire, which can be extended by mutual agreement and which is subject to acceptance and concurrent implementation by Russia.[5] Certainly, the absence of Ukraine in the first round decreases expectations of the outcomes, reminiscent of the time in 2023 when Russia did not attend the two-day National Security Advisors in Jeddah.[6] Effective mediation necessitates a balanced approach that considers all parties’ perspectives—much as the Camp David Accords, the Oslo Accords or the Good Friday Agreement. Even so, the rounds in the Kingdom have been pragmatic and parties have demonstrated will to reach an agreement. The talks in Riyadh and Jeddah are simultaneously a messenger and a message. Saudi Arabia and the Gulf States have strategically positioned themselves as neutral players, leveraging strong relations with the great powers, including the U.S., Russia, China, and Europe. Some examples include several mediations regarding prisoner exchanges between Ukraine and Russia brokered by Saudi Arabia or the United Arab Emirates, as well as the Jeddah Declaration of Commitment to Protect the Civilians of Sudan.[7] The ongoing talks in Riyadh are not isolated events but part of a chronology that is keeping up its pace. Multipolarity is a trend, diplomacy is its mirror, and the Middle East is now at the heart of it. Qatar’s role as host of the U.S.-Taliban negotiations in Doha[8] and mediator between Israel and Hamas,[9] Oman’s discreet diplomacy in facilitating discussions between the U.S and Iran that led to the 2015 Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, and the UAE’s contributions to the Ethiopia-Eritrea peace agreement in 2018,[10] as well as its hosting of the COP28 summit in Dubai,[11] exemplify the diverse and strategic diplomatic engagements of Gulf states. These efforts highlight the region’s growing influence as a bridge for dialogue. Just as Middle Eastern literature, as The Assemblies of al-Hariri, weaves intricate narratives of resilience and negotiation, the region’s diplomacy reflects a complex evolution where alliances shift, and history is rewritten. The diplomatic leverage can be explained by the neutral stance of Saudi Arabia and other Gulf countries since the outbreak of the two recent wars. Even when Saudi Arabia consistently voted against the Russian invasion of Ukraine at the United Nations General Assembly[12] and contributed more than $400 million in aid to Ukraine,[13] a diplomatic balance was built, maintaining early ties and dialogues with Russia through the OPEC+ platform on energy security and trade, subjects that keep open communications channels and cooperation opportunities. The wars also offered a new way for the aspirations of third countries to become visible as actors capable of mediating international conflicts and the impassé of UNSC resolutions or the vacuum of influence in country desks in New York, Olso, Geneva, Vienna or Paris. Traditional mediation efforts rely on formal, structured, legalistic processes and sometimes with the military intervention of third parties as tools. In contrast, contemporary mediation needs and uses more flexibility to adapt to fluid actors, intentions, and communication complexities – far from the standard carrot-and-stick negotiation manuals. Sometimes, decision-makers and diplomats forget conflicts are about people more than nations. The novel As Long as the Lemon Trees Grow[14] by Zoulfa Katouh reminds us that Syria is a country, but more essential than that, it is a home for many. Using this lens, the Gulf states’ approach to conflicts has been strategic and culturally sensitive to consensus-building. This understanding of mediation has reinforced the probability of success projection. In this realm, respect and confidentiality will always be the core principles of reputation, both challenged by an era filled with mass media and disinformation operations. The humanitarian situation in Gaza, the normalisation of ties with Israel, peacemaking and peacebuilding efforts in Iraq, Lebanon, Sudan, Syria and Yemen and a reconfiguration of governance in Beirut and Damascus, are all pivotal issues for the Middle East. On this path do challenges to diplomacy lie, as well as to reputation-building for mediation and conflict resolution. First are the mediation efforts that are guided by self-interest, particularly in scenarios where ties with one of the conflicting parties are significant. Second, given the complex regional web and an environment full of actors inside a competitive dynamic, mediation initiatives could be seen as an extension of rivalries rather than impartial peacebuilding efforts. Third is maintaining national stability and regional proficiency to make joint decisions with a shared compass of regional security with a long-term perspective. An oft-quoted Swahili proverb[15] says, 'You cannot turn the wind, so turn the sail'. Turning the sail is now, more than ever, in the hands of each nation, particularly when strategic autonomy is the new setting for foreign policies in the Middle East and beyond.

Renewed Turkey-Kurd Peace Push Presents Opportunities For Regiona...	By Mohammed A. Salih (FPRI) -- A renewed peace effort between the Turkish government and the Kurdistan Workers’ Party (PKK) has reignited hopes for a resolution to the four-decade-long Kurdish insurgency and the broader Kurdish question in Turkey. In a historic announcement on February 27, PKK leader Abdullah Öcalan, imprisoned on Turkey’s Imrali Island since 1999, called on the PKK and all affiliated factions to lay down their arms and dissolve themselves. The PKK, which has been designated a terrorist organization by the United States and the European Union, has waged an armed struggle against the Turkish state for Kurdish rights since 1984. The stakes of this renewed peace initiative are high. After a decade of intense conflict, its success or failure will have profound implications for Turkey’s domestic stability and regional dynamics, particularly in Syria and Iraq. This moment presents a critical opportunity for Washington to engage constructively and encourage Ankara, Damascus, and Kurdish groups to pursue a path toward lasting peace. Renewed Peace Efforts This is not the first time the Turkish government, the PKK, and the broader Kurdish movement in Turkey have attempted to reach a peace deal. Previous peace efforts between 2009 and 2015 ultimately failed, leaving Kurdish grievances unresolved and prompting Turkey to launch military campaigns against PKK positions in Iraq. The latest signs of renewed dialogue emerged last October when Devlet Bahçeli, leader of the Nationalist Movement Party (MHP), hinted at negotiations and suggested that Öcalan might be allowed to address the Turkish parliament or be moved from Imrali to house arrest. This is particularly notable given that Bahçeli’s MHP is an ultranationalist party in a governing coalition with President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan’s Justice and Development Party (AKP). Unlike in the early 2010s peace talks, Erdoğan has not taken a leading role in this round of negotiations. Instead, he has largely remained silent, though he recently offered a cautious endorsement of the peace talks, warning that a breakdown would result in Ankara 'eliminating' the last PKK guerrilla. Challenges to the Process Several obstacles could derail the peace process. On the Kurdish side, it remains unclear whether the PKK leadership in Iraq’s Qandil Mountains will comply with Öcalan’s call to disarm and dissolve. While the PKK announced a unilateral ceasefire on March 1, it conditioned full disarmament on the establishment of a 'legal framework' for peace — without specifying what such a framework would entail. Öcalan himself reportedly told pro-Kurdish parliamentarians who visited him in prison that legal and democratic assurances would be necessary for his initiative to succeed. While some sources say Turkey is willing to introduce legal measures or constitutional amendments to formalize a peace deal, as of now, there is no clear indication that it would actually do so. Additionally, despite ongoing peace efforts, the Turkish military continues to bomb PKK and SDF positions in Iraq and Syria, which could lead the Kurdish parties to question Turkey’s commitment to a peaceful resolution and prompt them to abandon the fragile process. Another major challenge is the political calculus of the AKP-MHP coalition. Erdoğan’s primary motivation for pursuing negotiations could be to extend his presidency beyond 2028. He would need the support of over 60 pro-Kurdish parliamentarians to pass constitutional amendments allowing him to seek another term. At the same time, deeper strategic factors may be influencing Ankara’s calculations. The shifting regional landscape following the October 7 attacks by Hamas, the increasing dominance of Israel, and Iran’s declining regional influence have all altered Turkey’s strategic outlook. Peace with the PKK — and, more broadly, with Kurdish factions in Syria — would allow Ankara to consolidate its regional gains over the past decade. Stabilizing Syria The collapse of the 2015 peace talks between Turkey and the PKK led to an escalation of Turkish military operations in Syria. Ankara views the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) as an extension of the PKK, even though claims of direct organizational links between the PKK and the SDF remain, at best, contested. The SDF’s core unit, the People’s Protection Units (YPG), and its political wing, the Democratic Union Party (PYD), are both part of the Kurdistan Democratic Communities Union (KCK), an umbrella organization of which the PKK is the main component. In his late February message, Öcalan called for 'all factions' and 'all groups' affiliated with the PKK to lay down arms. SDF General Commander Mazloum Abdi rejected on February 27 the notion that Öcalan’s call for the PKK has any bearing on the SDF. The SDF is America’s primary on-the-ground partner in Syria in the fight against the Islamic State (ISIS) and controls nearly one-third of the country’s territory. However, Turkey and the Syrian factions it backs have launched multiple military offensives since 2015, capturing significant areas previously held by the SDF or its affiliates in northern Syria. On March 10, Abdi and Syrian Interim President Ahmed al-Sharaa signed an eight-point agreement in Damascus, calling for the integration of the SDF and its governing institutions into the Syrian state. Syria remains a crucial arena for Turkey. Having been deeply involved in the country’s crisis since the early days of the uprising, Ankara now wields significant influence over opposition groups and aims to secure the long-term benefits of its involvement. Turkish businesses stand to gain substantially from Syria’s eventual reconstruction, which is expected to require between $250 billion and $400 billion in investment. At the same time, resolving its conflict with the PKK and SDF would enable Turkey to prevent rival actors — especially Iran and Israel — from forging alliances with Kurdish groups in Syria and Iraq that could challenge Ankara’s regional ascendance in recent years. Stabilizing Iraq A peace deal between Turkey and the PKK would also have far-reaching effects on northern Iraq. Turkey has conducted military operations against PKK positions in Iraqi Kurdistan since the early 1990s, and since 2015 these operations have intensified. According to Community Peacemaker Teams, a local conflict-monitoring group, Turkish forces launched over 2,100 attacks on alleged PKK targets in Iraqi Kurdistan throughout 2023 and the first half of 2024. Hundreds of Iraqi Kurdish border villages remain abandoned due to the ongoing conflict. Meanwhile, in recent years, Sinjar in Iraq’s Nineveh province has become a major flashpoint. The PKK established a presence there in 2014 after playing a key role in rescuing Yazidis from ISIS, but since then the area has been occasionally targeted by Turkish airstrikes. The continued hostilities between Turkey and the PKK have added another layer of instability to Iraqi Kurdistan at a time when the autonomous region is already under pressure from Iran and its allied militias. The United States, which has historically maintained strong ties with both the Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG) and Baghdad, has a vested interest in reducing tensions in northern Iraq. Recommendations for U.S. Policy Turkey is a key U.S. ally and a NATO member, with an important role in the shifting geopolitical dynamics in the Middle East, southern Caucasus, and Eastern Europe. A lasting peace between Ankara and the PKK would eliminate one of the longest-running conflicts in the region that has the potential to undermine Turkey along its southern borders. Although Turkey is unlikely to accept direct foreign mediation in its negotiations with the PKK, the United States can play a constructive role by publicly supporting the peace process. The PKK’s leadership has significantly reduced its demands to broader democratization in Turkey, no longer calling for statehood or even decentralization. Washington should press Ankara to capitalize on this historic opportunity and reach a dignified and fair settlement with the Kurdish movement. In Syria, the United States has a more direct role to play. As the primary backer of the SDF, Washington facilitated recent negotiations between the SDF and the new Syrian government. On March 11, Secretary of State Marco Rubio expressed Washington’s support for the recent deal between Sharaa and Abdi. Ensuring a fair agreement on the SDF’s integration into the Syrian security apparatus and the recognition of Kurdish rights in Syria would help build a unified and more stable state. However, Washington must tread carefully. While Ankara and Damascus may favor integrating SDF elements individually rather than as a cohesive unit into Syria’s new military and security apparatus, this approach risks allowing the more radical armed factions within the new government to gain dominance. The recent massacres of local Alawites and some Christians in western Syria underscore that Damascus’ security forces cannot yet be trusted. This was reaffirmed in Rubio’s March 9 statement, in which he condemned the violence and vowed to protect minority communities in Syria. Fully disbanding the SDF within Syria’s new apparatus would eliminate the last major barrier to more radical and unruly elements seizing control of the new Syria. Even if the United States fully withdraws its troops from Syria, it should leverage other available tools and incentives — such as the removal or imposition of sanctions — to prevent post-Assad Syria from becoming a hub of regional instability and a magnet for extremist elements from across the region and beyond. Hence, a more prudent strategy would be to preserve the SDF’s military structure as much as possible within the emerging state. On this issue, a divergence of interests exists between Washington and Ankara, which American policymakers must recognize and manage. In a worst case scenario, the United States should carefully dissect the Turkey and Syria cases to ensure that if peace efforts within Turkey fail, it does not automatically weaken the SDF’s position in Syria or derail SDF-Damascus negotiations. In Iraq, Washington should also encourage an end to Turkish-PKK clashes and push for the full implementation of the Sinjar Agreement signed in 2020, which calls for the removal of PKK-affiliated forces and factions allied with Iran from the area and strengthens the position of its allied KRG. It should be kept in mind that failure to achieve peace between Turkey and the PKK, as well as between the SDF and Turkey-backed Damascus, and a return to intense conflict in Iraq and Syria would create an opportunity for Iran to further destabilize Syria and northern Iraq as a means of retaliating against Turkey. Iranian officials, already angered by the new regional dynamics following Bashar al-Assad’s fall last December, could exploit renewed hostilities to advance their strategic interests and undermine a nascent regional order that might otherwise align with U.S. interests. Iran is well positioned to do so through Iraqi armed factions aligned with Tehran, leveraging Iraq’s long shared border with Syria to its strategic objectives. About the author: Mohammed A.

India: Border Challenges In Tripura – Analysis	By Priyanka Devi Kshetrimayum Tripura remains free of terrorism. The year 2024 marked a milestone achievement in the state of Tripura, where Chief Minister Manik Saha announced the state 'insurgent-free or zero insurgency' with the signing of the peace agreement, the Memorandum of Settlement (MoS), on September 4, 2024, between the Government of India (GoI), the Government of Tripura, the National Liberation Front of Tripura (NLFT) and the All Tripura Tiger Force (ATTF), in the presence of the Union Home Minister (UHM) Amit Shah, at North Block, in New Delhi. The agreement followed the laying down of arms ceremony on September 24, 2024, where the 'presidents' of the Biswamohan Debbarma faction of the NLFT (NLFT-BM), Biswamohan Debbarma; the Parimal Debbarma faction of the NLFT (NLFT-PD), Parimal Debbarma; NLFT Original (NLFT-ORI), Prasenjit Debbarma; and ATTF's Alindra Debbarma handed over their AK series rifles. Also, a total of 584 cadres of NLFT and ATTF laid down their arms: NLFT-BM, 261 cadres; NLFT-PD and NLFT-ORI, 100 cadres each; and ATTF, 123 cadres. The weapons handed over included 89 country-made guns, 13 pistols, nine AK series rifles, eight factory-made guns, seven land mines, one revolver and one rifle. According to official figures, between September 24, 2024, and December 11, 2024, a total of 902 cadres of NLFT, ATTF and other groups abjured violence and joined the mainstream of society. No further surrenders have taken place thereafter. On May 20, 2024, before these developments, an Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA) Tribunal had declared NLFT and ATTF and their factions, wings, and front organisations, unlawful associations, stating that their cadres were involved in kidnapping for ransom, extortion, etc. The notification highlighted that the two groups sought to create an independent nation by secession of Tripura from India through armed struggle, in alliance with other armed secessionist organisations of Tripura, and to incite the indigenous people of Tripura. It further noted that NLFT had been working in close nexus with other North-East insurgent organisations having their bases in Bangladesh, including the Kangleipak Communist Party (KCP), Kanglei Yaol Kanba Lup (KYKL), Kamtapur Liberation Organisation (KLO), National Socialist Council of Nagaland-Isak-Muivah (NSCN-IM) and Hynniewtrep National Liberation Council (HNLC). The ATTF had connections with the National Socialist Council of Nagaland-Khaplang (NSCN-K) and Kamtapur Liberation Organisation (KLO). For long years, since the inception of NLFT on March 12, 1989, and ATTF in 1993, which was originally named All Tripura Tribal Force (formed on July 11, 1990), the two militant outfits have been involved in violent activities, with the common objectives of deporting all foreigners who entered Tripura after 1956 and restoring alienated tribal lands. The present agreement is, however, an example of militant outfits choosing a peaceful path to resolve the issues surrounding the indigenous population of Tripura. The decline in the number of insurgent-related incidents and fatalities in Tripura was one of the factors that made this possible. According to partial data compiled by the South Asia Terrorism Portal (SATP), since 2010, fatalities have been recorded in single digits for eight of the 15 years, while no fatality was reported in the remaining seven years (data till March 16, 2025). There was a total of 13 insurgent-related killing incidents in which 16 fatalities were recorded [five civilians, seven Security Force (SF) personnel and four terrorists] from 2010 to March 16, 2025. Of these, NLFT was involved in 10 incidents, including two NLFT-BM-related incidents in 2021 and 2022, while ATTF was involved in only one incident, on January 4, 2023, which also resulted in the last reported insurgent-related fatality in Tripura. Of the remaining, two incidents involved the Bru National Liberation Front (BNLF), while the third could not be attributed to any identified militant group. Moreover, since March 6, 2000, a total of 3,824 militants have surrendered in the state. 2024 and 2025 (to date) have not reported any arrests associated with particular insurgent outfits. The trends of arrest, in recent times, have been associated with the possession of firearms. Some of the incidents of this kind in 2025 include: February 13: Police arrested Rajkumar Debnath and Palash Pal from South Jagatpur in Sidhai, Tripura's West District, in connection with a case registered under the Arms Act in December 2024. Police recovered a 7mm pistol along with an empty magazine from the residence of Rajkumar Debnath on February 15. February 7: In a joint operation with the Border Security Force (BSF), Police arrested Anjan Das from Konaban Radhanagar in Sepahijala and recovered a pistol and three live rounds from his possession. January 25: Police carried out an operation and arrested two persons, Niraj Kumar and Indar Mukhia, in possession of a pistol, from the Dharmanagar Sub-division of North Tripura District. At least 13 insurgents were arrested in six separate incidents in 2023. The last insurgent-related arrest was on December 16, 2023, when the Tripura Police arrested three NLFT-PD militants - self-styled 'major' Ganaram Rang aka Baileng, Rai Bahadur Reang and Rai Taingha Reang - from the Khasnam Para Bru Settlement Camp in North Tripura District. A total of 1,114 militants have been arrested in Tripura since March 6, 2000. The MoS of September 2024 is accompanied by aid, rehabilitation and relief packages. In the latest agreement, the Centre approved a special INR 2.5 billion package for the development of the tribal population in Tripura. A monthly stipend of INR 6,000 and a fixed deposit of INR 400,000 for each of the rebels who renounce violence, with the deposit accessible after a three-year lock-in period, were also promised. However, the likelihood that packages announced and promises made at the time of the agreement being fulfilled remain bleak. On February 21, 2025, Tripura United Indigenous Revolutionary Peoples' Council (TUIRPC) leader Daniel Borok Debbarma announced a protest aimed at pressing their 21-point charter of demands, with support from all surrendered militant organisations. On February 25, 2025, the organisation staged a daylong blockade on the Assam-Agartala National Highway at Hatai Kotor in West Tripura District, which is the fifth protest of such kind over the past years. The demands included rehabilitation, land allotment, housing, and economic assistance for surrendered militants. The group claimed that the Government failed to fulfil its promises and had not done anything for surrendered militants over the past 30 to 35 years despite assurances. TUIRPC leader Daniel Borok Debbarma stated, The government made numerous promises, but none have been realised. Many of our demands remain pending, which is why we have resorted to this road blockade as a form of protest. This is the fifth time we are taking such an action. Our key demands include the withdrawal of all court and police cases against us. Even now, we are being summoned by the police for various cases. We were promised pucca houses, but none have been provided. We also demand the use of the Roman script for the Kokborok language, replacing the current Bengali script. Additionally, the government must ensure proper infrastructure, including water, electricity, and roads, in rehabilitation areas. Free education for our children from Class 1 up to the university level must also be guaranteed. In response, Minister of Tribal Welfare Department Bikash Debbarma met with representatives of TUIRPC on March 4, 2025, and assured them of the Government's support, adding, 'The government is committed to addressing the issues of surrendered militants. We will work towards resolving their grievances at the earliest.' Meanwhile, the porous international border with Bangladesh (parts of Tripura's 856-km-long border with Bangladesh are still unfenced due to local disputes) remains a hindrance, with numerous infiltration attempts by Bangladeshis and Rohingyas owing to the tumultuous conditions in the neighbouring country. As reported on November 3, 2024, Chief Minister Saha urged UHM Amit Shah to take steps to complete the unfenced border. Saha observed, in this regard, We are all keeping watch on the situation in Bangladesh and it may take time to practically see its possible impact on our ties with the country. But since we have seen an increase in influx, we have raised the matter with the Centre and sought complete fencing of the border. According to an official release by the Border Security Force (BSF) on December 1, 2024, a total of 675 illegal immigrants, including 55 Rohingyas, 620 Bangladeshi nationals and 260 Indian nationals, were apprehended by the BSF's Tripura Frontier in various operations, from January 1 to November 30, 2024. The BSF added contraband worth more than INR 46 crore was seized, including substantial quantities of narcotics. The seizures included 66,316 bottles of Phensedyl, 9,203.24 kilograms of cannabis, 605,334 Yaba tablets, 1,222,894.5 kilograms of sugar, 496.26 grams of gold, 381.01 grams of brown sugar, one pistol and 210 rounds of ammunition. Both the border guard organisations, BSF and Bangladesh Border Guard (BBG), collaborated in addressing the security challenges of the two nations. However, the political situation in Bangladesh has had a ripple effect in Tripura. On December 2, 2024, a protest was launched in front of the Bangladesh Assistant High Commissioner in Agartala, focusing on atrocities against Hindu minorities and a demand for the release of Hindu leader and ISKCON member Chinmoy Das Prabhu. The protest was also joined by a right-wing organization, called Hindu Sangharsh Samity. In response to the protest, the Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) took up security measures and emphasised that 'diplomatic and consular properties should not be targeted under any circumstances.' As Tripura reached its milestone in achieving the zero-insurgency status, with a larger vision of the Government of India's policy towards 'insurgency-free, peaceful and prosperous North East', the issue of addressing the grievances of surrendered militants lingers on. The Government must revisit its surrender cum rehabilitation programme and address the protracted failures of implementation. Moreover, the state is crippled by other challenges, particularly along its international border with Bangladesh. The influx of illegal migrants along the border, part of the larger border crisis across India's Northeast, needs to be addressed at the earliest, as it constitutes a serious security threat.

Armenia At Constitutional Crossroads – OpEd	By Maroš Cuník (Eurasianet) -- Armenian Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan’s success in finalizing a peace treaty with Azerbaijan is a major achievement. But Pashinyan’s next challenge may prove even tougher to accomplish – convincing Armenians to embrace an overhaul of the county’s political, economic and social culture through the adoption of a new constitution. Pashinyan outlined his vision for the country’s transformation, which he frames as 'Real Armenia,' in late February. It stresses the need for entrepreneurship and a new understanding of the meaning of patriotism, focusing on the future and letting go of the past. From Pashinyan’s standpoint, strategic necessity dictates a need for a new constitution: Armenia’s long-standing partnership with Russia has crumbled, undermining Armenian security. Now, Armenia must adapt to become 'more viable in the new geopolitical and regional conditions.' Old thinking has kept Armenia in 'constant conflicts with our neighbors,' he has stated. He believes a new approach that sets aside old grievances can usher in an age of economic prosperity and security. 'Peace is the most reliable guarantee of security,' Pashinyan’s Real Armenia doctrine states. 'The most important components of ensuring security are the interdependence of the countries of the region, ensuring the country's place in the regional and global supply chain and trade.' The prime minister is willing to make compromises that many other Armenian politicians are not willing to risk, especially concerning the future of Nagorno Karabakh. The first step for the government in implementing the Real Armenia agenda will be amending the preamble of the Armenian constitution, which indicates that Karabakh is a constituent component of historical Armenia. Azerbaijan, which reconquered the territory in late 2023, has made the adoption of an amendment to unequivocally recognize Baku’s sovereignty over the territory a prerequisite for the signing of the peace treaty. Given that Armenia and Azerbaijan have finalized the treaty text, it would seem the two governments have agreed on a mutually acceptable resolution concerning Karabakh’s place in the Armenian constitution. But Pashinyan and other government officials have so far not revealed the substance of the compromise. To date, Pashinyan has been cagey, stating that the constitution as presently written does not make any territorial claims against Azerbaijan. Any move to amend the constitution is sure to fuel a highly emotional debate in Yerevan. For nationalists, relinquishing claims to Karabakh is seen as a betrayal of national interests. Many also contend that conceding on the Karabakh matter would encourage further Azerbaijani claims, particularly concerning the so-called Zangezur corridor, a proposed land connection between the Azerbaijani mainland and the Nakhchivan exclave. Bowing to Baku’s demand for unhindered movement along the corridor would be an unacceptable infringement on Armenian sovereignty in the view of many Armenians. Only after Pashinyan can finesse the Karabakh preamble issue and get the peace treaty with Azerbaijan signed, can his government focus on selling the Real Armenia doctrine to a hesitant population. At that point, geopolitical pressure on Armenia could grow intense. Given that Pashinyan’s government has lost all trust in Russia as a security guarantor, the Real Armenia doctrine calls for the country’s geopolitical reorientation away from Moscow toward the United States and European Union, as reflected in Yerevan’s recent decision to embark on the EU accession process. This places Armenia in a difficult position because the country’s economy remains dependent on Russia as a trading partner and energy supplier. The Kremlin is not likely to stand by and do nothing as Pashinyan proceeds with his geopolitical pivot. At the same time, it is unlikely Armenia can receive any serious security guarantees or transformative economic support from the US and EU soon. Currently, Western support is more symbolic and rhetorical rather than practical. Pashinyan has indicated that he wants to put a new constitution that embodies his Real Armenia vision up for approval in a popular referendum before the country’s next scheduled parliamentary election in late 2026. That does not give the government a lot of time to win over the large number of domestic skeptics while at the same time being buffeted by outside forces intent on seeing him fail. Considering the domestic tensions and external pressures, one of three possible outcomes is likely. The chances for Armenia’s rapid strategic realignment seem low at present, given that Pashinyan appears to lack a critical mass of popular support for the Real Armenia doctrine. Achieving a geopolitical transformation in such a short timespan without triggering a domestic or external crisis is a tall order. It is also possible that domestic and foreign opposition, from Russia and/or Azerbaijan, may prove too much for the Armenian government to overcome. Russia could apply economic and diplomatic pressure, and Azerbaijan could seek additional territorial or economic concessions from Yerevan to paralyze Armenian governance and, potentially, topple Pashinyan. Another scenario involves the incremental adaptation of Pashinyan’s vision. If he can get Azerbaijan to sign the peace treaty, Pashinyan can buy himself some time. He may have to push back his timeline for a new constitution, but the fact that domestic forces opposed to the government’s agenda currently lack unity gives Pashinyan what looks to be a decent chance of securing reelection in 2026. He could then work to recalibrate relationships with Russia, Azerbaijan, the United States and EU while building domestic consensus for the Real Armenia program. The process would involve economic diversification, careful engagement with Azerbaijan and deepening ties with the US and EU without triggering regional destabilization. Armenia now stands at a constitutional crossroads with a peace agreement awaiting signatures. There is no way of telling how Pashinyan’s ambitious initiative to remake Armenian society and secure the country’s sovereignty will turn out. The process over the coming months and years will test the limits of Pashinyan’s political and diplomatic skills and will shape Armenia’s future to better or worse for decades to come.

Americans Go Egg Hunting In Europe	By Magnus Lund Nielsen (EurActiv) -- As Americans keep wringing their hands over skyrocketing egg prices, the United States has been reaching out to European producers to chip in – but Europeans have little help to provide. 'The US have asked virtually every country in Europe,' said Danish industry representative Jørgen Nyberg Larsen. Larsen said suppliers and industry groups in Germany, Spain, France, the Netherlands, Italy and fellow Nordic countries have received similar requests. The requests come amid a growing Trump-driven trade riff between the US and its European partners. In late February, the US Department of Agriculture (USDA) office in The Hague reached out to European countries regarding potential supplies, Larsen said. By early March, the USDA followed up with a request to assess the quantities each country could provide. 'Since then we haven’t heard anything,' Larsen says. Market flooding US consumers experienced a sharp rise in the cost of everyday essentials, and eggs in particular, fuelling economic discontent that played a key role in the US election outcome last year. Furthermore, a spike in bird flu in North America has pushed prices upwards. Egg prices were a frequent topic during the campaign, and have remained a politically charged issue in the US since Donald Trump was sworn in as president in January. Last week, Trump stated that the egg prices were down – despite Associated Press reportsthat eggs prices in the US are actually the highest since the turn of the millennium. While Finland has declined to send eggs, other countries are willing to assist. Turkey has agreed to provide the US with 15,000 tonnes of egg to curb prices. Other countries remain primarily focused on ensuring supply for consumers within the EU. 'We don’t have a lot to offer,' said Larsen. Another major hurdle potential hurdle for would-be exporters is that the US washes its eggs, a practice that is uncommon in most EU countries and even illegal in parts of the bloc. As a result, any EU egg exports would have to undergo additional processing before reaching US consumers.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWdlwqxCPKbaWj46oU3y27m3	2025-03-17T16:55:42-07:00	
Government Efficiency And DOGE Government Efficiency – OpEd	The Social Security Administration (SSA) announced that it was reversing plans to eliminate the option of providing service over the phone. This was a response to a public outcry over the proposed policy. The reason for the outcry was that many older people (the type most likely to get Social Security benefits) are distrustful and uncomfortable with the Internet. They therefore rely on telephone service for things like arranging direct deposit of their Social Security benefits. (SSA is still not allowing changes to direct deposit over the phone, contrary to what I wrote in an earlier version.) SSA should be applauded for reversing an obviously wrongheaded policy, but it is worth asking how it ever came up with the idea of eliminating phone service to begin with. Apparently, this was one of the efficiency enhancing measures that the 'super-high IQ' DOGE team developed. This is a great example of how the ostensible 'efficiency' being pushed by Elon Musk and his DOGE team has little to do with actually promoting efficiency in government. There are some simple and obvious points that we can say about government efficiency. First, we have a $7 trillion federal budget. That fact means that we can be absolutely certain that there is some waste, fraud, and abuse. We also can be sure that some of the 2.4 million workers employed by the federal government are lazy and/or incompetent, just as we can be certain that some of the 154 million workers employed in the private sector are lazy and/or incompetent. But moving from these obvious truths to increasing government efficiency is a big step. We actually do have people within the government that have been working for years trying to improve efficiency. Most obviously, there is the Government Accountability Office (GAO), which regularly audits various government departments and makes specific recommendations on how they can increase efficiency. We also have the inspector generals (IG) of the agencies and departments, who review processes and contracts within agencies like USAID and look for fraud and abuse. Many of the widely publicized incidents of fraud or abuse have been uncovered by these IGs. Incredibly, one of Donald Trump’s first moves in office was to fire most of the IGs. While it is questionable whether he even has the legal authority to do this (the law says that they can only be fired with cause), it makes zero sense that a president anxious to get rid of waste in government would fire people who in many cases have decades of experience exposing waste and fraud. One defense of the firings is that the IGs have not been successful in eliminating waste, but this line is just repeated to generate confusion. The IGs only have power to make recommendations, they can’t do anything on their own. If Trump, Musk, and DOGE were actually interested in eliminating waste and abuse, they would review the reports from the various IGs, as well as recommendations from GAO and use these as a guide for eliminating problems that have already been identified. Instead, they have largely run around blindly, making cuts at agencies before they even bothered to learn what the agencies or their workers do. This is exactly what happened when they fired essential staff at the National Nuclear Security Administration before they realized they were needed to ensure the safety of our nuclear weapon stockpile. They subsequently had to rush to rehire them. They had difficulty tracking down some workers because they had deleted their government e-mails. The story is perhaps nowhere more egregious than with Social Security. Elon Musk and his DOGE team have tried to get into our confidential files on our work and benefit history. There is no remotely plausible reason that DOGE needs our personal information to detect fraud and abuse in Social Security. If they want to evaluate whether the records are accurate, they can use deidentified data, where our names are kept confidential. Researchers both inside and outside the Social Security Administration (SSA) have used this data for decades to detect problems in the program. They did not need to get, and possibly alter, confidential data. The other problem with Elon and the DOGE gang’s reckless approach to Social Security is that they haven’t bothered to make any effort to understand the program and instead seem determined to just develop confused propaganda points to attack the program. Their most widely touted point is that Social Security has millions of dead people on their roles, many of them well over 100 years old, some over 200 years old. Contrary to what Musk and Trump have told the country these dead people are not getting benefits. The SSA knows very well that these people are dead. They haven’t removed them from their lists because it would cost millions of dollars to do so, and there seemed no obvious reason to do so. A department actually interested in efficiency might agree with this decision. The other line that Musk has been pressing is that Social Security is a Ponzi scheme. This is more than a bit fantastic as a claim. The program has been around for more than 80 years and has paid every penny of scheduled benefits. And we know exactly where money will come from to support the program for the indefinite future. The only sense in which it is a Ponzi scheme is that future benefits will depend on people paying taxes into the system. But government bonds could be said to be a Ponzi scheme in the same way. If no one was paying taxes to the government, government bonds would not be worth anything. But if we want to go to this level of absurdity, even stocks of private companies would qualify as Ponzi schemes, since shares of Tesla and SpaceX probably will also not be worth very much if the U.S. government collapses. Musk clearly has no interest in making Social Security more efficient, he is just interested in trying to undermine the credibility of the program, presumably with the goal of making people more amenable to cuts and/or privatization. DOGE is clearly not about efficiency. Maybe a better acronym would be DOPE, Department of Propaganda Enhancement.

Keeping The Climate Agenda On Track In A Trumpian World – OpEd	The election of Donald Trump in November 2024 has seen the United States, in rapid succession, exit the Paris Agreement on climate change and move to impose punishing tariffs on imports from countries around the world. This is a mighty double hit on the world’s ambitions to deal with the existential problem of climate change. As one of the world’s two biggest carbon emitters, the United States’ desertion of the Paris Agreement directly jeopardises reining back emissions and keeping global climate targets on track. Even more dangerous, Trump’s assault on global trade threatens to undermine the transformation of the global energy system through the trade, technology transfer and investment essential to cutting the growth of greenhouse gases. The United States’ walking away from the Paris Agreement and setting out to trash the global economic order creates a whole new level of uncertainty about the future of the international cooperation that is needed if we are to deal with the climate problem. One thing, however, is certain: the United States will not be a constructive national player on climate change for some time to come. And the United States is no longer a responsible custodian of, or even participant in, the rules based international trade order and will not be for an equally long time. Trust of the kind that the United States has enjoyed at the centre of the global economic and political order takes years to build. It has been destroyed in less than 100 days of Trump’s administration. In the face of the US geopolitical maelstrom, can the rest of the world keep the climate agenda on course? What initiatives might help to achieve this? There are people in every country who would deny or wish away the impact of man-made climate change. The United States, at least for the moment, is exceptional in having a national government that is almost totally dominated by such people — though Australia too once had such a government. Most governments, however, still have strong popular mandates for achieving their declared zero carbon goals. Communities around the world are confronted with intensifying natural disasters and their increasing severity and frequency that are its consequence. These events provide the foundation of support for the global climate agenda, minus national leadership in the United States. The global constituency for addressing climate change still provides incentive to businesses and farmers around the world to invest in a zero-carbon future and the innovation that is needed to make it happen. Elon Musk, and other US entrepreneurs, will hopefully continue to capitalise on the opportunities of a green economy future despite the unfavourable national policy environment they face under the Trump administration. In China and Europe where the policy environment has been conducive to building a renewable energy future, new industries and technologies have dramatically lowered the costs of energy transition and begun to claw back on carbon emissions. China and Europe have spawned comparative advantages in decarbonisation in production and consumption. The cost of solar power has fallen by 85 per cent and the cost of wind energy halved in a decade or so and Chinese capacity is rapidly lowering the cost of electric vehicles. Through open trade, technology embedded in green goods and transferred through investment, these centres of industrial innovation and energy transition are the agents of decarbonisation across the world. As the response to climate change reshapes and alters the global economy and supply chains, it opens opportunities for ambitious, strategic corporate and government players. These players will be able to accelerate the uptake of new technologies and practices that reduce emissions, create jobs and underpin economic growth across a wider range of countries and economies. The scale of resources needed to invest in climate change is daunting. The International Energy Agency estimates that, by the early 2030s, the world will need to invest US$4.5 trillion annually to remain on track for a net zero transition by 2050. Mobilising international public funding will now be harder and new sources of public funding will have to be mobilised. China is well placed to step into the breach. Policy frameworks and settings, and their extension through cooperation across national and regional borders, are essential to encourage private funding of sustainable investments, and now more importantly than ever. The problem is that US withdrawal from international climate cooperation and its frontal attack on the global trade regime could both become contagious. The immediate effect of Trump-induced global economic uncertainty is to undermine investor confidence not only in North America but around the world. Elevated international uncertainty is bad for business. It could be fatal for international climate change and trade cooperation unless the rest of the world doubles down on the multilateral, rules-based trade order and keeps the global climate change agenda on track. Like-minded countries will have to step up in an unprecedented way to leverage existing frameworks that create and keep open the markets for low carbon, sustainable goods and services. In this week’s lead essay, Ma Jun suggests that East Asian partners in the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) arrangement have incentives to establish a beachhead of international cooperation on climate change and against protectionism through a regional green trade initiative. An RCEP green trade bloc would help to unlock a sustainable transition and enhance economic growth across a large part of the global economy. An open East Asian green trade arrangement, Ma argues, would ‘reduce the costs of green goods and services in most countries, boost green industries and enable faster and wider adoption of low-carbon practices and technologies’. Cementing and deepening cooperation between Europe, China and East Asia on the development of common financial frameworks (through the Multi-Jurisdiction Common Ground Taxonomy) for green investment is an important complement to working together on keeping trade and investment open. East Asia has the platform in place and the leverage to make a difference to global outcomes if it moves swiftly on both fronts. Source: This article was published by East Asia Forum.

Merkel Is Right: ‘Putin-Versteher’ Is Misguided – OpEd	Former German chancellor, Angela Merkel, has said that discussions about Russia’s interests should not be verboten – silenced. The veteran leader in German politics has criticized the slandering of those who advocate for a greater understanding of Russia's perspective in geopolitical affairs. The term 'Putin-versteher' (Putin understander) has been employed by those seeking to silence others who advocate for a more balanced discussion regarding Russian geopolitics. Merkel has argued that such derogatory terms hinder meaningful dialogue, obfuscates better understanding and undermines diplomacy. In an interview with Berliner Zeitung on Friday, Merkel was asked how she felt about the term, which is often used to label people who address Russian President Vladimir Putin’s concerns over NATO expansion. 'Not good, because there has to be a discussion about it. You have to plan ahead for diplomatic initiatives so that they are available at the right moment,' she said. The former chancellor also rejected the idea that seeking to understand Moscow’s position amounts to supporting it. 'I find the accusation of being a 'Putin-versteher' inappropriate. It is used as a conversation-stopper, a way to shut down debate.' Asked if she has ever been called one, Merkel replied: 'No one has ever called me that – it’s a strange word. Understanding what Putin does and putting oneself in his position is not wrong. It is a fundamental task of diplomacy and something entirely different from supporting him.' Her remarks come amid an ongoing debate in Germany over its policy toward Russia. The term 'Putin-versteher' is frequently used to criticize those who advocate for diplomatic engagement with Moscow, portraying them as sympathetic to the Kremlin. Speaking on European security concerns, Merkel warned that failing to address Russia’s interests could increase the risk of future conflicts. 'There is no justification for him [Putin] invading another country, but the discussion about Russia’s interests must be allowed.' The Wall' fell in ‘89; yet, for 35 years the West has proceeded as though it was still intact. It's time to let go of our Cold War mentality – a foreign policy built on it is contrary to what is in the best interest of the United States as well as Europe. Western democracies seek long-term stability. To achieve this, the West must no longer ostracize Russia as a veritable pariah state. The predicate for such treatment is based on a perception of Moscow as the old Soviet Union, generated through a pre-1989 Cold War lens. This must give way to a new vision of relations between Russia and the West. To understand Russia, its geopolitical concerns and intentions with respect to the West in general and Europe in particular, consideration must be given to the political intrigues which ensued after the fall of the Wall in ‘89. U.S. Secretary of State James Baker’s famous 'not one inch eastward' assurance about NATO expansion in his meeting with Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev on February 9, 1990, was part of a cascade of unfulfilled assurances about Soviet security. Gorbachev and other Soviet officials received reiteration of these assurances throughout the process of German reunification in 1990 and 1991. Declassified US, Soviet, German, British and French documents posted December 12, 2017 by the National Security Archive at George Washington University attest to this. There appears to be a structural fallacy in the West’s orientation vis-a-vis Russia, today. The view of the USSR as a threat during the Cold War was valid. The Warsaw Pact (created 1955 in response to NATO in 1949) was real and its purpose clear. Today, however, 'the Pact' no longer exists – not even the Russian president sees Russia as athreat to the EU or NATO. According to the reasoning of the Russian president, compared to the EU and NATO, Russia is no threat – and nuclear war is pure insanity, 'absolutely out of the question.' Today, the West must follow a new path, one not dictated by a political view created over 70 years ago and designed to fight a Cold War adversary. President Trump has already begun the journey down a new path. During the recent Saudi-Ukraine Peace Conference, the president indicated his intent to reset the US-Russia economic and political relationship. One such move is to bring Russia back into the economically powerful G-7 group of countries. In addition, the US and Russia are working towards an agreement whereby the US would participate in developing Russia’s substantial mineral deposits. Talks have reportedly focused on natural resource exploration, trade routes, and energy collaboration inclusive of the Arctic region. Moreover, Washington and Moscow are in talks on a major deal that would allow for the resumption of Russian energy exports, German outlet Correctiv reported last week, citing its own investigation. An agreement would involve American companies purchasing some portion of the previously disrupted Nord Stream pipeline infrastructure, as well as stakes in three German refineries currently owned by a subsidiary of the Russian energy giant Rosneft, the report said. These are important first steps towards long-term global geopolitical stability. But additional steps should be taken with regard to the issue of Russia and US security interests to reduce tensions and build mutual trust towards greater stability. The Russia of today (with its market economy and -- prior to February 2022 – a substantial energy source for EU economies) should be considered through the lens of Realpolitik. From the vantage point of Western security interests, Russia should be viewed within an expanded frame of reference – rather than necessarily over against it. Security is built on Realpolitik (not ideology) and that means pragmatism, not emotion. If the aim of Western security policy is to mitigate the potential for future conflicts by fostering long-term stability, then (unpalatable though it might seem) discussions with the Russian 'Bear' must commence. The longer the West delays the inevitable dialogue with Russia, the greater the likelihood of further conflicts. Knowns are better than unknowns. Realistic perceptions are to be preferred to faulty ones. Understanding the terms of Russia’s position (even if peripheral) in a more comprehensive Western security frame of reference is critical to long-term stability. Given the understandable reciprocal lack of trust between Moscow and the West, an exclusively adversarial approach is a 'Mobius twist' in which one ends up back where one started – with conflict and instability. The endless sanctions, military deterrence and strategic containment have failed to achieve their objectives and thereby increased the likelihood of future conflict. The challenge is finding a middle path (mutual understanding) between deterrence and confrontation. Keeping Russia outside will only build suspicion and predispose to instability.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfHSL6ZhmFs3pzty7v1LpQe	2025-03-17T16:46:45-07:00	
Do We All Have PTSD? – OpEd	Just how much mental and psychological trauma exists in the country and world today cannot be quantified, and I would not trust any studies that tried. But this much is clear. We have lost our footing in knowing something that scientists long believed we could know: whether and to what extent an economy is growing and prospering or going the opposite way. Everyone seems just to be winging it these days. Ever since lockdowns utterly broke reporting, it’s been hard to tell up from down. The substantial hits taken by major financial indexes over the last two months seem to have triggered a shift in public sentiment from indifferent to gloomy. Probably this has nothing to do with the vast wealth held in invested retirement accounts. Each refresh of the page seems to deliver more bad news. This has in turn affected the willingness to spend and the outlook generally. And yet there is something strange going on. Inflation in real time is genuinely down from its 4-year trend and showing the best numbers since 2020. Even the CPI reflects this. The jobs outlook for the private sector is slightly improving. Why has consumer sentiment suddenly taken a dive? It’s odd because there is a paucity of evidence for a sudden shift, unless tariffs are to blame, which seems doubtful (to me). One possible theory: the public has a form of economic post-traumatic stress disorder, a clinical name for what was once called battle fatigue and shell shock. It is what happens to the human spirit in the face of something unexpected, terrible, and ultimately traumatizing. There are stages of recovery that move from denial, anger, bargaining, and depression, with acceptance as the last stage. That might be where we are. For years now, the national media and government agencies have claimed that all is well. Inflation is cooling. Job growth is strong. The recovery is upon us. Countless media articles have bemoaned the gap that separates real data and maudlin public perceptions. We are encouraged to believe that 'shutting down the economy' is really no big deal, just something you do before turning it on again. Stop complaining! You are rich! It was the ultimate in economic gaslighting, something about which many of us have been kvetching for five years now. In 2024, Brownstone Institute commissioned a closer look. The study found that the US had been in a technical recession since 2022 and with no real recovery since 2020. The authors got to this conclusion by looking at industry price data rather than the wild underestimates from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. It set that against a realistic output estimate. They show all their work. No one has ever taken issue with the study. This is also the 5th anniversary of the greatest trauma of our lives, the lockdowns that wrecked millions of businesses, shut hospitals and churches, restricted movement, and decimated economic life by force. No one ever thought such a thing was possible. It was a trauma for people on the level of wartime. Even now, people are reluctant to talk about it, just like granddad never spoke about his experiences in World War II. Here we are today, desperately approaching finding normalcy again. With that has come a wake-up call concerning household finances. Real income is down. Savings are down. Bills are up. Cutbacks are necessary. They have been delayed for years as the mass media trumpeted the glories of the Biden recovery that simply did not exist or was otherwise a debt-fueled hologram. Now comes the University of Michigan’s Consumer Sentiment Index. After three years of showing big gains, oddly timed with the Biden presidency, it is now showing a tremendous plunge, oddly timed with the Trump inauguration. What especially makes it odd is that inflation is actually lower now than in four years. The latest numbers show none of that. I would offer a chart, but the Institute for Social Research of the University of Michigan withholds making its latest data live for fully one month. You have to pay to get it. This is why no public charting service can give you that data. Hey, they have to make a buck, right? Who can fault them for this? Well, there is a problem, one I never expected. I always thought of the University of Michigan data as likely more reliable than a federal agency. It seems like it comes from the 'real' America, a flyover state with actual scientists who are independent. It only took a quick look on Grok to discover that the Institute for Social Research and this survey in particular is one of the top recipients of federal funding. It comes from the National Institutes of Health, the National Science Foundation, the Social Security Administration, and elsewhere. It totals as much as $100 million per year, from your pocket to theirs. They then sell their data – which is drawn from a survey of 1,000 people – to the private sector at a profit. This has been largely unknown and truly, no one really thought to question this glorious and objective data from the best data-mongers we have. In the past, it never occurred to me to look at the funding sources for this kind of research. But things are opening up. We now understand the racket. The federal government taxes you, feeds the universities and NGOs, they generate research and propaganda to feed the machine, and the cycle continues. The examples are legion and have resulted in an absolute avalanche of fake science in the last five years. We have no direct evidence that the latest Consumer Sentiment data is fake. It might be entirely real, an indication that people are only now waking up from a four-year dream state of denial and confusion – symptomatic of PTSD or shell shock from the trauma of the Covid lockdowns. On the other hand, one does wonder, given that we now know that this ballyhooed research center is actually a federal cutout. I was at an airport bar the other day, and a man asked about my awareness bracelet. It says, 'I won’t be locked down.' He wondered what that meant. Knowing that he was likely still in the denial stage, I explained that five years ago, all our rights were deleted, the economy deliberately crashed, and life was turned inside out based on edicts, pending the release of a new shot that didn’t work but everyone was forced to get anyway. I tried not to make a show of this or go on too long, so I just left it there. His response: 'Yeah that sucked.' Long pause. He followed up: 'We haven’t really had a kind of reckoning with all that, have we?' 'Nope,' I responded. He went back to his beer and nothing more was said. The days before the lockdown were indeed our last innocent moment.

Peace Between Ukraine And Russia: Is Putin Finally On Board? – Op...	By Dave Patterson In life and war, nothing is for sure. Following the negotiations in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, between American and Ukrainian representatives, a ceasefire and way forward to peace in the former Soviet state’s conflict with Russia seemed possible. However, amid a dispute between the two warring powers, one bent on survival and the other focused on conquest, an armistice leading to peace is tricky. The Ukraine government agreed to the conditions set out in the 30-day pause in fighting. Russia, however, is just coming to the party. A Ceasefire Between Ukraine and Russia Secretary of State Marco Rubio was guardedly optimistic in announcing the agreement between the US and Ukraine. However, he quickly pointed out that this only works if Russia’s President Vladimir Putin agrees as well. Rubio made it clear, though, that the US has put the onus on the Kremlin to make this peace deal work. Where Russia stands in the near-term had been difficult to determine, and President Putin was surprisingly vague regarding his position. However, in a breaking story from Moscow, the Associated Press reported that he 'agrees in principle with a US proposal for a 30-day ceasefire in Ukraine, but the terms need to be worked out, and he emphasized that it should pave the way to lasting peace.' Before that story broke, Just the News had reported: 'President Vladimir Putin’s foreign policy adviser, Yuri Ushakov, on Thursday rejected a 30-day ceasefire deal proposed earlier this week by Ukraine and United States.' Timely, delicate, and consequential transactions between nations can drive circumstances rapidly, as Mr. Ushakov discovered. In announcing his acceptance of the US-Ukraine proposition, Putin expressed his concern that it would be just an opportunity for Ukraine to rearm forces on the front lines. To show how difficult a negotiating process this is, during previous attempts at peace, particularly in recognition of Christmas, Ukraine was strongly critical of Russia accepting the pause in fighting to resupply and refresh its troops. According to the AP, Putin told a press conference in Moscow, 'So the idea itself is correct, and we certainly support it. But there are issues that we need to discuss, and I think that we need to discuss it with our American colleagues and partners.' Meanwhile, President Trump’s special envoy, Steve Witkoff, landed in Moscow to provide details of the accord. His job will not be easy. Everything about the fractured relationships between Russia and the US, plus the residual tension between the US and Ukraine, cast a shadow of intense mistrust. Success may be a long-drawn-out effort. Therein lies the problem. Ukraine’s President Zelensky must press for an end to the fighting sooner than later. Ukrainian fighters’ initial successes in moving into and capturing the Russian Kursk region are slipping away. Russian forces have recaptured the area’s largest town, and what Zelensky had hoped to be a territorial bargaining position is evaporating. If the negotiations for lasting peace come down to a discussion about trading territory, losing Kursk puts Kyiv at a disadvantage. Trump’s Sanction Threats Were Important However, the timing of Putin’s tentative agreement to the ceasefire suggests that pressure on him by the recent comments of President Trump may have been compelling. When confirmation of the Kremlin’s willingness to enter into a pause in the fighting was not timely, the US president’s Truth Social megaphone reminded the players: 'Based on the fact that Russia is absolutely ‘pounding’ Ukraine on the battlefield right now, I am strongly considering large-scale Banking Sanctions, Sanctions, and Tariffs on Russia until a Cease Fire and FINAL SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT ON PEACE IS REACHED. To Russia and Ukraine, get to the table right now before it is too late. Thank you!!!' What Trump’s posts lack in the subtlety of polite diplomacy, they make up for with clarity. During a press availability in the Oval Office Thursday (Mar. 13) with President Trump and NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte, the latter commented: 'Finally with Ukraine, you broke the deadlock. As you said all the killing and young people dying; cities getting destroyed. The fact that you did that started the dialogue with the Russians and successful talks in Saudi Arabia with the Ukrainians. I really want to commend you for that.' What Trump has shown is that when he makes promises, whether on the campaign trail or as president, he keeps them, and Putin knows this. Compared to this time last month, the first steps in bringing an end to the horrifying destruction and loss of life appear closer. The willingness of Russia and Ukraine to engage in discussions to implement the 30-day ceasefire is a welcomed development. The views expressed are those of the author and not of any other affiliate.

Myanmar: Junta Troops Forcibly Recruit More Than 70 Young Men In ...	Authorities in Myanmar forcibly recruited more than 70 young men from a single town in the south-central Ayeyarwady region, residents said Monday, as the junta launched a new round of training for the country’s draftees. It’s the latest round-up under Myanmar’s military service law, which the junta began implementing last April as a way of shoring up its dwindling ranks amid mounting losses to rebel groups. On March 14, junta troops in Ayeyarwady’s Mawlamyinegyun township arrested more than 70 men — including some as young as 17 years old — and sent them to depots in the Yangon region to take part in the 11th round of military training, residents told RFA Burmese. The arrests were carried out by troops from the junta’s 534th Infantry Battalion based in Mawlamyinegyun, said one resident who, like others interviewed for this report, spoke to RFA on condition of anonymity due to security concerns. 'Young people in the villages are too afraid to sleep at home at night due to fear of conscription,' he said. 'Soldiers are forcibly arresting them. The local battalion is carrying out the arrests, and at times, parents have no idea where to look for their children [after they are taken].' The identities of the young men were not immediately clear, and RFA was unable to independently verify who was taken in the dragnet. Attempts by RFA to contact Khin Maung Kyi, the junta’s spokesperson and social affairs minister for the Ayeyarwady region, for comment on the situation went unanswered Monday. The forced recruitment comes after residents of Ayeyarwady’s Hinthada, Laputta, and Kangyidaung townships last month said that several young men fled the area after they were summoned by name for conscription, instead of an earlier used lottery system. Administrators targeted over draft Under the mandatory military service law, men aged 18 to 35 and women aged 18 to 27 must serve a minimum of two years in the military. Young people have been looking for ways to leave the country ever since the law was enacted. Many new recruits have been sent for training after being detained at gunpoint by junta troops. They face torture or execution if they are caught trying to escape. In late February, rebels in Myanmar’s Bago region assassinated two local administrators who forcibly recruited civilians for military service, residents and other sources said, bringing the number of officials killed for their involvement in carrying out the draft to at least 110. Prior to the incidents, the latest killing of an administrator for their involvement in military recruitment was that of Than Htwe, of Khwet Ma village in Magway region’s Minhla township, who was shot dead on Feb. 15. Between February and September 2024, anti-junta forces killed 108 ward and village administrators involved in recruiting, compiling name lists and extorting money for military service, according to data compiled by RFA.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfHSL6ZhmFs3jipWcsIxzxi	2025-03-17T16:37:38-07:00	
Trump Sets Tuesday Call With Putin In Search Of Cease-Fire In Ukr...	(RFE/RL) -- US President Donald Trump said he plans to speak by phone with Russian President Vladimir Putin on March 18 as he bids to bring about a cease-fire in the war in Ukraine that has drained both sides of soldiers and resources. 'I'll be speaking to President Putin on Tuesday. A lot of work's been done over the weekend,' Trump told reporters late on March 16 during a flight back to Washington from his resort in Florida. 'We want to see if we can bring that war to an end. Maybe we can, maybe we can't, but I think we have a very good chance,' Trump said. When asked about possible concessions that might be required to secure a cease-fire, Trump said that 'we'll be talking about land. We'll be talking about power plants.' 'I think we have a lot of it already discussed very much by both sides, Ukraine and Russia. We're already talking about that, dividing up certain assets.' The Kremlin did not immediately comment. Trump has made a priority during the first months of his second term in office to bring about a cease-fire agreement in the three-year war in Ukraine. After holding talks in Saudi Arabia, Ukrainian and US officials announced on March 11 that Kyiv had agreed to a 30-day cease-fire proposal, contingent on Russia's agreement. Moscow has so far reacted coolly to the idea, with Putin suggesting additional conditions, including a freeze on US weapons supplies to Kyiv. Meanwhile, a top Russian official said Moscow will insist Ukraine not be allowed to join NATO and remain 'neutral' in any peace deal -- conditions Kyiv has long rejected. One of the Kremlin's original grievances in justifying its February 2022 invasion continues to be one of Kyiv's central demands: NATO membership. On March 14, Putin had said any agreement should lead to long-term peace that addresses the 'root' reasons for the war -- an apparent reference to NATO expansion and other developments Putin claims have put Russia's security in jeopardy. In remarks published on March 17, Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Aleksandr Grushko told the Russian daily Izvestia that 'we will demand that ironclad security guarantees become part of this agreement.' 'Part of these guarantees should be the neutral status of Ukraine, the refusal of NATO countries to accept it into the alliance,' he said. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has often stressed that for Kyiv to accept any peace deal it must come with security guarantees for Ukraine from its Western partners, including eventual NATO membership. 'I have insisted [on Ukraine's membership in] NATO, but you know what the answers have been,' he said in February, suggesting that the path to joining the Western military alliance remains obstructed. On March 16, US Secretary of State Marco Rubio said in a CBS interview that a final peace accord would 'involve a lot of hard work, concessions from both Russia and Ukraine,' adding that it would be difficult to even start such talks 'as long as they're shooting at each other.' Separately in March 17, French President Emmanuel Macron and new Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney met in Paris and 'reaffirmed their unwavering support for Ukraine as it continues to resist Russia’s unjustifiable war of aggression,' according to a joint statement. Meanwhile, Zelenskyy on March 16 shook up his military leadership, appointing Major General Andriy Hnatov as Ukraine's new chief of the General Staff, replacing Lieutenant-General Anatoliy Barhilevych, as Kyiv looks to speed the pace of reform and reorganization. 'We are consistently changing the armed forces to make them even more combat ready. To achieve it, we are changing the management system and introducing clear standards,' Defense Minister Rustem Umerov said The statement said Barhilevych, who was appointed to the post in February 2024, will now serve as inspector general of the Defense Ministry. Barhilevych replaced Lieutenant General Serhiy Shaptala when he took the post on the General Staff in 2024. On the battlefield, Russian forces launched what appeared to be a major drone strike on the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv, on March 16 as explosions were heard in various districts. Mayor Vitali Klitschko said air-defense units were attempting to knock out the drones and warned residents to 'stay in shelters.' In the Sumy region, authorities said one person was killed and two injured when explosive devices dropped from a Russian drone and mortar fire hit an apartment building in the Bilopillia community. In Russia's Kursk region, Russian forces continued their drive to force Ukrainian troops from territory they had captured in a stunning cross-border offensive last August. Latest estimates put the area under Ukrainian control at about 110 square kilometers, down from a peak of nearly 1,400 square kilometers last year.

Hegseth Says Campaign Against Houthis Will Be ‘Unrelenting’ Until...	By Matthew Olay During a media interview yesterday, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth said the U.S. military will continue to tactically engage Iranian-backed Houthis until they stop acting aggressively against U.S. ships in the region. Hegseth commented on the topic following President Donald J. Trump's order for U.S. Central Command to launch multiple airstrikes against Houthis in Yemen, March 15, 2025. 'Freedom of navigation is basic; it's a core national interest,' Hegseth said, adding that the current campaign is about restoring deterrents in the region in addition to freedom of navigation. 'The minute the Houthis say, 'We'll stop shooting at your ships [and] we'll stop shooting at your drones,' this campaign will end but, until then, it will be unrelenting,' he continued. Hegseth also said the airstrikes were meant to draw Iran's attention. 'The message is clear to Iran … Your support of the Houthis needs to end immediately. We will hold you accountable as the sponsor of this proxy, and I echo [the president's] statement [that] we will not be nice about it,' Hegseth said. The Houthis have been acting aggressively in the Red Sea region since October 2023, when a U.S. Navy destroyer had to intercept three land-attack cruise missiles fired by the Houthis toward Israel. Since then, the Houthis have launched over 100 drone and missile attacks targeting American and allied ships in the Gulf of Aden and the Red Sea, resulting in many commercial ships having to alter their routes to avoid the region at a tremendous commercial cost. Hegseth likened the severe economic impact of the Houthi aggression in the region to 'being held hostage by a terrorist organization' and then pointed out that the Trump administration has indeed labeled the Houthis as such. 'To the Houthis: [the airstrikes weren't] a one-night thing … This is about stopping the shooting at assets in that critical waterway to reopen the freedom of navigation, which is a core national interest of the United States,' Hegseth said, before again reemphasizing that Iran needs to 'back off' from enabling the Houthis. Hegseth said Iran and its additional military proxies — including Hamas and Hezbollah — are in a 'weakened state.' 'But it doesn't mean they still don't have the desire [for aggression],' he said, adding that Iran will never be allowed to have a nuclear weapon. 'Iran must get that clear message and negotiate the end of their pursuit for nuclear weapons because … President Trump has said clearly that they will not get a bomb,' Hegseth said.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfHSL6ZhmFs3j_7JE5fHT_C	2025-03-17T16:32:21-07:00	
Palestine Question A Key Test Of US Foreign Policy – OpEd	It is crucial for any US administration to recognize that, regardless of political agendas, the views of the American public regarding the situation in Palestine and Israel are undergoing a significant shift. A critical mass of opinion is rapidly forming and this change is becoming undeniable. Paradoxically, while Islamophobia continues to rise across the US, sentiments supporting Palestinians and opposing Israeli occupation are steadily increasing. In theory, this means that the pro-Israeli media’s success in linking Israel’s actions against the Palestinian people to the so-called war on terror — a narrative that has demonized Islam and Muslims for many years — is faltering. Americans are increasingly viewing the situation in Palestine as a human rights issue, and one that is deeply relevant to domestic politics. A recent Gallup poll underscored this shift. The poll, released on March 6, was conducted between Feb. 3 and 16. It found that American support for Israel was at its lowest point since polling began 25 years ago, while sympathy for Palestinians had reached its highest level. Having 46 percent of Americans sympathize more with Israelis and 33 percent with Palestinians would have seemed inconceivable in the past, when the plight of Palestine and its people was largely overlooked by the general public. Even more remarkable is that this shift continues to gain momentum, despite the fact that the mainstream media and American politicians are more biased than ever, promoting a dehumanizing discourse of Palestinians and unprecedented, uncritical support for Israel. While the growing shift in favor of Palestine — particularly as a result of the genocide in Gaza, which played a role in influencing the outcomes in several states during the 2024 presidential election — went largely unnoticed by the Biden administration, it is clear that the dissatisfaction with the government’s position remains unchanged since the change of presidency. The previous administration approved significant military aid to Israel, topping $17.9 billion in the first year of the genocidal war on Gaza alone. This blatant disregard for Palestinian lives and rights has persisted under the new administration, who has appointed some staunchly anti-Palestinian, pro-Israel figures to key positions in his government. Trump did this despite making repeated, though often contradictory, promises to end the war and resolve the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Instead, the US president has approved the release of a shipment of heavy MK-84 bombs and passed the sale of arms worth nearly $3 billion to Israel. The White House also introduced a new US policy based on 'taking ownership' of Gaza and displacing its population. However, this position was inconsistently articulated and Trump last Thursday seemed to reverse it altogether. This left many wondering whether US foreign policy was truly independent or simply a reflection of the influence of Israel and its Washington lobby. Unlike President Joe Biden, whose support for Israel was consistent, the new administration’s stance has been confusing and contradictory. The US news portal Axios reported on March 5 that direct talks between the US, led by hostage envoy Adam Boehler, and Hamas had taken place in Doha. In an interview four days later, Boehler made the striking statement that US and Israeli foreign policies should be seen as separate. 'We’re the United States. We’re not an agent of Israel,' he said. However, as analysts began mulling over this unprecedented language, it was soon revealed that Boehler had been removed from his position and America’s traditional, unwavering support for Israel quickly returned. As US policymakers continue to swing between their unwavering commitment to Israel and 'America First' rhetoric, they must keep in mind the following four factors. First, the American public is increasingly aware of events in Palestine, so masking Israel’s violations of Palestinian rights under the guise of 'Israel’s right to defend itself' no longer suffices. Second, US and Israeli interests are not identical: the US seeks geopolitical dominance followed by stabilization and so-called containment, while Israel thrives on provocations, destabilization and long-lasting conflicts. Third, Palestine has become a domestic issue in the US and the debate on Palestine and Israel is no longer one-sided. Growing support for Palestine means that more US voters will base their future political decisions on how the country engages with Israel and its disregard for Palestinian rights. Fourth, crackdowns on dissent, arrests of activists and funding cuts will only deepen the polarization around this issue, rather than fostering an open, informed and productive debate on a matter of great importance to millions of Americans. Such actions are quickly eroding the reputation of the US as a democratic state and undermining confidence in its commitment to a peaceful resolution of the conflict. Palestine may not be the sole measure by which the Trump administration will be judged, nor the only factor shaping future voting patterns. Yet, it is undoubtedly a crucial test. If the contradictions persist and the US continues to provide unwavering military support for Israel, Palestine could become the defining issue that contributes to the unraveling of US foreign policy, not only in the Middle East but around the world. It is not too late for this trajectory to shift or for some degree of balance to emerge. The lives of millions of people are at stake.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfHSL6ZhmFs3ry-EUX16IZ5	2025-03-17T16:30:04-07:00	
North Korean Deployment In Kursk: A Window Into The DPRK Military...	By Lorenzo Fedrigo The direct intervention of North Korea in the Ukraine war represents a test benchmark for the Korea’s People Army, whose battlefield actions are now challenging the traditional Western opinions that have always drawn it as an obsolete and ineffective power.Looking beyond the dominant media’s narrative, North Korean involvement allows us to analyze with a better precision the operative capabilities of an army which is historically shrouded in secrecy. A deepening North Korea-Russia bilateral relationship The Kim Jong-un regime, Moscow’s historical ally, has constantly demonstrated its support for Russian expansionism in Ukraine. In 2017, the DPRK recognized Crimea as part and parcel of the Russian Federation, and then endorsed the invasion of February 2022. A few months later, the North Korean regime recognized the sovereignty of self-proclaimed independent republics of Donetsk and Luhansk. The latest significant diplomatic action between the two countries dates back to November 2024, with the ratification of an important military cooperation agreement which includes a mutual protection clause, sealing the strategic agreement we now see in action. In addition to political support, Pyongyang has provided an ever growing and more relevant military contribution. The first military supplies date from the end of 2022, when it appeared clear to Moscow that the conflict would last beyond its initial forecast, requiring external support in order to compensate for the military production shortfalls of Russia’s defense industry. The first North Korean aid included large deliveries of artillery munitions, but, according to data out of Ukraine, about half of the rounds fired were defective. Pyongyang continues to provide a great amount of its own ammunition production to its Russian ally.After the signing of the November 2024 agreements, this output has risen, now including self-propelled howitzers, short-range missile systems, and even soldiers in support of the Russian army – a fact still denied by Moscow and Pyongyang. The strategic rationale behind Pyongyang sending its men to support the Ukraine war resides in various conditionslaid out in the above bilateral agreements. In exchange for what Moscow sees as mere frontline fodder, the North Korean regime gains significant advantages, including access to sophisticated Russian satellite technology and the ability to acquire foreign currency to finance their nuclear and missile programs. In addition, North Korea benefits from Moscow’s sharing of advanced military technology and a reassurance of Russian support in the event of a conflict on the Korean peninsula. Unpacking the composition of the North Korean deployment in Kursk According to reporting out of Ukraine, the North Korean force sent in support to Russia amounts to between 10,000 and 12,000 men in five infantry brigades. After receiving basic training in Vladivostok, the troops were moved by air over 7,000 kilometers to the outskirts of Kursk, placed under the Russian military command, and here they’d have received Russian uniforms and equipment, in addition to forged identity documents that attribute them to the Russian region of Tuva, thereby concealing any evidence of North Korean involvement. The troops are supported by an estimated 500 officers and three North Korean generals, including Kim Yong Bok, commanding 1,500 men from the special operations forces of the People’s Army of Korea (조선인민군 특수작전군) whose presence was also confirmed by the South Korean National Intelligence Service (NIS). The North Korean deployment in Kursk has been used to launch continuous assaults, keeping Ukrainian forces engaged such that the Russians can concentrate on other critical areas of the front. The first North Korean attack on Ukrainian lines is likely to have been launched on 4 November, confirming Western fears dating back to August, when unit movements from Pyongyang were first detected near Vladivostok. The estimated 10,000 men deployed by the Pentagon at about 50 kilometers from the Ukrainian front, were initially considered part of a defensive contingent aimed at guarding the Kursk region, which had been the subject of the Ukrainian counteroffensive a few months earlier. Assessments gathered by Ukrainian forces suggest that these North Korean forces are totally unprepared for modern war. The tactics they employ are obsolete, based on military concepts that are at least four decades old, notably in the advancing of infantry fronts without mechanized support. But above all, these strategies completely neglect the decisive role of drone warfare in modern conflicts, which the North Koreans hitherto had no experience with. Despite the outdated tactical approach, the standard equipment provided to North Korean soldiers appears qualitatively higher than the average Russian. Weapons recovered from the dead confirm the presence of AK-12 assault rifles with a dozen magazines, between five and ten grenades, several mines and an updated version of the Russian tactical backpack containing very scarce water reserves and supplies. The surprising mobility of Pyongyang’s troops, facilitated by the absence of armor and bulletproof vests, makes these fighters particularly difficult targets to hit for drones. On the disciplinary level, North Korean soldiers are distinguished by a physical and mental resistance much higher than the worn-out Russian ranks. Their absolute dedication to the orders received lends itself to treacherous frontal assaults. There are numerous reports of North Korean soldiers who, instead of surrendering, preferred to be blown up with grenades. Ideological indoctrination seems to play a central role in the behavior of these units. According to some testimonies, North Koreans would eliminate the wounded comrades in order to avoid falling prisoners, just as the Russians have opened fire several times on retreating North Koreans, in the fear that capture may reveal their true identity. As part of the role played by propaganda, notes were found on the bodies of the fallen soldiers, in which they extol the superiority of North Korea and the willingness to sacrifice themselves for the glory of their own country at any cost. Offering a counter view to this alleged ideological fanaticism inherent to North Korean soldiers, there are some revelations confirmed by both the NIS and the former National Security Communications Advisor of the White House J. Kirby. It seems that the North Korean soldiers are forced by high command to commit the unthinkable in order to avoid capture, because being taken prisoner by the Ukrainians risks serious reprisals against their families back home. Particularly relevant are some documents found on officers’ bodies, including disciplinary records that outline punishments for crimes such as stealing food from supplies or hesitating to commit suicide attacks. Captured prisoners provide window into the North Korean deployment Although the news that filters through the North Korean regime is scarce, according to the NIS, the five North Korean brigades consist mainly of conscripts called up for military service from the age of 17. The mandatory service period would be around eight years, which would explain the great physical and mental resistance of the troops, as well as the good combat skills reported by the Ukrainians. Precisely because of the poor knowledge about these soldiers and the extreme difficulty in taking them prisoner, Ukrainian troops have been on a mission for over a month to capture at least one North Korean. As reported in an interview with the Kyiv Independent, the operation that led to the capture of two North Korean soldiers in mid-January was plagued by numerous difficulties. The two prisoners had been wounded during the fighting and were lying on the battlefield; the capture operations in both cases proved particularly complex, due to the immediate Russian reaction. Although they had never fired a single shot before, when the Russian command understood that the soldiers were being recovered, they opened fire in a deliberate attempt to prevent their capture. The two prisoners are currently in the custody of the Ukrainian secret services and are subject to numerous interrogations aimed at extracting as much information from them as possible. One of the soldiers, identified as Lee Jong Nam, born in 1999 in Pyongyang, a 25-year-old sergeant, enlisted in 2016, serving in a reconnaissance platoon as a sharpshooter. His first combat mission dates back to 8 January, during which he was wounded in the jaw. All the other members of his seven-man unit were killed in operations prior to his capture. The second prisoner, born in 2005, remains unidentified. Captured by the Ukrainian media in a film from his hospital bed, he stated that he was wounded on the ground for 'three, four or five days.' He also revealed that the name on his Russian military card was false, stating that he did not remember it and that it did not correspond to his real identity. The soldier revealed that he was convinced he was in the middle of a drill. According to a recent statement by prisoners, many of his fellow soldiers were even convinced that they were fighting against South Korean troops. An ongoing learning experience with wider implications According to Seth John, an academic at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, North Korean losses are difficult to quantify accurately. However, he estimates that they may be between 30% and 50% of the total, with at least 1,000 men killed in the course of the operations. The figures vary according to the sources: the South Korean NIS, for example, claims that Pyongyang has lost about 300 men, with 2,700 wounded and missing, while for Kyivthe number of casualties is estimated at 4,000. In any case, the losses are substantial, mainly due to the threat posed by drone warfare and the language barrier between North Koreans and Russians, which significantly complicates coordination on the ground. In light of this high human cost, according to Ukrainian reports, the North Korean contingent was temporarily withdrawn from the front to reintegrate personnel and receive further training, probably focused on drone tactics. There are also rumors of a possible new troop deployment by Pyongyang, in compliance with the military cooperation agreements ratified last November. As per an article published by the BBC on 7 February, the North Korean contingent has since returned to combat, however the news remains to be confirmed. Although the North Korean intervention is not essential in determining the outcome of the war, it offers us interesting insights from multiple perspectives, not only for the organization of the North Korean military, but also in the context of a wider geopolitics. The North Korean deployment in Ukraine is already producing significant effects: troops are gaining first-hand experience on the modern battlefield, mitigating against decades of tactical backwardness. At the same time, the use of domestically produced weapons and equipment in a high-intensity conflict allows Pyongyang to assess their effectiveness. Armed with this knowledge, Pyongyang, with strong Russian support, could establish itself as a relevant regional actor in East Asia.

Abortion Tourism On The Rise In Russia As Regions Adopt Different...	The Russian government has been actively seeking to reduce the number of abortions in Russia as it faces increasing demographic problems. Despite the constitutional right to abortion and the decline of abortion operations given improved birth control methods, Moscow has banned pro-choice propaganda and is supporting regional governments’ anti-abortion laws (Window on Eurasia, October 18, December 21, 2024; Garant.ru; ConsultantPlus, accessed March 12). Moscow has not instilled a country-wide abortion ban, a move that would spark criticism in politically-sensitive and sizable population centers such as Moscow and St. Petersburg. Instead of a ban, the government has supported actions by federal subjects to restrict access to abortions, ensuring a difficult process that varies across the regions. This array of regulations has caused abortions to be difficult to access in some regions and easier in others. This in turn has led to the emergence and growth of abortion tourism as women travel from abortion-restricted regions to others, or even abroad, where it is easier to access (Novaya Gazeta Europe, February 7; Veter, March 6). Using this approach, the Kremlin seeks to retain power while shifting responsibility for these restrictions onto individual regions, much as it did during the COVID-19 pandemic (see EDM, April 27, 2020). Such an approach, however, may backfire by lessening Moscow’s authority and demonstrating to citizens that laws can be bypassed. In December 2023, a private clinic abortion prohibition bill was proposed to the State Duma, but the Parliamentary Committee on Health did not support it. Many private clinics, however, have refused to perform abortions, forcing women to turn to government clinics with long wait-times and where staff reportedly pressure women to continue their pregnancy. Although these clinics were said to have voluntarily refused service, it is suspected that it was done under pressure from the authorities (Radio Svoboda, March 9, 2024). The proposal of a full abortion ban in Vologda Oblast, about 400 miles east of St Petersburg, has attracted particular attention. Georgy Filimonov, governor of Vologda Oblast, is pushing for a regional law that would ban all abortions, excluding in the cases of medical complications or rape (Novaya Gazeta Europe, February 7). This display of loyalty to the Kremlin, rather than to the Russian constitution and Russian law, is sending a chill through the region. Even if such a law is adopted, which is improbable given its unpopularity, it is unlikely to survive any subsequent court challenges. Irina Faynman, an abortion rights activist, founder of the Foundation for Emergency Contraception, and author of the Telegram channel 'Whispers of the Blood', is certain no such law will ever pass at the federal level because it would be so unpopular (Russian Feminist Association 'SHE', July 22, 2023; T.me/shorokhi_krovi, accessed March 12). Faynman argues that Moscow is attempting to achieve the same ends by forcing the regions one by one to introduce such measures (Novaya Gazeta Europe, March 7). Unsurprisingly, under these circumstances, other regional heads seek to continue the approach the Putin regime has long maintained and are looking to adopt regulations in a move to shift the responsibility to hospitals, doctors, and municipalities (Mel, March 8). According to Faynman, some women who are being refused requests for abortions at clinics in Vologda Oblast are now travelling to neighboring Yaroslavl Oblast where there are no such restrictions. At present, this is the easiest option as they can travel there by local train or bus for relatively little money. The total number of women doing so is unknown, she acknowledges, but the hospitals in Yaroslavl are now reporting overcrowding in their obstetrician-gynecologist (OB-GYN) departments. They may soon need to turn women away, not because their region has banned abortion but because there simply are not enough doctors and nurses to accommodate the number of procedures (Novaya Gazeta Europe, March 7). Due to Russian President Vladimir Putin’s healthcare optimization project, which has cut the number of hospitals and doctors throughout Russia over the last decade, this will be a growing problem (Novyye Izvestiya, May 19, 2024; Novaya Gazeta Kazakhstan, September 16, 2024). The phenomenon of Russian women traveling for abortions has grown to the point that Russians refer to it as 'abortion tourism,' Faynman says (Novaya Gazeta Europe, March 7). This term is not unique to Russia and has been used in places such as the United States for some time. The term abortion tourism gained popularity in 2023 as more and more women travelled from region to region for abortions. Faynman states that the routes that have attracted the most attention are those from Karelia, Kursk, and Kaliningrad to Moscow and St. Petersburg. While most Russian abortion tourism remains within the borders of the country, Faynman says, an increasing number of women are travelling to Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan for medical procedures. Those countries provide good services in this regard and are not expensive for the Russian women who need them (Novaya Gazeta Europe, March 7). Faynman adds that she and other activists are currently forming groups to educate women on their rights and to access abortions when needed (Novaya Gazeta Europe, March 7). The Russian government, however, may counter this by charging them with promoting abortion, something now illegal country-wide, or otherwise seek to suppress their activities (Verstka, March 10). In this situation, she says Russian women should not continue to count on being able to access the morning-after pill, as many have in recent years, but rather should instead practice safe sex to avoid being at the mercy of Kremlin policies (Novyye Izvestiya, November 28, 2024; Novaya Gazeta Europe, March 7). Abortion tourism is only one of the ways in which Moscow’s efforts to restrict or even ban abortions are backfiring. Russian sociologists claim that such moves will do little to nothing to boost the birthrate (Window on Eurasia, February 16). More seriously, however, many Russian women will turn to illegal abortion providers at great risk to their health and lives (Yesli Byt’ Tochnym, July 28, 2023). This latest Kremlin tactic is likely to exacerbate relations between the regions and the center, highlighting how the Kremlin seeks to protect itself by not imposing such restrictions on women in Moscow and St. Petersburg. This tactic, however, also suggests that if the federal subjects hold the right to restrict or even ban abortions, they should have the ability to make decisions on other issues as well. This will affect not only traditional questions such as restrictions on alcohol sales and consumption, but broader political ones as well (The Insider, November 22, 2024; Nakanune.ru, March 6). Consequently, while banning abortions in certain regions may please Russian conservatives, this move may end by undermining and even threatening Putin’s hold on power, hardly the result he or Russia’s conservatives want (Window on Eurasia, August 7, 2023). The growth of abortion tourism is yet another harbinger of the fall of Putin’s regime.

Regional Green Trade Bloc To Fight Both Climate Ahange And Protec...	By Ma Jun US President Donald Trump’s decision to raise tariffs on imports from Canada, China and Mexico, and all imports of aluminium and steel has led the world to brace for major trade disruptions and economic confusion. Protectionism has come back into vogue and countries are cultivating critical sectors at home to bolster their economic security. The retreat from free trade will accelerate under Trump, with far-reaching consequences — especially in the fight against climate change. But the world has changed significantly in recent years. A deeper trend visible beyond the posturing and threats includes growing recognition of the urgency of cultivating home-grown green industries to combat climate change. This climate imperative must serve two mutually reinforcing goals — staving off further temperature increases and boosting economic growth and job creation. Green trade is international trade in green goods and services in areas such as renewable energy, green transportation, energy efficiency, waste management, sustainable agriculture, nature-based solutions and environmental professional services. Allowing free green trade — the trading of green goods, services and technologies as freely as possible across nations — will help decarbonise the economy and protect the environment at low cost. A green trade arrangement would involve reductions in tariffs and non-tariff barriers on a carefully selected list of green goods and services that deliver environmental and climate benefits. This will reduce the costs of green goods and services in most countries, boost green industries and enable faster and wider adoption of low-carbon practices and technologies. Introducing green trade policy on a global scale is challenging as one or two nations can obstruct a complex global deal. But it can be built on the foundations of existing regional trade agreements, among a smaller ‘coalition of the willing’. In the Asia Pacific region, the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) offers one avenue for freeing up green trade. As the world’s largest trading bloc, by population and GDP, it comprises 15 countries and accounts for 30 per cent of global economic activity. A green trade arrangement could operate within the terms of RCEP, eliminating tariffs and significantly reducing non-tariff barriers on green goods and services ahead of the bloc’s existing eight-year timeline for full tariff removal. Designing the list of green goods and services that should be covered by the green trade arrangement is the first step that is needed. An initial study by the Institute of Finance and Sustainability (IFS) suggests that this list could include a few dozen categories and a few hundred products and services. Demonstrating the economic benefits of a green trade agreement to all member states will be key. Robust design of the arrangement must ensure that all member countries in the bloc benefit economically, accelerating their pace of decarbonisation and advancing the growth of their green industries. Incentives for green foreign direct investment and technology transfers — such as a more stable policy environment, enhanced protection for investors and intellectual property rights — need to be incorporated into the green trade arrangement to increase trade and encourage cross-border green investment and technology transfers and help low-income countries develop green industries and jobs. If RCEP adopts the idea, a larger number of Chinese, Japanese and South Korean electric vehicle and renewable energy equipment manufacturers are likely to invest in supply chain development and license technologies to local producers across ASEAN countries. There needs to be a balance between the need for policy incentives to stimulate green industries and trade-distorting subsidies. Government incentives for the production and consumption of green goods and services are often viewed favourably, but they can lead to trade disputes. Within the RCEP framework, it would be helpful if some no-significant-harm principles and prohibited subsidies could be agreed upon. Non-tariff barriers not only tariffs must be removed or reduced. Under many free trade arrangements, non-tariff barriers are often more significant impediments than tariffs to international trade and investment in green industries. This requires a serious stocktake of all non-tariff barriers, including import and export quotas, quality inspection against domestic standards, customs clearance processes, product traceability requirements, trade finance and export credit insurance and cross-border payment and settlement. Options should be developed to reduce these barriers, including harmonising green product and traceability standards and reducing the cost of trade finance using green finance instruments. A dialogue that considers all these factors will be crucial and larger economies such as China, Indonesia, Australia, Japan and South Korea can play a key role in forming an initial consensus on the economic and climate merit of a green trade initiative within RCEP. A regional green trade arrangement can be an inclusive approach to support a ‘just’ climate transition. It will promote decarbonisation and mutual economic benefits in all member states — via job creation and revenue growth. A multilateral approach will build mutual trust for broader cooperation on climate and trade issues. The case for green trade arrangements is even stronger compared to the approach being embraced by some advanced economies. While the Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM) favoured by the European Union can reduce carbon leakage from imports, it harms incomes and employment in developing economies exporting carbon-intensive goods. Such unilateral measures are likely to lead to retaliation and yet more protectionism. CBAM amounts to a ‘stick’ that punishes developing countries for not sacrificing domestic growth and development to reduce emissions. In contrast, a green free trade arrangement provides a ‘carrot’ encouraging green production and trade. Aligning climate goals with trade and development objectives rewards all participating economies for making progress on the green transition with mutual gains from trade, an initiative of the type a just green transition demands.

Western Pundits Should Stop Writing Idiotic Nonsense About Russia...	From an extremely small list, Owen Matthews has been one of the more balanced mainstream commentators on the war in Ukraine. Not seeking to take one side over the other, but to step back and look at the bigger picture. I was shocked, therefore, by his article in the Independent this week. ‘The Russian economy is on the brink of collapse, and Putin knows it,’ ran the headline. I’ve read a different version of the same headline over a hundred times since 2014, including while serving as the Economic Counsellor at the British Embassy in Moscow. I am still waiting for it to be proved correct. Firstly, some of the data in Matthews’ article were objectively not correct. The ‘ruble has lost over half its value since Putin invaded Crimea in 2014.’ Wrong. It is around one third of its spring 2014 value. And as I’ve pointed out many times, a weak ruble has been an explicit article of Russian monetary policy since late 2016, to offset the effect of major energy price swings. That helped Russia pull in record tax receipts in 2022 because of the potent combination of sky high energy prices and rock bottom ruble rate. That’s basic economics. ‘Over $600bn of the Kremlin’s foreign currency reserves have been frozen in Western banks,’ Wrong again. The figure is less than $300bn, and Russia still retains the same value of available reserves, that would cover over a year’s worth of imports. I could go on but won’t. Matthews is known as an historian, not an economist. I don’t claim to be an economist either, but I can count. In broad terms, I don’t dispute the economic headwinds that Matthews points to, albeit clumsily. Domestic labour constraints driven by the war and Russia’s secular population decline are a problem. Massive fiscal stimulus is overheating the economy with inflation high. Although I’d argue that 9% isn’t ‘rampant’; one million percent in Venezuela is rampant. However, Russia has been here before. Inflation breached the 9% mark in November 2014 following the oil price collapse, and didn’t fall below that level until early 2016. It peaked again at the start of the war in Ukraine hitting 18%. Interest rates in Russia now are extremely high at 21% but, again, they were hiked to 17% in December 2014. It isn’t incorrect for Matthews to point out these legitimate economic challenges. The point is that neither inflation nor interest rates will ever be a strong enough reason for President Putin to change course in Ukraine. Not now, not in 2014, not at any point since the Ukraine crisis started. He has always chosen to accept economic pain and manage the political consequences of that, to avoid backing down in the face of western economic pressure. Like so many mainstream pundit, Matthews briefly sketches the economic fix Ukraine is in before hurrying along as if there’s ‘nothing to see here’. Conveniently, he doesn’t explore the mathematics of how Europe will pay to keep the lights on in Kyiv while also funding Von der Leyen’s $800bn rearmament programme. Nor has he considered what this would mean for ordinary European citizens who increasingly question the wisdom of funding a forever war that Ukraine cannot win. Or considered the link between self-defeating war policy of identikit globalist European leaders and the rise in the popularity of anti-war nationalist parties all across Europe. Owen Matthews doesn’t touch on Ukraine’s looming sovereign default and the collapse of its currency that would follow. Or the concern that, with a structural current account deficit, Ukraine has no way to exist as an independent, sovereign nation, other than, you guessed it, through western state handouts. Nor how the immense cost of bailing Ukraine out would fall on Europe on top of the contingent liabilities already enumerated above. Rather, Matthews suggests that Europe needs to do more of what is has been doing for the past eleven years without success. More sanctions, even though over 90% of individual sanctions have absolutely no effect. He doesn’t reflect on the fact that Russia has been under sanctions for eleven straight years, is the most sanctioned country on the planet, and yet is still growing faster than Europe, even though that growth is undoubtedly built on fiscal sand. Yet still, finally and irrevocably, he suggests Europe could cut itself off completely from Russian gas. No need to dwell on the obvious economic truth that higher-cost energy in Europe is driven by a huge imbalance between supply and demand that neither the U.S. nor Russia experiences. No thought given to the notion that Europe’s deindustrialisation has been accelerated by the political choice to cut off 90% of piped Russian gas supplies. As every other mainstream British pundit has called for more sanctions and less gas, Owen Matthews has plumped for the easy option too. Presumably to show some value-added in his low-calorie commentary, Owen Matthews supports Ukrainian drone attacks on any energy infrastructure that facilitates the delivery of Russian gas to Europe. Clearly impressed by the destruction of the NordStream pipeline, like a spotty-faced teenager watching a Seventies Bond movie, he considers industrial terrorism to be a legitimate policy choice for western leaders. I would like to say that his article was terrible. But in truth, it was no different from practically every other mainstream British Glavlit article on Russia’s economy that I’ve seen over the past eleven years. And, the thing is, it isn’t that it was littered with data that was objectively untrue. It was not the not the lack of economic analysis, or the failure to explore the greater economic challenge facing Ukraine. It was not, even, the crass and frankly dangerous policy prescriptions. It was that, like so many other journalists I had thought weaker, Owen Matthews was missing the point. Badly, irresponsibly, and idiotically, missing the point. Despite the very clear economic challenges that Russia does face because of the war in Ukraine, its economy will always be better placed to manage the shock of war than Ukraine’s. Every argument to punish Russia more will only embolden Putin to keep fighting. In this war of attrition, Ukraine, and Europe, will run out of money first. And with Trump shutting off the taps of American money, that crunch point will come much sooner.

America Is Already A Large Country. Let’s Not Make It Bigger – Op...	By Patrick Carroll One of the themes that seems to be emerging in the first weeks of Donald Trump’s second term is geography, and specifically cartography. He has already renamed the Gulf of Mexico the Gulf of America, he has floated the idea of Canada becoming the 51st state, and he has also expressed interest in bringing Greenland into the fold. Suffice it to say, a lot of maps will need to be redrawn if he gets his way. This isn’t the first time Americans have set their sights on acquiring new territory. Indeed, American history is littered with expansionist schemes, from westward expansion to the Alaska Purchase and so on. It’s apposite that Trump has also changed the official name of Denali back to Mount McKinley, after another expansionist president. Not everyone is happy with these latest designs, of course. Canadians in particular have mostly balked at the notion of being absorbed by the US. But while the merits and demerits of these proposals can be debated, what’s really interesting about these border conversations is the fact that we’re even having them. Thinking Outside the Box National borders have become deeply ingrained in many parts of the modern world. While some borders do change from time to time, many others—such as the Canada/US border—have been the same for decades and have come to be taken for granted. From a young age we learn that this is just the way the world is, and the standard depiction gets reinforced by the thousands of maps we encounter throughout our lives. But with Trump’s recent moves, people are waking up to the fact that we don’t need to accept the longstanding status quo borders that we’ve inherited. If everyone is on board, we can just change the map if we feel like it. The people who drew the existing lines aren’t in charge anymore; we are, and we have every right to draw different lines if we so choose. The question then arises: What kind of political borders should we want? What’s the ideal size of a country, and, conversely, how many countries should there be? At first blush, it seems clear that there’s a Goldilocks zone for country size. A country that’s too big would likely run into problems because it would force all sorts of diverse and geographically dispersed people groups into the same polity. At the same time, a country that’s too small might miss out on economies of scale. When weighing this idea, it’s important to remember just how wide this spectrum can be. Some of today’s countries are tiny microstates—such as Andorra, Liechtenstein, Monaco, and Vatican City—and yet by all accounts they seem to be doing fine, if not excelling. But while these practical considerations are interesting to ponder, there’s a moral component to this question as well. The Case for Smaller Countries In the view of America’s Founding Fathers, governments have a very specific role, namely, protecting the rights of the people. The whole point of the institution, in their view, is establishing and enforcing this moral principle. So maybe the question we should be asking is not so much 'What size of country is the most practical?' but rather 'What size of country will be the most conducive to the protection of human rights?' On this question, there’s a good case to be made that having a large number of small countries is better than having a small number of large countries. In his 2022 book Breaking Away: The Case for Secession, Radical Decentralization, and Smaller Polities, Ryan McMaken outlines some of the primary benefits of political decentralization. 'The first benefit of decentralization is that smaller states and decentralized states allow residents to make more choices as to what sort of regime they wish to live under in order to better meet their needs and protect their rights,' he writes. When a wide variety of other countries are right next door, relocating to a country that’s a better fit for you is a much more realistic option. Another point McMaken makes is that decentralization tends to limit the power of aggressive states: On the whole, small and decentralized states are less likely to abuse their power, destroy their economies, and disregard basic human rights. Large, centralized states, on the other hand, are more easily able to abuse their residents and deny their rights, leading also to more dysfunctional economies and diminished economic opportunity. While pondering these ideas, some may be concerned that breaking up countries would compromise the unity of a territory or people group, but that doesn’t have to be the case. Countries can come together to form military and economic partnerships, just like they currently do. Decentralization is not about breaking people apart. It’s simply about changing the administrative structure of the world to something that will do a better job of fostering freedom and prosperity. All that to say, now that longstanding borders are suddenly being questioned, this seems like a good time to interrogate the cartographic shibboleths of our age.

Free Markets Promote Peaceful Cooperation And Racial Harmony – Op...	By Wanjiru Njoya In Human Action, Ludwig von Mises highlights the importance of human cooperation as a prerequisite for the division of labor and free exchange. Without this, humanity remains mired in poverty: The 'state of nature' that the reformers and utopians depicted as paradisiac was in fact a state of extreme poverty and distress. 'Poverty,' says Bentham, 'is not the work of the laws, it is the primitive condition of the human race.' Even those at the base of the social pyramid are much better off than they would have been in the absence of social cooperation. They too are benefited by the operation of the market economy and participate in the advantages of civilized society. Mises emphasizes that free exchange does not merely benefit specific groups but benefits everyone in society. He argues that 'everybody is interested in the preservation of the social division of labor, the system that multiplies the productivity of human efforts.' He calls this 'the theorem of the harmony of the rightly understood interests of all members of the market society,' because all members of society benefit from free market exchange. He debunks the theory propagated by Marxists that capitalism is about 'class affiliation' and their claim that economics is about promoting the 'class interests' of the bourgeoisie at the expense of the proletariat. In what are often described as 'Neo-Marxist' theories, class interests are now seen by many people as analogous to race interests, so they depict economics as an attempt to promote the interests of one race at the expense of another. They claim that 'oppressor' races represent a threat to the economic interests of 'oppressed' races. Failing to understand the social and economic benefits of free exchange, they cling to the false notion that economic development is a zero-sum game, in which anyone who gains can only do so at the expense of others who must lose—the fallacy that some are rich because others are poor. This is one of the fundamental errors made by race-hustlers who claim that black people are poor because white people are rich. They view market exchange as just another platform for racial conflict, in which different races compete against each other for a fixed amount of wealth. They promote racial hostility and treat peaceful cooperation with disdain. They wage all types of wars—real and metaphorical—such as the 'war on hate' and the 'war on racism,' which assign blame for social and economic problems along racial lines. For example, an article published by the Economic Policy Institute claims that the economic model of the American South is deliberately racist and aims 'to extract the labor of black and brown Southerners as cheaply as possible.' Although slavery in the United States was abolished in 1865, these economists claim that 'the Southern economic development model ensures that businesses continue to have access to cheap Black labor even after the abolition of slavery.' They are champions of the twisted Orwellian notion that 'war is peace' as they attempt, in vain, to bring about economic progress, not through peaceful cooperation and exchange, but instead through fomenting racial conflict. Yet this racial rhetoric—far from inspiring economic progress—leads only to persistent hostility and resentment, which, in turn, yields more poverty and destitution. Punished with Poverty In their book, Punished with Poverty, Ronald and Donald Kennedy reject such insistence on viewing the economy of the South through the prism of race. The Kennedys point out that after the war of 1861-1865, policies of subjugation and poverty were deliberately pursued to the detriment of the entire South. They argue that this was harmful to all races—and the poorest suffered the most. The view was widespread at the time that subjecting the South to poverty was no more than a people who lost a war should expect. The Kennedys illustrate this with the example of Horace Greeley, who in May 1861 said that: When the rebellious traitors are overwhelmed in the field, and scattered like leaves before an angry wind, it must not be to return to peaceful and contented homes. They must find poverty at their firesides, and see privation in the anxious eyes of mothers and the rags of children. While Greeley’s views, like those of many others, may have evolved as the war unfolded, the view he expressed in 1861 was once again featured during the Reconstruction era, in an article published in 1872 by The New York Times. It is clear that the economic policy of Reconstruction was not designed to rebuild the South, but to 'punish it with poverty' as the Kennedys put it. In a similar vein, Tom DiLorenzo observes that: The main purpose (and effect) of the 1865–1877 'Reconstruction' policies was to centralize and consolidate state power and to establish Republican Party political hegemony. It was not to 'heal the nation’s wounds' or economically revitalize the South. Indeed, Reconstruction created new wounds and economically destroyed the South. Its purpose was to continue the economic plundering of the Southern states for as long as possible, and to establish a national Republican Party political monopoly. Therefore, the Kennedys argue that the economic interests of the South during Reconstruction should not be understood purely by reference to race, but instead ought to be seen as the common interest of the South. They point out that, 'The Northern desire to put Southern children in ‘rags’ was not directed just at white Southerners but it was directed at all Southerners, both white and black.' Contemporary economic challenges, then, cannot be understood as pertaining to specific races. Thus, the Kennedys argue that: …the South’s impoverishment will not be corrected by improving one part (black or white) of the South’s population while leaving the other in poverty… The propagandists for the Federal Empire have done a masterful job in convincing black Southerners that if the white South gains then the black South will lose. This false Yankee narrative began during the War and Reconstruction and continues today. This narrative of the Radical Republicans, which claimed that white Southerners were against economic progress for blacks, was countered by both black and white speakers at an event organized by a black group, the Pole-Bearers’ Association, in July 1875. A speech given at this event by Gideon Pillow emphasized that 'the two races have a common interest in each other and in each others’ welfare…the interests of the white and colored races in the south are inseparably intermingled, and are dependent on each other. What advances the interests of the one advances the interest of the other.' Pillow was echoing the words of Nathan Bedford Forrest who in his address at this event said: 'I have an opportunity of saying what I have always felt—that I am your friend, for my interests are your interests, and your interests are my interests. We were born on the same soil, breathe the same air, and live on the same land. Why, then, can we not live as brothers?' About the author: Dr. Wanjiru Njoya is the Walter E.

The Geopolitical Implications Of Energy Transition – Analysis	Shifting from fossil fuels to renewable energy sources can be considered a major transformation of the twenty-first century and was solemnly adopted due to the increase in efforts made towards combating climate change. This shift also included technological and environmental factors along with considerable changes in a country's politics. W hile countries try to embrace cleaner energy systems with the intent of reducing carbon emissions, the shifting energy systems are transforming the world's power relations, economic interdependencies, and international affairs. This article aims to understand the international relations impact of such energy transitions, focusing on the power shifts, the emergence of new critical mineral markets, the reduced dominance of traditional petrostates, the creation of new forms of international and interregional competition and cooperation, and how such factors will impact international politics and the challenges and opportunities that will emerge from it. The Redistribution of Global Power The power structure worldwide undergoes key transformations due to the continuing energy transition. Throughout history, fossil fuel-abundant nations including Saudi Arabia together with Russia and the United States used their resources to gain significant political influence. Global power centres are starting to realign because the worldwide shift towards renewable energy sources is taking place. Nations that excel in renewable energy cultivation along with exports and technological development including essential minerals sourcing will gain status as future superpowers of the energy sector. China currently leads other nations in renewable energy technology production by being the worldwide front-runner for solar panels wind turbines and batteries. Significant financial support for research and development activities has provided China with decisive advantages in the worldwide energy transformation process. The nation leads worldwide in solar panel production at 70% of total output and has major battery manufacturers CATL and BYD among its manufacturers. The dominant position of China allows the country to control world markets and lead the development of future energy systems. Through the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), China has expanded its political influence by making large investments in renewable energy initiatives for Asia, Africa, and Latin America. The European Union (EU) has established itself as a prominent climate policy leader while working to achieve carbon neutrality targets through green technology innovation. The European Commission launched the European Green Deal in 2019 to transform Europe into the world's first climate-neutral continent by 2050. The initiative aims to invest €1 trillion in renewable power development along with energy efficiency upscales and sustainable infrastructure advancement during the succeeding decade. EU initiative-taking climate policy has given the organization both geographical power and international leadership capacity to establish worldwide benchmarks and steer global climate discussions. The global reduction in fossil fuel dependency has diminished the worldwide influence of Russia and Saudi Arabia since the world shifted toward alternative energy sources. Oil and gas exports account for 40% of the Russian federal budget revenue and these exports have been strained by reduced demand alongside Western economic restrictions (BP, 2023). The Ukrainian invasion fast-tracked European nations to abandon Russian energy supplies thus making Moscow internationally weaker. Saudi Arabia seeks economic diversification through Vision 2030 while its export revenue heavily depends on oil at 85%. The Importance of Critical Minerals Sustainable energy development heavily relies on essential minerals that include lithium, cobalt nickel, and rare earth elements because these elements enable battery production electric vehicle manufacturing and renewable energy infrastructure development. The geopolitical influence of mineral supply chains intensifies because most foreign supply routes are restricted to a few countries thus creating both strategic risks and diplomatic possibilities. China exercises control over 60% of global rare earth element production and it continues to invest in mining activities throughout Latin America and Africa. Advanced technological devices, which include wind turbines and electric vehicles require these rare elements for their production. The extensive Chinese control of this sector provides Beijing with the power to influence worldwide markets and manipulate other countries through economic pressure. In 2010 China suspended its rare earth element exports which disrupted major international supply routes throughout the diplomatic standoff with Japan. The United States alongside its allies have started a synchronized effort to distribute their supply chains by funding domestic mining activities while developing resource partnerships in locations like Australia and Canada. Because of its critical minerals needs the U.S. created the Energy Resource Governance Initiative (ERGI) to support environmentally friendly mining operations and maintain vital mineral supply. The European Union acknowledges critical minerals as strategic assets thus it works on developing local sources while creating stronger international partnerships to reduce dependence on China. The anticipated growth of mineral resource competition could trigger both nationalist policies and international trade conflicts together with military confrontations. The Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) stands out as an essential location because the country produces 70% of global cobalt while becoming a focal point of international rivalry. The battery technology market heavily relies on cobalt because it powers the crucial lithium-ion cells utilized for electric vehicles and renewable energy storage systems. Cobalt mining in the DRC frequently creates environmental damage together with human rights violations that generate substantial ethical and environmental concerns. The resolution of present-day struggles in mining requires international partnerships between nations together with the implementation of environmentally friendly mining guidelines. Other than the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI) which promotes transparency and accountability in mining operations, more steps must be taken to achieve fair distribution of energy transition benefits. The Diminishing Influence of Petro-Dependent Nations The decline of global dependence on fossil fuels creates substantial economic challenges for petrostates because these nations operate through oil and gas exports. The financial success and international influence of Saudi Arabia together with Russia and Venezuela stem from their fossil fuel product exports. Energy transition threatens these oil-exporting countries economically and politically leading to possible social unrest throughout their territories and regional peace destabilization. Russia's federal budget depends on oil and gas exports to the extent of 40% which has led to financial deterioration due to reduced global demand and international sanctions. The Russian invasion of Ukraine has accelerated European nations to shift their energy supply from Russian sources thus strengthening both political and economic independence of Ukraine and weakening Moscow's international position. Russia attempts to reverse its market deterioration by strengthening ties with China and India, but European market retreat continues to affect their economic stability. The Saudi government launched Vision 2030 to reduce oil dependence in its economy through investments in renewable energy projects and growth in the tourism and entertainment industry. These strategic initiatives show unclear results because oil remains responsible for exporting 85% of the kingdom's revenue. Petrostates declining power will make a noticeable impact on worldwide security levels. Depletion of revenue creates obstacles for these countries to support their social systems and maintain political stability thus causing internal conflicts which can lead to population movements across borders. Venezuela became an economic disaster after its citizens lost wealth to falling international oil prices alongside its administrative dysfunction. Under such conditions, Venezuela has become the source of a humanitarian crisis that pushes 6 million of its citizens to leave their homes resulting in increased pressure on Colombia and Brazil. Some petrostates take assertive measures to defend their interests through manipulation of energy prices together with proxy-conflict engagement. The Middle Eastern nation Iran serves as an example by using revenue from oil to fund military groups in the area that raise regional conflict levels. The progress of alternative energy transitions will cause petrostate geopolitical methods to transform into new international security challenges. The Rise of New Alliances and Conflicts Renewable energy development creates new strategic alliances and competitive relations between countries which seek to secure their energy systems. International power relations acknowledge renewable energy collaboration as an essential factor which enables countries to share technology construct infrastructure systems and address climate change challenges. The European Green Deal operated by the European Union attains partnerships with African nations to develop their renewable energy sector while boosting their sustainable development framework. The process of transition is deepening already existing conflicts alongside producing fresh disputes. Knowledge sharing, infrastructure building and climate policy initiatives drive important disputes that emerge from mineral resource competitions. Geopolitical competition is escalating for energy network development such as pipelines and grids. The Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) of China has delivered substantial investment to renewable energy ventures that traverse Asia and Africa while Europe through an approach that worries local nations about debt burdens and Chinese strategic control. Energy transition affects both military strategy development as well as defence organization priorities. Both cyber threats and physical attacks on renewable energy infrastructure are prompting nations to allocate funds for protective measures because renewable energy holds vital importance for national security. Space satellite systems serve as primary monitoring instruments for managing renewable energy installations as countries build space-force capabilities. The Importance of International Institutions The energy transformation process demands robust worldwide organizations to manage its network of complex geopolitical issues. The United Nations (UN) together with the International Energy Agency (IEA) and the World Trade Organization (WTO) require transformation to monitor essential components like resource administration and climate financial assistance along with technological delivery. The priority must concentrate on creating international standards and rules regarding renewable energy technologies along with essential mineral supply chains. The development of clear guidelines that maintain fairness while ensuring transparency stands essential for resource access alongside environmental sustainability and prevention of exploitation. International collaboration plays a vital role in helping developing nations achieve their energy transition by ensuring the worldwide distribution of renewable energy benefits. Conclusion The energy transition serves both environmental protection needs and geopolitical system changes worldwide. The transition has restructured worldwide political structures through new power alliances, it has established complex networks of reliance and exposure, and it generates mixed results from collaborative work and confrontational actions. Countries need to address geopolitical difficulties during their energy transition while finding ways to benefit from existing opportunities. The path towards a smooth energy transition needs global partnership based on multilateral institutions to succeed. Unite national efforts help nations to minimize resource competition risks along with providing support to vulnerable oil-producing states and promoting sustainable development. The energy transition remains a critical challenge of our present time since it will affect global geopolitics throughout the ensuing years.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWdN79tj7OBqjx-Jwg1rdqYt	2025-03-16T17:28:05-07:00	
Europe Needs Trump, Now And In The Future – Anlysis	Europe is staring down the barrel of a stark new harsh truth and reality where the US is no longer a given in the security umbrella of the continent, and all the past ignorance and almost total reliance on Washington for its security needs will now need a total overhaul. Europe and NATO without the US will inevitably spell doom for both, as although they have more than a million troops and modern weaponry at its disposal from the 31 other countries in the alliance, they still lack the final piece of the capacity needed to win a conflict and to deal a decisive blow, or to even have a capable deterrent effect in the first place. With Ukraine now accepting the peace proposal from the US and that the ball is now in the court of Moscow, Europe left even more vulnerable and less influential in the stakes involved, especially the future. During the Cold War, US troops were on the continent as a deterrent to Soviet ambitions, but now, the presence there further fuelled complacency on the parts of Europe,encapsulated in the potential move to reassign American troops from Germany to Hungary. Europe is now seen from the lens of Washington and Trump as increasingly the enemy and disruptor from within, where decades of military support and funding have only been met with more economic and trade imbalances that have further squeezed Washington. For Europe, long buoyed by Washington's easy and entrenched support in a bipartisan basis before Trump came along, it has now increasingly termed Washington as the enemy rather than the trusted ally, from the increasingly fragile security umbrella to the ease of Trump using his cards to expand influence and territories and using the tariff tool to correct pact imbalances, including goals on Greenland and Canada. Europe sees that if Trump can do that to established allies including Canada, then Europe minus the strategic foresight and move by UK's Starmer, will be in the line of fire as well. Some argue that as soon as Europe realises that it can no longer trust and rely on Washington, it will be compelled to fix its own security which will create an even stronger, not weaker Europe. This does not reflect the past and future reality of the continent's security and economic credentials. Poland Prime Minister Donald Tusk argued that Europe as a whole is truly capable of winning any military, financial, or economic confrontation with Russia. Far from it, Europe is left as a sitting duck without the US. Washington has been central to European security WWII, helped to create NATO and deployed hundreds of thousands of soldiers to Europe to challenge Soviet influence. As of July 2024, the US had about 65,000 active-duty soldiers permanently stationed across Europe, along with extensive weaponry, defence systems and other assets vital to NATO, according to the US government's Defense Manpower Data Center. Most of those US troops are in Germany (35,000), Italy (12,000) and the UK (10,000), and with some 10,000 soldiers on rotational deployment in Poland which is a key part of NATO's eastern flank with Russia. While some have argued that the UK, France, Italy and Spain all possess modern aircraft carriers and amphibious ships capable of launching jets as compared to Russia's single antiquated aircraft carrier, they lack the capacity, readiness and volumes of direct deterrence and in sustaining a protracted war that Russia is now accustomed to, even with the various economic pressure in place. NATO's European allies have some 7,000 aircraft, 6,800 tanks, 2,170 military ships and six aircraft carriers, according to the Global Firepower defence index. However, they lack the real life firepower capacity and the precedence of war fighting experience unlike what the Americans and Russians have had. Russia enjoys higher volume and practical experience and an upper hand advantage both in conventional and nuclear capacities. France and Britain both have a combined nuclear warheads of around 500, while the US has around 5000, and Russia has the highest number at approximately 6000. Currently, Russia has at least 1.32 million active-duty soldiers, hundreds of thousands of whom are fighting in Ukraine.Russia also operates dozens of overseas military facilities, most located in former Soviet states. The capability and power gap still persists between the whole of Europe and Washington's armoury that is very much in need. The new wave of arms race and armament has changed the orientation of the region, but Europe still needs Washington support. Zelensky has claimed that around 40% of his country's battlefield needs are being met through domestic production, often in joint ventures with Western defence firms, but remains vulnerable without American support especially in nuclear and high technology missiles. Last year, only 18 NATO allies just spent the target of 2% of GDP in defence. Currently, the EU's member states spend some €325bn ($340bn) a year on defence, which comes to about 1.8% of the bloc's GDP. That is still, three years into the war in Ukraine, less than the 2% target that NATO set its members in 2014 after Russia annexed Crimea and occupied the eastern Donbas region. Even the 3.5% figure leaves a gap of 1.7% of GDP to be filled. What does Europe really lack? It is the basic military technology and capability that make armed forces credible, capable and most importantly, lethal. Europe has outdated and outnumbered ships and missiles. It has ships without the proper missiles, planes without the needed technological capacity including jamming capabilities, and even troops without adequate ammunition. The disparity of Western and Eastern European military capabilities and intra-European power gap are glaring. Lacking the combined holistic military spectrum, including intelligence, space security and satellite capabilities, cyber and digital warfare, missiles, and nuclear first and second strike capacities, Europe cannot afford to defend itself without America. The nature of European arsenals cannot match with the overall nuclear and military umbrella that America provides. The American nuclear umbrella and nuclear forces have protected Europe for decades, serving as the ultimate deterrent. But it has for decades been piggybacking on America's back, banking on the conventional and assured American military and financial support in securing its interests and security needs without the urgent need to bolster these capabilities. The nature of European arsenals cannot match with the overall nuclear and military umbrella that America provides. The American nuclear umbrella and nuclear forces have protected Europe for decades, serving as the ultimate assurance and guarantee against a Russian invasion. This easy ride on security assurances for Europe made it easier for it to focus deeper on its economic and trade needs, and pivoting to Africa and Asia. However, even this is ineffective, with its Global Gateway strategy and the Indo Pacific push all failing to pull Europe out of its stagnation,even in post Brexit recovery. With Trump now reversing decades of free ride, European security suddenly looks in shambles, even without the Ukraine pretext in the first place. This new reality jolted Europe into a new scramble for defence reorientation. EU countries are trying to mobilize trillions of euros for additional defense for this purpose. Germany's chancellor-in-waiting Friedrich Merz announced that the government would amend the constitution to exempt defense and security outlays from fiscal limits, paving the way for a massive increase in defence spending and support, pledging to do 'whatever it takes' to defend the country, including planning a €500 billion infrastructure fund to invest in priorities such as transportation, energy grids and housing over 10 years. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen proposed raising hundreds of billions more to restore Europe's defense capacity. Despite the new historic move by Germany to shake up its defence needs and industry and in taking leadership of Europe's security since its postwar history, it still lacks the capability to unite and project capable European collective security in the way Washington has done. As Trump repeatedly pointed out Europe's own perplexing irony, the EU spent $23 billion on Russian oil and gas in the third year of the war on Ukraine, more than the $19.6 billion in financial aid it offered to the war torn country, resulting in the Kremlin making close to $1 trillion from oil exports since February 2022. Europe has long accustomed itself to the perceived status quo model of democracy and governance that has seen it being mired in its traditional approach to addressing and perceiving threats. Vance argued that a lack of Trump-style 'democracy' in Europe was a bigger security threat to the continent than China or Russia. This Trump approach to reorient the European and Russian policies and models have invited various perceptions and arguments. Some have seen this move as a strategic model to split Russia from China and to get Europe to take care of itself, paving the way for the US to fully focus on the rivalry with Beijing. The argument behind this is that while the West remains fairly important in maintaining the rules based order and democracy, Trump sees the more important need for America to sustain and to be strong again, as only the US has the capacity to stand up to any global threats. His aim is to Make America Great Again, and not Make the West Great Again, where a win for the US is more pervasive and important for the entire Western world. Others have called for Europe to build its own credible nuclear deterrent, with France being called to extend its nuclear protection to Germany and to the rest of Europe. With Germany being the largest and economically most powerful country in Europe, others have called for Berlin to pay the lion's share for this new nuclear umbrella, where with its low debt burden, Berlin would be able to mobilise money. This remains a far-fetched ambition. Although capital and resources might be pooled, the end result in a realistic on-the-ground deterrent remains sketchy and inadequate. Europe's vulnerability to energy security and reliance on external energy sources remain the main sticking points. It remains hard for Europe to ward off this dependency, let alone defend the shipping lanes and pipelines for its energy imports. The calls for Europe to enhance its domestic energy production through the woke and liberal approach of renewable energy sources continue to be a bad strategic mistake, where after the initial bandwagon of reducing fossil fuel energy reliance, most European nations switched back to conventional sources. Germany realised that shutting down its nuclear power plants and pushing clumsy and lousy climate policies that have alienated large parts of the population remained a huge mistake for the wrong scramble to join the madness of the green liberal agenda. While Europe is busy aligning with the green and woke agenda, China and Russia continue to surge ahead with their own relentless strategic pursuits of military advancements without the limitations of green models and policies, powering through their energy, economic and military transformations with common sense utilisations of their strength. Trump wanted the same common sense approach in regaining America's long subdues and hidden strength that has been curtailed by the liberal Democrats that has weakened the country's economic, energy and military potential, further being strangled by both allies and enemies alike in trade and economy and global moral obligations without any returns. Europe's spending to support Ukraine is equally underwhelming. Since January 2022 the EU and its member states have spent €113bn in financial, military and humanitarian help, the equivalent of just above 0.2% of their GDP during each of those three years, according to data from the think tank, Kiel Institute. Europe's imports of weapons made by the United States have skyrocketed in the past five years, raising serious questions about whether the continent can achieve its vaunted goal of defence autonomy. New research released on Monday by the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI), a leading defence and armaments think tank, shows Europe increased its imports of weapons two-and-a-half times over in the past five years compared with the previous five years. Most European Union members did not begin boosting their domestic weapons production until last year. Zelensky went to solicit European support after the Trump standoff, hoping to use the fear of Russia to get the needed European military and funding injection and explain how Ukraine will supposedly serve as the buffer for European security. The new wave of arms race and armament has changed the orientation of the region, but Europe still needs Washington support. Zelensky has claimed that around 40% of his country's battlefield needs are being met through domestic production, often in joint ventures with Western defence firms, but remains sitting ducks without American support especially in nuclear and high technology missiles. The question is, how far will Europe go to spend and defend Ukraine if it does not create the deterrent effect against Russia? It is the fear of the domino effect that has propelled Europe to be jolted out of its slumber, where it has for years been taking advantage of Washington in doing the heavy lifting. If Ukraine does not serve as the buffer and as the frontier in stopping Putin's intent, Europe will have little incentive to commit as much as Washington did. The US and Trump still hold the upper card in dealing with both Europe and Russia, and deservingly so, for the peace of the regions and the world.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWdN79tj7OBqj5ksEsZ2uwv0	2025-03-16T17:24:05-07:00	
African Air Chiefs Focus On Disaster Response	Across the continent, Air Forces are striving to achieve air supremacy, neutralize threats and gather intelligence. They also play a pivotal role in humanitarian and disaster relief efforts. That occasionally overlooked role was the focus of the recent African Air Chiefs Symposium, where more than 240 participants from 38 nations gathered in Lusaka, Zambia, from February 17-21. Citing the ebb and flow of drought and floods in his country, Zambia Air Force Commander Lt. Gen. Oscar Nyoni underscored the importance of bringing together air chiefs from across the continent. 'Air Forces across Africa possess a unique capability to do more than just safeguard our skies,' he said during an online media briefing on February 19. 'With diverse air assets and skilled personnel, we have the potential to provide vital support to nations in distress. 'These things come unannounced, and they can affect anybody at any time. So it is very gratifying that we are hosting this symposium at a time that we have seen the effects of drought, and we know exactly what it means to seek support from other willing nations.' The annual symposium is the keystone event for the Association of African Air Forces (AAAF), which Nyoni chairs. The organization focuses on collaboration in finding African-led air power solutions among its 29 member nations and the United States Air Force. U.S. Air Forces in Europe-Air Forces Africa Commander Gen. James Hecker highlighted the growing role of the association, which has expanded significantly since its creation in 2015. 'From just four countries to 29 member nations, the expansion of the Association of African Air Forces reflects Africa’s increasing capacity to address its challenges collectively,' he said during the online media briefing. While the weeklong event featured workshops, community engagement activities and cultural exchanges, its centerpiece was a tabletop exercise, which sought to improve coordination and readiness for humanitarian assistance and disaster response missions with an emphasis on air mobility and resource-sharing. A tabletop exercise is a discussion-based session where team members meet in an informal setting to discuss their roles during an emergency and their responses to a particular simulated situation. Hecker underscored the importance of planning, noting that critical logistical questions, such as fuel costs, supply arrangements and diplomatic clearances for overflights, must be addressed in advance rather than during a crisis. 'What we’re doing here is the beginning of this tabletop exercise,' Hecker said. 'The culmination will be a live-flight lifeline exercise that will occur in Kenya in November of 2026.' The live-flight exercise aims to enhance coordination, response time and logistical efficiency in disaster-relief scenarios. Since its establishment in 2011, a different member nation of the association has hosted the symposium each year. Nigeria will host in 2026. With the AAAF anthem playing during the closing ceremony, Nyoni passed the association flag to Air Marshal Hassan Bala Abubakar, the Nigerian Air Force chief of staff and the next chairman of the organization. The association chose both the new flag and the new anthem during the session. 'Together we can achieve greatness as one unified continent,' Abubakar said. 'This symposium is more than just a meeting of minds. It is a demonstration of our commitment towards a safe, more secure and prosperous Africa. Our collaboration is a powerful reminder of the importance of finding African solutions to African problems.' Nyoni reflected Zambia’s pride in hosting the symposium, noting that the event is a significant step toward deeper collaboration among African Air Forces. 'The enthusiasm and the contributions that have been brought on board by the chiefs from all over Africa — that’s Southern Africa, East Africa, West Africa, and the North — has been fantastic,' he said. 'And seeing the contributions from them and their desire to contribute towards solving African problems is highly appreciated. And for us in Zambia, being at the center of it, it’s something that I think is very, very encouraging and inspiring.'	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWdN79tj7OBqj1TGikwny1Fi	2025-03-16T17:20:49-07:00	
The US And EU Drumbeat For Central Asia’s Critical Minerals Grows...	(Eurasianet) -- It is not just the Trump administration that is into hard rocks. The European Union is also a big fan of Central Asian metal. In their dealings with Central Asian governments, US and EU officials seem fixated on expanding access to the region’s abundance of 'critical minerals.' Over the past few days, top Trump administration officials have courted Kazakhstan. Energy Secretary Chris Wright raised the topic of rare earths during a March 13 meeting with his Kazakh counterpart, Almassadam Satkaliyev, on the sidelines of an energy conference in Houston. A day earlier, Secretary of State Marco Rubio issued a statement following talks with Kazakh Deputy Prime Minister-Foreign Minister Murat Nurtleu stating that the United States 'looks forward to working with Kazakhstan to deepen economic ties in the energy, telecommunications, and critical minerals sectors.' The growing American interest in critical minerals is matched by the European Union. European Commissioner for International Partnerships Jozef Sikelak, who began a six-day tour of the five Central States on March 12, is also scouting out potential investments in the mining sector. An EU statement noted that critical minerals is one of the four main topics for discussion with Central Asian leaders during Sikelak’s visit, with the EU aiming to promote 'best practices, new jobs and economic resilience.' The other chief aims of the tour are to improve infrastructure in transport, digital connectivity and water, energy & the climate sectors, enabling an expansion of trade between Central Asia and the EU. During a stop in Uzbekistan, Sikelak is scheduled to tour the Almalyk Mining and Metallurgical Complex. Uzbekistan earlier in March announced a $2.6 billion initiative to develop its mineral and mining sector creating a prime opportunity for US and European investment. During his recent visit to France, Uzbek leader Shavkat Mirziyoyev signed a $5 million mineral deal, the state-aligned Gazeta.uz outlet reported March 13. As part of the agreement, France’s Geological Service will 'provide its experience and knowledge for the development of the national geological service in Uzbekistan,' the Gazeta.uz report said. Another project involves 'geological and technical studies of critical minerals.' A lack of supply of rare earths needed to power many of the gadgets deemed indispensable in the 21st century is prompting the US and EU to look to Central Asia as a supply source. 'A combination of factors makes Central Asia – particularly resource-endowed Kazakhstan but also Uzbekistan and Tajikistan – the most viable alternative to traditional suppliers [especially China],' according to an analysis published in late 2024 by the Australia-based Lowy Institute. But the United States and EU must play catch-up to gain a significant share in the region’s mining and minerals sector. China long ago established itself as the region’s dominant player. 'China’s own growing internal demand for critical minerals – primarily associated with the rapidly increasing production of microchips and green energy – makes its strategic interest in this sector of Central Asian economies particularly strong,' the Lowy Institute analysis stated. 'In effect, Beijing has already taken the lead, especially in Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan, where it controls almost all the leases of rare-earth mining.' While few opportunities may exist with current mining operations, the US and EU have an opportunity to capture a major share of future projects. 'Central Asian leaders understand that without foreign (financial) capital, know-how and technologies, capitalization on local resource potential is not realistic,' said the Lowy Institute analysis. 'They have also realized that collaborative actions will better enable them to excel in producing [critical minerals], thus securing their place in the global supply chain.'	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWdN79tj7OBqj6Vo9CVLvkA5	2025-03-16T17:14:26-07:00	
The Dangers Of Trump’s Expansionist Foreign Policy: Global Instab...	In recent years, the emergence of aggressive unilateral policies has raised significant concerns within the global community. The foreign policy maneuvers of former President Trump—such as proposals to invade Greenland and Mexico as well as the suggestion to annex Canada as the 51st state—constitute a direct threat to international stability and the established global order. These reckless initiatives undermine international alliances and multilateral cooperation, thereby risking severe diplomatic and economic security repercussions. This essay examines the challenges posed by these policies, analyzes their potential consequences, and underscores the necessity for a more strategic and cooperative approach in 2025. The Importance of International Alliances A cornerstone of contemporary global governance is the network of international alliances that sustain order and maintain a balance of power. Partnerships with NATO, Canada, Mexico, and other traditional allies are essential for security. In 2025, data from the American Institute for Global Policy revealed that 72% of foreign diplomats believe that unpredictable U. S. foreign policies significantly jeopardize global stability. By diverging from established diplomatic protocols, unilateral actions such as invasions proposed and annexations threaten these relationships. In the absence of trust and cooperation, the efficacy of global security initiatives diminishes efforts, complicating the address threats transnational such as terrorism cyberattacks and organized crime. Unilateral Aggression and the Consequences of Expansionism The proposals to invade and Greenland along Mexico with the audacious plan to annex Canada exemplify a broader trend towards unilateral aggression. Historically, international law and norms have condemned acts of expansionism and violations of national sovereignty. In 2025 expert in international relations cautioned that any military intervention conducted without multilateral consent could establish a perilous precedent. • Invasion of Greenland: This would challenge the territorial integrity of a sovereign nation and risk exacerbating tensions in the Arctic, a region already strained by climate change and competing economic interests. • Annexation of Canada: This proposal is both politically and logistically implausible and would elicit widespread backlash from the global community. Canada, a close economic and security ally, would likely pursue alternative partnerships, thereby weakening U. S. influence in North America. • Invasion of Mexico: While cartel violence is a legitimate concern, a unilateral invasion would likely escalate violence and further destabilize the region. Intervention without Mexico’s consent could provoke a humanitarian crisis and undermine standing agreements. Diplomatic Fallout: Downgrades and Severed Ties One immediate consequence of these aggressive policies is the potential for diplomatic downgrades or the complete severing of relationships with key allies. In 2025, reports preliminary indicate that longstanding several diplomatic partners are reevaluating their ties the with United States. • Canada and Mexico: In response to expansionist rhetoric from certain targets, these nations are seeking alternative alliances with global powers, including the European Union and China. • NATO and UN Relations: By disregarding international agreements, the United States risks alienating its NATO allies and undermining its standing within the United Nations. • Economic Consequences: Should allies or downgrade sever ties the United States could encounter economic trade sanctions restrictions and foreign reduced ultimately investment domestic harming industries and employment. The Need for Transparency and Congressional Oversight Foreign policy careful necessitates deliberation and transparency. However, the ambiguity surrounding these aggressive proposals has engendered widespread uncertainty both domestically and internationally. In 2025, lawmakers expressed many concerns regarding the absence of clear strategic objectives. They argue unchecked that executive power in foreign policy could lead to detrimental decisions to international relations and destabilizing for domestic governance. • Strengthening Congressional Oversight: Congress must exercise its authority to obstruct reckless military actions and ensure that foreign policy decisions are aligned with democratic principles and national interests. • Avoiding Policy Flip-Flops: Rapid shifts in foreign policy create instability. A coherent long-term strategy is essential to maintain U.S. credibility on the global stage. Multilateral Diplomacy as a Countermeasure In 2025, diplomatic engagement with international organizations such as the United Nations and the Organization of American States is crucial. These institutions provide a platform for peaceful conflict resolution and uphold global norms. By embracing multilateral diplomacy, the United States can: • Rebuild trust with Allies: A commitment to international cooperation strengthens diplomatic relationships. • Resources Pool for Global Security: Coordinated efforts in sharing intelligence and military joint training can effectively address security threats without unilateral intervention. • Enhance Conflict Resolution Mechanisms: Diplomatic channels should be prioritized over military action to address cross-border issues such as drug trafficking and organized crime. Investing in Soft Power Initiatives Soft power—the capacity to influence through culture diplomacy and economic incentives—serves as a crucial alternative to military intervention. In 2025, the United. State Department reported that several allied nations had augmented support for cultural exchange programs and international aid to aggressive counter foreign policies. Cultural Diplomacy: Strengthening academic and cultural programs exchange can foster goodwill between nations. Economic Aid and Development: Providing economic support to struggling regions can address the root causes of instability rather than resorting to military intervention. Public Diplomacy Campaigns: Utilizing media technology to promote U.S values and interests can enhance global perceptions of America’s role in international affairs. Challenges In Reversing Aggressive Policies Despite the benefits of diplomacy and soft power, significant challenges persist in transitioning away from an aggressive foreign policy approach. • Domestic Political Polarization: The influence of nationalist and isolationist factions within the United States complicates the pursuit of a cooperative foreign policy. • Economic and Political Costs: Reversing course may provoke economic sanctions, trade barriers, and diplomatic backlash. • Rebuilding Credibility: Restoring trust among global allies requires time, particularly following years of unpredictable policy decisions. Conclusion: The Need for a Coherent Foreign Policy Strategy President Trump's aggressive foreign policy proposals, including plans to invade Greenland and Mexico and to annex Canada, pose a significant threat to international stability. As 2025 unfolds, trends observed in global relations underscore the urgent need for a recalibrated U.S strategy that prioritizes multilateral cooperation and legislative oversight. By strengthening international alliances, unilaterally rejecting aggression, and investing in soft power initiatives, the United States can avert the pitfalls of diplomatic isolation and economic fallout. Ultimately, a well-defined foreign policy that respects international law and embraces cooperative problem-solving is essential for safeguarding national interests and promoting long-term prosperity in an increasingly interconnected world.

North Macedonia Nightclub Fire Leaves Dozens Dead	By Sinisa Jakov Marusic At least 59 people have died and 155 have been hospitalised after a fire broke out inside a nightclub in the small eastern town of Kocani in the early hours of Sunday morning, Interior Minister Pance Toskovski told reporters. Toskovski said the use of pyrotechnics for visual effects during a live concert at the club was the likely cause. 'At the moment when the [pyrotechnic] fountains were activated, the sparks most likely hit the ceiling, which is made of flammable material, and in a short time the fire spread throughout the entire discotheque and thick smoke was generated,' he said. Video footage of the fire inside the nightclub published on Sunday morning, showing the ceiling on fire, seemed to corroborate the minister’s account. Earlier, Toskovski said that as part of the investigation into the cause of the fire, the police have already apprehended suspects. Radio Kocani, which was first to break the news, said the fire at the overcrowded Pulse nightclub broke out around 3am. The blaze started during a performance by a well-known North Macedonia hip-hop band called DNK (DNA in English). At least one of the band’s members, musician Vladimir Blazevski, known as Panco, was hospitalised, his sister Jadranka Nikolovksa told the local Sakam da Kazam news website. 'I know for now that his life is not in danger. He has burns on his face and hand and is on oxygen support,' Nikolovska was quoted as saying. In the wake of what is one of the biggest tragedies in the recent history of the country, North Macedonia’s Prime Minister Hristijan Mickoski has cancelled a trip to Montenegro where he was supposed to attend a European People’s Party summit. Mickoski headed for Kocani instead. North Macedonia’s President Gordana Siljanovska-Davkova went to visit one of the hospitals in Skopje where some of the injured have been taken. 'I cannot comprehend how it was possible that this happened,' Siljanovska-Davkova told reporters there. Justice Minister Igor Filkov told a press conference that those responsible must be held accountable. 'This is not just a tragedy. This is an alarm that calls for accountability! There are no words for this pain… but there has to be justice! Something like this must never happen again,' Filkov said. The European Union’s enlargement commissioner, Marta Kos, sent condolences. 'Deeply saddened by the tragic fire in Kocani, North Macedonia, which claimed lives of too many young people,' Kos wrote on X. The town of Kocani is located some 100 kilometres east of the capital, Skopje, and has a population of around 25,000 people.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWdN79tj7OBqj3ax1fFwdiL_	2025-03-16T17:09:24-07:00	
Why Egypt Refuses To Administer Gaza – OpEd	By Dr. Abdellatif El-Menawy Egypt has firmly rejected the proposal made last month by Israeli opposition leader Yair Lapid that suggested Egypt take over the administration of the Gaza Strip for up to 15 years in exchange for the cancellation of its external debt. The Egyptian response was clear and decisive, with the Foreign Ministry stating that such proposals are an 'attempt to circumvent Egypt’s and the Arab world’s firm stance,' emphasizing the need for Israel to withdraw from occupied Palestinian territories and for an independent Palestinian state to be established. This rejection is not just a passing political stance but a continuation of Egypt’s long-standing position on the Palestinian issue. Egypt has consistently opposed any proposals that reinforce the occupation or undermine the Palestinian cause. Previously, it also refused to participate in international forces within Gaza, further demonstrating its firm stance against assuming security or administrative responsibilities in the enclave. The idea of Egypt managing Gaza is not new, as Egypt governed the territory between 1948 and 1967. Initially, Gaza was under the administration of the All-Palestine Government, which was supported by Cairo but lacked effective international recognition. As a result, Egypt later placed Gaza under direct military rule without formally annexing it. During this period, Gaza faced severe economic and humanitarian challenges, worsened by the influx of more than 200,000 Palestinian refugees after the Nakba in 1948. Egypt never had a long-term political plan for governing Gaza; rather, it saw its administration as a temporary responsibility until a comprehensive solution to the Palestinian issue was found. Egyptian rule in Gaza ended after the 1967 war, when Israel occupied the enclave along with the West Bank and Sinai. Since then, Egypt has not played a direct role in Gaza’s administration but has remained a key player in security matters and political mediation. Egypt’s rejection of Lapid’s proposal is rooted in multiple concerns, with national security being the most critical. Cairo fears that assuming control of Gaza would create a significant security burden, particularly given the complex internal dynamics of the enclave and the presence of armed factions outside the control of the Palestinian Authority. If Egypt were to take administrative responsibility, it might find itself in direct confrontation with resistance groups, leading to unwanted conflicts that could destabilize Egypt’s internal security. Additionally, Egypt is wary of Gaza becoming an unstable zone that extremist groups could exploit as a base for attacks on northern Sinai. To avoid such scenarios, Cairo is keen to prevent any situation that would entangle it in a complex security challenge on its eastern border. Egypt also rejects any role that would make it act as a security enforcer for Israel. From Cairo’s perspective, Lapid’s proposal is an attempt to shift responsibility for Gaza onto Egypt, allowing Israel to evade its obligations. Instead of shouldering the costs of reconstruction after the devastation caused by Israeli military operations, Tel Aviv appears to be seeking to offload the burden onto Egypt. This aligns with Egypt’s policy of refusing to serve as an instrument for implementing Israeli strategies that do not contribute to a comprehensive resolution of the Palestinian issue. Cairo understands that any direct involvement in Gaza’s administration could be perceived as serving Israeli interests at the expense of Palestinian rights. Egypt is also deeply concerned that taking over Gaza’s administration could serve as the first step in a larger plan to permanently separate the enclave from the West Bank, effectively dismantling the Palestinian cause. If Gaza is removed from the broader Palestinian equation, it could pave the way for initiatives aimed at resettling Palestinians outside the West Bank — an idea that Egypt has consistently opposed. There is also a strong fear that accepting control over Gaza could lead to a broader plan of relocating Palestinians from the enclave into the Sinai Peninsula. Egypt firmly rejects such a scenario, as it would not only undermine its national sovereignty but also pose a serious threat to its stability. Another key factor in Egypt’s rejection of the proposal is the belief that its economic challenges do not justify compromising its national policies. Despite the economic incentives included in Lapid’s proposal, particularly the offer to cancel Egypt’s debts, Cairo has made it clear that it will not trade its strategic positions for financial relief. Egyptian officials have repeatedly emphasized that, despite the country’s economic difficulties, accepting such an offer could lead to political and security repercussions that far outweigh any temporary economic benefits. Lapid’s proposal was not the first attempt to persuade Egypt to take on Gaza’s administration. In 2023, the US made a similar suggestion of Egypt temporarily overseeing Gaza’s security, but Cairo rejected that as well. Then-CIA Director William Burns discussed the idea with Egyptian President Abdel Fattah El-Sisi, who firmly declined the proposal. Moreover, Egypt has refused to participate in any international forces inside Gaza, believing that such involvement would make it a direct party to a prolonged conflict, leading to unpredictable consequences. Egypt has not merely rejected the idea of governing Gaza but has also proposed alternative solutions that focus on Palestinian self-governance. One such solution is reinstating the PA’s control over Gaza as a step toward Palestinian unity and an end to internal divisions. Additionally, Cairo has suggested forming a nonpartisan Palestinian government to oversee both the West Bank and Gaza — a proposal that Israel has opposed. Egypt has also offered to provide limited security and logistical support, such as border monitoring and training Palestinian security personnel, while firmly refusing any direct administrative role. Egypt’s position on Gaza is clear and strategic: it refuses any direct administrative role within the enclave and opposes any plans that could undermine the Palestinian cause. This stance is evident in its repeated rejection of Israeli and American proposals, despite political pressure and economic incentives. From Cairo’s perspective, the solution to Gaza’s crisis does not lie in Egyptian administration but in a comprehensive settlement that includes ending Israel’s occupation, restoring PA control over Gaza and ensuring the Palestinian people’s right to establish an independent state. Egypt remains committed to its role as a mediator, but it refuses to become a direct party to a crisis that it believes should not be its responsibility. Dr. Abdellatif El-Menawy has covered conflicts worldwide. X: @ALMenawy	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWdN79tj7OBqj7ntg0J9u_75	2025-03-16T17:06:31-07:00	
Czech Minister Urges EU Response In Wake Of Trump Cuts To Radio F...	By Aneta Zachová and Charles Szumski (EurActiv) -- Czech Foreign Minister Jan Lipavský said he plans to raise the issue of Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty (RFE/RL) at Monday’s gathering of foreign ministers from across the European Union in Brussels, following moves by US President Donald Trump to yank funding from several media outlets over the weekend. Lipavský argued on Czech TV on Sunday that Europe should launch a broader political discussion given what the broadcaster means for the continent, although he wasn't sure exactly what steps the EU could take. In a post on X, Lipavský wrote that he wanted to explore 'how to at least partially maintain' RFE/RL's broadcasting operations. The Czech minister's comment comes after the Trump administration placed journalists at several US-funded broadcasters – including RFE/RL and Voice of America – on leave on Saturday after it froze their funding. The White House framed it as part of an effort to reduce US federal bureaucracy and a purge of 'radical propaganda'. But in Prague, where RFE/RL has its headquarters, the reaction has been one of alarm. The media outlet played an important historical role in opposing communist rule in Czechoslovakia, and across the Eastern Bloc, before 1989. It is in Europe's interest that such broadcasting continues, Lipavský said, adding that RFE/RL provides crucial support to democratic forces in Eastern European and Asian countries. He also called RFE/RL a 'beacon' for those under totalitarian rule. 'From Belarus to Iran, from Russia to Afghanistan, RFE and Voice of America are among the few free sources for people living without freedom,' he said on X. He also suggested that those outlets are important for countering Kremlin narratives. 'This is a gift to America’s enemies,' warned RFE/RL President Stephen Capus in an articlepublished on Saturday, a sentiment echoed by the international press advocacy group Reporters Without Borders, which condemned the move as a betrayal of America’s historic commitment to press freedom. However, Trump’s allies, including senior US Agency for Global Media adviser Kari Lake, defend the cuts, arguing the agency is a 'giant rot' wasting taxpayer dollars. Lake claimed that projected savings could hit $700 million by 2026. Elon Musk, a key administration figure, cheered the decision on the X social media platform, which he owns. Musk dismissed the US government-backed outlets as 'radical left crazy people talking to themselves'. Centre-right Czech MEP Danuše Nerudová said she also intends to raise the broadcaster’s future within the European Parliament.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWdN79tj7OBqj_FjyohAmdc3	2025-03-16T17:03:31-07:00	
Serbia’s Vucic Says Government Gets ‘The Message’ After Biggest P...	(RFE/RL) -- President Aleksandar Vucic acknowledged the 'enormous negative energy and anger' directed at authorities as the Serbian capital witnessed its biggest public protest in decades. With public ire fueled by allegations that official corruption played a role in a deadly train station accident in November, Vucic tried to position himself as responsive to public demands. 'We will have to change ourselves,' Vucic told a news conference late on March 15. 'All people in the government have to understand the message when this many people gather. We will have to change ourselves,' he said. Authorities had estimated the crowd size at between 88,000 and 107,000. However, the Archive of Public Gatherings, an informal organization, put the number of people participating at between 275,000 and 325,000. The outpouring of crowds was one of the largest Serbia has witnessed in decades. Protesters skirmished with riot police at several locations in Belgrade, throwing fireworks and bottles. Minor incidents were reported around 7 p.m. near Pioneer Park, where students had set up a camp, after which participants announced an end to the protest for the night. A group of people later continued to light torches at the Serbian parliament building as police stood nearby. Most protesters left the area by 11 p.m. The demonstration was the largest in a wave of student-led protests demanding Vucic's government be held accountable for a deadly cement canopy collapse at a railway station in November. Vucic also insisted the majority of citizens do not want a 'color revolution.' That's a term referring to public uprisings in places like Ukraine, Georgia, and Kyrgyzstan that have led to the ouster of governments. The popular protests that paved the way for the ouster of Yugoslav leader Slobodan Milosevic in 2000 are also sometimes classified as a 'color revolution' as well. Earlier in the day on March 15, flag-waving demonstrators gathered at several locations and converged outside the parliament, in what appeared to be one of the country's biggest protests in decades. 'Look how many of us there are,' one student told protesters. 'Let your voice wake up Serbia.' Participants had streamed into the capital from across the country on foot, bicycles, and motorcycles ahead of the demonstration. Supporters and fellow protesters, including students from Belgrade, laid out a red carpet and cheered as people entered the city center. Vucic also said 56 people were injured during the protest but none with life-threatening injuries. He said 22 protesters had been arrested for crimes against property and for assaulting police officers and other people. The number could not immediately be confirmed. The November 1 collapse of the cement canopy at the railway station in the northern town of Novi Sad has led to what may be the biggest challenge yet to Vucic's political power. Fifteen people were killed in that incident. Student protests over the accident have evolved into a broader movement opposing what demonstrators say is the crumbling rule of law and systemic corruption under Vucic, the president since 2017 and prime minister for three years before that. Student protesters have been demonstrating and blocking their university departments for over three months. Tens of thousands of people have taken to the streets to demonstrate in over 200 cities and towns. Ljiljana Kovacevic, a teacher from the northern town of Vrbas, told RFE/RL that she came to Belgrade to support the students, her former pupils. 'We hope everything will go smoothly and the students will achieve their goals -- along with us,' she said. The parliament speaker announced a day before the protest that the parliament building would remain closed until March 17 for security reasons. Government officials accused the protest organizers of planning violence and announced arrests. Students denied the authorities' claims and called for a peaceful gathering.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWdN79tj7OBqj4gSnOpXlRK5	2025-03-16T16:59:59-07:00	
The End Of Transatlanticism – OpEd	There is growing evidence that the United States' relationship with Europe will never be the same under Donald Trump presidency. In light of two key developments, it seems that the American Century in Europe has truly come to an end. First, there was the 90-minute phone call between Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin on February 12, during which the two leaders agreed to immediately begin negotiations to end the war in Ukraine—without the presence of Ukraine or Europe. Meanwhile, U.S. Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth made his first foreign trip to Brussels to remind European allies that from now on, the responsibility for Europe's defense lies with European nations, not the United States. Hegseth’s bluntness in front of European counterparts—who are used to more diplomatic language—was truly shocking. He reiterated Trump's demand that NATO members allocate at least 5% of their GDP to defense spending, despite knowing that many European countries oppose this. He also made it clear that the top priority of Trump's second administration in foreign policy would be dealing with China and securing America's borders—not Ukraine or Europe. He further warned that the U.S. would no longer tolerate an unbalanced relationship—essentially the current transatlantic system—that encourages dependency. Following Hegseth’s remarks, U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio stated in a recent interview that the United States should not be the primary guarantor of security in Europe but rather a supporting actor in achieving it. He also criticized major European powers, saying: 'When you ask them why they can’t spend more on national security, they respond that doing so would require cuts to welfare programs, unemployment benefits, and early retirement at age 59. That’s the choice they have made, but we are subsidizing it.' This unconventional and deconstructive stance on transatlantic relations stems from the fact that both American presidents and their European counterparts have failed to adapt transatlantic relations to the realities of the 21st century. As a result, the transatlantic alliance now finds itself extremely vulnerable to a U.S. president who, more than any other, has pursued policies in a nationalist and deal-oriented manner. Trump’s treatment of European allies reflects his disregard for the central pillar of U.S. grand strategy since World War II—trans-Atlanticism. Trump’s agenda is not about European security. He believes the United States should no longer bear the cost of securing Europe. Without a doubt, the first major test of this new reality in U.S.-Europe relations will be Ukraine. Peace negotiations to end the war in Ukraine began immediately after Trump's direct call with Putin. However, these talks are currently taking place in Saudi Arabia between the U.S. and Russia, with no Ukrainian representatives present. According to Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, European leaders have also been completely excluded from the negotiations. As a result, not only President Zelensky but all of Europe has been sidelined from this U.S.-led deal. The absence of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky—who was at the center of U.S. efforts on Ukraine during Biden’s presidency—and his European allies from the talks is an alarming sign for them. It has raised concerns that a 'dirty deal' is being brokered to end the war entirely in Moscow's favor, at the expense of Kyiv and Europe. In response, Zelensky has stated that he will not recognize any agreement in which Ukraine is not included in the negotiations. European leaders, after holding an emergency meeting in Paris, have also insisted that any peace talks must include both Kyiv and European nations. Given the bleak outlook Hegseth painted during his Brussels visit regarding Ukraine’s future, Kyiv and Europe’s reaction seems justified. In reality, he was laying out Washington’s initial stance before entering negotiations: Ukraine cannot return to its pre-2014 borders before the annexation of Crimea, Ukraine cannot join NATO, U.S. forces will play no role in any security force guaranteeing a potential peace deal, and any peacekeeping force that is formed will not fall under NATO’s mutual defense clause—meaning the U.S. will not support peacekeepers in case of conflict. Trump and other U.S. officials argue that they are taking a 'realistic' approach to the Ukraine war and that European leaders must accept this new reality—one shaped by Russia's military power. Despite violating fundamental international laws, this situation, they argue, is irreversible. The truth is that Trump is leveraging Ukraine’s and Europe’s concerns as a bargaining chip to extract concessions from his longtime friend, Putin. However, he must consider that rewarding Russia with a favorable deal could set a dangerous precedent. Under these circumstances, Ukraine’s hopes of reclaiming its lost territories seem increasingly distant. There is a strong possibility that negotiations will lead to an outcome similar to the division of Germany after World War II—one part of Ukraine under Moscow's control, and the other, an independent Ukraine, potentially joining the European Union, much like West Germany once did. But beyond Ukraine's lost lands and aspirations, something else has also vanished: the familiar and long-standing trans-Atlanticism that has defined U.S.-Europe relations for over eight decades.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWdN79tj7OBqj0jsVgkX2oon	2025-03-16T16:56:52-07:00	
Trump And The Return to Economic Colonialism: Coercive Diplomacy ...	U.S. President Donald Trump, continuing his strong-arm tactics toward Europe and making territorial claims over the continent, has now set his sights on economically subjugating an independent European country. His demands for a share of Ukraine’s natural resources, along with his close ally Elon Musk’s use of coercive diplomacy and blackmail, signal that Trump's America is willing to sacrifice any principle and revive old patterns of exploitation to maintain its dominance in what is now a new era of great power competition. As the war in Ukraine rages on, leaving the country heavily reliant on military and financial aid from its Western allies—especially the U.S.—Washington has reportedly proposed an agreement to Kyiv that resembles extortion. The Trump administration has demanded that Ukraine hand over half of its revenue from natural resources, including oil, gas, minerals, and port infrastructure, in exchange for continued support. Moreover, the U.S. wants a 66% stake in resources from territories currently under Russian occupation if they are liberated. Meanwhile, Trump refuses to offer any concrete security guarantees to Ukraine or bolster its conventional deterrence against Russia. The pressure doesn’t come from Trump alone. Elon Musk, a close ally, has reportedly threatened to cut off Ukraine’s access to Starlink services if Kyiv refuses to comply with the deal. This would cripple Ukraine’s critical military communications and disrupt essential civilian services, including businesses, hospitals, and humanitarian aid, putting the country under even greater strain. Ukraine’s natural resources hold immense strategic value. The country possesses vast mineral reserves vital for advanced technologies, including electric vehicles and wind turbines, and are critical to national security for major powers. For example, Ukraine has some of the world’s largest deposits of graphite and lithium, essential for lithium-ion batteries, electronics, and stealth fighter jets. Additionally, rare earth elements and strategic metals like neodymium and gallium—crucial for defense industries and green energy—are abundant in Ukraine. With China dominating global supply chains for these materials, Western nations view Ukraine’s reserves as essential to countering Beijing’s economic influence. Trump’s worldview revolves around great power competition, where the U.S. must use any means necessary to maintain its global dominance. In this perspective, sanctions, threats, extortion, military intervention, and even colonial-style resource exploitation are all seen as legitimate tools for securing America’s superiority. His interest in Ukraine’s mineral and energy wealth aligns with this broader strategy, particularly in countering China. Similarly, his previous interest in acquiring Greenland can be understood in this context, as its strategic location and resources would bolster U.S. power against both China and Russia. The world is experiencing a resurgence of great power rivalry and neo-colonialism, but with one crucial difference: Europe is no longer a dominant force or a colonial power—it is now a target. Historically, Europe played a central role in shaping global policies and resource distribution. However, it is now caught in the crossfire of ruthless geopolitical competition from the U.S., China, and other rising powers. As America pursues aggressive bargaining, sanctions, and military threats to strengthen its position, Europe finds itself no longer leading the game but struggling to navigate its growing vulnerabilities in an increasingly brutal global contest.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWdN79tj7OBqj1Y9CNcoXfpQ	2025-03-16T16:52:25-07:00	
Trump’s Second Presidency: The Fall Or Reconstruction Of American...	Donald Trump's second presidency has not only introduced new challenges to U.S. domestic policies but has also posed serious threats to democratic institutions and the U.S. Constitution. These threats have the potential to dismantle the very foundations laid by the Founding Fathers in the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution, which were designed to ensure a balance of power. During Trump's second term, the U.S. has witnessed dramatic developments and even crises in both domestic and foreign policy. While his first presidency was marked by controversial and polarizing policies, his second term has escalated concerns with executive orders that challenge legal and democratic institutions. These orders have not only put the Constitution at risk but have also undermined the fundamental principles of American democracy, which emphasize the separation of powers and checks and balances. The Trump administration has issued multiple executive orders that not only contradict the core principles of the U.S. Constitution but also set a dangerous precedent for the executive branch’s authority. These orders have largely targeted areas such as immigration, human rights, and international agreements. For example, Trump’s immigration policies, particularly restrictions on refugee admissions and migration, have starkly contradicted constitutional provisions that emphasize individual freedoms and human rights. One of the most controversial executive orders was the travel ban on several Muslim-majority countries, which sparked widespread protests both domestically and internationally. This order not only violated human rights principles and religious freedoms but also directly conflicted with constitutional guarantees regarding equal protection and non-discrimination. Democratic institutions in the U.S., which rely on the balance of power, face significant threats. A key principle of the Constitution is the separation of powers, designed to prevent excessive concentration of authority in any single branch. However, Trump’s reliance on executive orders, especially without consulting Congress or the judiciary, has disrupted this balance and created deep divisions within democratic governance. For example, the Brookings Institution has warned of the potential harm to U.S. democracy under Trump’s leadership. Analysts have expressed concerns about the erosion of the separation of powers and the undermining of constitutional governance due to Trump's authoritarian tendencies. Similarly, the Minda de Gunzburg Center for European Studies has highlighted how Trump’s policies weaken democratic institutions, impact elections, and threaten voting rights. One of the most significant consequences of Trump's presidency has been his influence over the judiciary. Both during his first and second terms, he has aggressively sought to appoint judges to federal courts who align with his ideological and political views. These appointments—often made with minimal oversight—have had lasting impacts on judicial proceedings and legal interpretations. This shift in judicial and executive appointments, particularly within the U.S. Supreme Court, is placing democratic institutions under immense strain and gradually eroding the judiciary's independence. In American society, the crises triggered by Trump’s policies continue to intensify. One of the most pressing issues is the deepening social divisions fueled by his racist, anti-immigrant, and economic policies. Decisions such as withdrawing from the Paris Agreement, reducing public welfare programs, and implementing extreme economic policies have not only widened social disparities but also posed serious threats to national and social security. According to the Council on Foreign Relations (CFR), Trump has repeatedly clashed with U.S. democratic institutions. He has shown little regard for the judiciary, bureaucratic agencies, or Congress’s ability to check his power. This approach reached its peak when he refused to accept the results of the 2020 election and incited his supporters to storm the U.S. Capitol on January 6, 2021. His actions have drawn comparisons to populist leaders in Hungary and Poland who have systematically challenged democratic systems. Ultimately, Trump's executive orders and policies may lead to further constitutional and democratic crises in the future. While he has been successful in pushing many of his orders through in the short term, in the long run, this trend risks undermining the very foundations of American democracy and destabilizing the nation. If Trump continues to govern through executive orders while refusing to cooperate with Congress and the judiciary, American democracy may face even greater instability. Only if he moves toward greater collaboration with various government institutions and allows for proper oversight in decision-making can there be hope for a more stable and democratic future. Trump’s approach to governance—centered on personalizing power and weakening traditional democratic institutions—could ultimately erode the U.S. Constitution. By using executive orders as a tool to bypass legislative processes, he has effectively elevated the executive branch above the other branches of government. This strategy, which deepens the rift between the judiciary and legislative bodies such as Congress and the Senate, will further reduce their ability to function effectively. In such a scenario, the principle of separation of powers—one of the fundamental pillars of the American Constitution—will be sidelined, and the system of checks and balances will give way to authoritarianism. The long-term consequences of this approach include reduced political legitimacy, governance crises, and ultimately, the erosion of civil society. A society once built on participation, public trust, and independent institutions now faces the risk of internal collapse.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWdN79tj7OBqj0I_fWHgC03e	2025-03-16T16:50:25-07:00	
US To Expel South Africa Ambassador As Relations Deteriorate	U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio announced Friday that South Africa's ambassador to Washington had been declared persona non grata, signaling worsening relations between the two countries. In a post on X, Rubio said South Africa's ambassador to the U.S., Ebrahim Rasool, was 'no longer welcome in our great country.' Ebrahim Rasool is a race-baiting politician who hates America and hates @POTUS [President of the United States].' There has been no immediate response from South Africa's embassy in Washington. Rubio's move came amid tense relations between the U.S. and South Africa. President Donald Trump recently signed an executive order suspending aid to South Africa over a controversial land expropriation act that Trump said would lead to the takeover of white-owned farms. Trump also said that South African farmers were welcome to settle in the United States. South Africa's President Cyril Ramaphosa, in a post on X, defended his government's measure. 'We are guided by the Constitution, which places a responsibility on the state to take measures to redress the effects of past racial discrimination,' he said. 'We have expressed concern about the mischaracterisation of the situation in South Africa and certain of our laws and our foreign policy positions,' Ramaphosa said after Trump signed the executive order in early February.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWdN79tj7OBqj0-bWcJSA7qf	2025-03-16T16:48:14-07:00	
Africa’s Unique Gut Microbiome Could Guide New Medicines	More than 40,000 previously unknown gut microbes in African populations could completely change how medicines work for millions of people, according to scientists. Research led by the Sydney Brenner Institute for Molecular Bioscience (SBIMB) at the University of the Witwatersrand, South Africa, addressed the gap in microbiome studies, which have largely overlooked African populations. 'The long-term goal is to be able to translate a lot of this into real life,' explains Ovokeraye Oduaran, one of the researchers. 'We want to make sure that when medicines are made, as many people as possible are counted.' Why this matters For years, most medicines have been developed based on research from high-income countries. But the gut bacteria – the tiny organisms living in the digestive systems – help process these medicines, and African populations have completely different gut bacteria to people in Europe or America. This means many drugs might not work the same way for African patients. The researchers say their findings, published in the journal Nature could help create better treatments specifically designed for African populations.'These findings represent a watershed moment for the African human microbiome by highlighting the scale of novel biodiversity that still exists within African microbiomes.'Jerolen Naidoo, senior researcher in bioengineering and integrative genomics, Council of Scientific and Industrial Research 'That’s how important these studies are and it gives you that power to be able to make that decision,' says Luicer Ingasia Olubayo, a Sydney Brenner Charitable Trust postdoctoral fellow at SBIMB, who also worked on the study. She says doctors might need to prescribe different medication or add probiotics when treating African patients. Surprise discoveries The team from the Sydney Brenner Institute found more than 1,000 new bacteria species and over 40,000 new viruses living in the gut microbiomes of African people. 'We found a lot of novelties,' says Olubayo. 'Certain bacteria that were rare on other continents were plentiful in Africa.' The researchers collected stool samples from about 1,800 women across Kenya, Ghana, Burkina Faso, and South Africa. These samples were analysed using genetic sequencing technology to identify the different microorganisms present. New hope for HIV treatment One of the most exciting discoveries was finding unique gut bacteria patterns in people with HIV, say the researchers. 'Had we not done this study, we would not have found this unique microbial signature linked to HIV infection,' says Olubayo, explaining that the bacteria patterns they found were completely different from those seen in HIV patients in wealthier countries. This discovery could lead to better ways to detect, monitor, and treat HIV in African populations. The study was the largest ever to investigate the microbiomes of women living with HIV and understanding this disease requires regional-specific research. City vs. rural life The researchers found that people living in rural areas had richer, more diverse gut bacteria than city dwellers. They also found that urban participants often lacked a bacteria called Treponema, probably because they eat less fibre and use more antibiotics. Charissa Naidoo, co-director of the African Microbiome Institute, warns that beneficial gut bacteria are disappearing as more Africans adopt urban lifestyles and use more antibiotics. 'Urgent action, such as through nutritional intervention, is needed to preserve gut microbiome diversity in the era of antibiotic overuse,' she cautions. This loss of diversity could have long-term health consequences, potentially contributing to increases in allergies, autoimmune disorders, and metabolic diseases like diabetes. However, the story isn’t as simple as 'rural versus urban'. The team found that gut bacteria varied significantly even between different cities like those in Kenya versus South Africa. 'We questioned the rural-urban dichotomy that is usually used by other researchers,' explains Olubayo. 'Instead, there was fluidity and transition between these populations.' This suggests that local diets, environmental factors, and cultural practices all play important roles in shaping our gut microbiome. Filling in the blank spots In 2007, the US National Institutes of Health launched a major global project called the Human Microbiome Project, to improve understanding of the microbiota involved in human health and disease. However, most studies in this area have largely focused on high-income populations, with low- and middle-income countries severely underrepresented. 'If you look at the map of the world and plot how many population-based studies have been done, Africa is ending up to be blank, so we’re happy that we are able to paint the African map as well,' says Olubayo. The researchers say they are expanding their work to study connections between gut bacteria and other health issues like sleep problems, menopause, and brain diseases. Naidoo, of the African Microbiome Institute, suggests future research should also focus on tuberculosis, given its widespread impact in South Africa and neighbouring countries. Jerolen Naidoo, senior researcher in bioengineering and integrative genomics at the Council of Scientific and Industrial Research, says this work is the first large-scale study of its kind, led by and focusing on Africans. 'These findings represent a watershed moment for the African human microbiome by highlighting the scale of novel biodiversity that still exists within African microbiomes,' he says. More equitable representation of this diversity is needed within global resources and reference databases, he adds.

Iran And Russia Pursue Multipolar World Order – Analysis	On January 17, the leaders of Iran and Russia signed a new comprehensive strategic partnership agreement in Moscow, replacing a previous pact from 2001 that has been renewed several times (Al Jazeera, January 17). Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine and deteriorating Russia-West relations have transformed Moscow-Tehran ties. Historically, Russia was cautious about sharing sensitive technology with Iran to avoid Western backlash. Russia’s war against Ukraine, however, has pushed Moscow to further pivot toward Asia, with Iran playing a key role in this realignment. Even if the war against Ukraine ends, Russia’s alignment with Iran is likely to continue. As both states face Western sanctions, Moscow increasingly views Tehran as a vital partner, especially for access to the Indian Ocean and East Africa (see EDM, January 11, 2024). Iran, anticipating maximum pressure from Washington, is also keen to expand military and political cooperation with Russia (The White House, February 4). The official details of the new agreement essentially cover all areas of cooperation, including culture, politics, infrastructure development, and even sanitation (IranGov, January 17). Russia and Iran argue that the two will continue promoting a just and multipolar world. This means cooperation within and expansion of such platforms as BRICS+ and the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (see EDM, November 4, 2024). [1] Another area of cooperation is the development of a new payment system to facilitate the reduction of dependence on the U.S. dollar (see EDM, January 11, 2024). There are also intentions to expand the International North-South Transport Corridor (INSTC), which runs from Russian ports to Iran and its southern seashore and aims to link Russia with the Middle East, India, and even Africa’s eastern coasts (see EDM, June 7, 2023). Unsurprisingly, military and strategic ties are prevalent throughout the treaty, including strengthening bilateral cooperation. This likely refers to the continued supply of Iranian drones and potentially other technologies such as short-range ballistic missiles to Russia (see EDM, March 6, June 20, 2023, September 18, 2024). The document mentions the South Caucasus and the Caspian Sea, and how Russia and Iran will strive to 'facilitate bolstering of peace and security' in these areas (IranGov, January 17). In both regions, Moscow and Tehran have traditionally shared a specific approach based on the concept of 'regionalism,' which seeks to limit the presence of non-regional actors such as the United States and the European Union. Tehran and Moscow likewise support the 3+3 initiative which includes Russia, Iran, Türkiye, and the three South Caucasus states (despite Georgia so far declining participation due to Russia’s continuous occupation of 20 percent of its territory) (see EDM, March 12). Beyond these points, the treaty also reveals the limits of the Russo-Iranian partnership. Despite expanding cooperation, Moscow and Tehran have not included stipulations on forming a formal alliance, nor pledges on mutual defense in case one of the countries is attacked by a third party. Conversely, for example, the treaty between Russia and North Korea signed in 2024 does have a special mutual defense clause, effectively elevating Moscow-Pyongyang relations to an alliance (Al Jazeera, November 12, 2024). This difference highlights Tehran and Moscow’s need to maintain flexibility in their partnership in such a way that evades formal alliance. Moreover, beyond the lack of a specific mutual defense clause, a series of issues remain contentious and limit the level of cooperation between Moscow and Tehran. Tensions persist, particularly over delays in arms trade as Iran still awaits delivery of Russian Su-35 fighter jets, possibly due to Moscow’s balancing act with Middle Eastern powers such as Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates (Al-Monitor, January 27). Additionally, there are differences over Russia’s support for Azerbaijan’s ambition to establish the so-called Zangezur corridor, which would run from Azerbaijan proper to its exclave of Nakhchivan and to Türkiye, all via Armenia’s southernmost province of Syunik. Russia is eager to restore Soviet transportation routes, increasing its influence in the region (see EDM, January 25, 2021). While Iran’s calculus is simple, the corridor would deprive Armenia of its physical border with the Islamic Republic (Azatutyun, February 6). Iran would face an uncomfortable reality of Russian and especially Turkish influence along its northern border. The differences have often sparked diplomatic spats between Moscow and Tehran and continue to be problematic (see EDM, September 12, 2024). A wider Middle Eastern angle to Russo-Iranian relations is also underway. Iran has often chastised Russia for the latter’s support of the United Arab Emirates’s claim over the islands in the Persian Gulf. These islands are currently under Tehran’s control, but are contested by Abu Dhabi as under occupation by Iran (Iranintl, December 21, 2023; ARN News Center, September 24, 2023). Moreover, Russia is unlikely to support Iran in any direct conflict with Israel, instead limiting military support to avoid jeopardizing its broader regional interests (Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Russia, December 30, 2024; Izvestiya, March 6). The treaty serves as a comprehensive framework for the two powers to build closer ties and cooperate in ushering what they often refer to as a just and multipolar world order (see EDM, November 10, 2022, October 21, 2024; Tehran Times, August 11, 2024). Bound by shared opposition to the West, Tehran and Moscow appear to have found a balance between expanding cooperation while maintaining strategic flexibility. In short, their relationship remains transactional, with both sides wary of each other’s long-term ambitions from the South Caucasus to the Middle East. The January agreement ultimately demonstrates the awareness that Moscow and Iran maintain in both evading binding commitments that could restrict their maneuverability while seeking to project a unified position toward multipolarity. This article was published at The Jamestown Foundation's Eurasia Daily Monitor Volume: 22 Issue Note: [1] A loose political-economic grouping initially consisting of Brazil, Russia, India, the People’s Republic of China (PRC), and South Africa, which has now expanded to include Iran, Egypt, Ethiopia, and the United Arab Emirates.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWceuc9kPxWWMED2j6aFUYXw	2025-03-15T17:30:43-07:00	
Pakistan Bogged By Growing Ferocity Of Balochistan Insurgency – A...	By Sushant Sareen The insurgency in Balochistan is becoming ominous and has been palpable for a couple of years. But the gravity of the situation in Pakistan's biggest province failed to register in the Byzantine corridors of power in Islamabad. In Pakistan's capital city, the only thing that mattered was controlling and manipulating the state’s institutions to ensure the survival of the hybrid regime controlled by the military junta of General Syed Asim Munir and fronted by Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif. The fires in Balochistan, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Sindh, and Pakistan-occupied Kashmir (POK) received cursory coverage in the media. The public discourse has predominantly revolved around Imran Khan and his trials and tribulations in prison, and the regime’s machinations in countering his narrative, and his popularity. Balochistan was too distant from Islamabad and even Lahore for anyone to bother about what was happening in the restive province. Late last month, after Maulana Fazal-ur Rehman’s speech in the National Assembly where he said that 'five to seven districts in Balochistan were in a position to announce independence' and the 'United Nations (UN) would recognise them the next day,' Pakistani people and beyond started taking notice of the sharply deteriorating security situation in the province. Although Maulana may have gone a bit overboard over the UN recognising a declaration of independence in Balochistan, he has his ears and eyes on the ground in the province and has a very good understanding of how bad things are. Following the Maulana, the Leader of Opposition (LoP) in the National Assembly, Omar Ayub, said that the Pakistani state had virtually ceased to exist in more than half a dozen districts of Balochistan. According to Ayub, the Pakistani flag was not flying in these districts. Nonetheless, it was not only political leaders opposed to the hybrid regime who were flagging the alarming situation in Balochistan. One of the closest advisors of PM Sharif, Rana Sanaullah, warned that armed groups could descend from the mountains and seize control of Balochistan. After initially trying to deny that things were spiraling out of control in the province, the Chief Minister, Sarfraz Bugti, finally admitted the situation was alarming. However, the insurgents could not hold any area for longer than a few hours. That the insurgents could strike at will and seize control of major highways and small towns for even a few hours was hardly something that any responsible administrator could be sanguine about. If anything, the rising frequency of high-profile, high-impact strikes by the Baloch insurgents has completely undermined the authority of the state. Worse, it has fuelled so much uncertainty that it has put paid to ambitious plans to attract foreign investment in infrastructure and mining projects. It was against this backdrop that the Baloch Raaji Aajoi Sangar (BRAS), an umbrella group of four militant insurgent groups namely Baloch Liberation Army (BLA), Balochistan Liberation Front (BLF), Balochistan Republic Guard (BRG) and Sindhudesh Revolutionary Army (SRA) announced the formation of a Baloch National Army with a unified command structure and a shift of focus from 'Scattered operations to an organised, coordinated and decisive force'. BRAS declared its intent to intensify the war against both Pakistan and its main patron, China and bring greater lethality in its guerilla operations. To hit Pakistan and China where it hurts, the BRAS decided to ‘intensify the blockade on all important highways of Balochistan to disrupt the logistical, economic, and military interests of the occupying state.’ Within days of the BRAS announcement of ramping up its operations, the guerillas hit the strategic Coastal Highway and set six gas tankers and police vehicles on fire. There was also a sudden uptick in Improvised Explosive Devices (IEDs) and suicide attacks on Pakistani security forces and Baloch collaborators. The sheer expanse of geography where these attacks took place was particularly notable–a suicide attack in Kalat city, an IED blast in Quetta, another IED in Khuzdar against a pro-regime tribal leader, targeted killings of two clerics in Zehri, the same town that was stormed and occupied for a few hours by nearly a 100 insurgents in January last. According to data compiled by the South Asia Terrorism Portal, in just the first nine weeks of 2025, there have already been 70 incidents, in which around 135 Pakistani security forces personnel have been killed as against 66 insurgents/extremists–a ratio of 2:1 which reflects the enormity of the problem. Some of these insurgent attacks caused serious damage in men and material to the Pakistani security forces. In early February last, insurgents ambushed a van carrying troops, killing 17 Pakistani soldiers in the Kalat district. Two weeks later, in attacks on a Pakistan army checkpoint and a convoy in the Mand area, another 17 Pakistani soldiers were killed. The insurgents also attacked a bus carrying mine workers in Harnai, killing 11. Although the Pakistani media presented this as an extortion racket run by the insurgents, the fact that it was an attack on an economic target–the insurgents call it exploitation of Balochistan’s resources by Punjab–made it a legitimate target in their view. Similarly, the targeting of Punjabi businessmen and settlers the Baloch call them spies and collaborators–is also a part of the strategy of the Baloch fighters against the Pakistani state. Perhaps the most devastating attack was carried out in August 2024 when the Baloch insurgents launched Operation Herof, in which they carried out coordinated attacks across the length and breadth of the province. In 2024 alone, over 900 attacks were carried out by the insurgent groups, the bulk of them by BLA, BLF and under the label of BRAS. Except for the Pashtun-dominated districts of Northern Balochistan, the Baloch insurgents have been active in every district of Balochistan. This is a qualitative change from past insurgencies when the fighting was restricted to a few districts and tribes. Now, it is pan-Balochistan and cutting across tribal, linguistic, and gender divide. While the Baloch insurgents have upped their game, not just in terms of the ferocity, intensity, and organisational capability, the Pakistani state—which is a euphemism for the Pakistan Army—has not been able to evolve to respond effectively. Its playbook is the same decades-old one: increase brutality, offer blandishments to tribal chieftains, bribe influential politicians, browbeat the people, stifle all dissent, keep a very tight leash over the media, install puppets and Quislings to run the province under the garb of democracy. But it is proving counterproductive, and the more the Pakistan Army doubles down on its repressive rule, the more it alienates the Baloch people and swells the ranks of the insurgent groups with recruits, including women and young people from educated middle-class. Finding itself losing the narrative war, the Pakistan Army has responded predictably. It has started raiding universities and abducting Baloch students, keeping them in illegal custody and, in some cases, killing them and dumping their bodies on the roadsides or in the wilds. In just the first few weeks of this calendar year, over 250 students have forcibly disappeared. This enforced disappearances issue has only fuelled disgust and alienation against the Pakistani state, arguably becoming one of the central pillars around which Baloch public opinion has been mobilised. Apart from the brutal repression that has been unleashed, the Pakistan Army is trying to play catch up in the narrative game by using tactics which are now anachronistic. For instance, authorities often parade a ‘surrendered militant’ who recites a predictable narrative – accusing commanders of greed, claiming India funds them, and asserting they work against Baloch interests. The Pakistani media then plays up these stories to amplify them. But no one except perhaps people in Punjab are buying what the Pakistan Army’s disinformation wing is selling. Similarly, exaggerated and often utterly fictitious claims of the Pakistan Army’s operations either to repel an attack or to raid insurgent hideouts are not impressing anyone. In most cases, the Pakistan Army conjures up an imaginary number of insurgents killed just to show that it is fighting back, and hard. The BRAS declaration to restructure its organisation and intensify its operations makes it clear– the insurgents believe the struggle in Balochistan has entered a decisive phase. The political narrative is dominated by young leaders of the Baloch Yakjheti Council, such as the indomitable Mahrang Baloch, Sami Deen Baloch and other members spearheading massive protests across the province. Members of the legislative assembly and the ‘elected’ government in the province have become political pigmies who are in power only because they have been foisted on the people of Balochistan by the Pakistan Army. The political and democratic processes in Balochistan have become redundant because they have been completely compromised and rigged by the Pakistan Army, all of which feeds into the narrative of pro-independence voices. Militarily, the Baloch insurgents have demonstrated their reach, capability and ability to coordinate complex attacks. While there is some skepticism about how much the Baloch can achieve because they constitute less than 5 percent of Pakistan's 250 million population, the insurgents believe that they have the critical mass required to win against the Pakistani state. What they lack in sheer numbers, they make up because of the raging Taliban insurgency in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province and the Pashtun belt of Balochistan, which is bogging down and bleeding the Pakistan Army. Add to this the sharp deterioration in relations between the Taliban regime in Afghanistan and Pakistan. The Taliban appear to be giving space to the Baloch as it gives them a certain leverage over Pakistan, which they suspect of flirting with Islamic State Khorasan (ISK) to undermine the Islamic Emirate. The situation in Sistan-Balochistan province of Iran is also proving conducive for the Baloch insurgents in Pakistan. Faced with the audacity and ferocity of attacks being carried out by the Baloch freedom fighters, and given that Pakistan’s antediluvian approach to tackling the restiveness in the province is not working, there are limited options available to the Pakistan Army. It can continue doing what it has been over the last 25 years since this fifth insurgency has been raging in Balochistan, perhaps intensify what it has been doing. But the result is unlikely to be any different. The Pakistan Army could also decide to carry out a scorched earth steamroller operation in Balochistan. Managing the operation’s political, military and diplomatic consequences could prove disastrous. A third option is to try reconciliation. This is, however, a long and difficult path to take and beyond the intellectual ability of Pakistan's Punjabi military elite because it militates against the colonial control fetish of Pakistan's ruling class. But regardless of what policy Pakistan adopts, the situation in Balochistan will continue to be fraught for the foreseeable future. And while intimations of Balochistan shaking off the ‘shackles of slavery’ (to use the evocative phrase of Imran Khan) might be highly premature and overly optimistic, Balochistan will remain the bone stuck in Pakistan's throat—one it cannot expel, yet one it struggles to swallow.

Egypt’s Gaza Reconstruction Plan – Analysis	By Hirak Jyoti Das On 4 March 2025, the Arab League held an emergency summit in response to United States (US) President Donald Trump’s announcement to 'take over' and 'own' Gaza, under long-term American control and relocating Palestinians elsewhere, particularly Egypt and Jordan. Trump’s plan has fostered collective concern within the Arab world, not just about Palestinians but also to protect their own states from spillover effects. The Arab League members adopted Egypt’s Gaza reconstruction plan which focuses on re-development and rehabilitation without removing the Palestinian population.[1] The plan envisions a green and smart city powered by renewable energy, fostering a sustainable economy with long-term employment in industry, agriculture and technology. Gaza is divided into five key sectors each with distinct functions, i.e., Rafah as a logistics centre; Khan Younis as a science and knowledge centre; Deir Al-Balah hosting Al-salam centre; Gaza city hosting the government headquarters; and a cultural centre in North Gaza. The plan designates six basic zones, i.e., residential zones, commercial and mixed-use spaces, service and development corridors, recreational and tourism zones, central green axis and agricultural and industrial zones.[2] The estimated cost of the five-year Gaza reconstruction plan, set to conclude by 2030, is US$ 53 billion. The six-month early recovery phase (US$ 3 billion) focuses on clearing rubble, building 200,000 temporary housing units, restoring 60,000 homes and implementing social protection and loan programmes. Phase one (two years, US$ 20 billion) will develop infrastructure, essential services and utilities. Phase two (2.5 years, US$ 30 billion) aims to construct 460,000 housing units for 2.75 million people, establish utilities, build industrial zones, fishing and commercial ports, an airport and a 10 km Corniche road. The plan seeks to generate 500,000 jobs across housing (80,000), industry (70,000), tourism (60,000), services (90,000), agriculture (120,000) and fishing (80,000).[3] The sources of financing that could be tapped include the United Nations (UN), financial institutions, donor states, development banks, FDI and private partnerships. A trust fund under international supervision is proposed for transparency and efficient fund allocation. Politically, the plan aims for a two-state solution, ceasefire preservation and governance under a non-partisan technocratic Gaza Administration Committee during a six-month transition period facilitating Palestinian Authority’s (PA) return in Gaza Strip. Egypt and Jordan offered training for Palestinian forces, while a UN Security Council-backed peacekeeping force is suggested for security and state-building.[4] Lacuna in the Proposal The Egyptian plan is perceived as more realistic than Trump’s ‘Riviera in the Middle East’ proposal which could perpetuate significant destabilisation in the region. The Egyptian plan excludes Hamas from governing Gaza and dismisses the relocation option. There are, however, significant gaps in the Egyptian plan’s security and governance provisions and it does not sufficiently address Israel’s strategic concerns. Israel’s Foreign Ministry rejected the Arab League-endorsed proposal arguing that it 'fails to address the realities of the situation following 7 October 2023, remaining rooted in outdated perspectives'. It suggested that Donald Trump’s idea could provide an opportunity for the Palestinians in Gaza 'to have free choice based on their free will'.[5] The statement blamed Arab states for levelling baseless accusations against Israel and rejecting Trump’s initiative. Israel’s swift rejection is a calculated move to block the plan from gaining international acceptance. Israeli commentators have pointed to the lack of condemnation of Hamas’ 7 October 2023 attack and the absence of accountability for their actions in the Egyptian plan.[6] Israel has insisted on adhering to a security-centric approach towards Hamas. In this context, the plan lacks clear mechanism for Hamas’ transition out of power in the long term and does not address the armed group’s military capabilities or durable security arrangements. The plan does not mention disarming Hamas but instead calls for resolving the issue of armed factions through a credible political process by restoring Palestinian rights. Moreover, Israel is unlikely to favour a UN peacekeeping force in Gaza Strip due to its distrust of the UN’s activities and their overall stance on Israeli occupation policy.[7] Israel’s non-acceptance of a PA rule in Gaza poses a serious challenge to the Egyptian plan. Israel has reasons to be concerned about the selection of members for the Palestinian technocratic team, as radical elements could potentially infiltrate in the governing bodies. While technocrats may be responsible for managing day-to-day affairs, Hamas could still maintain de-facto authority by exerting influence behind the scenes.[8] The proposal does not include any provision for elections. During the summit, PA President Mahmoud Abbas expressed his commitment to holding elections in the West Bank, Gaza and occupied East Jerusalem if the circumstances are suitable. However, Abbas’ commitment to elections remains highly doubtful that could in fact weaken Fatah’s hold in West Bank. Besides Israel, divisions among Arab states could hinder the Egyptian plan’s feasibility. While all Arab League members have endorsed the proposal, Gulf States remain cautious about Hamas’ Islamist agenda and links with Iran. Qatar supports Hamas’ inclusion in the political process, whereas, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) insist that the group relinquish power and commit to disarmament.[9] The absence of Saudi Crown Prince Mohamed bin Salman and Emirati President Mohamed bin Zayed in the Cairo summit suggests hesitation to commit to Gaza’s rehabilitation without a clear roadmap for security, peace and political reform.[10] Notably, the Emirati Ambassador to the US, Yousef Al-Otaiba speaking at the World Government Summit in Dubai on 12 February 2025, broke from the broader Arab stance stating that he saw ‘no alternative’ to Trump’s plan and expressed hope for finding common ground with the US policy.[11] The rehabilitation process along with critical financial support from Gulf States could be jeopardised if Hamas continues its militant activities, perpetuating the cycle of violence and increasing the risk of newly built infrastructure being destroyed in future conflicts. In the US, reactions have been mixed. White House National Security Council spokesperson Brian Hughes argued that the Arab Plan did not address the reality that Gaza is currently uninhabitable and residents cannot humanely live in a territory covered in debris and unexploded ordnance. President Trump stands by his vision to rebuild Gaza free from Hamas. We look forward to further talks to bring peace and prosperity to the region.[12] Subsequently, US Special envoy to the Middle East Steve Witkoff called the proposal a 'good faith first step' with 'a lot of compelling features to it'. Hours later, State Department spokesperson Tammy Bruce stated that Trump’s plan was 'an invitation for new ideas, and it seemed to have spurred some new ideas' from the Arab world but characterised the Egyptian proposal as 'inadequate'.[13] The US policy, therefore, intends to push regional allies to propose alternative offers, shape the diplomatic process and keep its options open. In the coming days, how key Arab states such as Saudi Arabia, Qatar, the UAE and Egypt navigate their engagement with the Trump presidency will be critical in influencing Israel to compromise. This could involve accepting a reformed Palestinian Authority, resuming aid, ensuring full implementation of Phases Two and Three of ceasefire deal, and ultimately ending the war.[14] To salvage the plan, securing US backing and leveraging its strategic heft to pressurise Israel will be pertinent. The US, rather than UN, could be assigned a leading role in peacekeeping efforts. The US, even without direct troop deployment, could provide diplomatic leadership, operational and logistical support. The peacekeeping efforts should proceed in parallel with confidence-building measures and international guarantees to prevent Israel from reneging and resuming hostilities. Arab states should also exert pressure on Hamas to ensure full compliance. A joint US–Arab initiative could help relaunch Israel’s peace negotiations with PA and long-term truce with Hamas. A Saudi–Israel normalisation based plan could help secure US’ active involvement and a central role in a renewed Arab plan.[15] While Israel supports Trump’s plan and rejects the Egyptian proposal, Hamas’ refusal to disarm could deepen divisions, making the initiative a non-starter. Hamas has sent mixed signals about its future in Gaza, expressing willingness to discuss demilitarisation as the end goal of the peace process, but rejecting it as a prerequisite for negotiations.[16] Uncertainty remains over whether Hamas will cooperate, disarm and relinquish control. Moreover, Netanyahu’s political compulsions and the growing unpopularity of a two-state solution within Israel could impede any path towards reconciliation. Conclusion Trump’s displacement option carries significant risks creating unpredictable outcomes and potentially leading to the annulment of Egypt and Jordan’s peace treaties with Israel, sabotage the Abraham Accords and normalisation plans with Saudi Arabia. However, Israel’s current government remains unwilling to compromise on PA rule in Gaza, uninterrupted aid supply and complete withdrawal from the Philadelphi corridor. The continued political domination of Hamas in post war Gaza could complicate the rehabilitation process pushed by the Gulf States. While mass displacement is unlikely, Israel may seek territorial concessions that would redraw Gaza’s borders. A security buffer zone running from north to south on the Palestinian side would confine the population within the 365 sq. km area, which spans approximately 40 km in length and 3 to 12 km in width.[17] Given these constraints, the most probable scenario is the return to status quo. This would entail a slow and fragmented rehabilitation process, a stalled reconstruction effort, and continued Palestinian dependence on Israel for aid and essential services. Intermittent rocket attacks and IDF counter strikes would likely persist, reinforcing instability. Additionally, Israel may retain military presence in key areas within Gaza, solidifying control through the buffer zone while avoiding full reoccupation. The prolonged deadlock would deepen humanitarian challenges, delaying any long-term resolution to the conflict.

Thailand: Two Years On Has Anti-Torture Law Reduced Abuse? – Anal...	By Nontarat Phaicharoen After an infamous case where police were filmed torturing a drug suspect who died, a Thai court in 2023 ordered police to implement measures under an anti-torture law, including videotaping interrogations and wearing body cameras during arrests. The police officers entangled in the 2021 case thought they had erased footage from a CCTV camera of their interrogation of suspect Jirapong Tanapat. But an officer leaked it to a lawyers’ group, which circulated it on social media. Former Police Col. Thitisan Utthanaphon – nicknamed 'Jo Ferrari' because he had a personal fleet of fast cars – was the policeman who led the interrogation where officers handcuffed and put plastic bags over Jirapong’s head. On March 7, Thitisan was found dead in his Bangkok prison cell, where he was serving a life sentence over the case. Authorities this week ruled his death a suicide by hanging. But whatever happened with the anti-torture measures that were mandated under the law? Have the measures made a difference? The law has led to the purchase of nearly 50,000 body cameras for law enforcers, authorities said. Since the Prevention and Suppression of Torture and Enforced Disappearance Act was passed in February 2023, the Justice Ministry reports 141 complaints have been filed. That’s a significant reduction. Statistics from the National Human Rights Commission showed that at least 150 cases were reported annually in the years 2017 through 2022. Breaking down the 141 complaints from the past two years, 58 involve torture, 45 involve cruel and inhumane treatment, 17 involve enforced disappearances and 21 involve multiple offenses. Officials said no officers have been prosecuted but several cases are under investigation. 'This law is a crucial tool that will ensure state officials carry out their duties more cautiously, and as we’ve seen, complaints have indeed decreased,' Justice Minister Tawee Sodsong said late last month. During the same month as the law took effect in February 2023, the cabinet approved spending 445 million baht ($13.2 million) to acquire 48,568 body cameras for police officers. These cameras were allocated to crime prevention, patrol and traffic officers along with investigators. Somchai Homlaor, a member of the Committee on Prevention and Suppression of Torture and Enforced Disappearances, noted significant improvements. 'In these two years since implementation, effective measures include body cameras and arrest-report documentation,' he told BenarNews. 'We must acknowledge that complaints about torture and enforced disappearances have significantly decreased. Officials are considerably more cautious.' Despite the apparent success of the cameras, some issues remain. 'The sheer volume of data is enormous and it must be retained until each case is closed, presenting considerable challenges during implementation,' Thanaseth said. How did this happen? The path to enactment of the anti-torture law took over a decade despite attempts by advocates to get it on the books. Thailand ratified the U.N. Convention Against Torture in 2007 and signed the Convention Against Enforced Disappearances in 2012. Yet, efforts to pass the domestic law stalled for years. In 2016, Thailand’s junta-led National Legislative Assembly, whose members were mostly police and military officers, rejected proposed legislation. Following the 2019 election of a new, democratic legislature, PMs eventually passed the bill in 2022, leading to its implementation in early 2023. 'This law primarily addresses state officials’ actions. It directly affects law enforcement officers and their handling of suspects, ensuring accountability for any torture or cruel treatment inflicted physically or mentally,' police Col. Thanaseth Pirom-iam, deputy commander of the Royal Thai Police Education and Quality Assurance Division, told BenarNews. Pornpen Khongkachonkiet, director of the Cross Cultural Foundation, emphasized the significance of the law, which was created with public participation and closely aligns with international standards. 'It can genuinely protect victims, provide remedies and hold state officials accountable for acts of torture,' she told BenarNews. Key provisions prohibit detention in secret or undisclosed locations and unequivocally forbid enforced disappearances under any circumstances, including war, internal security threats or public emergencies. The law covering police, military, immigration and forestry officers mandates comprehensive audiovisual recording from the moment of arrest through interrogation and release. Offenders face severe penalties, including prison terms ranging from 15 years to life and fines between 300,000 and 1 million baht (U.S. $8,875 and $29,600). Still, deaths in custody remain high, although the Justice Ministry attributes most of them to natural causes including illnesses. The ministry statistics show 627 deaths involving prisoners and 52 while in police custody were recorded over the past two years. Are officials finding ways around the law? Even as reports of torture appear to show a decrease, human rights advocates question whether law enforcement tactics may be changing. The Cross Cultural Foundation documented 24 complaints under the anti-torture law, but only one case reached court and 17 remain under investigation. Foundation lawyer Pornpimol Mukkuntod said methods of mistreatment had become more subtle to evade legal detection. 'The law is indeed enforceable, but is every article effectively implemented? Do all officials follow the rules strictly? That’s another matter,' Pornpimol said. 'Torture has significantly reduced, but we’ve received reports of soldiers forcing detainees to strip and stand in the rain, a more subtle form of abuse designed to circumvent the law.' Ruj Chuenban in Bangkok contributed to this report.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWceuc9kPxWWMFgEurx4QEDv	2025-03-15T17:21:07-07:00	
Chinese Blockbuster Holds A Lesson For China’s Soft Power – Analy...	By Wanning Sun The release of Ne Zha 2, an animated feature film about a rebellious boy from Chinese mythology, has been hailed as a DeepSeek moment in China’s film industry. Its success makes the case for market-driven cultural diplomacy rather than government direction. Since its release in cinemas throughout China on 29 January 2025, the film about a god-boy grossed over US$1 billion in China in nine days. This makes Ne Zha 2 the first movie to break US$1 billion in a single market — overtaking Star Wars: The Force Awakens. It is also the first time a film produced outside the Hollywood Studio System has crossed the US$1 billion mark. A few key ingredients may account for the phenomenal box office success of Ne Zha 2. One is certainly its creative energy. The film takes a story from ancient Chinese mythology and turns it into a visual feast that is funny, fast-paced and irreverent. Its release as one of the ‘Chinese New Year Films’ (he sui pian) — a marketing gimmick that can be traced back to the post-war Hong Kong film industry — also contributed to domestic success. Another could be its ability to appeal to the patriotism of domestic audiences by poking light fun at the United States. Above all, like DeepSeek, Ne Zha 2 relied on local talent. The film took five years to make and involved more than 130 Chinese companies. Producer and Director Yang Yu said he initially wanted to engage an overseas animation team to help with the special effects but struggled to win interest. Eventually, China’s Base FX took on the challenge. Ne Zha 2 is a market endeavour, but this does not stop the Chinese government from boasting about it. After all, Party policy thinkers have thought long and hard about how to get mainstream international audiences, especially those in the West, to consume Chinese content. As early as the 1990s, the Chinese government was aware of the undue dominance of Western media in shaping global attitudes towards China. Enamoured of the idea of soft power, Beijing has spent around 6 billion dollars trying to get its state media content to ‘go global’ and compete with Western discourses. The agenda of the ‘go global’ mission was to ‘tell China’s story’ to the world, with its own voice and perspective. Complimentary copies of China’s state media outlet China Daily became widely available in many major cities in the West. Chinese state media organisations also tried to forge collaborations or partnerships with Western media outlets by signing memorandums. But these initiatives have to a large extent backfired, producing widespread suspicion and anxiety about Chinese influence. The rest of the world, especially Western countries, tend to find the content of Chinese media boring, hollow and propagandistic. In turn, the entertainment sector, not primarily tasked with telling China’s story or targeting international audiences, has shown some promising signs of delivering soft power dividends. For instance, the Chinese television dating show If You Are the One took flight in Australia and many other countries. Unlike state news media, entertainment programs like If You Are the One offer a glimpse of Chinese society that is mostly missing from the Western media, thereby offering a much-needed counterbalance — even a healthy antidote — to the China influence narrative. Though not initially tasked with promoting an attractive China, the show presented aspects of contemporary Chinese society that are more convincing, relatable and even endearing to its Western viewers. Like If You Are the One, Ne Zha 2 is a market product that primarily targets Chinese-speaking viewers and has gone global via market mechanisms rather than Party decree. Ne Zha 2 debuted in North America on 14 February 2025 after special screenings on 12 February, and launched in cinemas in Australia, New Zealand, Fiji and Papua New Guinea on 13 February. Additional releases are also planned for other countries including Singapore, Malaysia, Egypt, South Africa, Pakistan, Japan and South Korea. Now six weeks since its initial release, the film has surpassed US$2 billion at the box office. Its grossing figures continue to rise. The phenomenal box-office value of Ne Zha 2 sends a clear message to Disney and its subsidiary Pixar — Chinese audiences may no longer need to be entertained by Hollywood blockbusters. It also puts the heads of other animation studios — including DreamWorks, Warner Bros, and (in Japan) Studio Ghibli — on notice, suggesting that Chinese animations could soon vie to attract a global audience that has so far been almost monopolised by Disney. Most significantly, the Chinese animation industry may soon begin to reverse the Mulan phenomenon — rather than letting the Americans tell a Chinese story, why can’t the Chinese tell a Western story? At the very least, perhaps the Chinese government will get the message this time — keep your hands off and let markets do the job of finding innovative ways of showcasing Chinese culture to the world.

Can Trump Do Anything To Make Putin Accept A Cease-Fire In Ukrain...	By Ray Furlong (RFE/RL) -- While Ukraine has signed up to a US cease-fire plan, Russian President Vladimir Putin has equivocated –- effectively saying 'Yes, but.' Trump has said it would be 'disappointing' if Putin doesn't sign up, but did not want to be drawn on what leverage he may have to push him to agree to the 30-day truce. So, what can he do? There seem to be three options. Sanctions Trump said he could do 'things financially that would be very bad for Russia.' This sounds like a hint of extra sanctions, and Trump also threatened as much in a recent post on his Truth Social network. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Kevin Hackett, head of the National Economic Council, have echoed Trump's comments but not provided any detail of what tougher sanctions would look like. Hackett spoke recently of 'sticks and carrots.' On March 13, the administration took action by not extending a sanctions waiver on selected Russian banks facilitating payments for oil and gas. This makes it harder for other countries to make these purchases. Reestablishing the waiver would be a carrot, and the United States have raised the prospect of sanctions relief if Moscow negotiates. Putin has indicated he wants bigger carrots, such as demilitarizing Ukraine and stopping US weapons supplies to Kyiv. In terms of sticks, Hackett said there was 'a heck of a lot of things' that could be done but did not name any of them. One option that's been discussed would be imposing secondary sanctions on third countries that buy Russian oil above a Western-imposed price cap of $60 a barrel (the current market price is around $70). The biggest customers are China, India, and Turkey (in that order). Another idea might be to reduce the level of the cap, further slashing Russian revenues. This would require coordination with Western allies. Russia has used a 'shadow fleet' of aging oil tankers to circumvent existing sanctions. This could also face tighter sanctions, by adding more vessels to the proscribed list, for example. But it's a game of cat and mouse. Vessels often go through multiple ownership changes involving numerous shell companies. Enforcement requires substantial effort and resources. Another step that's been mooted would be to ban imports of products based on Russian crude oil refined in third countries. Measures such as these would tighten the screw on the Russian economy. But they would not be a quick fix and would be unlikely to have the same rapid effect that Washington's weapons supply freeze appeared to have in pushing Ukraine to agree to the cease-fire plan. Tariffs In other international disputes, Trump's weapon of choice is tariffs, and he could certainly impose them on Russia. But the effect would likely be very limited. Trump's use of sanctions has caused deep concern in other countries, such as China, Canada, and European Union members. But these are all major US trading partners with plenty to lose. Russia, by contrast, hardly sells anything to the United States. 'Russian exports to the US dropped by more than 80% last year, compared to the pre-war period, to about $3bn, the lowest since 1992,' noted Alexander Kolyandr in a recent article for the Center for European Policy Analysis. 'This represents about 10 days-worth of Russian exports to China in 2024.' A non-tariff measure Trump suggested in January was persuading Saudi Arabia to drive down the price of oil by ramping up production. But this would seem unlikely to match Saudi interests. Guns Trump's special envoy to Russia and Ukraine, Keith Kellogg, has laid out a third way that Washington could wave a stick at Russia. In June last year, he unveiled a plan to get both sides to the negotiating table quickly. 'We tell the Ukrainians, 'You've got to come to the table, and if you don't come to the table, support from the United States will dry up,'' he said. 'And you tell Putin…if you don't come to the table, then we'll give Ukrainians everything they need to kill you in the field.' So far, we've seen the first part of this scenario. It was quick and easy to achieve. It was also cheap, since withholding military aid is obviously cheaper to US taxpayers than providing it. There are major questions about the second part, not least that Kellogg himself has not played a prominent role in negotiations so far. Flooding Ukraine with weapons would be an expensive endeavor for a US president who has spoken so often about how the war has already cost Americans too much. It would also represent a dizzying political turnaround. Trump has warned Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy that he is 'gambling with World War III.' Washington may judge that the second part of Kellogg's strategy is just too risky. Ray Furlong is a Senior International Correspondent for RFE/RL.

Remembering The Ides Of March – OpEd	By Lawrence W. Reed In Shakespeare’s Julius Caesar, a fortune teller warns the Roman potentate to 'Beware the Ides of March.' In the calendar of the time, this meant the 15th. Caesar paid little heed, and on March 15, in 44 BC, he was assassinated by senators eager to restore the fading Republic. If I had been in Rome on that date, I might have applauded the deed. Caesar, after all, was no friend of the liberties of the Republic. He was a violent, power-lusting demagogue who bullied the Senate into naming him 'dictator for life' just weeks earlier. I can easily imagine that the threat to Roman liberty justified extreme measures. We now know, however, that Caesar’s death did not produce the outcome its architects intended. Instead of renewing liberty, it provoked civil war and imperial autocracy. The Republic was dead as a doornail, never to rise again. While the most famous Ides of March remains that fateful day in Rome, a March 15 event from American history (in 1783) also deserves attention. The two principal characters—Caesar in the first instance, George Washington in the second—couldn’t have been more different. Both were military figures, but the similarities end there. The former intended to extinguish a republic; the latter fought to establish one. One was ambitious for political power; the other preferred managing a farm in Virginia. Caesar possessed little respect for civilian authority, but Washington defended it at all costs. And while Caesar was an arrogant scoundrel, Washington earned the reverence of his countrymen as a pillar of solid character. What happened on March 15, 1783? Known in history as the high-water mark of the 'Newburgh Conspiracy,' it involved disgruntled officers and soldiers of America’s Continental Army, commanded by General George Washington. Perhaps the best book on the subject is David Head’s A Crisis of Peace: George Washington, the Newburgh Conspiracy, and the Fate of the American Revolution. 'It was a crisis of peace,' the author argues, 'a time when the Revolution still might have failed, and the crisis at Newburgh was an hour of grave danger.' Americans can be grateful that in a moment when character made all the difference, we had a Washington and not a Caesar. Here’s the backdrop: In the popular imagination, the American victory against the British at Yorktown in October 1781 is the end of the conflict with the mother country. In reality, the war would not formally conclude until the Treaty of Paris almost two years later. If peace overtures had broken down at any time in between, hostilities could easily have resumed. So Washington, headquartered in Newburgh, New York, worked to keep the army together and ready in case events turned nasty. It was, to put it mildly, a massive challenge that would have defeated a lesser man. The army seethed with discontent over the bad food and deplorable living conditions it had suffered for years. The men longed to rejoin their families, impoverished in many instances by the absence of a breadwinner. To add insult to injury, compensation for their wartime services was pitiful. David Head writes: As much as they expected money, officers and soldiers alike rarely received any pay at all. As Washington told a complaining Maryland general in spring 1782, 'no pay has been lately given to the Troops of any state.' He could have said the same at virtually any other point in the war. Congress and the states had offered the men little more than pledges to pay something in the future. The paper dollars the Congress printed and sometimes provided the army were near-worthless from the start, as were the slips of paper issued by various states. Imagine setting aside your life, occupation, and family, risking life and limb under harsh conditions for a cause that might not end well—and doing it for free. In May 1778, in lieu of pay, Congress approved pensions of half pay for seven years for officers who served for the duration of the war. That was immensely better than anything the average grunt could expect at that moment. Late in the conflict, Congress changed the promise from seven years to life at Washington’s urging. Anything less, the General feared, would produce mass resignations. Yet he still expected loyalty to the goals of the revolution. When an officer suggested to Washington that the men be given land in the West to establish a country and anoint a king, Washington smacked it down in the strongest possible terms. He wanted no hints of any betrayal of the young country’s republican principles. The problem was not that Congress had the money and simply wouldn’t pay it out. It was on the brink of bankruptcy, the costs of war having drained what little treasury it ever had. In early March 1783, tensions over the pay and pensions situation threatened to boil over. Letters and rumors hinted that some men contemplated a march on Congress in Philadelphia to compel it to pay up. Some politicians hoped, not so secretly, that the threat of insurrection would galvanize the country in favor of stronger central government. Washington was more than a little concerned. He knew, as the National Constitution Center explains, that 'A large-scale mutiny by American soldiers would shatter the public’s confidence in the military, vindicate Great Britain’s skepticism about the American experiment, and tarnish the young nation in the eyes of the world.' The great man ordered an assembly of officers for March 15 and gave the indication that General Horatio Gates would be the speaker. Washington understood the value of a theatrical entrance. Gates had barely opened the meeting when Washington surprised everybody by walking in. Stunned, Gates gave him the floor as Washington gazed upon the faces of his angry men. He produced some paper on which he had written what became known as the 'Newburgh Address,' arguably the most important speech of his military career. In a calm but fervent tone, Washington counseled patience. He recognized what the men had been through, and he asked them not to throw it all away: Let me entreat you, Gentlemen, on your part, not to take any measures, which, viewed in the calm light of reason, will lessen the dignity, and sully the glory you have hitherto maintained—let me request you to rely on the plighted faith of your Country, and place a full confidence in the purity of the intentions of Congress; that, previous to your dissolution as an Army they will cause all your Accts to be fairly liquidated, as directed in their resolutions, which were published to you two days ago—and that they will adopt the most effectual measures in their power, to render ample justice to you, for your faithful and meritorious Services. And then, he did something that brought many men to tears. He appeared to hesitate over some words, reached in his pocket for a pair of glasses almost no one had ever seen him wear before, and said this: Gentlemen, you will permit me to put on my spectacles, for I have not only grown gray but almost blind in the service of my country. In an instant, the turmoil was over. This was a man who had always strived to do his best, who endured hardship at the side of his men, who never lost faith in the cause of liberty or the men who fought on its behalf. Washington loved his men, and they in turn loved him back. As he departed the building, one officer after another reaffirmed their loyalty. There would be no mutiny that day. Peace with Britain arrived in September. Congress eventually hammered out an agreement with the army. It called for five years of full pay instead of the lifetime pension of half pay promised earlier. The men received bonds which, to Congress’s credit, were redeemed at 100 cents on the dollar by the new American government in 1790. In an ancient Roman context, the Ides of March evokes a story of bloodshed and tyranny. In an American context, however, March 15 should be remembered as a remarkable day in which the character of a great man saved a nation. About the author: Lawrence W.

Leftward Drift Of America’s Political Duopoly – OpEd	Trump's social and economic policy is a mixed bag of leftist and rightist tenets. Many still fail to grasp the core ideological principles of his populist approach, left to rely solely on the vague 'Make America Great Again' slogan. Representatives of the Republican Party and conservatives generally assume themselves to be right-wing. Indeed, within the American duopoly political system, Republicans are positioned to the right of Democrats on a relative scale. However, on an absolute scale, both major American political parties today occupy positions on the political left. While this assertion may seem counterintuitive at first glance, this article offers some evidence to support this conclusion. Looking ahead, I will note that the main point of convergence is the fact that both Democrats and Republicans alike rely extensively on omnipotent state to address all societal problems, which essentially positions them in left-wing ideological territory. The Democratic Party is evidently left-wing by design and policy, closely resembling Europe's Social-Democratic parties. Often known as Evolutionary Socialists or Democratic Socialists, Democrats explicitly advocate for increased governmental roles in healthcare, education, wealth redistribution, and extensive regulation of the economy. They believe societal issues are primarily resolved through state intervention rather than individual initiative or free-market solutions. Republicans, traditionally perceived as the party of limited government, have gradually drifted leftward, abandoning core conservative principles over recent decades. In this article, 'conservative' refers to a flavor of conservative philosophy rooted in free-market principles and the maximization of individual freedom, closely aligned with libertarianism. The last genuinely center-right president was Ronald Reagan, who comprehensively understood and articulated the dangers inherent to expansive government power. Reagan famously asserted that the government was not the solution but rather the problem itself. Since his era, Republican leadership has increasingly embraced state intervention in various forms, marking a pronounced departure from authentic conservative tenets. I argue that the current ideological stance of the Republican Party is center-left. What policies are keeping Republicans hooked on the center? Let’s take Trump presidency as an example. One of Trump's most commendable right-wing economic moves involved reducing taxes and advocating for deregulation. Tax reductions typically align with conservative economic thought, intended to foster economic growth by enabling individuals and businesses to retain a larger share of their earnings. Similarly, deregulation reflects conservative acknowledgment that excessive bureaucratic processes impede productivity and stifle innovation. Trump, with firsthand experience as a businessman, vividly illustrated the impediments caused by burdensome regulations, especially in construction and real estate industries. However, Trump's commitment to conservative principles wasn't consistent. A prominent example was his staunch support for eminent domain, the state’s ability to seize private property, allegedly for the public good. Trump's justification was pragmatic: without eminent domain, infrastructural projects like highways couldn't efficiently proceed. Yet, from a libertarian perspective, eminent domain severely undermines the sanctity of private property, a cornerstone principle of genuine individualist philosophy. Any support for such state intrusion places one firmly on the political left. Trump should be praised for his efforts to eliminate wokism, social-engineering and restoring common sense. He courageously challenged the increasingly pervasive ideology of Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) which has permeated educational institutions, corporations, and government agencies. Trump's attempts to curtail this ideology within governmental operations were important, highlighting how collectivist thinking can erode the individual autonomy fundamental to a free society. At the same time, we see that American business tend to sway with the wind—eagerly adopting DEI, only to quietly retreat later when the administration changes. It’s disappointing to see American companies lose their spine, too tied to the state’s shifts. This suggests a society tilting toward a collective mindset. The Trump administration aimed to streamline government, trim its size, and rein in spending—a worthy goal that, if realized, could greatly benefit society. Yet, small government does not simply mean its nominal size—although reducing this is inherently beneficial—but rather its minimal footprint in socio-economic affairs. True conservatism prioritizes limiting governmental power and maximizing individual freedom, resisting state interference in private decisions. Sadly, this doesn’t always seem to top the Republican priorities. Next, let’s consider what precisely constitutes the Republicans' leftward drift? Fundamentally, it revolves around their reliance on government intervention. Despite rhetoric favoring small government, Republican policies frequently employ the state's regulatory and economic power extensively. A striking misstep in Trump's policies is his enthusiastic embrace of tariffs, which, despite his rhetoric, neither shrank the overall trade deficit nor significantly spurred the onshoring of American businesses during his first term. Tariffs are essentially taxes imposed on imported goods, a governmental measure that contradicts conservative economic principles. They increase the cost of goods for consumers and businesses, inadvertently transferring wealth from private entities to government coffers. Republicans traditionally advocate for reduced taxation, yet tariffs effectively increase economic burdens, limiting market freedom and consumer choice. The rationale behind tariffs typically revolves around protecting domestic industries from foreign competition. However, this justification often lacks credibility, as demonstrated by Trump's tariff policy regarding Canada and Mexico. The American automotive industry, for instance, was blindsided by tariffs that Trump imposed without their prior request or even consultation. Instead of benefiting, automakers found themselves pleading for tariff exemptions, fearing significant economic losses. This scenario starkly illustrates how such protectionist measures often backfire, undermining their supposed intent and inflicting unintended economic harm. To grasp why tariffs typically harm the economy, it's essential to understand the principle of competitive advantage in international economics. Competitive advantage occurs when a nation or business produces goods or services more efficiently than others, benefiting from specialization and trade. Trump’s claim that the U.S. doesn't need Canadian lumber neglected this principle entirely. By arbitrarily deciding on behalf of businesses from whom they should buy their resources, Trump engaged in profoundly leftist governmental interference. In a genuine free-market economy, companies—not governments—should choose their suppliers based on efficiency, quality, and cost-effectiveness. Furthermore, autarky—economic self-sufficiency—is inherently leftist, opposing right-wing market-based economics advocating free and open trade. Trump's tariff strategy, whether intentional or not, veered dangerously toward economic isolationism, undermining the core conservative value of free enterprise and open markets. What socio-economic policies would bring Republicans back to right side of the political spectrum? There are critical regulatory policies hampering economic growth that genuine conservative approaches would dismantle. The first and most significant regulation ripe for removal is the mandatory minimum wage, a state-imposed constraint distorting the natural market dynamics of labor supply and demand. True economic freedom involves allowing the market to determine wages organically, optimizing employment and economic efficiency based on real-time conditions and individual merit rather than artificial government mandates. Rent control policies similarly represent another destructive intervention that exacerbates the housing crisis rather than resolving it. Government-imposed rent limits artificially reduce housing supply and quality, discouraging investment and leading to chronic shortages and deteriorating housing conditions. Eliminating rent control would allow market forces to adjust housing availability and affordability naturally, genuinely addressing shortages through incentivized production rather than misguided state-imposed restrictions. Another key regulatory element needing improvement is our tax code. It’s overly complex, burdensome, and riddled with loopholes. Our progressive tax system acts as a wealth redistribution mechanism, placing individuals and businesses in tricky situations, especially near tax bracket thresholds. Progressive taxation subtly and gradually erodes property rights, unfairly penalizing success. Reforming the IRS and adopting a simplified tax code with a modest flat tax would be a better path forward. There’s no need to create yet another government agency, the ERS, to handle tariffs and other external contributions to the treasury. This is definitely not an exhaustive list of policies; rather, it highlights just a few key areas needing attention, leaving room for broader discussion and additional reforms. Ultimately, genuine economic revitalization relies not on expansive government intervention but on policies increasing productivity, innovation, and product quality. True right-wing economic ideology emphasizes minimal state involvement, enabling individuals and businesses maximum freedom to determine their economic destinies. Any deviation from this principle, however well-intentioned, inevitably pushes policy into leftist territory, restricting liberty, stifling economic vitality, and perpetuating state dependency.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWceuc9kPxWWMGeU8fXU02LJ	2025-03-15T17:11:46-07:00	
Kremlin: Reasons To Be Optimistic About Ceasefire Deal	Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Friday that there were reasons for 'cautious optimism' regarding a proposed ceasefire deal between Ukraine and Russia, following talks between a U.S. envoy and Russian President Vladimir Putin in Moscow. Speaking to reporters in a telephone news briefing, Peskov referenced comments from Putin on Thursday in which he expressed qualified support for a U.S. ceasefire proposal to halt Russia's war with Ukraine for 30 days but said some questions needed to be answered. Peskov said that while much remains to be done, Putin 'expressed solidarity with [U.S. President Donald] Trump's position.' He said Putin held late-night talks Thursday with U.S. special envoy Steve Witkoff, during which Putin 'conveyed information and additional signals to President Trump.' The Kremlin spokesman said both sides agreed Putin and Trump should speak, adding that the timing of the conversation would be agreed upon once Witkoff had conveyed the new information to Trump. Trump said in a post on his Truth Social website Friday morning that 'there is a very good chance that this horrible, bloody war can finally come to an end.' He also said he had 'strongly requested' that Putin spare the lives of 'thousands' of Ukrainian troops in Russia's Kursk border region who were 'completely surrounded' by the Russian military. 'This would be a horrible massacre, one not seen since World War II,' Trump wrote on social media. Later Friday, Putin told the National Security Council in Moscow that if the Ukrainian troops laid down their arms and surrendered, they would not be killed. Ukraine's military, however, denied that its forces in Kursk were surrounded by Moscow's troops and said reports to that effect were Russian manipulation. In his nightly address to his nation Thursday, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said that Putin's comments to Witkoff were 'very manipulative,' and that he thought Putin's qualified support for the U.S. plan was an effort to lay the groundwork for rejecting it. 'He is in fact preparing a rejection at present, because Putin is, of course, scared to tell President Trump that he wants to continue this war, that he wants to kill Ukrainians,' Zelenskyy said. He noted Ukraine had accepted the U.S. proposal and was ready to organize monitoring and verification. 'We are not setting conditions that complicate the process; Russia is,' Zelenskyy said. White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said Friday that no discussions between Trump and Putin had been scheduled, but she said that could change. She called the talks in Moscow on Thursday 'a productive day for the United States of America and for the world in terms of peace.' On Thursday at the White House, ahead of talks with NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte, Trump said it would be 'very disappointing' if Russia ended up rejecting U.S. efforts to end the fighting. Meanwhile, Britain's Defense Ministry said Friday that Russia's prioritization of funding its war with Ukraine had likely resulted in insufficient funding for average Russians' health care, leading to shortages of medical staff and equipment. In its Defense Intelligence report, the ministry said Russia reportedly closed at least 160 hospitals in 2024, including 18 maternity facilities and at least 10 children's clinics. The report said Russia's small towns and villages had been particularly affected. The Defense Ministry said the 500,000 casualties Russia has sustained in the war in Ukraine most certainly continue to put a strain on all levels of care in the Russian military medical system.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWceuc9kPxWWME4FTvKrXkyp	2025-03-15T17:10:19-07:00	
We Can’t Fix International Organizations Like The WTO: Abolish Th...	In a recent Springer publication, Marcos Falcone proposed 'Bringing the Austrian School into the 21st century' by embracing existing international institutions as a means of maximizing global liberty. Acknowledging that they are often justly criticized for being bureaucratic and ineffective, Falcone argues that they have historically contributed to economic growth and democratization and that all that is needed are two key reforms to strengthen freedom within the current international order: strict enforcement of the subsidiarity principle (where governance decisions occur at the most local level possible) and the acceptance of secession as a legitimate political process. The article traces the theoretical justification for these reforms through the works of prominent Austrian economists, such as Ludwig von Mises, Friedrich Hayek, and Murray Rothbard. Falcone highlights how subsidiarity, when applied weakly (e.g., the European Union’s version), allows for overreach by centralized authorities and argues that a stricter application would ensure that power remains local, preventing unnecessary bureaucratic growth and inefficiency. Likewise, secession is framed as an extension of self-determination, enabling political communities to align more closely with their preferences. Falcone uses Switzerland and the early United States as models for balancing subsidiarity and secession, arguing that their federal structures successfully limited centralized power while preserving diversity. Ultimately, Falcone argues that enforcing subsidiarity and embracing secession would strengthen rather than weaken international institutions by making them more accountable, flexible, and limited in scope. The reforms would foster competition between governments, improving policies and enhancing freedom. While it should be clear that Falcone is right in citing Rothbard as a champion of secession as essential for individual liberty, he did so because he saw decentralization as a step toward full privatization of governance, not the better working of supranational institutions. A full Rothbardian critique would take issue with several fundamental premises of Falcone’s argument. The Flaws in Falcone’s Premises From a strict anarcho-capitalist and voluntarist perspective, the idea of 'improving' international organizations rather than abolishing them is entirely misguided, as these organizations are inherently coercive, funded through taxation (theft), and serve the interests of political elites rather than individuals. What is desired is advancing true liberty, not advocating for a 'better' form of statism. 1. International Organizations as Illegitimate Entities In Nations by Consent, Rothbard rejects the idea that states (or international organizations) should have any monopoly over governance. Instead, he argues for a world of decentralized, voluntary associations without coercive taxation or state control. Falcone assumes that international institutions should be reformed to function more efficiently, but Rothbard would insist that they should be eliminated entirely, as they are unnatural constructs that exist solely to serve political elites, not individuals. 2. Subsidiarity is Insufficient – Only Privatization Ensures Freedom The article argues that strict subsidiarity (where decision-making is pushed to the lowest level) is a means of increasing liberty. However, Rothbard would reject subsidiarity as an incomplete solution because it still assumes the existence of government power at any level. Rothbard’s anarcho-capitalist vision goes beyond subsidiarity—he would argue that all governance functions should be privatized. Under subsidiarity, a local government may impose restrictive economic policies or violate property rights just as a national government would. Size of government is not the issue—its very existence is. Instead of subsidiarity, Rothbard would advocate for competing private security agencies, voluntary arbitration, and free-market legal structures. 3. Secession is Good – But Not Enough The article correctly aligns with Rothbard’s strong support for secession as a fundamental right. However, Rothbard would likely push the logic further – secession should not stop at the nation-state level but continue down to the individual level. Rothbard argues that the ultimate goal of secession is not just breaking states into smaller states but eliminating the state entirely. In The Ethics of Liberty, he argues that secession is a form of voluntary association: If a neighborhood, city, or even a single person wants to secede, they should be allowed to do so. The article still envisions nation-states as inevitable, but Rothbard would argue that the real aim should be the disintegration of the state into purely voluntary associations. 4. No Need for 'Stronger' International Organizations The article assumes that international organizations could strengthen if they limit their scope and embrace secession. A Rothbardian critique would be that international organizations should not be strengthened at all – they should be abolished. Organizations like the UN, EU, and WTO exist only because of state coercion. Without taxation and political power, they would collapse. Rothbard would likely argue that instead of 'strengthening' them, they should be replaced with voluntary networks of trade, arbitration, and private defense associations. The author treats international organizations as a given, but Rothbard would say they are artificial constructs that serve political elites, not free individuals. 5. The Market, Not Governments, Should Facilitate Trade and Cooperation The article acknowledges that international trade has lifted billions out of poverty, but it credits international institutions like the WTO and NAFTA for facilitating this trade. Rothbard would argue that free markets, not governments or bureaucracies, are responsible for economic progress. Trade happens despite institutions like the WTO, not because of them. Governments create tariffs, regulations, and barriers that hinder free exchange. A Rothbardian view would reject managed trade agreements and instead support true free trade, meaning unilateral elimination of all trade barriers without reliance on international treaties. Conclusion: Falcone’s 'Better Statism' is Inadequate to the Austrian School’s Goals While the article presents a vision for greater decentralization, Rothbard would find its underlying premise flawed: namely, that the current system can or should be improved within existing international structures. Instead, a Rothbardian critique would advocate for: Abolition of international organizations rather than their reform. Privatization over subsidiarity – decentralization is good, but private governance is the real goal. Radical secession – not just for states, but for individuals and voluntary communities. Free trade through voluntary association, not international agreements. Elimination of all coercive government entities in favor of private legal and defense systems. Ultimately, from a Rothbardian perspective, the best way to maximize liberty is not through better governance but through the abolition of the state altogether. While Falcone’s article takes steps in the right direction by supporting subsidiarity and secession, it does not go far enough in fully dismantling state power and replacing it with a system based purely on individual consent and voluntary association. In this sense, Falcone’s effort is inadequate to the needs of 'Bringing the Austrian School into the 21st Century' since the Austrian school – at least in its Rothbardian form – does not seek 'better statism' but actual liberty.

Ukraine’s President Signs Law To Facilitate Purchase Of Belene Nu...	The two part-built units at the Khmelnitsky nuclear power plant could be finished with unused equipment from Bulgaria's discontinued Belene nuclear power plant project, with President Volodymyr Zelensky signing into law the legal framework for the acquisition. Ukraine's parliament, the Verkhovna Rada, backed the plan last month, with the presidential signature required to put it into law. Nuclear power plant operator Energoatom said the law establishes the legal framework and gives approval for negotiations with Bulgaria for the acquisition of the equipment. The back-story Khmelnitsky's first reactor was connected to the grid in 1987, but work on three other reactors was halted in 1990, at a time when unit 3 was about 80% complete and unit 4 about 25%. Work on the second reactor restarted and it was connected to the grid in 2004, but units 3 and 4 remain uncompleted. The Belene project in northern Bulgaria was for the construction of two 1000 MWe units, using Russian VVER-1000 designs. Preliminary site works began in 2008, and contracts for components including large forgings and I&C systems were signed with suppliers, but the project was stymied by financing problems. Equipment for the nuclear island had been paid for and was manufactured and delivered in 2017 and has since been kept in storage - the then government formally ended plans for the project in 2023. Since then there have been talks about Ukraine purchasing the unused Belene equipment in what International Atomic Energy Agency Director General Rafael Mariano Grossi called an 'interesting project' with its 'efficient' idea of one interrupted construction project integrating technology from a discontinued project. The agency has said that it will help throughout the project to ensure safety standards are assured at all times. The Bulgarian parliament has already given approval for negotiations about the sale of the equipment to Ukraine, with the minimum aim of recouping the reported EUR600 million (USD622 million) paid for the equipment. In May last year, at the request of the Bulgarian and Ukrainian governments, a US technical team joined experts from the two countries to conduct a technical assessment of the VVER equipment stored at Belene. Westinghouse has also confirmed it will be able to supply fuel for the completed Khmelnitsky units. Ukraine's Energy Minister Herman Halushchenko said, after the parliamentary vote giving the go-ahead in February: 'The completion of the Khmelnitsky NPP is a strategic task for Ukraine. Nuclear energy is the basis of our energy system, and to a large extent it is thanks to it that we have light and heat, despite constant attacks.' He also stressed that Ukraine, which is currently at war with Russia, would not see any Russian involvement in the project - 'everything will be implemented by Ukrainian and American companies'. He added that completion of the units will be 'many times' faster and cheaper than construction from scratch. Ukraine has 15 reactors, capable of generating half its electricity, at four existing nuclear power plants, including the six-unit Zaporizhzhia plant which has been under Russian military control since early March 2022. The country has plans for at least nine Westinghouse AP1000 units, including two new ones planned at Khmelnitsky and others at the Rivne and South Ukraine plants. The two completed units could provide more than 2 GW of capacity.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWceuc9kPxWWMOHzuf4i5kwW	2025-03-15T17:06:15-07:00	
Crypto And The Far Right – OpEd	Back in 2021, Donald Trump called cryptocurrency 'a disaster waiting to happen' and a 'scam.' Takes one to know one, right? As he got closer to regaining the White House, however, Trump changed his mind about this 'scam,' probably as a result of the millions of dollars that flowed into his campaign coffers from industry donors. To the delight of these donors, Trump promised to make the United States the cryptocurrency capital of the world. He also talked about creating a strategic reserve of Bitcoin. After he won the election, Trump received over $11 million in contributions to his inaugural committee from the crypto industry. It’s a hallmark of pyramid scams that only the people at the top reap the benefits, and Trump has put himself at the very apex of the ziggurat in order to rake in millions for his posse and for himself. Consider the saga of $TRUMP. Three days before his inauguration, the $TRUMP meme coin debuted. Meme coins are usually based on an Internet meme and are 'typically characterized by their volatile nature.' Well, that sounds like a good fit for Trump! Indeed, after he promoted the coin on his social media accounts, its value surged astronomically. Some of the biggest winners in this naked money grab were the firms that launched the coin and profited from the transaction fees, which netted them as much as $100 million in the first two weeks. One of those firms was CIC Digital, which is owned by…Trump himself. Like all financial operations characterized by irrational exuberance, the value of $TRUMP soon plummeted. Indeed, over 800,000 investor accounts lost a total of $2 billion. Of course, they’re not the only Trump supporters who are suffering from buyer’s remorse. Even the stock market, which initially cheered Trump’s election, is having a serious hangover, a swing in mood not very different from $TRUMP’s trajectory. $TRUMP’s deep dive notwithstanding—or perhaps because of the success of this scam—crypto remains an essential part of Trump’s economic plans. And Trump is not the only far-right leader who has dabbled in scamming the population with crypto. Argentina’s Javier Milei is now dealing with the aftermath of a corruption scandal associated with $LIBRA, a meme coin he initially supported and which left 10,000 investors over $250 million poorer. El Salvador is still reeling from Nayib Bukele’s crypto obsession, which cost his country $60 million when Bitcoin tanked a couple years ago—not to mention all the Salvadoran energy and natural resources that Bitcoin mining has absorbed. Two years ago, I explained how cryptocurrencies function like pyramid scams. Last year, I discussed the environmental consequences of crypto. Now I want to dig a little deeper into the politics of crypto: how Trump and his far-right allies are using these digital currencies as a strategy to rig the rules of the game in their favor. The Mechanisms of Theft To understand how crypto scams work, you need to know about 'sniping' and 'rug-pulling.' When a new crypto product is launched, whether it’s a meme coin or a non-fungible token, a select group of speculators place a big buy to push the value higher. If enough of these 'snipers' exit at the same time, the value drops, providing the snipers with short-term profits and leaving a lot of other investors holding the (empty) bag. Of course, it helps to know in advance about a new product launch so that you can line up your bots and your AI to execute high-volume and high-speed trades—and your coordinated exit from the stage. In another context, you might call this 'insider trading.' The orchestrated sale of the crypto product is known as the 'rug pull.' It can be sudden, as was the case with $TRUMP. Or it can take place over a longer period of time in what used to be known as the 'long con.' The rug pull sometimes relies on the services of a celebrity. Let’s take a brief look at the case of Javier Milei in Argentina to understand how this works. Enter Milei Argentine President Javier Milei is, to say the least, a heterodox economist. He pledged to cut government spending as a way of reining in inflation. He fired 30,000 government workers, eliminated government subsidies, and halted many public works projects. No surprise that Milei and his infamous chainsaw served as the inspiration for Musk and DOGE. Inflation in Argentina has indeed fallen, from nearly 300 percent to around 85 percent in January. But the costs have been immense to the poor. More than half of Argentines now live below the poverty line, and they are dealing with increased costs for food and basic services. The economy has contracted as a not-very-surprising result of Milei’s chainsaw approach to government. Among his many economic enthusiasms, Milei has relentlessly attacked the country’s central bank and advocated for the adoption of the U.S. dollar as the national currency. During his first year in office, he didn’t put crypto at the heart of his economic platform. But his efforts to displace the central bank has been accompanied by a push to lift restrictions on currency exchange, which would give cryptocurrencies a big boost. Argentinians are already leading adopters of crypto, largely as a hedge against the volatility of the Argentine peso (frankly, they might as well buy lottery tickets or play slots at the casino). But that’s changing as a result of the $LIBRA scandal. At the instigation of several fast-talking meme coin boosters, Milei endorsed $LIBRA when it was released on Valentine’s Day this year. But the value of the meme coin tanked within mere hours as top investors pulled the rug out from under it. As 'Cryptogate' spread, Milei scrambled to deny any connection to the fiasco. But that was hard to do given the evidence of several tweets showing Milei, with his trademark glower and two thumbs up, posing with those boosters, including an American named Hayden Davis. Davis runs Kelsier Ventures, which was part of the sniping and rug-pulling around $MELANIA, the spousal counterpart to $TRUMP, which followed a similar trajectory of jumping high off the diving board and then plunging into the empty pool below. Davis did the same thing with $LIBRA, making off with around $100 million. He has promised to refund some of that money to the people who lost big. Don’t hold your breath. 'This is an insider’s game,' Davis has said about these meme coins. 'This is like an unregulated casino.' As for Milei, the real purpose of his economic program has been starkly revealed by this scandal: a transfer of money from the poor to the rich. His popularity was already on a downward trajectory in early February before the scandal, with 53 percent of the population disapproving of his policies (compared to 43 percent in favor). Cryptogate could be an anchor that pulls Milei down to the bottom of the sea. Trump Also Goes Big It’s no accident that the administration’s government-cutting initiative, DOGE, shares a name with a leading cryptocurrency. Cutting government oversight, eliminating regulations, and empowering the already-powerful private sector all benefit the crypto industry. But Trump is not just cutting government—he is putting his own people into positions of power. That includes right-wing financier David Sacks, who’s in charge of both crypto and AI in the Trump administration. Sacks comes out of the same political milieu as Elon Musk and Peter Thiel (with whom he led PayPal). As with so many of Trump’s appointees, the opportunities for corruption abound. As MSNBC reported at the end of last year, 'Sacks launched an artificial intelligence company called Glue this year and is known to be a major investor in cryptocurrencies, which would seem likely to create some conflicts of interest if he’s steering the administration’s AI and crypto policies.' Trump is also staffing the Securities and Exchange Commission with crypto loyalists who have already begun to deconstruct the oversight of the crypto sector. As The New York Times notes: Federal officials declared that so-called memecoins would not be subject to strict oversight. A series of investigations into major cryptocurrency firms were halted. And the Securities and Exchange Commission agreed to pause a fraud case against a top crypto entrepreneur. Just over a month since President Trump’s inauguration, U.S. regulators have almost entirely dismantled a yearslong government crackdown on the crypto industry, a volatile sector rife with fraud, scams and theft. Meme coins, of course, are the $TRUMP and $MELANIA scams that have already bilked thousands of investors. The reduction of oversight on crypto, meanwhile, is likely to increase the pool of victims. Burwick Law is the firm trying to claw back money for those who were scammed by $HAWK (promoted by influencer Haliey Welch) and also 200 clients from various countries who lost money in the $LIBRA scandal. Dubbed the 'ambulance chaser of crypto,' Max Burwick is going to face a deregulatory headwind coming from the Trump administration. But the biggest crypto project of the Trump administration is its crypto strategic reserve, an idea promoted hard by the crypto industry. It’s the culmination of the right-wing’s push for U.S. businesses to invest in crypto and also state governments buy up the currency. A strategic reserve of crypto makes no sense. Such reserves are meant for valuable assets like oil and gold. Why doesn’t Trump consider a strategic reserve of Amway products or Tupperware? For the time being, the two reserves (one for Bitcoin, the second for other digital assets) will contain only crypto seized in criminal or civil forfeitures. The crypto industry was disappointed that Trump didn’t mandate federal purchases of the currencies. But that will probably happen in the future. The new initiative calls on federal agencies to come up with strategies to buy more Bitcoin. And there’s now a bill in Congress calling on the government to buy a million Bitcoin. So, basically, such a reserve is just a gift to all the crypto loyalists who have supported Trump. Let’s call it what it is: a first step toward state capture by crypto oligarchs. Why Does the Far Right Love Crypto? Crypto appeals to the far right for several reasons. It promises to undermine the state’s central authority. It offers a degree of anonymity, which can facilitate tax evasion, asset parking overseas, and plain old money-laundering. And its volatility allows for the profiteering that sometimes goes by the name of entrepreneurialism. Meanwhile, for extremist organizations that need to stay under the radar to evade surveillance, crypto is the monetary equivalent of an encrypted messaging service. According to the Anti-Defamation League, '15 white supremacist and antisemitic groups and individuals, as well as their donors, that collectively moved $142,546 worth of cryptocurrency to and/or from 22 different cryptocurrency service providers.' The European far right is also beginning to trade in these currencies. In countries with conventional governance—that is, not lunatics like Trump and locos like Milei—crypto functions as a right-wing weapon against the state. But when the inmates take over the asylum, the currency becomes a way of consolidating power in the hands of oligarchs. Meme coins like $TRUMP and $LIBRA are just the side hustles by opportunists who want some of the crumbs that fall off the oligarchs’ tables. The real money is in the 'legitimate' trade in crypto, the speculation in Bitcoin and Dogecoin. This is where far-right politicians create 'positive synergies' between government deregulation on one side and campaign contributions on the other. This institutional corruption is at the center of the Trump/Milei enterprise: the wholesale looting of the public sector and the grotesque enrichment of the already rich.

Mass Protests Grip Belgrade As Serbia’s Vučić Faces Pressure From...	By Laurent Geslin (EurActiv) -- Hundreds of thousands of people took to the streets of Belgrade today as a wave of demonstrations against Serbia’s powerful president, Aleksandar Vučić, enters its fourth month. This demonstration could be Serbia's largest since the fall of Slobodan Milošević in October 2000. At least, that's what the columns of students and Serbian citizens who have been converging on Belgrade from across the country over the past few days are hoping. In the heart of the Serbian capital, a hundred tractors requisitioned by the regime were parked around the Presidential Palace on Friday, creating the appearance of an improvised fortress, as RFI reported. Nearby, a city park has already been occupied for several days by a mix of hooded toughs claiming to be students – who say they oppose the months-long blockade of Serbian universities by protesters – and by several dozen veterans of the Yugoslav wars. 'The government may attempt to unleash its most violent supporters against the protesters,' Vuk Vuksanović, an analyst at the Belgrade Centre for Security Policy, told Euractiv. 'But any such move would only fuel the mobilisation, especially since it is unclear whether the police and military are still fully under the control of the authorities.' In an effort to secure the loyalty of the country’s security forces, the Serbian government passed an abrupt pay hike for Interior Ministry employees on Thursday. The authoritarian Vučić, who has held power in Serbia since 2014, has also intensified his threats, stating on 11 March in an interview with Serbia’s national broadcaster RTS that 'those who commit acts of violence will end up behind bars'. These warnings, however, have done little to deter the months-long student protests that have been demanding transparency about the deadly roof collapse at the recently renovated railway station in Novi Sad, which killed 15 people on 1 November. What began in the northern Serbian city quickly spread nationwide, with protesters also denouncing widespread government corruption.'Aleksandar Vučić spreads fake news on social media, claiming that students are attacking the police, which is obviously false,' Aleksa Nikolić, a student at the University of Novi Sad, told Euractiv. 'He is doing everything to stir up tensions, divide the population, and provoke clashes – but it is up to us to decide when this movement will end.' In a bid to quell public anger, the Serbian president dismissed his prime minister, Miloš Vučević, in late January after a student was beaten by members of the ruling Serbian Progressive Party (SNS). Since then, Vučić has struggled to regain control, facing a movement without a clearly identified leader that has deliberately distanced itself from major opposition parties. 'The key question now is how to channel this anger into political action,' the Belgrade-based novelist and philosopher Igor Štiks told Euractiv. 'The only option currently on the table is the formation of a transitional technical government, whose main task would be to organise free elections.' Vučić’s international backers Despite mounting street opposition, Vučić continues to enjoy tacit support from major European capitals that have business interests in Serbia, including Berlin and Paris, as well as from EU institutions – although the Socialists and Democrats group (SD) in the European Parliament has echoed the student demands. The Serbian president also enjoys the help of his American counterpart, Donald Trump, who this week did not hesitate to send his eldest son, Donald Jr., to Belgrade. The visit followed last year’s agreement with an investment firm run by Jared Kushner – Trump's son-in-law – which plans to build a hotel on the site of the former Yugoslav People’s Army headquarters, damaged during the 1999 NATO bombing of Belgrade. Vučić can also take pride in his close ties with Moscow, as Belgrade has never enforced EU sanctions against Russia, despite Serbia holding official EU candidate status since 2012. Just days ago, Vučić stated that Russian President Vladimir Putin supported 'the legitimate authorities of Serbia'.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWceuc9kPxWWMCAt0ZsVkNCG	2025-03-15T17:00:40-07:00	
South Sudan: Opposition Leaders, Others, Detained, Says HRW	South Sudanese authorities have arrested at least 22 political and military personnel in the wake of violent clashes that started in mid-February 2025 between government and armed groups in Upper Nile, Human Rights Watch said. These recent developments have plunged the country into political crisis.'The lack of transparency and legitimate concerns about the legality of the arrests and detention of opposition leaders and others fuel instability in an already fragile security context,' said Nyagoah Tut Pur, South Sudan researcher at Human Rights Watch. 'Authorities should immediately reveal the fate and whereabouts of detainees and ensure their due process rights, including by bringing them before a properly constituted and impartial court.' The people arrested since March 4, are aligned with First Vice President Riek Machar, head of the Sudan People’s Liberation Army in Opposition (SPLA-IO). The timing of these detentions coincides with a political crisis in Nasir, Upper Nile, where clashes between government forces and armed youth militia, also known as the White Army, displaced thousands of civilians. The area is a stronghold for supporters of Machar who has long been in opposition to President Kiir. The South Sudanese government should immediately end the enforced disappearance or incommunicado detention of everyone linked to the opposition who has been detained since the first week of March and ensure full and strict respect for their due process rights, Human Rights Watch said. On March 4, military authorities arrested and detained Lieutenant General Gabriel Duop Lam, deputy chief of staff of the unified army structures, who also serves as acting chief of Staff for SPLA-IO. Officials also disarmed and detained five of his bodyguards, a credible source said. The whereabouts of the six men is unknown. The detention or other deprivation of liberty of an individual, followed by a refusal to acknowledge the detention or to reveal the fate or whereabouts of the person deprived of their liberty, constitutes an enforced disappearance under international law, a crime subject to an absolute prohibition in all circumstances. On March 5, at 2 a.m., armed National Security Service (NSS) officers took Puot Kang Chol, the petroleum minister, from his house in Juba, along with at least seven others, without explanation and drove them away, a credible witness said. The seven include: a friend, Camilo Gatmach; bodyguards Nelson Malou, Kun Tut, Peter Magong; and three family members Koang Puk, Biluny Puk, and Buay Thiechuong. The NSS officers had initially arrested Chol with one of his bodyguards at around 11 p.m. on March 4 but brought him back, a credible witness said. The eight men were initially held at the NSS Riverside (Operations) facility then transferred to the NSS headquarters, also known as Blue House, credible sources say. On March 6, the NSS arrested Thomas Jal Thomas, deputy inspector general of the police, and James Duop Gatleak, his deputy, in their offices and took them to the Riverside detention site but released them after a few hours, according to a credible source. That same day, 11 armed NSS officers took Stephen Par Kuol, the peacebuilding minister, from his office along with three staff members, a witness said. They bundled them into two Landcruiser pickup trucks with other armed officers and drove away. The four men were released on early morning of March 7. Also on March 6, NSS officers arrested and detained Mam Pal Dhuor, a member of SPLA-IO, at Juba International Airport as he attempted to board a flight to Kampala, a credible source said. Meanwhile the situation in Nasir deteriorated. On March 7, armed men attacked a UN helicopter on a mission to rescue wounded soldiers in Nasir, killing a crew member and injuring two others. President Kiir also announced that a well-known army general, Majur Dak along with 27 other soldiers who were to be evacuated, were also killed during the attack. The same day, the army issued a circular, seen by Human Rights Watch, deploying forces in six major road junctions leading to and from the capital, Juba. Heavy deployment at the residence of Riek Machar in the evenings is apparently ongoing. Puok Both Baluang, the spokesperson for Riek Machar, told Human Rights Watch that as of March 10 they knew of 22 men affiliated with the SPLA-IO – including party members, staff, family, and bodyguards – detained by NSS and Military Intelligence, many of whose fate or whereabouts is unknown. Media reported that Gatwech Lam Puoch, an SPLA-IO member of parliament for Nasir county, was arrested on March 11 and is detained at the Blue House. Spokespeople for the NSS and the army did not respond to requests for comment. At a news conference on March 5, Information Minister Michael Makuei Lueth, said that, 'If anybody is arrested, it is for a reason.' And on March 8, the NSS spokesperson announced that it had arrested people with 'verified links to the situation in Nasir, Ulang, and surrounding areas' following extensive 'intelligence' and promised more arrests. The National Security Service operates with limited legal and judicial oversight and de facto impunity. The service is responsible for enforced disappearances as well as the incommunicado detention and torture and ill-treatment of detainees. It has also unlawfully conducted surveillance. The government should revise the definition of 'crimes against the state' and remove the security service authority to arrest and detain people, limit its authority for search, seizure, and surveillance, and bring it in line with the constitution and international human rights standards, Human Rights Watch said. The government has in the past used trumped up charges of crimes against the state such as treason, publishing false information, and insulting the president, to restrict freedom of expression, assembly and association, such as peaceful exercise of political opposition, or public criticism of state policy and actions. Prosecutions and trials have been marred by human rights abuses and political interference. The government should immediately make public the grounds for and evidence to justify the recent arrests. All detainees should immediately be brought before an independent judge to scrutinize the legality of the arrests, and to determine if they should be released or if they can continue to be lawfully detained. The international community, including the United Nations, the African Union, and the Intergovernmental Authority on Development (IGAD) should press the South Sudanese authorities to uphold human rights, including the immediate end to any and all enforced disappearance and bringing the detainees before a court, Human Rights Watch said. 'South Sudanese authorities should cease arbitrary detention of opposition members and other actions that amount to harassment and not use the security institutions as a tool of oppression,' Pur said. 'International and regional actors like the African Union should insist that authorities uphold human rights obligations as they seek to de-escalate political tensions.'	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWceuc9kPxWWMLo9nDtGbizL	2025-03-15T16:57:24-07:00	
ASEAN’s Response To Trump 2.0: An Analysis Of Problems And Challe...	The return of Donald Trump to the White House in 2025 presents a complex geopolitical challenge for the Association of Asian Southeast Nations (ASEAN). Trump’s previous tenure demonstrated a clear departure from multilateralism, a prioritization of bilateral transactions, and an unpredictable engagement with global allies. ASEAN, a bloc reliant on diplomacy, economic integration, and strategic neutrality, now finds itself at a critical juncture. Trump likely brings resurgence economic uncertainty, security dilemmas and a potential erosion of ASEAN’s diplomatic unity. This essay presents a deeper analysis of the problems ASEAN faces and challenges it must navigate for Trump 2.0. Trump’s first presidency (2017-2021) reshaped global diplomatic norms, retreating from multilateral institutions and shifting U.S. engagement toward a transactional interest-based approach. Unlike Biden’s administration, which sought to rebuild alliances, Trump 2.0 could see ASEAN further marginalized in favor of individual, deal-driven engagements. The erosion of ASEAN’s collective leverage weakens its ability to negotiate favorable terms with the U.S, ultimately creating internal strategic divisions and dilemmas among its member states. If Trump dismisses ASEAN-centric frameworks such as the ASEAN-U.S. Summit and the East Asia Summit bloc, regional influence may wane, making it vulnerable to external pressures from both Washington and Beijing. Economic ramifications are among the most pressing concerns. Trump’s initial tenure was marked by an aggressive trade war with China, severely disrupting global supply chains and creating economic ripples throughout Southeast Asia. The potential for renewed economic hostilities in 2025 poses a threat to ASEAN’s economic stability, which is deeply intertwined with both the U.S. and Chinese markets. While ASEAN sought to mitigate these risks through agreements such as the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP), a Trump-led U.S. could impose new trade barriers or renegotiate deals favoring American interests, leaving ASEAN economies susceptible to external economic shocks. Moreover, Trump’s preference for bilateral over multilateral trade deals undermines ASEAN’s negotiating power, potentially isolating smaller economies and exposing them to predatory economic practices. Security in the Indo-Pacific is another significant challenge. Trump’s previous presidency displayed a wavering commitment to regional security frameworks, which, if repeated, could leave ASEAN member states exposed to China’s increasing assertiveness in the South China Sea. The Biden administration reinforced freedom of navigation operations (FONOPs) and reaffirmed support for ASEAN’s territorial claims, but Trump’s return deprioritize might these efforts favor in striking of trade or investment deals with Beijing. If the U.S. scales back its military presence, China could seize the opportunity to escalate its militarization of disputed waters, further pressuring ASEAN claimants such as the Philippines, Vietnam, and Malaysia. The lack of a strong U.S deterrence could force ASEAN states into strategic difficult recalibrations with some potentially yielding to Chinese influence to ensure economic and security guarantees. Moreover, ASEAN’s ability to maintain autonomy is strategic U.S.; amid tensions, China will be tested severely. Trump’s with the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue (Quad) comprising the U.S. Japan, India, and Australia were inconsistent during his first term. A second Trump presidency could either revive an aggressive Indo-Pacific posture or result in further disengagement, depending on his administration’s priorities. Both scenarios present challenges: an intensified Indo-Pacific strategy could pressure ASEAN states to choose between aligning with the U.S. and maintaining neutrality, while a disengaged Trump administration could leave ASEAN diplomatically stranded, exposing it to Beijing’s influence. The principle of ASEAN neutrality, long regarded as stabilizing a force in the region, may come under increasing strain as the bloc struggles to navigate shifting geopolitical dynamics. Institutional limitations within ASEAN also pose challenges in responding to a changing U. S foreign policy landscape. The bloc’s consensus-based decision-making model, while promoting unity, often slows responses to geopolitical crises. Trump’s preference for direct bilateral negotiations could widen divisions within ASEAN, particularly between states aligned more closely with U.S. interests (such as Singapore and the Philippines) and those economically dependent on China (such as Cambodia and Laos). A lack of ASEAN-coordinated response would weaken its influence in Washington, reducing its ability to shape U. S. policies that affect the region. Political ramifications are also a significant challenge for ASEAN. During Trump's first term, there was a noticeable reluctance to prioritize democratic norms and human rights, with a greater emphasis on economic and security-based transactions. If this trend persists, ASEAN leaders grappling with internal legitimacy issues—like Myanmar’s junta or Thailand’s military-backed government—may experience reduced scrutiny from Washington. Conversely, democracies like Indonesia, which value strong relations with the U. S based on governance and human rights, could see their ties strained. This disparity may further fragment ASEAN’s internal cohesion as different member states navigate Trump’s foreign policy priorities through diverging strategies. Despite these hurdles, ASEAN has opportunities to counterbalance the uncertainty of a Trump 2.0 Presidency. Strengthening intra-regional economic cooperation through RCEP and fostering deeper trade ties with the European Union could help Japan and India reduce their overreliance on U.S. markets. ASEAN can strengthen its defense initiatives through the ASEAN Defense Ministers’ Meeting-Plus (ADMM-Plus), allowing for a degree of stability that is independent of U.S. military engagement. Engaging China strategically while maintaining ASEAN’s collective stance in territorial disputes will be crucial in ensuring that regional sovereignty is not undermined. Ultimately, ASEAN’s response to Trump 2.0 must be characterized by adaptability, unity, and strategic foresight. The bloc faces formidable challenges, including economic uncertainty, instability, security, and the erosion of multilateral diplomatic engagement. The primary obstacle remains ASEAN’s cohesion—without a unified strategy, individual states may be forced into difficult concessions that undermine regional stability. Trump’s unpredictable approach to foreign policy adds a layer of complexity, making it imperative for ASEAN to bolster its resilience through diversified partnerships and strengthened internal coordination. If ASEAN fails to shape its regional strategies proactively, it risks being sidelined in an increasingly volatile Indo-Pacific order. The coming years will test the bloc’s ability to navigate one of its most complex diplomatic landscapes to date, demanding a recalibrated and pragmatic approach to ensure its continued relevance and stability.

Petrobras Confirms ‘High Productivity’ Of Discovered Well In Colo...	By Bruno de Freitas Moura Petrobras announced this week that formation tests on the Sirius-2 well, discovered last year in Colombia’s deep waters, confirmed 'good productivity.' Sirius-2 is situated in the Guajira Basin of the Caribbean Sea, 31 kilometers off the coast at a depth of 804 meters. The reservoir lies 76 kilometers from Santa Marta. In addition to confirming good productivity, samples were collected for laboratory analysis. 'The test's preliminary results reinforce the region's gas potential,' the company stated. Petrobras explores and produces oil and gas in Colombia through its subsidiary, Petrobras International Braspetro B.V.—Sucursal Colombia (PIB-COL), in partnership with the state-owned oil company Ecopetrol. The Colombians hold a 55.56 percent stake in the consortium, while Petrobras owns 44.44 percent. When the consortium announced the well's discovery in August, it was named Uchuva. It was later renamed Sirius. Exploratory block In addition to Sirius-2, the companies are also exploring Sirius-1, a nearby well within the same exploration block. 'The consortium will continue assessing the drilling results of the Sirius-1 and Sirius-2 wells, in line with the planning and contractual commitments with the National Hydrocarbons Agency (ANH),' Petrobras stated. The ANH, affiliated with the Colombian Ministry of Mines and Energy, is the regulatory body for the oil and gas sector in Colombia, similar to the role of Brazil's National Petroleum, Natural Gas, and Biofuels Agency (ANP). In this week's statement, Petrobras highlighted that exploration in the Guajira Offshore Basin maritime block (GUA-OFF-0) 'aligns with the company's long-term strategy to replenish oil and gas reserves by exploring new frontiers and forming partnerships, ensuring global energy demand is met during the energy transition.' Giant field The region where the Sirius-2 well is located can be considered part of the equatorial margin, as stated by Petrobras' Director of Exploration and Production, Sylvia Anjos, on December 5, 2024. At that time, the state-owned company announced the discovery of the largest natural gas reservoir in the history of the neighboring country. Despite the large volume, the Brazilian state-owned company declared that production would be directed to the Colombian gas market to meet the country's high demand. Equatorial margin The equatorial margin has gained attention in recent years as a promising new frontier for oil and gas exploration. Recent discoveries off the coasts of Guyana, French Guiana, and Suriname have highlighted the region's significant exploration potential, given its proximity to the equator. In Brazil, the equatorial margin extends from the state of Rio Grande do Norte to the state of Amapá. Petrobras has 16 wells in this new exploratory frontier but only has authorization from the Brazilian Environmental Institute (Ibama) to drill two of them, located off the coast of Rio Grande do Norte. The exploration has faced criticism from environmentalists, who are concerned about potential environmental damage. Ibama has denied licenses for other areas, such as the mouth of the Amazon Basin. Petrobras has requested a reconsideration from the institute, which is linked to the Ministry of the Environment and Climate Change and is currently awaiting a decision. Petrobras emphasizes that extracting oil from the equatorial margin is a strategic decision to reduce the country’s reliance on oil imports. Petrobras in the world The Brazilian state-owned company's operations abroad aim to secure sources that will strengthen its oil and gas reserves. Less than a month ago, Director Sylvia Anjos highlighted the need to acquire oil fields in African countries, particularly in Angola, Namibia, and South Africa. Petrobras also holds three exploration blocks in São Tomé and Príncipe, located off the west coast of Africa. In Argentina, through its subsidiary Petrobras Operaciones S.A., the company holds a 33.6 percent stake in the Neuquén River production asset. In Bolivia, Petrobras primarily produces gas from the San Alberto and San Antonio fields, holding a 35 percent stake in each of these service contracts, which are mainly focused on supplying gas to Brazil and Bolivia. In the United States, Petrobras operates in deepwater fields in the Gulf of Mexico, with a 20 percent stake held by Petrobras America Inc. The company is part of the MPGoM joint venture with Murphy Exploration & Production Company.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWceuc9kPxWWMIN3fZ3Joimp	2025-03-15T16:52:09-07:00	
Trump Calls For Safety Of Surrounded Ukrainian Troops In Kursk Re...	U.S. President Donald Trump announced that his administration has held 'productive discussions' with Russian President Vladimir Putin, during which he urged the safety of Ukrainian soldiers allegedly surrounded in Russia's Kursk region. In a March 14 post on Truth Social, Trump stated: 'At this moment, thousands of Ukrainian soldiers are completely surrounded by the Russian army and are in a very bad and vulnerable position. I have strongly urged President Putin to spare their lives. It would be a terrible massacre, the likes of which hasn't been seen since World War II. God bless them all.' However, he did not provide specific evidence. Russian President Vladimir Putin, during a meeting with permanent members of the Security Council, emphasized that Ukrainian troops in the Kursk region, if they lay down their arms and surrender, will have their lives and dignified treatment guaranteed in accordance with international law and Russian Federation laws. The Russian President noted that the Russian side approaches Trump's appeal with understanding, considering the humanitarian aspects concerning Ukrainian servicemen. However, he stressed that their crimes against civilians are classified as terrorism. Putin also stated that foreign mercenaries are not subject to the provisions of the Geneva Convention on the treatment of prisoners of war. Additionally, the Russian president mentioned that the Trump administration is taking steps to restore Russian-American relations, which had deteriorated under the previous U.S. administration. He emphasized that this process is complex, but there have already been phone conversations between the two countries' leaders, communications between foreign ministers, as well as a meeting between Russian presidential aide Yuri Ushakov and his American counterpart. On March 13, Putin stated that Russia is ready to consider the U.S.-proposed 30-day ceasefire, provided that Ukraine halts mobilization, military preparations, and foreign aid supplies. He also claimed significant advances in the Kursk region, stating that the ceasefire would benefit Ukraine. On March 12, Moscow reported recapturing over 86% of previously occupied territories in the region, including the strategic city of Sudzha, initially seized by Ukrainian forces during the Kursk incursion in August 2024. Putin noted that in the event of a complete physical encirclement, Ukrainian soldiers would have two choices: surrender or die. However, Ukraine's Commander-in-Chief Oleksandr Syrskyi acknowledged the 'difficult situation' in the region but affirmed that Ukrainian forces would maintain their defense 'as long as it is reasonable and necessary.' Previously, Syrskyi had denied reports of Ukrainian soldiers being encircled in the Kursk region.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWceuc9kPxWWMDK9wBhb35rc	2025-03-15T16:50:41-07:00	
Patriarch Bartholomew Says 1054 Church Division ‘Not Insurmountab...	By AC Wimmer Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew I of Constantinople on Wednesday offered a hopeful historical assessment of the traditional 1054 date for the 'Great Schism' between Rome and Constantinople, suggesting that tensions developed gradually over time and 'are not insurmountable.' 'Of course, problems have accumulated over a thousand years. But we are full of hope that they will be resolved in a few years,' the patriarch emphasized during an audience in Istanbul on March 12 with a pilgrimage group from the German Association of the Holy Land. The honorary head of worldwide Orthodoxy made these comments in the presence of Melkite Greek Catholic Patriarch Emeritus Gregory III Laham, reported CNA Deutsch, CNA’s German-language news partner. The pilgrimage preceded the 1,700th anniversary of the Council of Nicaea held in 325 A.D. Rather than a sudden break in 1054 — the traditional date of the separation between the Orthodox and Catholic churches — Patriarch Bartholomew suggested these tensions gradually strengthened over time. The potential for a historic breakthrough in ecumenical relations has been building for some time. In January, during vespers concluding the Week of Prayer for Christian Unity, Pope Francis highlighted the 'providential' timing of Easter falling on the same date in both the Gregorian and Julian calendars this year. 'Let us rediscover the common roots of the faith,' the pontiff urged. 'Let us preserve unity!' Cardinal Kurt Koch, prefect of the Dicastery for Promoting Christian Unity, has long supported efforts toward a common Easter date. In 2021, Koch welcomed a suggestion that the year 2025 would be an ideal time to introduce a calendar reform allowing both Eastern and Western Christians to celebrate Easter together. 'It will not be easy to agree on a common Easter date, but it is worth working for it,' Koch stated at the time, adding that the initiative was 'very dear to Pope Francis and also to the Coptic Pope Tawadros.' Calendar considerations The First Council of Nicaea, held in 325, decided that Easter would be celebrated on the first Sunday after the full moon following the beginning of spring, making the earliest possible date March 22 and the latest possible April 25. Today, Orthodox Christians use the Julian calendar to calculate the Easter date instead of the Gregorian calendar, which was introduced in 1582 and is used by most of the world. The Julian calendar calculates a slightly longer year and is currently 13 days behind the Gregorian calendar, resulting in different dates for Easter celebrations most years. One possible obstacle to a universal agreement could be ongoing tensions between different churches. In 2018, the Russian Orthodox Church severed ties to the Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople after Patriarch Bartholomew confirmed his intention to recognize the independence of the Orthodox Church of Ukraine. During a meeting with the International Theological Commission at the Vatican in November 2024, Pope Francis confirmed his intention to travel to Turkey in May 2025 to mark this significant anniversary. 'I plan to go there,' Pope Francis stated, noting that the Council of Nicaea 'constitutes a milestone in the journey of the Church and also of all humanity, because faith in Jesus, the Son of God made flesh for us and for our salvation, was formulated and professed as a light that illuminates the meaning of reality and the destiny of all history.' However, the pope’s health situation may affect the planned pilgrimage to modern-day Turkey, as his ongoing hospitalization has raised questions about his ability to undertake the journey.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWceuc9kPxWWMETbWctOpbo2	2025-03-15T16:48:02-07:00	
Sporting Contradictions: Athletes, The Olympics And Climate Chang...	The time has come for arguably the sporting world’s most famous mafia organisation to select its new chief. The various turf-conscious representatives of the International Olympic Committee will be busy with the task of finding a replacement for Thomas Bach when ballots are cast at Costa Navarino, Greece on March 20. Seven candidates have made the list. They show little risk of cleaning the body’s spotty image. Juan Antonio Samaranch Jr.’s candidacy is a lovely reminder of his father, who was himself made IOC president in 1980. That Samaranch was not shy about his fascist sympathies, defending, not infrequently, the rule and legacy of Spain’s dictator Francisco Franco. 'I was with many, many Spaniards with Franco,' he stated at a news conference in 1999. While the father’s sins should not be visited upon the son, the very fact that a bid is being made for the IOC presidency suggests that this apple did not fall so far from the tree. In a flawed effort to influence the candidates and what might be called their vision for the games, over 400 athletes from 90 countries have added their names to a letter urging the candidates to prioritise climate change in their policies. That they think their views make the slightest difference is almost charming. That they pick climate change as the issue suggests they have slumbered in a deep, uninterrupted sleep. The IOC has certainly shown interest in easily gulled athletes in recent years. At points, it has been rather cunning and ruthless in using these unsuspecting sorts to spruce an unrecoverably tarnished brand. The organisation, most notably, trumpeted the role played by some 6,000 sporting individuals in laughable anti-corruption education campaigns during the Paris Olympic Games last year, and the Youth Olympic Games held at Gangwon. The letter itself has also been pushed by athletes who are already in the employ of the IOC apparatus. Sailor and British Olympian Hannah Mills, one of the document’s key proponents, is called, without any sense of irony, an IOC sustainability ambassador. With a sense of wonder, she reflects on the devastation caused by the LA wildfires and how it proved something of an epiphany: 'the time is now to set a course for a safe, bright future.' The letter asks the incoming president 'that over the years and the course of your presidency one issue be above all others: the care of the planet.' The rise in temperatures and extreme weather were 'already disrupting competition schedules, putting iconic venues at risk and affecting the health of athletes and fans.' Rising heat levels had also raised 'real concerns about whether the Summer Games can be held safely in future years, and Winter Games are becoming harder to organise with reliable snow and ice conditions diminishing annually.' A few of the IOC candidates, mindful of the letter’s publicity, reacted on cue. Prince Feisal Al Hussein of Jordan professed being impressed by the 'powerful message from Olympians around the world'. World Athletics chief Sebastian Coe expressed his willingness to meet the signatories to 'share ideas and initiatives'. The letter itself is an exercise in mushy contradiction. The Olympics, pushed by an organisation that runs on the blood of corruption, must count as an environmental and social welfare calamity. Staging them entails disruptive construction, the depletion of resources, the alteration of landscape. Their purpose, far from encouraging good will and the stirrings of the social conscience, lies in a promotion of the relevant city and government often at the expense of the disadvantaged citizenry, a naked, propagandistic display of the regime of the day. The IOC has unashamedly claimed to be a promoter of green policies. In 2021, it committed to reducing its direct and indirect emissions in the order of 30 per cent, and 50 per cent by 2030. It puts much stock in the Olympics Forest project, a shiny enterprise that conceals what has come to be described as 'carbon colonialism', which involves the use of misleading carbon offsets and the exploitation of states in the Global South. Little wonder that this cynical body has been identified as a greenwashing culprit par excellence, a point utterly missed by the letter’s signatories. The 2024 Paris Olympics, described by organisers as 'historic for climate' and 'revolutionary' in nature, proved nothing of the sort. Jules Boykoff, well versed on the politics of the Olympics, preferred a different view, calling the games a 'recycled version of green capitalism that is oblivious in its incrementalism, vague with its methodology and loose with its accountability.' If care of the planet is what these athletes sincerely want, a swift abolition of the Olympics, along with a virtuous cancellation of the IOC, would achieve their goals. At the very least, the games should be dramatically shrunk. Iconic avenues would be spared. The safety of athletes and fans would not be an issue. Why wait for extreme weather to either modify or even do away with the games altogether? Dear incoming IOC president, you can end the whole charade once and for all.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWceuc9kPxWWMNxN6At-sKBb	2025-03-15T16:46:11-07:00	
AI Is Greatly Lowering The Integrity And Standards Of A PhD Award...	The advancement of artificial intelligence (AI) has already heavily impacted the credibility of the PhD or Doctorate of Philosophy. AI has long been used to assist students in undertaking literature searches, but now the technology is fully capable of creating a whole thesis in a matter of a few days. Not only can AI create a thesis, but even the primary research materials, such as interviews can skilfully be created using AI. By using advanced settings, any AI generated data can closely resemble the syntax and idiosyncrasies of target interviewee cohorts. A number of psychology and sociology-based research journal papers have already been withdrawn and/or removed from journals, because it was discovered the data was generated by AI. Such ethical violations have been rising exponentially in the academic world of late. Creating a thesis by AI is an easy option to the old days when internet didn’t exist and almost half the time of a PhD candidate’s working time was looking for and reading articles in libraries. Sometimes students would have to wait months for some obscure article or book can be found in some far-off library and borrowed. The work that once could take a year of more can now be done in a day. Today AI is fully capable of developing a flawless hypothesis, generate a complete literature review, and finally discuss and analyse any date and results to a satisfactory standard to satisfy PhD examiners. As mentioned above, with even the data artificially generated, a whole thesis can be fabricated. A new industry has developed Ethics and integrity are the only gateways that are set up to prevent such fraudulent activity. However, today unfortunately, very little integrity and ethics exist in academia. Previously, PhD candidates had the noble ambition to further their own knowledge in scientific and philosophic domains, and usually ended up in research or teaching roles. The numbers were very low. However, today, the PhD, master of DBA degrees are desired for getting high paying jobs, and gaining a title that would garner them a persona of respect within the community. AI now allows the masses to achieve this. Those who undertake the PhD process with the aim of defrauding it, must find a supervisor, who is willing to take part in the conspiracy. Unfortunately, there are so many willing to do that. The supervisor can hide from the faculty, the fact that the thesis was not created through numbers of drafts, until the final thesis was ready. In this way, a PhD candidate can be presented to examiners without they being wise to the fact the thesis was AI generated. Spotting an AI generated thesis requires some skill. They are generally flawless documents. However, some supervisors know how to counter this with 'implanting' small mistakes and error to remain above this suspicion. The key to exposing any AI generated thesis comes down to the viva, where the candidate will be asked questions. In addition, examiners must delve into a person’s academic background to gauge whether they would be capable of undertaking such research. Creating AI generated thesis is rapidly growing into a lucrative business. If USD 2,000 for a master thesis and USD 15,000 for a PhD thesis are the going rates, then some unscrupulous academics can make a lot of money, and easy money at that. The only extra skill that is needed is mastering AI software in a way to create what is needed for candidates. Don’t be shocked to know that there are some people making big money on this gravy train. The bottom line for society is that the PhD is now becoming almost worthless. Any PhD holder will now become a suspect of being an AI graduate. The same goes for master and DBA graduates. Feeding this fraudulence is the high number of students who demand this service. The most lucrative place to undertake this activity is in institutions where large numbers of foreign students attend. AI will supplement the pockets of those who want to flaunt the system, and make money. AI is already taking over the jobs of journalists, teachers, and any other job that requires knowledge, because AI can replace the need for knowledge. This is a major problem for academia, which until now is not speaking up about this issue. There is complete silence in the halls of learning today. The long-term risks are that future PhD graduates may take on critical jobs where lives depend, thus endangering the community. Meanwhile, there are unscrupulous academics enjoying the AI windfall.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWceuc9kPxWWMGLfZrvquG-s	2025-03-15T16:44:18-07:00	
Islamic Extremism In Sri Lanka: A Rising Threat To South Asian Se...	Since the onset of Israel’s war on Hamas, the first incident of Israeli tourists facing terrorist threats abroad occurred in Sri Lanka. The war began on October 7 after Hamas attacked Israel, killing 1,200 people and taking some 250 others hostage. In October, Israel’s National Security Council urged Israelis to leave Sri Lanka’s Arugam Bay area and other beaches in the island’s south and west immediately, citing terrorism threats in the eastern part of Sri Lanka. This announcement from the Israeli Defense Ministry followed a warning from the US embassy in Sri Lanka, which stated it had 'received credible information warning of an attack targeting popular tourist locations' in eastern Arugam Bay. Eastern Arugam Bay, a hotspot for surfing around 400 kilometers (250 miles) east of Colombo by road, is a popular destination for Israeli tourists. The Indian Intelligence Agency had given a tip-off on October 7 that foreigners could be targeted, the local media reported, citing the Acting Inspector General of Police. The Sri Lankan government has now received intelligence reports of attempts to propagate extremist ideologies within the Muslim population in the Eastern Province. Most of such activities have been reported from the Kalmunai area, prompting SIS and military intelligence units to increase monitoring. Public Security Minister Ananda Wijepala has confirmed this, highlighting evidence of a breeding ground for Islamic extremism in the Eastern Province of Sri Lanka. Meanwhile, Sri Lankan President Anura Kumara Dissanayake informed Parliament that six arrests were made following intelligence reports about possible attacks on tourists in the Arugam Bay area. The April 2019 Easter attacks highlighted Sri Lanka’s vulnerability to the transnational Islamic Jihadi network. Up to 280 people, including foreigners, were killed in a series of suicide attacks orchestrated by ISIS-Sri Lanka (ISIS-S), which had its roots in Kattankudy, a predominantly Muslim area in the Eastern Province. The Zion Church in Batticaloa, one of the Catholic churches targeted, was symbolically selected due to the association of 'Zion' with the Land of Israel. The Eastern Province of Sri Lanka is an area where Muslims live in large numbers. Due to natural population growth and the migration of the main community, Hindu Tamils, Muslims are now approaching near-majority status in the Eastern Province. In the strategically important area of Trincomalee, Muslims are currently the majority community. Given this background, the view that the Eastern Province belongs to Muslims has been slowly taking root among the Muslim polity for a long time. What many fail to see is that support for Palestine has been the basis for the penetration of Western and anti-Israel ideologies among Muslims in the Eastern Province of Sri Lanka. In October 2022, a local media outlet reported that India and Israel were planning to invest jointly in the development of the agriculture sector in the Eastern Province of Sri Lanka. This plan was immediately opposed by Muslims, who viewed Indian-Israeli involvement in Sri Lanka as a disaster. This opposition was based on the belief that Israel should not be allowed to enter a place that belongs to Muslims. The opportunity to engage with religious organizations in Islamic countries has created an environment conducive to the spread of Islamic extremist ideas in East Sri Lanka. Whenever jihadists gain prominence internationally or Islamic attacks on the United States and Israel occur, there is a celebratory spirit among Muslim groups in the Eastern Province. For instance, during al-Qaeda’s peak, Osama bin Laden’s translated speeches were distributed in some local mosques. All South Asian-based Jihadi groups endorsed Osama bin Laden’s global jihad declaration and regarded al-Qaeda as the vanguard of jihadism. The activities of jihadists from Gaza to Kashmir are indirectly celebrated among Muslim groups in East Sri Lanka. This has fostered a continuing environment of anti-Western and anti-Indian sentiment among the younger Muslim generation. It is within this context that the ideology of ISIS was able to easily penetrate Kattankudy in the Eastern part of Sri Lanka. Moulavi M.C. Zahran, considered the architect of the Easter attack, has long been involved in the spread of jihadism in Sri Lanka. In August 2009, local media reported that he was the Propaganda Secretary of the Kattankudy-based Thawheed group. This group follows the Wahabi school, named after Muhammed ibn Abd al-Wahab (1703-1792), described as the first modern Islamic fundamentalist. Against this backdrop, Kattankudy has become known as the island of Islamic life, a fertile ground for Wahhabi-Sufi confrontations in Sri Lanka. Wahhabi-influenced youth from Kattankudy began targeting Sufis, who practice a mystical form of Islam. Grenades were thrown, and swords were thrust, resulting in hundreds of Sufis being forced from their homes. A 2007 academic policy paper warned that violence by hardline Muslims against Sufis in Sri Lanka could eventually lead to armed movements in parts of the country. Some analysts incorrectly attribute the rise of Islamic fundamentalism in Sri Lanka to the failure of successive Sri Lankan governments to address the socio-cultural, political, and economic grievances of the affected communities. In reality, Muslims in Sri Lanka should not be viewed as a community oppressed by the majority Sinhalese. Instead, they should be recognized as a community that has economically thrived by capitalizing on the civil war. Muslim politicians have held powerful ministerial positions in every government, including the ministries of foreign affairs and justice. The roots of Islamic extremism in Sri Lanka should be understood within the context of the religious global bond among Muslims. There are groups that identify themselves as global Muslims rather than citizens of a single country. It is within this framework that their jihadist mentality should be examined. The Sri Lankan government failed to anticipate the potential rise of globally inspired Islamic fundamentalist groups during the civil war. By allowing the formation of Muslim Home Guards to counter Tamil separatist militancy, the government inadvertently created an opportunity for these fundamentalist groups. This environment facilitated their easy establishment and organization in the region. Consequently, the notion that the Eastern Province was their territory gradually took hold among Muslim extremist groups. This progression vividly illustrates how Wahhabi preaching evolved into ISIS-Sri Lanka. The Iran-aligned Yemen-based Houthi terrorist group’s recent attacks on commercial ships in the Red Sea exemplify how Islamic terrorism can serve as a proxy tool in geopolitical competition. Amidst global geopolitical rivalries, the rise of Islamic fundamentalist groups in Sri Lanka’s Eastern Province, a region of strategic investment for India—particularly the Trincomalee district—poses significant security concerns. This development threatens not only Sri Lanka’s security but also India’s national security. India’s longstanding security challenges with Pakistan are intricately linked to the broader transnational threat of terrorism. South Asia has already witnessed the emergence of new jihadist groups. According to sources, many of these militant groups in South Asia draw their guidelines from al-Qaeda’s ideology and tactics, despite many being Deobandis while al-Qaeda adheres to Takfiri-Salafism. Al-Qaeda popularized the notion of Ghazwa-e-Hind to capture the imagination and loyalty of South Asian jihadists. National Thowheeth Jama’ath (NTJ) in Sri Lanka, founded by Zaharan, and the rapidly growing Tamil Nadu Thoweed Jamath in southern India both aim to foment militant Islamic fundamentalism. These groups have maintained a relationship for over a decade, as noted by MEMRI, a Washington-based think tank on the Middle East. In this context, the growth of Islamic extremism in Sri Lanka is intrinsically linked to South Asia’s security landscape.

Pakistan’s Hostage-Rescue Failures Exposed As BLA Siege Ends In H...	Conflicting narratives and military missteps emerge from the Jaffar Express crisis in Balochistan. The recent hijacking of Pakistan's Jaffar Express by militants from the Baloch Liberation Army (BLA) has ended in tragedy, exposing serious flaws in Pakistan's military preparedness and counterterrorism capabilities. While Pakistani authorities quickly declared success in ending the siege, conflicting reports from militants and independent sources have cast serious doubts on the official version, indicating higher casualties and continuing insurgent resistance. On March 11, 2025, militants belonging to the Baloch Liberation Army (BLA), a separatist insurgent group seeking independence for Pakistan's Balochistan province, seized control of the Jaffar Express near the Mashkaf region in Balochistan. The attackers blew up railway tracks, derailing the train, which was carrying around 440 passengers from Quetta to Peshawar, and held hundreds hostage, including Pakistani security personnel. Initially, the BLA issued a demand for a prisoner exchange, threatening to execute hostages if Pakistani authorities failed to comply within 48 hours. In response, the Pakistani military launched a large-scale operation, employing both ground forces and airstrikes. By March 12, Pakistan's Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR), the military's media wing, declared the operation successfully concluded, stating all 33 insurgents had been killed, 21 passengers and four Pakistani Army personnel had died, and all hostages had been rescued. Yet, the BLA swiftly disputed this victory declaration. The insurgent group categorically rejected ISPR's claims, labelling them 'propaganda.' In an official statement, BLA spokesperson Jeeyand Baloch said, 'The claims made by the Pakistani army spokesperson are a failed attempt to cover up lies and defeat. The ground reality is that the battle continues on multiple fronts, and the enemy is suffering heavy casualties and military losses.' Independent media reports further exposed these contradictions. Reuters, citing security sources, reported only 155 hostages were rescued initially, leaving many passengers unaccounted for. Al Jazeera corroborated that several dozen hostages remained trapped even after the Pakistani military's claimed completion of operations. Reports emerging from Quetta, the capital of Balochistan, provided an even grimmer picture. Local sources indicated at least 200 coffins being prepared for Pakistani soldiers, sharply contradicting the official military casualty figures. Additionally, the BLA publicly stated that it executed 50 hostages after Pakistani authorities refused to negotiate a prisoner exchange—highlighting the tragic cost of the military's refusal to engage diplomatically with insurgents. Security experts have pointed out that Pakistan's premature declaration of victory has damaged its credibility despite unclear ground realities. Military analysts noted the complexity of this particular hostage situation, mainly due to the insurgents reportedly having suicide bombers among their ranks, posing significant challenges for rescue operations. Islamabad, known for projecting its omnipotent intelligence apparatus and substantial counterterrorism experience, was expected to conduct a swift and precise operation. However, operational delays of approximately 30 hours suggest hesitations and logistical gaps, raising doubts about the military's preparedness for such high-stakes missions. Notably, Pakistan's approach stands in contrast to global best practices in hostage rescue operations. For instance, India's National Security Guard (NSG), internationally recognised for its counterterrorism capabilities, emphasises rapid deployment, real-time intelligence integration, and precision tactics. During the 2008 Mumbai terror attacks, the NSG successfully rescued over 600 hostages in a heavily contested urban environment. Even India's Railway Protection Special Force, Commando for Railway Security (CORAS), specialises in handling hostage situations involving trains, highlighting operational deficiencies within Pakistan's elite Special Services Group (SSG). Moreover, the Pakistani authorities' swift declaration of victory, without independent verification, has undermined public trust and credibility domestically and internationally. Reports of ongoing clashes and accusations by insurgents suggest that the military's narrative was an attempt at controlling the information landscape rather than accurately depicting operational realities. The broader context of the Baloch insurgency highlights that the hijacking was not an isolated incident. Balochistan remains Pakistan's poorest yet most resource-rich province, with a long history of grievances over economic marginalisation, political suppression, and human rights abuses by state forces. The China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC), a multibillion-dollar infrastructure initiative, further intensified these grievances by excluding local Baloch populations from economic benefits, leading insurgent groups to increasingly target both Pakistani and Chinese personnel and assets. Since its formation in 2000, the BLA has evolved into a more potent threat. Notable attacks include the 2019 assault on Gwadar's Pearl Continental Hotel and the 2022 Karachi University suicide bombing targeting Chinese nationals. The group recently formed a unified structure under Baloch Raji Aajoi Sangar (BRAS), aiming to launch even more coordinated offensives against Pakistani forces. This crisis has prompted renewed attention to the underlying political issues in Balochistan. Former Balochistan chief minister Akhtar Mengal recently stated, 'There is not a single inch of Balochistan left where the government can claim authority. They have lost this war—completely and irreversibly.' Mengal's statement suggests the insurgency is evolving beyond the state's control. Human rights groups and analysts have urged Pakistan to adopt a political solution alongside military operations. History shows that purely military strategies in Balochistan have only exacerbated local resentments, fostering further insurgency. The international community, which has remained largely silent, is also urged to reassess its stance and advocate for peaceful political solutions rather than tacitly supporting a purely militaristic approach. As the immediate crisis surrounding the Jaffar Express siege concludes amid confusion and controversy, deeper questions linger about Pakistan's broader counterinsurgency strategy and its repeated reliance on military solutions. The government's unwillingness to negotiate, combined with the military's mishandling of the operation and conflicting public claims, reveals a troubling lack of transparency and readiness to protect its citizens effectively. If the Pakistani state continues to prioritise military force over political dialogue, experts warn that the violence will escalate further, perpetuating instability and putting civilians at even greater risk. The recent siege stresses the critical need for Pakistan to rethink its approach to counterinsurgency—balancing security measures with genuine political reconciliation and respect for human rights. Unless such reforms are implemented promptly, Balochistan is likely to remain a flashpoint of conflict where both civilians and soldiers continue to pay the ultimate price.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfPrqpqMnK6upjQa2cF4Wlj	2025-03-14T17:21:06-07:00	
Iran And The Price Of The ANC’s Nostalgia – Analysis	The African National Congress’ friendship with Tehran is becoming the main bugbear in US relations with South Africa. By Peter Fabricius Back in 2022 and 2023 after Russia invaded Ukraine and Pretoria refused to condemn Moscow, South Africa’s friendly relations with Russia were the most toxic in Western, especially United States’ (US) eyes. But US President Donald Trump has turned the world on its head by blaming Ukraine for allowing itself to be invaded, a position that aligns with Russia’s narrative about the war. Now South Africa’s ties with Iran are emerging as the most damaging to its relations with the US. Trump’s hostility to South Africa became official in an executive order terminating all US aid to the country, partly because of its new Expropriation Act but also because of South Africa’s International Court of Justice (ICJ) case against Israel, and its ‘[reinvigorated] relations with Iran to develop commercial, military, and nuclear arrangements.’ Pretoria has been trying to avoid a complete breakdown in its relationship with the US, largely to protect its lucrative duty-free access to the US market under the African Growth and Opportunity Act. The recent aid cuts also pose a significant risk to South Africa, especially its already ailing health sector. Despite this, the African National Congress (ANC) – the major partner in South Africa’s government of national unity – is actively promoting its good relations with Iran. Last week Nomvula Mokonyane, the ANC’s Deputy Secretary-General and Blade Nzimande, Minister of Science, Technology and Innovation, both separately hosted Iranian Ambassador to South Africa, Mansour Shakib Mehr, describing their relationship with Tehran as ‘warm and cordial.’ Despite US concerns and recent aid cuts, the ANC is actively promoting its good relations with Iran This undoubtedly added grist to the mills of South Africa’s many enemies in the US, who have had Pretoria’s relations with Iran in their sights for some time. The US embassy in Pretoria warned South Africa about possible sanctions when two Iranian warships docked in Cape Town in early 2023. South Africa’s relations with Iran came under scrutiny after the 7 October 2023 attack on Israel by Hamas, which Iran openly supports. On 22 October, South Africa’s then foreign minister Naledi Pandor visited Tehran and met then president Ebrahim Raisi. At the time, foreign affairs officials told ISS Today she had among other things, delivered an invitation from Ramaphosa to visit South Africa, but that the visit had been called off. And then in January 2024, the ANC – which had been flirting with insolvency for years – announced it had managed to stabilise its finances without explaining how. Just days earlier, South Africa had charged Israel with genocide in Gaza before the ICJ. The timing raised suspicions, and a few commentators opined that Iran had paid off the ANC for taking Israel to court. The ANC and government denied this. A Daily Maverick fact check found no evidence of a payoff but concluded that the charges could not be proven or disproven, largely because the ANC accounts were not public. The ANC also aroused suspicion by hosting Hamas leaders for a Palestinian solidarity convention in South Africa shortly after the group attacked Israel. The ANC often seems to invite suspicion about its dealings with Iran and Hamas. Statements by top ANC executive and Minister of Mineral and Petroleum Resources, Gwede Mantashe – just days after Trump cut aid to South Africa this year – are a good example. He said Iran and Russia were both welcome to bid for South Africa’s planned contract to build a nuclear reactor to add 2 500 megawatts to the electricity. Trump is overreacting to SA’s positions, but countries shouldn’t be surprised if they are judged by the company they keep Yet, as Isabel Bosman, a Researcher at the South African Institute of International Affairs (SAIIA), told ISS Today, Iran has no known capacity or track record of building nuclear power stations abroad. She said Iran had required Russian assistance even to build its own nuclear power station. The fact that the International Atomic Energy Agency warned this month that Tehran is moving closer to being able to build nuclear weapons, has not helped South Africa’s cause. Even though, as Bosman says, there’s no evidence of any nuclear cooperation between the two countries. Chrispin Phiri, Spokesperson for South Africa’s Minister of International Relations and Cooperation Ronald Lamola told ISS Today: ‘Regarding the baseless allegations of nuclear collaboration, we resolutely uphold the principle that nuclear weapons have no legitimate place in our shared future. South Africa remains unwavering in its dedication to international initiatives designed to curtail the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and their means of delivery.’ It appears that the ANC is just being true to an old struggle-era ally, as it does with Cuba, Venezuela and Russia. (Even if, as Ukraine points out, the ANC’s struggle ally was the USSR not Russia, and Ukraine was part of the USSR.) South Africa and Iran’s official relationship goes back to the dawn of democracy when a Joint Commission of Cooperation was formed in 1995, and has met regularly ever since. But as Steve Gruzd, Head of the African Governance and Diplomacy Programme at SAIIA notes, the ANC’s relationship with Iran is even older than that and ‘when the ANC makes a friend, it's almost a friend for life and all sins are forgiven thereafter…’. He told ISS Today the ANC had admired Iran since the 1979 revolution, and that it falls into the category of ANC friends that ‘are not popular in the West.’ Is the rest of South Africa paying too high a price for the ANC’s revolutionary nostalgia? Gruzd notes that South Africa has defended Iran at the United Nations for its right to run a nuclear programme for peaceful purposes. He also said that the South African cellphone provider MTN is heavily invested in Iran, with a 49% share in one of the main cellphone companies. Yet it’s clear that national economic interests do not drive the relationship as total trade between the two countries barely reached R300 million in 2023. It is curious that the ANC is so friendly with Hamas’ main sponsor and Hamas itself, which is dedicated to a one-state solution to the Israel-Palestine conflict. Officially, the ANC still supports a two-state solution and is closer to the Palestine Liberation Organization – the co-architect of the two-state solution – than to Hamas. Phiri observes that ‘The narrative framing South Africa’s relationship with Iran echoes the now-discarded narrative towards Russia. Take for example [US] Secretary [of State Marco] Rubio’s statement on Russia relations – it refers to 'a commitment to restore a respectful and constructive interstate dialogue with Russia'’. Phiri adds that ‘As a sovereign state, South Africa unequivocally reserves the right to engage in dialogue founded on mutual respect and constructive intent with any nation, in alignment with its principles and national interests.’ That is of course true. It is also true that Trump is grossly overreacting to South Africa’s actions and positions. But countries should not be surprised if they are judged by the company they keep. Iran sponsors Hamas and Hezbollah to attack Israel, supplies drones to Russia to attack Ukraine and appears to be close to building nuclear weapons. As with other old ANC chums like Russia, one has to ask whether the rest of South Africa is paying too high a price for the ANC’s revolutionary nostalgia.

Russian Influence Operations In Georgia: A Threat To Democracy An...	By Vasil Sikharulidze (FPRI) -- Russia’s influence operations in Georgia represent one of the Black Sea region’s most comprehensive hybrid warfare campaigns. The Kremlin has employed military intervention and territorial occupation, economic embargos, energy leverages, political co-optation, corruption, and information warfare. The Kremlin’s objective is clear: to undermine Georgia’s statehood and derail the country from its democratic and economic development and Euro-Atlantic integration path, as well as entrench Russian strategic dominance. While Russia’s military occupation of Abkhazia and Tskhinvali remains a direct challenge to Georgia’s sovereignty, Moscow has expanded its influence through political co-optation, economic dependency, and information warfare. In Georgia, Russia has penetrated the ruling elite, manipulated public discourse, and fostered internal divisions, allowing it to exert control without open military action but with deeply embedded instruments of influence. While Georgia has demonstrated strong public resistance to these efforts, the growing authoritarian tendencies of its ruling elites—aided by Russian interference—pose a severe risk to the country’s future. Security Dimension To understand Russia’s influence in Georgia, we must begin with the security dimension. In 2008, Russia launched an open military invasion of Georgia. Currently, in violation of the EU-mediated ceasefire, Russia continues to occupy 20 percent of Georgia’s territory, establishing permanent military bases in Abkhazia and Tskhinvali. This occupation is a deliberate instrument of coercion aimed at limiting Georgia’s strategic choices. One of Russia’s hybrid tactics is 'borderization'—the gradual shifting of the occupation line deeper into Georgian-controlled territory. This tactic fosters insecurity, keeps border communities under constant pressure, disrupts local economies, and tests Western reactions. However, Russia’s influence in Georgia extends far beyond military pressure. Since 2012, following the electoral victory of the Georgian Dream – Democratic Georgia Party (GD), founded by Bidzina Ivanishvili (a billionaire with deep ties to Russia), Georgia’s political alignment has gradually shifted as a result of Kremlin narratives and financial incentives. It has accelerated in recent years, most actively after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in 2022. What began as a 'normalization policy' with Russia has evolved into a systemic rollback of democratic institutions and growing alignment with Kremlin objectives. Eventually, it developed into a Kleptocratic authoritarian governance system that had many similarities to the Kremlin regime. Another key turning point came in 2023 when the European Union granted Georgia candidate status. Instead of embracing this historic opportunity, the ruling party reintroduced the Russian-style 'Foreign Agents’ law,' a measure designed to silence civil society and independent media. This move sparked massive protests that were met with brutality from the government. Yet the government doubled down on Kremlin-style rhetoric, accusing the West of orchestrating unrest and attempting to drug Georgia into the war with Russia. The GD party even came up with a unique conspiracy theory of the 'Global War Party,' framing all critics as part of this 'party' that was pushing Georgia towards war. GD has echoed Moscow’s narrative on the 2008 war, blaming past Georgian leaders instead of Russia. The Kremlin’s propaganda promotes appeasement as the path to stability while portraying the West as a disruptor. Economic Leverages Beyond security and politics, Russia maintains substantial economic leverage over Georgia through trade dependencies, energy supply, and penetration into Georgia’s financial System. Despite a trade embargo from Russia that started in 2006, Georgia had remarkable economic growth thanks to effective economic and governance reforms undertaken. Georgian exports to Russia resumed in 2013. Despite Georgia’s stated policy of economic diversification, trade data shows a steady increase in economic ties with Russia. Following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in 2022, the structure of Russian business activities in Georgia underwent significant changes. Large Russian enterprises were compelled to exit the market, leading to a rise in small and medium-sized enterprises. Given that 38 percent of foreign investments in Georgia originate from offshore zones, accurately assessing the extent of Russian oligarchic influence remains challenging. In 2022, Russian foreign direct investment in Georgia reached a record $105.6 million, followed by a slight decline to $103.3 million in 2023. This increase has raised concerns among policymakers regarding Georgia’s long-term economic sovereignty. A particularly notable trend is the surge in real estate acquisitions by Russian citizens, which grew by 115 percent between 2022 and 2023, raising concerns about financial penetration and long-term economic influence. In 2023, the officially recorded trade turnover between Georgia and Russia reached $2.39 billion—a 47 percent increase compared to 2021, the year before Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine. Russia’s share of Georgia’s total trade turnover fluctuated over the past three years, rising from 11.4 percent in 2021 to 13.1 percent in 2022 before declining to 11.2 percent in 2023. This increasing economic interdependence poses risks, particularly for Georgian manufacturers who face growing competition from Russian imports, which now constitute approximately 39 percent of Georgia’s total imports. Energy Dependence: A Strategic Vulnerability Georgia’s dependency on Russian natural gas remains very low—Georgia mainly relies on natural gas from Azerbaijan since the 2006 South Caucasus Pipeline (or the Baku-Tbilisi-Erzurum Pipeline). While Georgia receives natural gas from Azerbaijan, Russian pricing mechanisms remain opaque, raising concerns about potential energy coercion. However, Georgia has become heavily dependent on Russia for liquefied petroleum gas controlled by Moscow-backed enterprises. Furthermore, Georgia relies entirely on imported petroleum, and current trends show that Georgia is becoming more dependent on Russian oil products such as gasoline and diesel again, which wasn’t the case a few years ago. In 2023, Russian fuel imports declined by 11 percent ($70 million) due to supply disruptions, but overall, Georgia’s dependence on Russian petroleum has increased since 2021. One of the most concerning aspects of Georgia’s energy policy is the absence of a strategic gas reserve, which places the country at risk of severe supply disruptions. Despite receiving €120 million in funding from European institutions for the construction of a strategic reserve, the Georgian government redirected these funds during the COVID-19 pandemic, delaying the project until 2025. As a result, Georgia remains the only country in the region without a strategic gas storage facility, making it highly vulnerable to supply shocks and potential Russian coercion. Strategic Connectivity and the Anaklia Deep-Sea Port Georgia’s geostrategic position makes it a vital link between Europe and Central Asia, with great potential for strategic connectivity crucial for trade, energy, and transportation. By bypassing Russia, this network may reduce Moscow’s leverage over regional commerce and strengthen economic ties between Central Asia and Europe, contributing to EU energy security. The Anaklia Deep-Sea Port was designed to enhance Georgia’s role as a key transit hub, attract Western investment, and integrate the country into global supply chains. However, the GD government undermined the project by canceling contracts, delaying implementation, and handing it over to a Chinese firm. This move sidelined Western investment and raised concerns about Chinese and Russian influence over Georgia’s infrastructure. By obstructing Anaklia, the government weakened Georgia’s strategic connectivity, reinforcing economic dependencies that serve Moscow’s interests. The project’s failure highlights how political decisions, influenced by pro-Russian narratives and geopolitical pressures, continue to limit Georgia’s long-term economic potential. Soft Power: Intelligence & Propaganda Networks Russia has systematically invested in propaganda, disinformation, political influence, and intelligence penetration in Georgia. Beyond economic dependencies, Moscow has developed a multi-layered soft-power network designed to shape public discourse, foster pro-Kremlin sentiments, and undermine Georgia’s Euro-Atlantic integration. One of the key pillars of Russia’s influence strategy is disinformation and media control. Kremlin-backed media outlets, troll farms, and social media networks actively disseminate anti-Western narratives, portraying European and NATO integration as threats to Georgia’s sovereignty and traditional values. These efforts promote the notion that Russia is Georgia’s natural economic and security partner, reinforcing dependence on Moscow. The penetration of these narratives extends beyond media platforms into Georgia’s political landscape, where the GD political class echoes Kremlin rhetoric opposing NATO and EU integration. A particularly concerning development is the role of the GD party in advancing anti-Western narratives. Over time, the ruling party has cultivated a distinctly anti-American and anti-European political rhetoric that closely mirrors Kremlin propaganda. GD leaders and affiliated media outlets routinely claim that the West seeks to destabilize Georgia, interfere in its domestic affairs, and push the country into war with Russia. These accusations, similar to narratives promoted by Russian state media, serve to discredit Georgia’s Western allies and undermine public support for European and NATO integration. The party has also employed fear-based messaging by portraying Western engagement as a direct threat to Georgia’s sovereignty while simultaneously advocating for 'sovereign democracy'—a concept aligned with Moscow’s ideological framework, which rejects Western democratic models in favor of state-controlled governance. Moscow has also cultivated an extensive network of non-governmental organizations and intelligence-linked entities to advance its strategic objectives. Investigative reports indicate that at least tens of pro-Russian organizations operate in Georgia, engaging in activities that whitewash Moscow’s aggression, downplay the occupation of Georgian territories, and propagate anti-Western propaganda. These organizations not only shape public opinion but serve as instruments for intelligence gathering, political lobbying, and electoral interference. The depth of Russian influence within Georgia’s political elite was starkly revealed in April 2024 when Ivanishvili claimed that Russia’s invasions of Georgia and Ukraine were orchestrated by a 'Global War Party' in the West. Similarly, statements from Prime Minister Irakli Kobakhidze suggesting that external forces control the United States and the European Union further illustrate the extent to which Kremlin-aligned narratives have been internalized within the ruling establishment. These statements reflect a broader effort to shift public opinion away from Western integration and to normalize closer ties with Moscow. Beyond political and media influence, Russia uses economic and financial tools to expand its presence in Georgia. State-controlled businesses serve strategic interests, while covert funding supports pro-Russian parties, civil groups, and media outlets that amplify Kremlin propaganda. These resources also fuel electoral interference, shaping Georgia’s political trajectory. In the digital sphere, Russian troll factories and media networks manipulate public perception, particularly during elections. They discredit Western alliances, promote pro-Kremlin narratives, and compete with national broadcasters. The GD party and its affiliates play a key role in this information warfare, pushing anti-Western rhetoric, revisionist history on the 2008 war, and policies that weaken Georgia’s Euro-Atlantic ties. The 2024 Elections and Public Protests The October 26, 2024, parliamentary elections marked a major setback for Georgia’s democracy. Independent observers, including the International Society for Fair Elections and Democracy, the Georgian Young Lawyers’ Association, and international monitors, documented widespread electoral fraud, including voter intimidation, ballot stuffing, vote secrecy breaches, and suppression of election observers. Despite clear evidence of fraud, the Central Election Commission declared GD victorious with 54 percent, an outcome immediately rejected by opposition parties, civil society, and international observers. While the European Union and United States refused to recognize the results, Russia and other pro-Kremlin leaders endorsed them, reinforcing Georgia’s political shift toward Moscow. Mass protests erupted, now lasting for over eighty-five consecutive days, making them one of Georgia’s longest-running resistance movements. The government responded with Kremlin-style repression, including brutal police crackdowns with mass detentions and arrests, beating and torturing detainees, and smear campaigns labeling protesters as 'foreign agents.' In a further escalation, Ivanishvili’s regime enacted draconian legislation that violates fundamental rights, including freedom of assembly, expression, and due process. It also uses financial pressure as a tool of political suppression. Just one example is the weaponization of financial penalties against protesters. Authorities introduced harsh new fines of 5,000 GEL—a crippling sum in a country where the average pension is 350 GEL and salaries average 1,000 GEL. More than fifty political prisoners remain detained while a politically controlled judiciary rubber-stamps these penalties. By criminalizing peaceful protest, the GD consolidates its authoritarian rule, erodes democratic norms, and distances Georgia from its European aspirations. Despite repression, public resistance remains strong, marking a defining moment in Georgia’s democratic struggle. Georgia stands at a crossroads, facing a choice between preserving its sovereignty and the Euro-Atlantic path or falling deeper under Moscow’s influence. The resilience of the Georgian people and international support will be critical in shaping its future. Russia’s influence strategy in Georgia is comprehensive, integrating political, economic, and informational tools to weaken sovereignty and entrench dependence. By portraying closer ties with Moscow as necessary for stability, the Kremlin aims to consolidate its regional dominance. Georgia’s subordination is central to Russia’s broader revisionist ambitions in the South Caucasus. The Global Danger of Russian Influence Operations Russia’s hybrid warfare—propaganda, disinformation, corruption, and political subversion—extends far beyond Georgia. These tactics target democratic societies worldwide, eroding trust in institutions and manipulating political discourse. The same elite capture, economic coercion, and divisive narratives used in Georgia are actively deployed against Europe and North America. This challenge does not require military confrontation: It works silently, destabilizing democracies from within. Western nations have already faced election interference, cyber-attacks, and disinformation campaigns designed to fragment societies and weaken strategic cohesion. Addressing this threat demands urgent, coordinated action from NATO, the European Union, and democratic allies. Strengthening resilience, transparency, and counter-disinformation efforts is essential. Georgia’s experience is a warning: If left unchecked, Russia’s tactics will be replicated elsewhere. Now is the time for proactive engagement, strategic countermeasures, and a firm commitment to defending democratic integrity globally.

Russia Plans To Turn Belarus Into Launching Pad For Intermediate-...	By Alexander Taranov On December 6, 2024, during a meeting of the Supreme State Council of the Union State in Minsk, Russian President Vladimir Putin announced the deployment of the Oreshnik intermediate-range ballistic missile (IRBM) (Kremlin.ru, December 6, 2024). This deployment is planned for the second half of 2025 on Belarusian territory. As in the case of the deployment of Russian tactical nuclear weapons in Belarus, this decision was purportedly made in response to a request from Belarusian President Alyaksandr Lukashenka (Belta.by, January 26). Putin justified his decision by referencing Russia’s obligations under the Treaty on Security Guarantees within the Union State, positioning it as a measure to ensure Belarus’s security against potential North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) aggression (see EDM, February 12, 13). In March 2023, Lukashenka mentioned the possibility of Russian strategic missile systems being placed in Belarus. He stated that discussions were ongoing with the Kremlin regarding the potential deployment of Russian strategic nuclear weapons, specifically the RT-2PM2 Topol-M ground-based missile systems (GBMS) (President of the Republic of Belarus, March 31, 2023). In April 2023, Belarusian Armed Forces undertook first measures to restore and modernize Soviet-era infrastructure in Brest oblast, specifically the launch sites for the RT-2PM Topol GBMS (Telegram/@modmilby, April 23, 2023; (Telegram/@Hajun_BY, April 24, 2023). Belarusian officials have indicated that Minsk still lacks complete information about the specific parameters and plan of Russia’s deployment of the Oreshnik missile system (MS) in Belarus. For instance, Lukashenka instructed the General Staff of the Armed Forces of Belarus to facilitate the deployment of the Russian Oreshnik MS in the country and carefully plan its combat use. According to Chief Major General Pavel Muraveiko, however, the Belarusian side has not been informed about the number of Oreshnik MS launchers that Russia will deploy in Belarus. Only the President of Russia knows this (Belta.by, December 12, 2024). Representatives of the top military-political leadership are addressing public concerns about this decision, which increases military dependence on Russia and affects Belarus’s sovereignty. In response, Lukashenka denied that Belarus is losing sovereignty to Russia. Contrary to his latest moves, he specifically stated that there is no 'Russian occupation' of Belarus and that such a situation will not occur as long as he remains the leader of the country (Reform.news, December 10, 2024; see EDM, February 12, 13). Deputy Chief of the General Staff of the Armed Forces of Belarus, Colonel Sergei Lagodzyuk, explains the decision to deploy the Oreshnik MS as a response to the deployment of similar U.S. medium-range weapons in Europe, the militarization of the region, Russia’s war against Ukraine, as well as an information campaign 'launched against Belarus to discredit the authorities and the leadership of the country to create conditions for the emergence or provocation of conflicts' ( Belta.by, December 12, 2024). The military-political leadership of Belarus believes that the MSs will produce a deterrent effect, such as nuclear weapons already on Belarusian territory, and will become a serious obstacle to potential aggression from NATO (Ministry of Defense of the Republic of Belarus, December 7, 2024). The commander of Russia’s Strategic Missile Forces, Colonel General Sergei Karakaev, explained that the Russian military command is only working on a decision to create new formations of the Strategic Missile Forces for a new medium-range missile system (TASS, December 16, 2024). The Oreshnik MS will be part of the Strategic Missile Forces of the Russian Armed Forces (RAF). In the event of deployment on the territory of Belarus, these systems will also be subordinate to the Main Staff of the RAF Strategic Missile Forces and/or the Joint Command of the Regional Troops Grouping (RTG) of Russia and Belarus, in which the Russian side dominates in the decision-making process, and the Belarusian side only has the right to an advisory vote (see EDM, February 3, 13). Lukashenka himself claims that, by agreement with Moscow, the military-political leadership of Belarus will select the targets for strikes with the Oreshnik MS (Belta.by, December 10, 2024; see EDM, February 3). He also stated that the military of the RAF will only service and carry out launches on certain targets, while and until Russian specialists train Belarusian military personnel (Belta.by, December 12, 2024). He also publicly confirmed the involvement of Belarus in the creation of this system, in particular the provision of chassis for its launchers manufactured by the Minsk Wheel Tractor Plant, or MZKT. In his words, Belarus needs 'only missiles' from Russia, and Belarus will allegedly create the chassis and launchers itself (Belta.by, December 10, 2024). Specifically, in the first nine months of 2024, MZKT sent 36 railcars with equipment and components to the Federal Research and Production Center 'Titan-Barricady' (Volgograd), one of co-producers of the Oreshnik MS (Telegram/@Hajun_BY, November 22, 2024). Some Russian military experts estimate that it is preferable to launch the Oreshnik IRBMs from locations in Belarus that are protected from a direct disarming strike. The areas around the cities of Mogilev and Bobruisk in Mogilev oblast are considered suitable for its deployment due to adequate forests, low population density, existing airfields, roads, railways, air defense coverage, and proximity to the Russian border. Consequently, it will be challenging for U.S. ATACMS to target these locations. Deploying the Oreshnik IRBM further west, however, could be risky, as the missiles would become vulnerable to enemy air defense systems during their initial flight trajectory. According to Russian military experts, 8–12 launchers of Oreshnik MS can be placed at two sites, which is equivalent to a full-fledged missile regiment of the Russian Strategic Missile Forces (Topcor.ru, December 17, 2024). Another potential site for the deployment of the Oreshnik MS may be the village of Cheretyanka in Gomel oblast, where the abandoned base of the 369th missile regiment of the Strategic Missile Forces was located during Soviet times. A delegation of the RTG Joint Command visited it in June 2022 with an unclear inspection. In Soviet times, the RSD-10 Pioneer missile system and the RT-2PM Topol strategic missile system were based on it. Near and on the base’s territory, there is all the necessary infrastructure, including a platform for unloading nuclear missiles, a railway, boiler houses, barracks and warehouses, although in poor condition (Telegram/@Hajun_BY, June 12, 2022). Considering these infrastructural requirements for the deployment, it can be assumed that in Mogilev oblast, Oreshnik can be placed in areas between Chausy, Krichev and Cherikov, on one hand, as well as Krichev, Bykhov, and Kirovsky, on the other. This deployment seems to be based on the assumption that Ukraine will not strike these targets. Practically, however, the Ukrainian Armed Forces can easily destroy Oreshnik IRBMs in those areas (The Kyiv Independent, November 24, 2024). Lukashenka confirmed on December 26 that he wants to receive 10 units of the Oreshnik IRBM from Russia and deploy them closer to the Smolensk oblast of Russia, which borders Belarus (Reform.news, December 26, 2024, January 26). References to Russia’s neighboring regions likely concern Russian Strategic Missile Forces’ combat duty crews operating in Belarus, frequently changing routes and positions. Permanent deployment points may appear in Russia’s Smolensk oblast, while temporary deployment points could be set up in Belarus’s Mogilev and Gomel oblasts. The deployment of the Oreshnik IRBMs, even in the Mogilev oblast, does not guarantee bypassing the U.S./NATO missile defense systems in Redzikowo, Poland and Deveselu, Romania in the SM-3 Block IIA version (NATO, July 10, 2024). The direct distance from Mogilev to these facilities is 850 kilometers (530 miles) and 1,170 kilometers (730 miles), respectively. There is only one military scenario for using the Oreshnik IRBMs from the territory of Belarus. This scenario involves the preemptive destruction of U.S./NATO missile defense bases in Poland and Romania as a result of a massive missile attack and/or the use of tactical nuclear weapons to destroy them. After that, the Oreshnik IRBMs can be used from the territory of Belarus against targets in Europe without the threat of interception by missile defense systems. Such a scenario is possible if Russian leadership designs plans for a vertical escalation of the conflict with Ukraine to a regional war with NATO in the European theater of war. For this reason, Russia plans to expand the tactical nuclear weapon carrier supply to Belarus. In particular, since June 2024, two new hangars have been built on the territory of military unit No 12147 in Osipovichi—where the 465th Missile Brigade of the Armed Forces of Belarus is located—for the new Iskander-M operational-tactical missile systems. In size and appearance, the hangars are similar to those shelters for the MS, built here two years ago (Svaboda.org, June 7, 2024). The missile brigade itself is located 12 kilometers (7.5 miles) from one of the alleged locations for Russian tactical nuclear weapons in the Balshaya Garozha village on the territory of the 1405th Artillery Ammunition Base (see EDM, April 30, 2024). Each of the hangars can accommodate 12 combat vehicles. In February 2024, Lukashenka mentioned that there were already two battalions of the Iskander-M MS in Belarus (RIA Novosti, February 20, 2024). Construction activities testify that a new missile brigade armed with the Iskander-M MS will be formed in Belarus. In this case, the total number of tactical nuclear weapon carrier launchers will reach 12 units in the near future in the missile brigade (Belarusinfocus.pro, June 9, 2024). At the same time, the Russian military-industrial complex is already modifying missiles for this system with a range of up to 1,000 kilometers (621 miles) (Militaryrussia.ru, July 24, 2024). In this regard, Putin also mentioned Belarus regarding additional deliveries of long-range missile weapons and speculated about Russia’s right to supply similar weapons to the West’s opponents (TASS, June 7, 2024). By the end of 2025, Russia will additionally deploy missile systems with a maximum range of 1,000 to 6,000 kilometers (621 to 3,728 miles) on the territory of Belarus. It is not ruled out that an additional batch of Iskander-M as well as Oreshnik missile systems will also arrive in Belarus in connection with preparations for the Zapad-2025 strategic maneuvers and will remain permanently there, as it happened after the Soyuznaya Reshimost-2022 exercise (Interfax.ru, May 10, 2022; see EDM, November 7, November 18, 2024). The deployment of such systems so close to NATO’s eastern flank, a potential theater of operations, indicates that Russia and Belarus are preparing for scenarios of preemptive missile strikes against critical, military and logistical infrastructure in Europe both in conventional and nuclear versions. Investments in advanced missile defense and long-range strike capabilities by Ukraine and NATO could mitigate the threats coming from Russian missile systems’ deployment in Belarus.

Syria’s Hayat Tahrir Al-Sham: The Jungle And The Leopard – OpEd	By Fernando Carvajal Events in Syria continue to evolve at lightspeed. In December 2024, regional and Western governments rushed to engage the new al-Qaeda-affiliated Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) government, which is supported by NATO member Turkey. Jubilation intoxicated the general population and the diaspora following the anticlimactic fall of the Assad regime. Nearly three months later, the honeymoon has run its course and the jungle holds on to the spots. After the regressive series of events following the US withdrawal from Afghanistan, regional and Western powers wait to see if the HTS government leaders can truly change their spots, as they traded fatigues for designer suits. The region has witnessed the chaos following the fall of notorious Iraqi President Saddam Hussein and most recently the rise of the Taliban in Afghanistan. In both cases, the region experienced a series of events where al-Qaeda and ISIS gained a lifeline, and women and minorities suffered from tremendous regressive policies under corrupt and extremist regimes. Damascus, the first Arab capital governed by self-made extremists listed as terrorists by the international community, surfaced as a unique case. In contrast to other extremist groups, HTS leaders immediately launched a well-coordinated 'charm offensive' and presented themselves as statesmen, surrounded by a jungle of militants marginalized by the victors, and away from the spoils. HTS leaders and their patrons aim to convince the world they’ve changed their spots. Can the jungle let it last? This is a loaded question. First, the international community must wait and see where the approach to de-radicalization since the September 11 attacks failed and the revolutionary spirit achieves change. The world waits to see the difference between al-Qaeda ideologues and their former hosts: the Taliban and ISIS. The experiment also raises the stakes for the Muslim Brotherhood — can it succeed in Damascus where it failed in Cairo? Damascus and the jungle On January 29, 2025, the HTS leadership gathered to confirm Abu Mohammed al-Jawlani (now Ahmed al-Shar’a) during a symbolic bay’a — Islamic oath of allegiance to a leader — summit in Damascus. Civilian and military loyalists gathered to consolidate the image of the State, but this was as much a message to rival Islamist factions as it was to international audiences. Under overt guidance and with material support from Turkey, the HTS government moved quickly to address a major obstacle to international legitimacy, removal from terrorist lists by the United States, European Union and United Nations. The new rulers in Damascus also need to consolidate authority and power over rival factions, ethnic minority groups, former regime remnants and hostile neighbors like Iran, Iraq and Israel. While HTS does not yet control all of Syria’s territory, it is relying on an extensive network of Islamist militants to deter fragmentation. Jawlani’s chess game smartly moved toward Iraq, where it hosted a meeting with former enemies in neighboring intelligence services. The meeting with Hamid al-Shatri, Head of the Iraqi National Intelligence Service, aimed to mend fences from Jawlani’s ISIS days. It also sought to strengthen the rear front to prevent new incursions by Iran-affiliated militias and elements of Lebanon’s Hezbollah paramilitary group. By meeting with Iraqi intelligence rather than diplomats, Jawlani signaled a merging of interests with Turkey. More interesting, and of higher risk for HTS, has been the reported collaboration with the US. A US State Department delegation visited Damascus in late December 2024. Soon after, a report emerged of possible intelligence sharing between Washington and HTS leadership. The meeting with Iraq officials and sharing of intelligence with the US seems like a carrot from Turkey to sweeten up the deal with Damascus. US strikes against ISIS and al-Qaeda elements serve Jawlani’s interests as much as the West’s. Members of jihadist groups from the jungle resisting Jawlani’s authority may turn on Damascus, derail HTS governance and attract negative attention. Enemies inside and outside pose as much threat as the inability to govern a highly diverse Syrian environment. HTS’s move from a jihadist militant group to a government entity complicates funding. Damascus no longer must simply fund a patronage network of jihadists. As a central government, HTS must provide costly services beyond the center, beyond security. Collection of taxes beyond their safe haven in the city of Idlib is no longer a model, neither are 'extortion, kidnapping and oil-smuggling … [or] at least $94 million from prisoner-exchange deals with the Syrian government, Iran, Lebanon and Italy.' Damascus needs a deal with Kurds for access to oil supplies. This requires a delicate balance as Turkey lies in the middle of an agreement with them. Can the leopard change its spots? Just as Afghanistan under the Taliban, the potential for Syria to surface as a new safe haven for jihadist militants is a primary concern for the region and the West. Every militant group is bound to experience a struggle for power, and Jawlani is at the center. As he switches from jihadist field commander to head of state, he must guard his generals as much as rivals among militant factions beyond the center. It is still unclear how power will project beyond the core. Likewise, no one knows what role Jawlani’s loyalists will play. Security and State revenue beyond Damascus will undoubtedly depend on stability in areas with Shia, Druze, Kurdish and Yazidi populations. Relations with minority groups will test the ability to govern and the degree to which Islamist extremists can change their spots. Jawlani has spoken the magic words for the West and pointed to elections being held around five years from now.

Trump’s Presidential Diplomacy Is Surging – OpEd	The US President Donald Trump by far outstrips any of his predecessors in post-cold war era in the transparency of his foreign policy agenda and in his attempt to connect the public opinion with his America First ideology. Trump’s presidential diplomacy depends heavily on his media briefings, which have become a daily occurrence and are an absolute ‘must’ for any serious analyst or observer of world affairs. Trump’s press conference at the White House on Thursday during the visit of the NATO secretary-general Mark Rutte stood out for the following signposts in the US foreign policy agenda that he planted in a 48-minute event alone. One. Whereas the expectation was that Rutte’s visit was just the right occasion for Trump to bring the western alliance to the centre stage of his foreign policy and reclaim the leadership of the transatlantic alliance 'to project American power' (Rutte’s words), he was instead simply uninterested in NATO — although Rutte praised him sky-high for his contribution to making the alliance a 'strong' organisation by boosting its budget. Two. On the contrary, Trump spoke at length on the Ukraine peace process and expressed hope that the war is ending, taking even a swipe at NATO for having squandered its budget wastefully under the Biden presidency by intervening in a war that should not have happened. By the way, Rutte is known to be a super hawk on Russia (which actually inspired President Biden to handpick him for the present job late last year.) Rutte was a prominent fixture in the family photos of the recent string of EU summits that were pioneered by French President Emmanuel Macron to choreograph the future trajectory of the Ukraine war against the backdrop of the perceived US retrenchment in Europe, Three. Trump taunted Rutte openly by proposing that the latter could be 'instrumental' in his hugely controversial foreign policy venture to annex Greenland, which Denmark, a NATO country, claims as its integral part. Trump severely questioned the basis of the claim by Denmark to Greenland. Rutte tried to change the topic but Trump would have none of it and reminded him of NATO’s 'relevance'. To be sure, NATO finds itself like a cat on a hot tin roof if Trump’s strong hint of a likely boost in the US troop deployment in its two existing bases in Greenland goes ahead which will be tantamount to an annexation by military means, something Denmark will be hardly in a position to counter. Trump spoke in the presence of Vice-President JD Vance and Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth. Four. Trump point blank rejected the narrative that Russia posed a military threat to Europe and that Russian victory in Ukraine will encourage Moscow to attack European states. Arguably, Trump’s ‘nyet’ not only knocks the bottom out of the legitimacy of the NATO and Europe’s intervention in Ukraine but also casts doubts on the raison d’être of the NATO. (Earlier in his remarks, Rutte had spoken forcefully of the imperative need to swiftly build up Europe’s defence industry to meet the Russian threat.) Five. Trump hinted that he may resume talks with North Korean leader Kim Jong-Un, which he began in the first term but got derailed as his presidency increasingly came under siege from the deep state and the neocon lobby with the support of the Democratic Party. A resumption of the US-DPRK talks can potentially realign the security alliance matrix in Northeast Asia and impact the US’ Indo-Pacific strategy on the whole. Six. Most important, Trump disclosed that much serious discussion had been taking place with Ukraine, including on the seemingly intractable territorial issues and the future status of the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Station in southeastern Ukraine, which is the largest nuclear power plant in Europe and among the 10 largest in the world, and has been under Russian control since 2022. Trump said, 'We’ve been discussing land with Ukraine… pieces of land that would be kept and lost and all of the other elements of a final agreement. You know, we’ve been discussing concepts of land because you don’t want to waste time with a ceasefire if it’s not going to mean anything, They discussed (in Jeddah) NATO and being in NATO, and everybody knows what the answer to that is. They’ve known that answer for 40 years, in all fairness.' Trump seemed to suggest that conditions have been created for holding serious negotiations with Russia going forward. Trump spoke with great deliberation in Rutte’s presence, knowing that European capitals would be keenly listening. Suffice to say, Trump has left the US’ European allies in no doubt that he is the new sheriff in town and there are no two ways about it. Trump has shown no interest in Western troop deployment in Ukraine; nor does he envisage any European participation in the US-Russia dialogue. Trump sees this as a deal between him and Putin and sounded confident that Russia’s concerns can be properly addressed. However, it is doubtful whether the Russian side also sees the situation in such binary terms. If Putin’s address to the Russian Foreign Ministry last June (spelling out the conditions to be fulfilled before talks commenced) is applied as the yardstick today, there is a long winding road ahead. Indeed, there is much scepticism in Moscow even about Ukraine’s sudden turnaround on ceasefire. Russians see it as a tactical ploy to wriggle out of the devastating rout that thousands of its elite troops are facing in Kursk at the moment, and nothing more. At the press conference, Trump touched on Putin’s statement on March 13 and said that the latter 'put out a very promising statement, but it wasn’t complete. And, yeah, I’d love to meet with him or talk to him.' Trump’s special envoy, Steve Witkoff met Putin on Thursday to discuss the results of US-Ukraine talks in Saudi Arabia earlier this week and to relay Moscow’s position back to Washington. based on Witkoff’s feedback from Moscow, Trump has since written on Truth Social, 'We had very good and productive discussions with President Vladimir Putin of Russia yesterday, and there is a very good chance that this horrible, bloody war can finally come to an end — BUT, AT THIS VERY MOMENT, THOUSANDS OF UKRAINIAN TROOPS ARE COMPLETELY SURROUNDED BY THE RUSSIAN MILITARY, AND IN A VERY BAD AND VULNERABLE POSITION. I have strongly requested to President Putin that their lives be spared. This would be a horrible massacre, one not seen since World War II. God bless them all!!!' In televised remarks later, Putin responded to Trump’s ‘demarche’ regarding the fate of Ukrainian troops. He said, 'We are sympathetic to President Trump’s call. If they lay down their arms and surrender, they will be guaranteed life and dignified treatment.' Trump had stated during the press conference yesterday that the US has already discussed many details of a potential 'final agreement' with Kiev and is now waiting to see 'whether or not Russia is there.' Apparently, Trump is conveying the impression that the latest signal from Witkoff’s meeting last night with Putin is that Russia is coming on board. However, appearances can be deceptive in such situations of smoke and mirrors in international diplomacy. A close reading of Putin’s statement of March 13 reveals that while Russia is, in principle, open to the US’ call for ceasefire, Moscow has serious reservations, and several questions remain to be answered. The ball is, arguably, in Trump’s court now, contrary to Washington’s facile argument. Suffice to say, the US-Russia dialogue appears to be at an inflection point.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfPrqpqMnK6uszy4Mi_i3JL	2025-03-14T17:12:31-07:00	
Kra Canal: The Impossible Dream Of Southeast Asia Shipping – Anal...	By Paulo Aguiar The idea of the Kra Canal has been a topic of discussion for centuries, as the promise of an alternative route between the Andaman Sea and Gulf of Thailand could revolutionize shipping and reshape regional geopolitics. While the project has never come to fruition, its potential impact keeps it in strategic conversations, particularly in light of China’s expanding influence in Southeast Asia and the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI). As of now, Thailand has opted for a different path, but debates over the canal’s feasibility and geopolitical consequences remain very much alive. Historical Background The concept of the Kra Canal dates back to 1677 when Thai King Narai commissioned French engineer de Lamar to survey the Kra Isthmus for a possible canal. At the time, the idea was not to connect the Gulf of Thailand with the Andaman Sea but rather to establish a navigable waterway between Songkhla and Marid (now Myanmar). De Lamar’s assessment concluded that the mountainous terrain, dense jungles, and the technological limitations of the era rendered the project unfeasible. The immense effort required to dig through the isthmus using 17th-century engineering methods made construction virtually impossible, leading to its abandonment. In the 19th century, as European colonial powers expanded their influence in Southeast Asia, the concept of the Kra Canal resurfaced. The British, who controlled key maritime trade routes through Singapore and the Strait of Malacca, viewed any alternative shipping channel with suspicion. They feared that a canal through Thailand would weaken Singapore’s strategic importance and threaten British dominance in regional trade. Meanwhile, France, eager to strengthen its presence in Indochina, saw the canal as a way to establish a stronger foothold in the region and counterbalance British influence. However, the Siamese government, wary of foreign intervention and territorial disputes, strategically resisted both British and French involvement. By carefully balancing diplomatic relations with European powers while preserving its sovereignty, Siam managed to prevent any progress on the canal during this period. Kra Canal in the Contemporary Context The Kra Canal attracted renewed interest in 1972 when an American firm, Tippetts-Abbett-McCarthy-Stratton (TAMS), proposed a 102-km-long canal connecting Satun to Songkhla. This proposal was driven by the need for an alternative shipping route to alleviate congestion in the Malacca Strait and provide a more direct maritime passage between the Indian Ocean and the South China Sea. The plan involvedadvanced engineering techniques of the time, envisioning a deep-water canal capable of handling large cargo vessels and oil tankers. However, with a projected cost of $5.6 billion and a projected 10–12 year construction period, the Thai government ultimately rejected the plan. Concerns included the massive financial burden, environmental impact, and the risk of regional instability, particularly stemming from foreign influence and internal security challenges. More recently, China has become increasingly interested in reviving the project as part of its Maritime Silk Road initiative, a key component of its Belt and Road Initiative (BRI). In 2015, an MoU was signed between private entities from China and Thailand to explore the feasibility of the canal, highlighting its potential to reshape trade routes and reduce reliance on the Malacca Strait. However, both governments quickly distanced themselves from the agreement, likely due to political sensitivities and opposition from regional players like Singapore and India. The canal never progressed beyond preliminary discussions. As of 2025, Thailand has instead opted to prioritize a $28 billion land bridge project—an overland transport corridor designed to facilitate cargo movement between the Gulf of Thailand and the Andaman Sea. This alternative aims to achieve similar economic benefits without the political and environmental challenges posed by a canal, making it a more viable and strategically balanced solution. Geopolitical Stakes Why the Kra Canal Matters If constructed, the Kra Canal would provide a strategic alternative to the Strait of Malacca, reducing shipping distances by approximately 1,200 nautical miles. This shortcut would save fuel costs, cut transit times, and ease congestion in the Strait of Malacca, which currently handles nearly 94,000 vessel passages annually. As global trade continues to expand, particularly in energy and container shipping, the demand for efficient and secure maritime routes is higher than ever. The canal would create an additional passage, reducing bottlenecks and alleviating concerns about over-reliance on a single trade route. China, as the world’s largest trading nation, would stand to benefit immensely by reducing its reliance on the Malacca Strait for energy imports and trade. Currently, approximately 80% of China’s oil imports pass through the Malacca Strait, making it a critical vulnerability in times of geopolitical tensions. Diversifying maritime routes through the Kra Canal could enhance China’s energy security, providing an alternative supply chain for crude oil and liquefied natural gas (LNG) imports from the Middle East and Africa. China-US Competition For China, the Kra Canal would address its 'Malacca dilemma'—the vulnerability of its maritime trade routes to potential blockades by rival naval forces, particularly the United States. A hypothetical China-controlled canal would enhance Beijing’s control over its supply chain and maritime security, while boosting its geopolitical influence in the region. Notably, the canal would enable China to establish a stronger presence in the Indian Ocean, allowing the PLA Navy greater operational flexibility and enhancing its ability to protect critical sea lanes. The United States and its allies, particularly Singapore and India, oppose the canal’s construction owing in large part to these geopolitical considerations. A China-dominated Kra Canal could reduce Singapore’s significance as a shipping hub, potentially diminishing its economic and strategic value. Singapore, which benefits heavily from transshipment fees and trade facilitation, would likely experience economic losses if traffic were diverted to a new canal. India, which has growing concerns over China’s increasing influence in the Indian Ocean, sees the Kra Canal as another strategic asset that could strengthen China’s maritime footprint near its sphere of influence. As a countermeasure, Washington is supporting Thailand’s land bridge project, which offers an alternative trade corridor without directly benefiting China’s strategic interests. The land bridge project, consisting of highways, rail networks, and deep-sea ports, provides a non-maritime alternative for trade while maintaining the regional balance of power. The United States has also increased maritime cooperation with Thailand, Indonesia, and the Philippines to ensure the continued security and open accessibility of the Malacca Strait. Regional Impacts For Thailand, the Kra Canal presents both opportunities and challenges. Economically, it could transform the country into a key logistics hub, generating substantial revenue from transit fees, port services, and related industries. By cutting travel distances for major shipping routes, the canal could increase direct investment in Thailand’s maritime infrastructure and create thousands of new jobs in shipping, trade, and logistics. The long-term economic benefits could help Thailand strengthen its position as a regional powerhouse in maritime commerce. However, from a stability standpoint, the canal threatens to divide Thailand geographically, reinforcing separatist movements in the south. The country has long struggled with separatist tensions in its southern provinces, and a canal physically splitting the nation could exacerbate these internal divisions. There are also concerns about foreign control or heavy foreign investment in the canal project, particularly if China were to play a dominant role in its financing and construction. Such involvement would inevitably spark concerns over sovereignty, with the canal potentially becoming an extension of China’s influence in the region. Additionally, the project would disrupt existing maritime economies, particularly in Singapore and Malaysia, which have consistently opposed its development due to fears of economic losses. The canal’s success would depend on the extent to which it diverts shipping away from traditional routes. If global shipping companies find it more cost-effective and efficient to use the new passage, Singapore’s role as a regional shipping hub could decline, prompting diplomatic tensions and resistance from ASEAN partners. Given these economic and political complexities, Thailand must carefully weigh its options. Kra Canal: A Reality Check Despite its apparent advantages, the Kra Canal comes with a host of economic, environmental, and security concerns. The latest estimated construction cost has ballooned to $30 billion, making financial feasibility a major hurdle. Beyond the initial investment, maintenance costs and the need for continuous dredging due to sediment buildup would add to long-term expenditures. Additionally, securing international financing could be challenging, especially considering the canal’s geopolitical implications and potential opposition from regional powers. The environmental impact is another major concern. Constructing a canal of this scale would require large-scale excavation, leading to habitat destruction for marine and terrestrial wildlife. The potential for oil spills, increased shipping traffic, and disruptions to local fisheries could have lasting ecological consequences. Moreover, altering water flow between the Andaman Sea and the Gulf of Thailand could impact ocean currents, salinity levels, and even regional weather patterns. Due to these challenges, the Thai government remains cautious, choosing instead to prioritize port expansions and alternative infrastructure projects. The modernization of Laem Chabang and Map Ta Phut ports aims to improve Thailand’s maritime logistics without the risks associated with the Kra Canal. Furthermore, the land bridge initiative offers a feasible alternative to facilitate cargo movement between the Gulf of Thailand and the Andaman Sea while maintaining national unity and minimizing geopolitical tensions.

Gaza’s Future – OpEd	The Arab League held a summit in Cairo on March 4 with the sole intention of considering a comprehensive plan for Gaza’s future, master-minded by Egypt. Costed at some $53bn, it focuses in a 112-page document on emergency relief, rebuilding shattered infrastructure and long-term economic development. The conference endorsed the plan, as far as it went. The later stages will require more detailed consideration. It was on February 4 that US President Donald Trump announced his proposal to turn the Gaza Strip into a US-run 'Riviera of the Middle East', having first evacuated the population to any nearby Arab states willing to accept a total of some 2 million people. The Arab world, as well as much of the rest of the globe, greeted the idea with a mixture of astonishment and ridicule. Some commentators, claiming to know Trump’s methods, maintained that he had deliberately used shock tactics to goad the Arab world into playing a more active role in considering Gaza’s future and how to achieve it. If this was indeed the method in Trump’s madness, it produced results. A couple of weeks later, on February 17, news media worldwide reported that Egypt was preparing an alternative to Trump’s proposal in which evacuating the territory and relocating the Gazan population would play no part. In the event the Egyptian proposal called for establishing 'secure areas' within Gaza, where Palestinians can live temporarily while Egyptian and international construction firms reconstitute the Strip’s infrastructure. More than two dozen Egyptian and international firms would take part, and the reconstruction would provide tens of thousands of jobs for Gaza’s population. Winding up the summit on March 4 Egypt’s President Abdel el-Sisi welcomed 'the consensus among the Arab countries to support the reconstruction plan for the Gaza Strip, which allows the Palestinian people to stay on their land without displacement.' In a social media post after the conference, Sisi said he looked forward to working with Trump, other Arab nations and the international community 'to adopt a plan that aims for a comprehensive and just settlement of the Palestinian Issue, ends the root causes of the Israeli Palestinian conflict, guarantees the security and stability of the peoples of the region and establishes the Palestinian State.' The Egyptian plan outlines a three-phase process taking five years, starting with a six-month 'early recovery period' involving the establishment of 'safe zones'. Some 1.5 million displaced Gazans would be moved into 200,000 prefabricated housing units and 60,000 repaired homes. This stage is estimated to cost some $3bn The second phase, lasting two years and costing $20bn, would see housing and utilities rebuilt. During the third phase, which would take another two years, an airport, two seaports and an industrial zone would be built at a cost of $30bn. As for the Strip’s governance, a key aspect of this plan is the establishment of a temporary Governance Assistance Mission from which Hamas would be excluded. This interim body would oversee humanitarian aid and initiate reconstruction efforts until a reformed Palestinian Authority (PA) can assume control. Despite this exclusion, Hamas has publicly welcomed the Egyptian plan as signaling strong Arab alignment with the Palestinian cause. Arab League chief Ahmed Aboul Gheit said the summit’s final communique calls on the UN Security Council to deploy an international peacekeeping force in Gaza and the occupied West Bank. In addition, the communique said Egypt will host an international conference in cooperation with the UN to agree on Gaza’s reconstruction. Funding will probably require investment from oil-rich Gulf governments including the United Arab Emirates, Qatar and Saudi Arabia. A trust fund, overseen by the World Bank, will be established to handle pledges and donor-provided funds. A final stage, still open for Arab discussion and refinement, would start the process of creating a sovereign Palestinian state. Establishing inter-connectivity between the West Bank, East Jerusalem and the Gaza Strip would be an early priority. In tackling this conundrum the planners need look no further than Trump’s own comprehensive plan, 'Peace to Prosperity: A Vision to Improve the Lives of the Palestinian and Israeli People', issued on 28 January 2020. The result of years of intensive diplomatic effort by Trump’s son-in-law, Jared Kushner, the plan envisaged the establishment of a sovereign Palestinian state in the West Bank, excluding the settlements, plus a Gaza greatly expanded by a swath of Israeli territory south of the Strip. All Palestinian occupied territories would be made contiguous by way of a network of highways and a road tunnel linking the West Bank to Gaza. The published plan contained maps illustrating how all enclaves of a sovereign Palestine could be inter-connected. Trump’s plan was no sooner unveiled than it was vehemently rejected by Mahmoud Abbas, president of the Palestinian Authority (PA), and other voices in the Arab world. But not universally. Significantly, both Saudi Arabia and Egypt seemed prepared to give the plan a fair hearing. The Egyptian Ministry of Foreign Affairs stated: 'Egypt recognizes the importance of considering the US administration's initiative from the perspective of the importance of achieving the resolution of the Palestinian issue, thus restoring to the Palestinian people their full legitimate rights…' Egypt’s new plan for Gaza’s future, while carrying the whole-hearted approval of the Arab League, has not fared so well in US and Israeli circles. The AP news agency reported that White House National Security Council spokesman Brian Hughes has dismissed the Egyptian proposal as unworkable. 'The current proposal does not address the reality that Gaza is currently uninhabitable,' said Hughes on March 4, 'and residents cannot humanely live in a territory covered in debris and unexploded ordnance. President Trump stands by his vision to rebuild Gaza free from Hamas. We look forward to further talks to bring peace and prosperity to the region.' A spokesperson for Israel’s foreign ministry, Oren Marmorstein, posted on X that the Egyptian plan 'fails to address the realities of the situation'. The plan, he said, remains 'rooted in outdated perspectives.' Nevertheless Egypt’s plan garnered backing from the UN secretary general, Antonio Guterres, who attended the Arab summit. 'I welcome and strongly endorse the Arab-led initiative to mobilize support for Gaza’s reconstruction,' he said. 'The UN stands ready to fully cooperate in this endeavor.' Initial knee-jerk reactions by US and Israeli spokesmen to the Arab-endorsed plan may yet be modified, especially as the White Housse announced on March 5 that the US was engaged in direct talks with Hamas. The door Is open for discussion and negotiation.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfPrqpqMnK6ukLVxs5HAIk-	2025-03-14T17:05:15-07:00	
Iran: The IRGC’s Fuel Smuggling Mafia – OpEd	Amid the power struggle and the impeachment battle of Abdolnaser Hemmati, the Iranian regime’s minister of economy, the issue of large-scale fuel smuggling has resurfaced. On February 26, Iranian regime president Masoud Pezeshkian said, 'Who is responsible for taking this massive amount of reserves out of the country? It is not possible for someone to smuggle diesel by hand or in small barrels across the border. Such large-scale smuggling requires an extensive network, so it must be clarified who is involved in this cycle' (Jamaran website, February 26, 2025). Even if it is unclear to others who is involved in this cycle, Pezeshkian knows well. He understands that the fuel smuggling corruption is linked to the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), the military arm of Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei, for whose longevity Pezeshkian prays daily. On March 1, the state-affiliated Ham-Mihan newspaper highlighted Pezeshkian’s admission: 'Smugglers buy diesel at 3,000 rials per liter and sell it for 700,000 rials per liter.' It then questioned: 'Why don’t you name the smugglers? Is it against the policy of unity? Who are these smugglers? … When you publish an official report listing the names of these ‘respectable’ smugglers, the people will believe that you can actually stop it.' Pezeshkian knows well that 30 million liters of fuel cannot be smuggled daily using small containers. Fuel smuggling is different from garment smuggling—it is controlled by entities with the tools to regulate, monitor, and even legitimize such operations. The IRGC, leveraging its influence over ports, land borders, and international networks, has turned fuel smuggling into a highly profitable industry. Pezeshkian is not distant from this cycle either. He is not here to expose the IRGC’s secrets; rather, he aims to use the disappearance of oil barrels as a political weapon to pressure his economy minister. Pezeshkian, in turn, seeks to use this issue to force his rivals into retreat in the power struggle. That is why, once the uproar over the 'impeachment' and 'resignation' subsided, Pezeshkian also stopped talking about corruption and fuel smuggling. However, the trail of smuggled 20, 30, or even 50 million barrels of oil is such a massive scandal that its signs occasionally emerge in the regime’s internal power and wealth struggles, as voiced by its own figures and media. The Tabnak website, affiliated with former IRGC commander Mohsen Rezaei, reported on December 28, quoting Alireza Salimi, a member of the parliament’s presidium: 'The oil minister told our commission that we are buying nearly 9 million liters of fuel from smugglers. So you know who the smugglers are because you’re buying from them! The trail is in your hands. Losing 20 million liters is a big deal—it’s no joke.' Some regime-affiliated experts claim that the actual amount of fuel smuggling is far greater than 20 or 30 million liters per day. The state-run Arman-e Emrooz newspaper, on December 23, quoted an economic expert: 'We consume 120 million liters of gasoline per day. Of this, only 70 million liters are actual domestic consumption—the rest is smuggled out of the country… Hossein Raghfar stated that this cannot be carried out solely by border porters or ordinary individuals; rather, it is an organized operation—in other words, a government-run enterprise.' By 'government-run,' he refers to the regime’s own machinery of looting, crime, and oppression. The same apparatus that, under the banner of the IRGC, burned dozens of impoverished Baluchi fuel carriers alive in their vehicles in March 2021. At that time, the IRGC attempted to block fuel carriers by digging deep ditches and setting up roadblocks. At the Askan border point, they opened fire with tank-mounted machine guns on the fuel carriers and the people who came to support them.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfPrqpqMnK6ury-EUX16IZ5	2025-03-14T17:03:32-07:00	
Closing Signs Are Signs Of The Times – OpEd	By Mark Thornton It was not long ago when signs for 'Help Wanted' seemed to be in every store window. That is starting to be replaced in 2024 and 2025 with 'Store Closing' signs. This switcheroo tells us volumes about how people and the economy are adjusting to the Fed’s money printing business. While the government and the wealthy elite benefit from the money printing, consumers and workers only seem to suffer. I do feel sorry for the rank-and-file workers in the economy, but my greatest gratitude and admiration is for the entrepreneurs and managers that are responsible for our prosperity, provide all the real jobs, and, in addition, create the tax base. Their much-maligned work and the changes they have been forced to make are truly remarkable in the face of the onslaught of change that has been unleashed by the government and the Federal Reserve, especially since covid. According to the ABCT, firings, mass layoffs and closures are late-stage events that are predictable from the previous stages starting with the Fed’s money printing. It is not the result of some random or mysterious psychological process. Sure, managers make plenty of what appear to be bonehead decisions, but I don’t envy them for the tough decisions they have to make every day. We know it’s a Fed-caused business cycle because the trends happen in stages along with spikes in the data, rather than in a normal fashion, with no spikes and correlation—so large numbers of 'Help Wanted' signs followed later by large numbers of 'Store Closure' signs. The time of adjustment with business cycles is uncertain. We don’t know exactly how much time will be involved or exactly how events will unfold. We do know that Trump’s tariffs will make things worse, but not by how much. The ways in which people have been adapting is particularly illuminating to the cause of the cycle—the Fed’s money supply expansion, but also to the fact that it causes, not just higher prices, but that it does cause a cyclical disturbance and that it creates winners and losers, and that, above all else, paper money is not neutral! Last year, retail closures reached 3/4 of the covid peak (boosted by some corporate bankruptcies) including large numbers of Family Dollar stores, CVS pharmacies, and Big Lots. That number is expected to double in 2025, led by Party City, Walgreens, 7-Eleven, and Macy’s. According to Intelligent HQ, in 2024 the: Goldman Sachs survey found that 91% of small business owners are struggling with the current economic impact on their industries. 56% report that the situation has worsened since the beginning of the year. Are small business owners prepared for these upcoming challenges in 2025? Of course, many small independent businesses are also closing, partly for traditional reasons because small independent businesses fail a lot even in normal times, but also for cycle-related reasons, such as a downturn in the real income of their consumers and the abnormally and stubbornly rising costs due to monetary inflation by the Fed. Changing consumer trends have been happening forever and the online trend has been firmly in place for 25 years and the delivery trend for over 5 years. These are also chains that are both opening and closing stores in large numbers. The retail landscape has already been adapting to those changing trends. One trend that we have been pointing to is the economic pinch inflation has on low and middle-income families. See the recent episode on how inflation is impacting 'satisfaction' and voting patterns. There are also signs that consumers are trading down from Target, to Walmart, and to the dollar stores, in addition to just 'doing without.' The other dominant trend is the stubbornness of rising costs. Labor has become more expensive and scarce in many occupations. The costs of materials and goods continue to rise. Rent, utilities, insurance continue to rise. The cost of government red tape and access to capital are major problems. This is frustrating to consumers and business owners alike. Business closures and startups are visible, but entrepreneurs and managers have been working at a frantic pace to keep companies operational and profitable enough to stay in business and expand. Staffing and shift changes, input mixes, technological fixes, product lines, and operating hours are just some of the noteworthy aspects or 'margins' of the business that have been changing at revolutionary speed compared to normal conditions. Of course, customers don’t like price hikes, surcharges, and automated tipping, but—under the circumstances—it is completely understandable. There are also business-specific changes that have been made. A restaurant may have transitioned from dine-in only to take-out only, to dine-in and take out, added delivery, and become a catering-only business in a matter of a few years. The menu had to change, hours of operation, along with big staffing changes. Inventories and suppliers of food items, condiments, and cleaning supplies all changed. Washing dishes and glasses might now all be replaced with take-out containers. The industrial dishwasher might be just sitting there, taking up space, or replaced with some cooking unit and the dishwasher crew replaced with a delivery crew or social media contractor. Even the politicized choice of what type of straw to offer customers has become a tense business decision! As Hayek pointed out, the knowledge to make such changes only exists in the mind of individuals at the local level. Their incentive to profit and stay in business is the reason for the dependability of capitalism. You should read Ludwig von Mises’s article 'Profit and Loss.' Artificial intelligence might help with this small business decision-making and that of their franchise-chain big brothers, but it will never be able to replace it. Of course, Hayek’s point also lays bare the general ineptitude of government-run operations to even keep up under such dynamic or even normal conditions! Government bureaucracies can only continue to exist with subsidized, routinized operations. The main source of our frustrations as consumers is the Federal Reserve. I will continue to be grateful to the entrepreneurs and managers and their staff for trudging through these difficult times.

Trump Sees ‘Very Good Chance’ Of Peace After ‘Productive’ Talks W...	(RFE/RL) -- US President Donald Trump said he sees a 'very good chance' for peace between Ukraine and Russia after 'very good and productive discussions' between US officials and Russian President Vladimir Putin. In a March 14 post on his Truth Social site, Trump also said the United States had urged Russia to spare the lives of 'thousands' of Ukrainian soldiers that Putin has said have been isolated by Russian troops in Russia's Kursk region. Ukraine disputes that claim. The post came just hours after the Kremlin said it was 'cautiously optimistic' following a meeting late on March 13 between Putin and US Special Envoy Steve Witkoff. 'We had very good and productive discussions with President Vladimir Putin of Russia yesterday, and there is a very good chance that this horrible, bloody war can finally come to an end,' Trump wrote. Trump added that 'thousands of Ukrainian troops are completely surrounded by the Russian military, and in a very bad and vulnerable position.' 'I have strongly requested to President Putin that their lives be spared,' he wrote. 'This would be a horrible massacre, one not seen since World War II.' Putin said a day earlier that a group of Ukrainian troops were 'isolated' in the Kursk region, the site of a surprise incursion by Ukrainian forces last August. Responding to Trump's plea on March 14, he said the soldiers' lives would be spared if they surrendered and urged Kyiv to order them to do so. Officials in Kyiv have said that while Ukrainian forces have been slowly withdrawing in the Kursk region under heavy pressure from Russian troops, but the armed forces general staff said on March 14 that '[r]eports of the alleged 'encirclement' of Ukrainian units...in the Kursk region are false and fabricated.' 'There is no threat of encirclement of our units,' it said in a statement on social media. Zelenskyy Challenges Putin's Motives Earlier on March 14, Putin's spokesman said there were grounds for 'cautious optimism' over Trump's 30-day cease-fire proposal, which Ukraine accepted earlier this week at talks with US officials in Saudi Arabia. Ukraine, meanwhile, questioned Moscow's sincerity in ending the war, which is now in its fourth year since Russia's full-scale invasion on February 2022. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters in Moscow that Putin sent Trump a message about his cease-fire proposal after his talks with Witkoff in the Russian capital. 'When Mr Witkoff brings all the information to President Trump, we will determine the timing of a conversation (between Trump and Putin). There are reasons to be cautiously optimistic,' Peskov said. Putin said a day earlier that he agrees in principle with the US proposal for a temporary cease-fire with Ukraine, but added that 'there are nuances,' such as Western weapons deliveries to Kyiv, that he wants addressed first. The Russian leader also said any agreement should lead to long-term peace that addresses the 'root' reasons for the war, an apparent reference to NATO expansion and other developments Putin claims have put Russia's security in jeopardy. In a video posted late on March 13, Zelenskyy questioned Putin's motives, saying the Russian leader was preparing to reject the proposal but was afraid to tell Trump.'That's why in Moscow they are imposing upon the idea of a cease-fire these conditions -- so that nothing happens at all, or so that it cannot happen for as long as possible,' Zelenskyy said. He followed up on March 14 with a post on social media accusing the Kremlin of trying to 'complicate and drag out the process.' 'Russia is the only party that wants the war to continue and diplomacy to break down,' he said on X after a call with the Secretary of State of the Holy See, cardinal Pietro Parolin. Putin's Response To Trump's Pressure Kyiv agreed to Trump's 30-day cease-fire proposal at a meeting in Jeddah on March 11, putting the onus for peace in Moscow's lap. Putin's response threw the ball back into US hands, at least to some degree. Trump called Putin's initial reaction to peace talk developments 'promising' but incomplete, though he added he hoped Russia would 'do the right thing' and agree to the deal. 'I think the Russians are keen not to be seen as the intransigent party as that could lead to consequences from Trump, such as sanctions. So that informed Putin's comments today,' John Hardie, deputy director of the Russia Program at Foundation for Defense of Democracies, a Washington-based think tank, told RFE/RL. Trump has made ending the war in Ukraine a top priority since taking office for a second term less than two months ago, and is wielding US leverage to get both Kyiv and Moscow to the table. On March 13, the US administration heightened pressure on Russia by increasing restrictions on the country's oil, gas, and banking sectors. Among the measures, the Treasury Department was allowing the expiration of a 60-day exemption put in place in January by the Biden administration that let some energy transactions involving sanctioned Russian banks continue. The move would make it more difficult for other nations, especially in Europe, to buy Russian oil. Meanwhile, the foreign ministers from the Group of Seven (G7) -- which includes the United States, Canada, UK, France, Germany, Italy, and Japan -- said they discussed imposing more sanctions on Russia and boosting support for Ukraine if the Kremlin does not agree to the cease-fire. Among the measures discussed during the March 13-14 meeting were caps on the price for Russian oil exports, they said in a joint statement. Western nations in late 2022 imposed a $60-a-barrel price cap on the export of Russian oil using Western ships or insurance. It is unclear if the G7 discussions touched on lowering the price cap. Russia's economy is heavily dependent on oil exports, which account for a third of federal budget revenues. In a joint statement following the meeting, the G7 said that 'we reaffirmed our unwavering support for Ukraine in defending its territorial integrity and right to exist, and its freedom, sovereignty, and independence.' 'We welcomed ongoing efforts to achieve a ceasefire, and in particular the meeting on March 11 between the US and Ukraine in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia,' it added. Putin also said there were several unanswered questions in the proposal, such as what to do about Ukraine's incursion into Russia's Kursk region. 'If we have a cease-fire, does that mean that everyone there would leave?' Putin said. 'Should we release them [Ukrainian troops] after they committed crimes against the population? Or would they surrender?' Ukraine denies committing such crimes, saying it abides by humanitarian law and does not target civilians. Why Should Russia Agree To A Cease-Fire? Kyiv seized a swath of the Kursk region in a stealth incursion in August, a move seen as an effort to divert Russian forces from eastern Ukraine and use the territory as a bargaining chip in any peace talks. That strategy is now failing as Russian forces supported by North Korean troops push the Ukrainians out of Kursk. Russia has regained more than half the territory in Kursk initially captured by Ukraine. Zelenskyy told reporters on March 14 that the situation in Kursk was 'obviously very difficult.' Among the other concerns Putin voiced about the cease-fire proposal is whether Ukraine would use the 30-day period to mobilize and train forces or rearm with the help of the West. He also raised the question of how the nearly 2,000-kilometer front would be monitored. Zelenskyy told reporters that the front could be monitored by US satellites. Experts had warned that Putin would likely seek to drag out cease-fire talks because his forces have the upper hand on the battlefield. Aside from the advances in Kursk, Russia is gaining territory in eastern Ukraine -- albeit at high human and material costs -- due to its significant manpower advantage. However, Zelenskyy said Ukraine has stopped Russian forces at the gates of Pokrovsk, a key logistical hub in Donetsk region, after months of fighting on the outskirts of the city. Zelenskyy asserted that the incursion into Kursk forced Russia to pull forces from eastern Ukraine, giving his troops time to defend the city. Russia is seeking to capture at a minimum the entirety of the four regions of Ukraine it claims to have annexed in September 2022: Donetsk, Luhansk, Zaporizhzhya, and Kherson. A cease-fire freezing the current front lines would leave them short of that goal. 'One way the Russians could slow down this process without coming out directly and saying 'no', is by dragging out those technical discussions on monitoring' the cease-fire, Hardie said. 'That could also give them ways to try to pin the blame back on Ukraine, by insisting on certain technical matters that Ukraine might find objectionable,' he said.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfPrqpqMnK6uk4N6JyS2bBV	2025-03-14T16:59:42-07:00	
NASA’s SpaceX Crew-10 Launches To International Space Station	Four crew members of NASA’s SpaceX Crew-10 mission launched at 7:03 p.m. EDT Friday from Launch Complex 39A at NASA’s Kennedy Space Center in Florida for a science expedition aboard the International Space Station. A SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket propelled the Dragon spacecraft into orbit carrying NASA astronauts Anne McClain and Nichole Ayers, JAXA (Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency) astronaut Takuya Onishi, and Roscosmos cosmonaut Kirill Peskov. The spacecraft will dock autonomously to the forward-facing port of the station’s Harmony module at approximately 11:30 p.m. on Saturday, March 15. Shortly after docking, the crew will join Expedition 72/73 for a long-duration stay aboard the orbiting laboratory. 'Congratulations to our NASA and SpaceX teams on the 10th crew rotation mission under our commercial crew partnership. This milestone demonstrates NASA’s continued commitment to advancing American leadership in space and driving growth in our national space economy,' said NASA acting Administrator Janet Petro.'Through these missions, we are laying the foundation for future exploration, from low Earth orbit to the Moon and Mars. Our international crew will contribute to innovative science research and technology development, delivering benefits to all humanity.' During Dragon’s flight, SpaceX will monitor a series of automatic spacecraft maneuvers from its mission control center in Hawthorne, California. NASA will monitor space station operations throughout the flight from the Mission Control Center at the agency’s Johnson Space Center in Houston. NASA’s live coverage resumes at 9:45 p.m., March 15, on NASA+ with rendezvous, docking, and hatching opening. After docking, the crew will change out of their spacesuits and prepare cargo for offload before opening the hatch between Dragon and the space station’s Harmony module around 1:05 a.m., Sunday, March 16. Once the new crew is aboard the orbital outpost, NASA will broadcast welcome remarks from Crew-10 and farewell remarks from the agency's SpaceX Crew-9 crew, beginning at about 1:40 a.m. The number of crew aboard the space station will increase to 11 for a short time as Crew-10 joins NASA astronauts Nick Hague, Suni Williams, Butch Wilmore, and Don Pettit, as well as Roscosmos cosmonauts Aleksandr Gorbunov, Alexey Ovchinin, and Ivan Vagner. Following a brief handover period, Hague, Williams, Wilmore, and Gorbunov will return to Earth no earlier than Wednesday, March 19.Ahead of Crew-9’s departure from station, mission teams will review weather conditions at the splashdown sites off the coast of Florida. With this mission, NASA continues to maximize the use of the orbiting laboratory, where people have lived and worked continuously for more than 24 years, testing technologies, performing science, and developing the skills needed to operate future commercial destinations in low Earth orbit and explore farther from our home planet. Research conducted at the space station benefits people on Earth and paves the way for future long-duration missions to the Moon under NASA’s Artemis campaign and beyond.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfPrqpqMnK6uhFkACzhMr4z	2025-03-14T16:58:22-07:00	
How Merz Hopes To End The Indecisive ‘German Vote’ In Brussels	By Nick Alipour (EurActiv) -- Europe's fate partly lies in the hands of sixteen Germans. That's how many negotiators will design the future European policy of the continent’s largest and most populous economy, as the Christian Democrats (CDU) and the Social Democrats (SPD) thrash out a coalition agreement in talks that started yesterday. The section on European affairs in the agreement has not usually been a major priority. But this time around, the negotiators got a special assignment from the very top. After three years of German indecision in Brussels, Friedrich Merz, the Christian Democrat chancellor-in-waiting, wants the country to take on a major leadership role in deciding the response to the myriad of challenges facing the continent. His solution? An institutional redesign that would assign more power over European policymaking to himself. It would help avoid the chronic deadlock between successive multi-party governments that's left Berlin silent on key EU issues in recent years. But it's also likely to ruffle feathers in coalition talks that are only just getting underway. Merz stresses that the alternative would be dire, however: 'If Germany remains silent, (...) we are also damaging the ability of the entire European community to act,' he said in a programmatic speech on his future foreign policy in January. Chronic indecision in Berlin The SPD likely shares Merz's diagnosis, as few were happy about the impression that Germany's SPD-led three-party coalition left in Brussels over the last three years. With European decision-making divvied up between different parties and ministries, indecision on key issues has been a problem at least since the days of Angela Merkel's 'Grand Coalitions'. Where the French president has almost full authority over his country's European course, the chancellor must find a common position within his government. When German coalition partners fail to agree on a joint position, then Berlin must abstain from voting on EU legislation – an outcome that's become so common it's dubbed the 'German vote'. In Berlin, a multi-departmental legislative file like EU migration reform has to be greenlighted by all ministries involved, requiring – in the case of migration – the approval of the foreign and interior ministers. Even the responsibility for coordination is split. The Chancellery's EU department can step in to adjudicate political conflicts between the parties; but the Foreign Office and the Economy Ministry are formally in charge of coordination between ministries, government sources explained. They also split responsibility for prepping European Council summits with the Chancellery, while a junior minister at the Foreign Office controls the EU reform and enlargement portfolios. That gives the Foreign Office – typically held by a junior coalition partner – a good deal of influence over EU matters. In short, it is a patchwork of overlapping responsibilities that has often left little space for Berlin to put forward a cohesive European vision. Things deteriorated under outgoing Chancellor Olaf Scholz's three-party government, which featured near-constant conflict between Scholz's Social Democrats, the Greens and the free-market liberal Free Democrats (FDP). 'In this past legislative period, almost all ministers [lacked] a sense for Europe,' acknowledged one SPD source, also pointing to Scholz's detachment from the issue, as he is mainly 'a transatlanticist'. The coalition partners repeatedly failed to engage with key EU legislation until the last minute, only to ultimately abstain from taking any position at all over a lack of agreement in Berlin. The most notorious example was the EU's proposed ban on the sale of new petrol cars, which had been fully negotiated in Brussels – only to be blocked when Germany pulled out just before the final vote due to an internal veto by the FDP. That Germany, home to a mighty car industry, hadn't weighed in earlier left many elsewhere in the EU baffled and irritated. Is a mightier Merz the answer? Merz has vowed to end all of the above. He is not planning on taking chances by relying on verbal commitments alone, as the previous coalition agreement did. Merz is aiming for an institutional redesign, as he outlined in January. The first pillar will be to create a powerful new national security council that he hopes to turn into 'the centre of gravity for the government's collective decision-making on all the main issues of foreign, security, development, and European policy'. The second pillar is to unite the steering power over European policy directly under the chancellor. The catch? Getting his perspective coalition partners to go along with that power grab won’t be easy. Creating a security council is likely the least controversial part, as the SPD had previously attempted to create such an institution under Scholz, only to be blocked by the Greens. But with an SPD politician almost certain to lay claim to the Foreign Office, it's unlikely they'd agree to shipping those European competences over to the Chancellery without a fight. 'I think we would protest strongly,' said the SPD source. 'We would not be smart if we left European policy entirely to the Christian Democrats, because European policy is also extremely important for the crucial areas of the economy and energy.' Experts still believe that Merz has a chance to improve European policy coordination, as the SPD's new leaders also have an interest in strengthening Germany's leadership in Europe, according to an analysis of the wider European impact of the German election by the Jacques Delors Centre's Johannes Lindner, Thu Nguyen, and Jannik Jansen. 'However, complete centralisation in the Chancellery will not be possible – if only because of [ministerial independence] and the need for coordination between the CDU/CSU and SPD,' Lindner told Euractiv. A lot will hinge on ministers' ability to improve timely coordination, he argued. 'The coalition negotiations now are a first test of how close they are to each other on the most important European policy issues.'	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfPrqpqMnK6uoPqLIm06F-w	2025-03-14T16:53:45-07:00	
All Eyes On Putin For Next Step To Ukraine Peace – Analysis	By Luke Coffey Global events can move quickly. Just two weeks ago, the world watched as Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky had a heated exchange with US President Donald Trump and Vice President J.D. Vance in the Oval Office. A planned rare earths mineral deal was scrapped at the last minute, and Zelensky was sent out of the White House in an unprecedented diplomatic standoff. But hard work and sincere diplomacy can pay off. Behind the scenes, both sides worked tirelessly to repair the relationship, culminating in a high-stakes meeting in Jeddah this week that brought the US-Ukraine relationship back on track and set the stage for what could be the first meaningful step toward ending Russia’s three-year invasion of Ukraine. Trump has been clear about his desire to end the war, but since returning to office in January he has learned that this is easier said than done. The meeting in Jeddah was the first concrete step in that process. One of Trump’s biggest criticisms of Ukraine during the heated White House exchange was that he did not believe Zelensky was sincere about wanting peace. After Jeddah, that perception has changed. The US and Ukraine agreed to a temporary 30-day ceasefire on land, at sea, and in the air — a deal that could be extended if all parties agree. However, Kyiv would not implement it unless Moscow agreed to do the same. Forty-eight hours later, Russian President Vladimir Putin said he supported the idea of a ceasefire but added conditions that make its implementation uncertain. The US and Ukraine also finalized the draft of the minerals deal that had been abandoned at the White House. Trump has even invited Zelensky back to the Oval Office, signaling a major turnaround in their strained relationship. As Secretary of State Marco Rubio said: 'The ball is in Russia’s court.' Last week I made my fourth visit to Ukraine since Russia’s full-scale invasion in 2022. Anyone who has spent time there knows that Ukrainians want an end to the war. They endure nightly air raids, missile strikes, and drone attacks. They also understand the long-term threat that Russia poses if there are no real security guarantees. For those of us who have seen wartime Ukraine firsthand, it has always been obvious that the Ukrainian people want the fighting to end. Yet some around Trump question whether Zelensky shares this view. After Jeddah, there is no longer any doubt. It is now up to Russia to decide whether to pursue peace. There is still a long way to go, and plenty of opportunities for setbacks. Even if a temporary ceasefire were agreed on, the war would be far from over. The night before the Jeddah talks, Ukraine launched its largest drone strike yet, sending nearly 400 to hit targets as far away as Moscow. Meanwhile Russia has continued its relentless bombardment of Ukraine with missiles and drones on a near-nightly basis. When I visited the front lines in the Kherson region, it was clear that decisions made in Jeddah, Washington, or Moscow are often irrelevant to those fighting on the ground. For the soldiers in the trenches, survival is the only priority. Until an actual ceasefire is implemented — not just discussed — nothing will change for them. Another major development in the war, and one that represents a significant setback for Ukraine, is Russia’s counteroffensive in its Kursk region. Ukraine launched a surprise attack last August and captured a sizeable portion of territory. The idea was to hold on to this land as a bargaining chip for future negotiations. But over the past seven months, Russian forces — bolstered by thousands of North Korean troops — have steadily regained control. Last week it appears that Moscow had completed its recapture of all the territory Ukraine seized. It will be up to future historians to assess whether the Kursk offensive accomplished tactical objectives or if it was a strategic miscalculation. In the short term, however, it does not help Ukraine’s position at the negotiating table. The loss of Kursk weakens its leverage. After traveling around Ukraine this past week, I am certain of one thing: the Ukrainian people are exhausted from the war. But they also know they have no choice but to keep fighting as long as Russia continues its aggression. If there is to be any lasting peace, it must include security guarantees ensuring that Russia will not attack again. This is the biggest challenge for Kyiv. Trump has ruled out NATO membership for Ukraine and has shifted the responsibility for security guarantees on to Europe. However, because the U.S. and most European countries operate under the same security umbrella, in practice it would be difficult to separate American and European commitments. The road to peace is long, and the war is far from over. The ongoing fighting in Donetsk, Kursk, and Kherson proves that reality. The biggest question now is whether the progress made in Jeddah will hold. There is always the risk that Trump is looking for a short-term political victory rather than a lasting peace agreement. If the ceasefire collapses, the war will probably escalate again, and Ukraine may find itself in an even more difficult position than before. For now, all eyes are on Moscow. The coming weeks will determine whether Russia is serious about peace or if the war will continue indefinitely. Luke Coffey is a senior fellow at the Hudson Institute.

California Endangers Self-Defense – OpEd	Last August in downtown San Francisco, an armed gunman stalked San Francisco 49ers rookie receiver Ricky Pearsall and demanded his watch along with everything he carried. Pearsall refused to comply and in the ensuing struggle took a bullet in the chest. The attack brought no public comment from Gov. Gavin Newsom, a former mayor of San Francisco, and state Attorney General Rob Bonta. Also holding off was Assemblyman Rick Zbur, Los Angeles Democrat and Harvard law alum. Zbur’s new bill makes a case that Pearsall should have handed over his valuables, run away, or both. According to Zbur’s Assembly Bill 1333, the use of deadly force by an innocent party—'homicide' in the bill’s text—is not justified: When the person was outside of their residence and knew that using force likely to cause death or great bodily injury could have been avoided with complete safety by retreating. When the person used more force than was reasonably necessary to defend against a danger. When the person was the assailant, engaged in mutual combat, or knowingly engaged in conduct reasonably likely to provoke a person to commit a felony or do some great bodily injury, except if either of the following circumstances apply: The person reasonably believed that they were in imminent danger of death or great bodily injury, and had exhausted every reasonable means to escape such danger other than the use of force likely to cause death or great bodily injury. In good faith, the person withdrew from the encounter with the other assailant or assailants and indicated clearly to the other assailant or assailants that the person desired to withdraw and terminated the use of any force, but the other assailant or assailants continued or resumed the use of force. According to Zbur, his bill 'was never intended to limit a crime victim’s right to defend yourself, your family, or home.' In an X post now unavailable, Zbur claimed, 'the goal is to prevent wannabe vigilantes like Kyle Rittenhouse from provoking violence & claiming self defense after the fact.' The assemblyman failed to note that Rittenhouse, 18, deployed deadly force while under attack and was acquitted of all charges. Zbur did not cite the looters who gunned down retired St. Louis policeman David Dorn or any of the many homicides during the 2020 riots in cities across the nation. A politician concerned about public safety might also have cited James Hodgkinson, who in 2017 deployed an SKS rifle against members of Congress as they played baseball. The attack nearly killed Rep. Steve Scalise, who had no time to run away. Consider also wannabe assassin Thomas Mathew Crooks. On July 13, 2024, in Butler, Pennsylvania, the 20-year-old Crooks eluded the Secret Service detail and got off eight shots, wounding presidential candidate Donald Trump, killing rally attendee Corey Comperatore, and wounding James Copenhaver and David Dutch. None of the attendees had time to flee. Californians can be forgiven for believing that AB-1333 benefits violent criminals while menacing the people’s right to self-defense. They might examine The Right to Bear Arms: A Constitutional Right of the People or a Privilege of the Ruling Class? by Stephen P. Halbrook, author of That Every Man Be Armed: Evolution of a Constitutional Right. And while debating AB-1333, know that a more dangerous bill is already state law. In September 2018, Gov. Jerry Brown signed Senate Bill 1391, which bars all prosecution of criminals under 16 in adult court. That means anyone under the age of 16 could murder Ricky Pearsall, be tried only in juvenile court, and gain release at age 25. The 49er miraculously survived and played well in his first season. His attacker has been charged with attempted murder, assault with a semiautomatic weapon, and attempted second-degree robbery. At this writing, the 17-year-old has yet to be publicly identified.

ComInfFest 2025: MTUCI Discusses Prospects For Exporting Russian ...	An initiative, designed to foster a strategic collaboration between educational institutions from Russia and Africa, is set to bring together exceptional young professionals in the field of information technology. On 13th March 2025, the Moscow Technical University of Communications and Informatics (MTUCI) hosted a large-scale roundtable discussion on 'Exporting Russian IT Education' as part of the International Science Festival 'Festival of Communications and Informatics Science - ComInfFest 2025'. The event became an important platform for discussing issues of promoting Russian educational programs in the field of information technology in the international arena. The roundtable was attended by representatives of embassies of 15 foreign countries and diasporas, interested government bodies of the Russian Federation, leading IT companies, international student organizations, as well as the president of the Cameroonian diaspora in the Russian Federation and chairman of the commission for work with African diasporas of the Russian-African Club of Moscow State University named after M.V. Lomonosov, Louis Gouend. MTUCI Rector Sergey Erokhin, the roundtable moderator, emphasized the growing interest in Russian IT education students from different countries, noting the need to create favorable conditions for their successful studies, adaptation, and professional development. Deputy Head of Rossotrudnichestvo Pavel Shevtsov emphasized the importance of creating attractive conditions for professional growth and employment of foreign students. Louis Gouend emphasized the importance of strengthening ties between the Russian and African educational communities and the role of the Russian IT sector in developing the potential of African students. He also touched upon the issues of adaptation of international students, proposing innovative integration methods and stressed that Africa will be a huge growing market for Russian IT education by 2050. The participants discussed issues of social and cultural adaptation, competitiveness of Russian education, and ways to overcome language barriers. The experts further emphasized the need for active interaction with foreign partners, popularization of Russian IT education, as well as interaction between educational institutions and businesses to create practical-oriented programs. At the end of the large-scale roundtable, Louis Gouend discussed with the university management the possibility of receiving subsidies for African students studying in the preparatory course. Moscow Technical University of Communications and Informatics (MTUCI) is a Russian university which specializes in the field of information technology, telecommunications, and information security. It currently has an enrollment of approximately 15,000 students. In January 1992, in accordance with Order of the Government of Russia, it received the status of as a technical university and transformed into the Moscow Technical University of Communications and Informatics (MTUCI).	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfPrqpqMnK6uq9tKE1kHGaX	2025-03-14T16:46:06-07:00	
Iraq Says Key Islamic State Leader Is Dead	By Jeff Seldin One of the Islamic State terror group's most senior leaders is reportedly dead, killed in what Iraq is describing as a U.S.-supported operation. Iraqi Prime Minister Mohammed Shia al-Sudani posted on social media Friday that the country's intelligence service 'successfully eliminated' IS deputy caliph Abdallah Makki Muslih al-Rufay'i. Sudani did not say when or how al-Rufay'i was killed, calling the death a 'significant security achievement.' Iraqi special forces, in a subsequent post on the X social media platform, said al-Rufay’i was killed Thursday in an airstrike targeting his location in Iraq’s Anbar desert. Officials said the strike was the result of a two-year effort to track his location, with breakthroughs coming in the past six months. The officials also said they arrested seven additional IS members, including two women, in a follow-up operation in Anbar. Intelligence collected at the scene of the airstrike further led to the arrest of another five people in the northern Iraqi city of Irbil. Iraqi officials said that al-Rufay'i, also known as Abu Khadija, was the top IS official for Iraq and Syria, and that he also played a key role in the group's external operations. A recent United Nations report, based on intelligence from U.N. member states, said al-Rufay'i ran IS operations across Iraq, Syria, Turkey and other parts of the Middle East. Other U.N. intelligence reports have identified al-Rufay'i as a member of IS' delegated committee, viewed as the terror group's most influential executive body. U.S. officials have yet to comment on the Iraqi claims. Various intelligence estimates put the number of IS fighters across Iraq and Syria at between 1,500 and 3,000, with the majority operating out of Syria. U.S. military officials warned in July of a possible IS resurgence in the region, saying the terror group was on a pace to more than double the number of attacks it had carried out in Iraq and Syria the previous year. More recently, in December, U.S. forces carried out a series of airstrikes against IS in Syria, hitting targets in areas abandoned by counterterror forces loyal to former Syrian president Bashar al-Assad. Despite those operations, intelligence shared by the U.N. indicated IS has been trying to take advantage of the fall of the Assad regime and resulting political turmoil. The U.N. report also said IS 'maintained the ability to operate and replace field commanders.' Yet while Iraq and Syria are central to IS' founding ideology, there has been a growing consensus among intelligence officials and experts that the terror group no longer sees the Middle East as its base for global operations. Officials, including those from the U.S., have said there is growing confidence that the group is now being led by Abdul Qadir Mumin, who has been based in Somalia, where he rose to prominence as the emir of the group's Somali affiliate, IS-Somalia. An offensive launched by forces in Somalia's Puntland region earlier this month, in part to chase after Mumin, has met with surprising success, pushing IS-Somalia out of some of its key strongholds. But the campaign has yet to find any traces of Mumin or other top IS leaders.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfPrqpqMnK6unM1X-0KuOaN	2025-03-14T16:44:34-07:00	
US Sanctions Thai Officials For Deporting Uyghurs To China	By Alex Willemyns U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio on Friday announced visa sanctions against Thai government officials involved in last month’s deportation of 40 Uyghurs to China, where they likely face torture as part of what American officials call an ongoing 'genocide.' The men had been held in immigration detention in Thailand since escaping China’s persecution in 2014. The Thai government’s decision to return them to China on Feb. 27 was criticized by the United States, European Union, United Nations and global human rights groups. Rubio said the U.S. visa bans will apply to Thai officials 'responsible for, or complicit in, the forced return of Uyghurs' to China, where he said 'they are subject to torture and enforced disappearances.' 'In light of China’s longstanding acts of genocide and crimes against humanity committed against Uyghurs, we call on governments around the world not to forcibly return Uyghurs and other groups to China,' Rubio said in a statement issued by the U.S. State Department. The statement also said some family members of the officials may be banned from traveling to the United States under the blacklisting. The State Department did not respond to an inquiry from Radio Free Asia about how many officials would be subjected to the ban. Officials at the department routinely decline to identify the names of those hit with visa bans, citing U.S. immigration laws around privacy. The United States has since 2021 described China’s persecution of the mostly Muslim ethnic Uyghurs as a 'genocide,' leveling accusations of torture, forced sterilization and slavery against Chinese officials. Beijing rejects the claims and says it only promotes development and vocational training in far-western Xinjiang, where most Uyghurs live. Close alliance The deportation of the Uyghurs and the visa sanctions is a rare case of acrimony between longtime allies in the United States and Thailand. In the days after the Feb. 27 deportation, a State Department official confirmed to RFA that U.S. diplomats offered to resettle the Uyghurs either in the United States or a third country, while a Thai opposition lawmaker said Australia and Sweden also made similar offers. Thai Vice Foreign Minister Russ Jalichandra eventually acknowledged that such offers had been made but said that Bangkok had finally agreed to return the Uyghurs to China to avoid inevitable 'retaliation from China that would impact the livelihoods of many Thais.' Rubio had said during his Senate confirmation hearing on Jan. 15 that he believed he could use America’s close historical relationship with Thailand to ensure the Uyghurs were not returned to Thailand. 'The good news is that Thailand is actually a very strong U.S. partner, a strong historical ally as well, and so that is an area where I think diplomacy could really achieve results, because of how important that relationship is and how close it is,' Rubio said at that time. World Uyghur Congress executive committee chair Rushan Abbas welcomed Friday’s visa bans, saying the move sent a clear warning to other governments that 'they will face consequences' for working with China to return escaped Uyghurs. 'This announcement is a critical step in holding those complicit in these egregious forced deportations accountable,' Abbas told RFA. 'For Uyghurs, forced return to China is tantamount to a death sentence, exposing them to torture, forced labor and enforced disappearances,' she said. 'This policy delivers a strong message that aiding China’s crimes will not go unpunished.'	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfPrqpqMnK6upLVSL1FOAHP	2025-03-14T16:42:39-07:00	
End Of Unipolarity: A Chance For Change – OpEd	Global conflict and uncertainty are nothing new, but since the 2008/09 economic crash, they have worsened exponentially. The arrival of President Trump has dramatically exacerbated the situation, turning turbulence into chaos and anxiety into fear. Governments and institutions are reeling after just seven weeks of Trump, his vice president J.D. Vance, and Elon 'Chainsaw' Musk—figures so extreme they make Trump seem moderate by comparison. It is impossible to keep track of the carnage (executive orders alone – 73 signed in the first 30 days). The strategy appears to be to overwhelm everyone – the Democrats (who appear shell shocked), foreign governments, the media, and the public, so nobody will notice the details. Since 20 January, a barrage of barbaric policy decisions and executive lunacy has flowed from the Oval Office, often involving actions that shatter tradition, flout the law, and violate the Constitution. A new world order and shifting alliances are in the air. Could the storm being unleashed by Trump and Co. inadvertently lead to positive structural and systemic change? Global Disruption The dominant global structure since the Second World War has been one of U.S. unipolarity, marked by global domination in which America has faced no significant competition or threat from other states. It is from this position—one that, in the American context, has bred increasing levels of paranoia—that Trump speaks when he says the U.S. will 'have' Gaza, based on American authority. Trump appears intent on breaking everything, destabilizing global institutions, and shattering long-held ideals like global unity, shared prosperity, and a 'one world' vision. Such concepts are being abandoned as international bodies are attacked and long-standing rules of global exchange are dismantled. At the stroke of a chunky black pen, the U.S. was formally withdrawn from several United Nations bodies, including the World Health Organization (its largest donor), the Human Rights Council (UNHRC), and UNRWA, the UN agency supporting Palestinians. The World Trade Organization (WTO) also faces threats due to Trump’s aggressive tariff policies. A review of U.S. involvement in UNESCO (the UN’s educational, scientific, and cultural agency) and U.S. funding for the United Nations itself has been ordered. Citing ‘the wild disparities in levels of funding among different countries,’ White House staff secretary Will Scharf explained that the decision was also a protest against ‘anti-American bias’ within UN agencies, though no specific examples of such prejudice were provided. Old alliances are hanging by a thread; the Palestinians’ right to a homeland has been swept aside, with ethnic cleansing of Gaza openly touted, and Israel given free rein to be even more barbaric—if such a thing is even possible. Aid organizations have been decimated, Europe and Ukraine are criticized, and Russia and Putin receive accolades. Canada and Greenland are eyed as potential U.S. states, and Trump wants to reclaim the Panama Canal and transform Gaza into a Palestinian-free Mediterranean resort under ‘American authority. Whatever disruptive actions Trump takes, others can—and potentially will—mimic, particularly other far-right leaders. This is especially troubling in relation to the Paris Agreement and global support for United Nations agencies. The UN is entirely reliant on member states for funding to carry out its life-saving work. Should nations begin to argue over their contributions and withhold payments, the valuable work the UN is doing around the world would be threatened The Trump Storm has thrown governments and organizations worldwide into turmoil, and after 70 years of U.S. hegemony, during which Western geopolitics and global affairs have overwhelmingly been designed and administered from Washington—often with disastrous consequences—there is talk of a new world order. It is not, however, a visionary, hopeful new world based on unifying principles and the oneness of humanity. Instead, it’s yet another divisive model rooted in power, ideology, and global dominance: Will China take over? Will Russia seek to expand its territory? What role will Europe play? Is the Trans-Atlantic Alliance shattered? And so on. The conversation centers around uncertainty, security, and defense capabilities. It’s more of the same unimaginative, duplicitous rhetoric we’ve heard for decades—a shocking reflection of the appalling quality of leaders currently in office, the corrupt nature of politics, and the extent to which the military-industrial complex and the corporate world hold sway. A Vision for Fundamental Change What is needed is not a new old world order, but a creative reimagining of civilization—a shift in values and ideals that shapes new and just systems and cultivates principles of goodness—cooperation, sharing, tolerance, and understanding. Gradual yet fundamental change that moves beyond manipulating existing patterns to establish a global order based on social justice and freedom; only this will lead to peace. While far-reaching reforms designed to bring about such change could, in principle, be introduced without the total destruction of existing systems, those in power—both political and corporate—having benefited the most, are determined to maintain the status quo, regardless of the consequences for society and the natural world. This leads to the rather depressing conclusion that only a seismic downfall will enable the changes billions of people around the world long for.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfPrqpqMnK6uq1SJkUpma6S	2025-03-14T16:41:09-07:00	
Forceful Taiwan Reunification: China’s Targeted Military And Civi...	By Suyash Desai (FPRI) -- For nearly a century, the People’s Republic of China (PRC) and Taiwan have largely avoided direct military confrontations across the Taiwan Strait. However, there have been four notable exceptions: the Taiwan Strait crises of 1954–55, 1958, 1995–96, and most recently, 2022–23. In the first three instances, the status quo was primarily restored following the crisis. However, recent events suggest worrying trends highlighting that Beijing is preparing for a forceful reunification with Taiwan. Chinese Communist Party (CCP) General Secretary Xi Jinping has already made reunification with Taiwan a part of his signature China Dream, announced during the 19th Party Congress meeting in 2017. However, this was not the first time Taiwan was featured prominently in speeches by top Chinese leaders. As political scientist Ketian Zhang highlights in her book China’s Gambit: The Calculus of Coercion, annexing Taiwan is considered a core interest of China, with official references to its significance appearing regularly since 2003. The most recent instance was Xi Jinping’s New Year’s speech on December 31, 2024, where he declared, 'No one can stop the historical trend of reunification of the motherland' (誰也不能充實祖國統一的歷史大勢). But beyond rhetoric and political posturing, the Chinese People’s Liberation Army (PLA) has taken concrete measures over the past decade to advance Beijing’s reunification agenda. Since the COVID-19 pandemic, these measures have intensified, reinforcing China’s willingness to use force. This article highlights the PLA’s systematic and incremental military and civilian-military measures—capabilities that might provide China with the tools to successfully conduct a potential forceful reunification with Taiwan in the near future. These measures include changing the institutions and patterns of PLA mobilization, constructing and using civilian infrastructure in military exercises, and establishing a new status quo through increasingly coercive military exercises around Taiwan. They also include standardization of the PLA for greater efficiency, effectiveness, combat readiness, stockpiling resources, and re-enlisting veterans with specific skills. This article builds upon Oriana Skylar Mastro’s arguments in her piece 'The Taiwan Temptation,' which contends that China’s expanding military capabilities and rising nationalism could drive Beijing to contemplate using force for reunification with Taiwan. It identifies granular military details, especially post-2020, but it doesn’t venture into arguments about the timing of the reunification, potential diplomatic backlash, or economic costs of the invasion. Recent Military-Civilian Measures Since 2015, the PRC has undertaken significant organizational, legal, and structural reforms to enhance the National Defense Mobilization System (NDMS) (國防動員系統). As China scholar Devin Thorne highlights in his recent testimony to the US-China Economic and Security Review Commission, NDMS enables the PRC to harness its political, economic, technological, cultural, social, and other civilian resources from peacetime to wartime. This helps China to address a wide range of threats, such as escalations on its border, domestic instabilities, natural disasters, and other crises. It also bolsters China’s military logistics. As Thorne highlights, the key developments include the enactment of the National Defense Transportation Law in 2017, the introduction of updated auditing and surveying data on natural resources protocols in 2018 and 2021, the establishment of new NDMS offices beginning in December 2022, the creation of a new type of highly trained and professional local militia force since 2021, and the enhancement of cross-militia training initiatives starting in 2024. The PLA can mobilize private and civilian resources through the NDMS during national emergencies. It highlights China’s determination to prepare for potential contingencies, including escalation activities on its borders with India, the Taiwan Strait, and the South China Sea. Lessons from the Russian-Ukrainian War and the Israeli-Palestinian conflict have further shaped these efforts. Once operational, the NDMS would ultimately allow the PRC to mobilize society and harness civilian and military resources more systematically and institutionally in case of a potential forceful reunification attempt with Taiwan. However, mobilizing resources and force is insufficient, as China would need to reach the other side of the Taiwan Strait during a potential escalation. Some scholars dismiss the idea that the PLA remains incapable of conducting amphibious operations at the scale needed to take control of Taiwan. Amphibious operations (landing assault) are one of the five most important campaigns (alongside anti-landing, island blockade, border area counter-attack, and counter–air-raid campaigns) discussed at length in the PLA’s first written doctrine on joint operations, Joint Campaign Outline, as operational requirements to take over Taiwan by force. Taiwan has 169,000 active military personnel, backed by 1.66 million reservists. As career naval officer Harlan Ullman explains, using the traditional three-to-one ratio of attackers to defenders taught at war colleges, the PLA would need to mobilize at least 507,000 soldiers. By extension, to cross the 106-kilometer-wide Taiwan Strait to conduct landing operations, China would need thousands of ships—far more than the current PLA Navy capabilities of 234 operating warships. However, China has long been working to mobilize its civilian infrastructure to support its military campaign. For instance, the PRC has emphasized the construction of roll-on/roll-off (RO-RO) (滾裝船) ships, which can use their power to set up ramps on docks or beaches to transport vehicles. Each RO–RO ship is estimated to carry at least three hundred vehicles and about fifteen hundred passengers. Since establishing the 'strategic projection support ship fleets' in China’s major ship-building companies in 2012, the PLA has actively cooperated with local shipping companies to improve maritime 'strategic delivery' capabilities by prioritizing the production of RO-RO ferries. According to naval strategist J. Michael Dahm, in January 2023, China had around thirty-one RO-RO ferries in operation. However, the Center for Strategic and International Studies pointed out that the mainland shipyards would deliver up to two hundred RO-RO ships in the four years from 2023 to 2026. Furthermore, the PLA has used these ferries in military exercises in the Taiwan Strait since 2019. For instance, the first fifteen-thousand-ton ferry, Bang Chui Dao RO-RO ship (棒槌島滾裝船), participated in an amphibious assault exercise in 2019. Since then, the PLA has conducted such military exercises regularly. In July 2020, the PLA experimented with launching amphibious assault craft from civilian ferries toward the beach rather than port facilities, and it conducted day and night exercises off the coast of Guangdong Province. August 2021 was the first time the PLA used a ten-thousand-ton–class civilian ferry ship to land military exercises. Furthermore, in August 2022, after then-Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi visited Taiwan, six of these RO-RO ships, which are operated by the Bo Hai Ferry Group Company (渤海輪渡集團公司) and are affiliated with the PLA Maritime Militia 8th Transport Brigade (海上民兵第8運輸旅), headed south toward Xiamen—the closest point to Taiwan. The RO-RO ferries were used more frequently in cross-transportation military exercises in July and September 2023. Furthermore, it was also discovered in January 2025 that China is building at least five landing barges at the Guangzhou shipyard with unusually long road bridges that extend from the bow of the ship, which makes them relevant to amphibious landing operations. Although these vessels and barges are extremely susceptible to attacks from Taiwanese F-16s, warships, and submarines, they would be supported by the PLA Navy, PLA Air Force, and PLA Rocket Force. The Changing Nature of Coercion and Military Exercises around Taiwan On September 17, 2020, the Taiwanese Ministry of National Defense published its first real-time military update, documenting PLA incursions into Taiwan’s de facto air defense identification zone (ADIZ). As meticulously recorded by Ben Lewis and Gerald C. Brown, by January 2025, there had been approximately eight thousand PLA violations of the ADIZ, including multiple crossings of the median line. Notably, Chinese warplanes crossed the median line in 2019 for the first time since 1999. However, Nancy Pelosi’s August 2022 visit to Taiwan provided the PLA with a pretext to escalate its activities, culminating in multiple advanced military exercises conducted around Taiwan from all sides. Since August 2022, the PLA has conducted five large-scale military exercises around Taiwan. Most of them coincided with significant political events. For instance, the first military exercise in August 2022 followed Pelosi’s visit. This was succeeded by the inaugural PLA Joint Sword exercises in April 2023, coinciding with former Taiwanese President Tsai Ing-wen’s visit to the United States and her meeting with then-Speaker of the US House of Representatives Kevin McCarthy. Subsequent exercises included Joint Sword A in May 2024 and Joint Sword B in October 2024. These exercises aligned with the inauguration of President Lai Ching-te’s tenure and his National Day speech. The most recent military exercises, conducted in December 2024, were held shortly after President Lai Ching-te’s travels through the United States. Notably, President Lai did not engage with any major US leaders during his transit. However, the recent exercises display the opportunistic Chinese behavior of leveraging situations to establish a new normal through increasingly coercive activities in the Taiwan Strait. The Joint Sword A and B exercises and the December 2024 drills are particularly significant for understanding the evolution of China’s coercion pattern and the difference between China’s military posturing and its intentions in the Taiwan Strait. While the Joint Sword A and B drills were declared in advance and focused on anti-intervention and amphibious assault near Taiwan, recent December 2024 exercises intended to perform blockade, strategic deterrence, and anti-interventionism exercises. The latest exercises occurred across expanded locations like Fujian, Zhejiang, and the Western Pacific. Significantly, the December 2024 exercise, for the first time, witnessed all three of the PLA’s sea-facing theater commands—North, East, and South—jointly participating in an operation in the eastern waters of China, a key demand by the leadership to achieve multi-domain joint operations capabilities. Notably, these instances reveal that the Chinese leadership is keenly aware of the PLA’s pre-existing weaknesses, like amphibious assaults and anti-intervention operations, and has been pushing the PLA to address this gap gradually. They also leveraged elements of strategic deterrence and surprise while adhering to steps toward joint combat operations, a prerequisite for a forceful reunification. Geographically, these exercises extended beyond the Taiwan Strait to cover broader areas, including Fujian, Zhejiang, Shanghai, and the Western Pacific, indicating a shift toward controlling key maritime zones in the First Island Chain. Thus, with active participation from all major PLA services and the three sea-facing theater commands, and indulgence in numerous aspects of warfare targeted toward the PLA’s primary strategic direction—Taiwan—these exercises signalled a more nuanced and multi-layered operational focus. Multiple Standardizations within the PLA Over the past seven years, particularly in the post-pandemic period, China has prioritized comprehensive standardization of procedures with the PLA and its auxiliary support systems—non-combat systems and components that support and sustain military operations. PLA leadership has issued numerous directives to achieve uniformity across various domains, such as the construction of barracks, military equipment procurement, and the establishment of standardized military training grounds. These efforts are extended to standardizing resource allocation, engineering procurement, equipment support, logistical operations, medical services, communication infrastructure, cybersecurity systems, and intelligence gathering and analysis mechanisms. These initiatives highlight China’s attempt to enable standardization within the PLA’s military operations to enhance its overall efficiency, effectiveness, and combat readiness. Streamlining key processes, including operational logistics, equipment maintenance, and strategic communication networks, would help the PLA to accelerate achieving capabilities to perform multi-domain integrated joint operations. Standardization facilitates interoperability across services, theaters, and arms, resulting in seamless coordination among ground, naval, air, space, and cyber units. Developing these capabilities is a prerequisite for conducting multi-domain integrated joint operations, a requirement for forceful Taiwan reunification. They are also indicative of the PLA’s steps toward achieving operational readiness. It is particularly relevant in regional and near-regional escalations, such as those in the South China Sea and the Western Pacific Ocean, which could be possibilities during the Taiwan reunification campaign. Resource Stockpiling Resource stockpiling is an important indicator of a nation’s preparedness for a potential conflict. It involves the systematic accumulation of critical materials, energy reserves, food supplies, and industrial inputs essential during wartime. Such activities are often undertaken to ensure self-sufficiency, mitigate vulnerabilities, and maintain resilience in the face of potential embargoes, trade disruptions, or blockades. Agricultural economist Gustavo F.C. Ferreira highlights in his testimony to the US-China Economy and Security Review Commission that China has been significantly increasing its energy resource reserves, particularly coal, crude oil, and natural gas. The country has built an extensive storage capacity for crude oil, estimated to exceed 1.8 billion barrels, including strategic petroleum reserves and underground storage facilities. Additionally, he points out that China’s coal production has ramped up aggressively, with approval of expansion projects equivalent to the European Union’s annual coal production in just one year. He notes that beyond energy resources, the stockpiling extends to other critical areas such as food (grains and protein sources), strategic metals (rare earth, copper, and lithium), and technological components (semiconductors). These measures are supported by state policies to reduce China’s reliance on global markets and ensure continued operation during a conflict or escalation. Similarly, there are reports about China’s record 105.03-million-metric-ton import of soybeans in 2024. This marks a 6.5 percent increase from 2023. This surge is possibly due to China’s efforts to prepare for a contingency, particularly in anticipation of intensified trade tensions with the United States. Researcher Zongyuan Zoe Liu’s work highlights China’s strategies to shield its economy from potential Western sanctions by drawing lessons from sanctions imposed on Russia. She notes China’s attempt to increase economic and technological self-sufficiencies by immunizing its economy against sanctions and building financial resilience against potential sanctions by the United States. Re-enlistment of Veterans Since 2017, the PLA has notified several enlistment orders for veterans with specific skill sets. A key focus has been the integration of veterans into civil-military roles. This is supported by policies to re-enlist them in specialized units adhering to Xi’s stated and revealed military goals for the PLA. For instance, in the case of Taiwan-focused operations, the PLA’s re-enlistment efforts focus on operational readiness by re-enlisting veterans skilled in amphibious operations, cyber warfare, and missile systems. Since 2022, there has been an emphasis on integrating these veterans into critical roles, such as reserve forces, militia coordination, and rapid mobilization units. Beyond these six measures, several other developments—China’s heavy investment in dual-use infrastructure such as ports and airfields on the east coast, development of amphibious and airborne military capabilities like the large Type 075 landing ships and Y-20 aircraft, investment in offensive intelligence and cyber capabilities, deployment of strategic missile systems like the DF-15 and DF-21, training of the maritime militia with the PLA and their expansion to support the armed forces whenever required, and the integration of real-time battlefield awareness via the BeiDou navigation system—are additional factors to conclusively determine the PLA’s intention and readiness for a potential reunification campaign with Taiwan. Conclusion It is a political decision to pursue the reunification campaign. Western scholars dismiss such arguments on the basis of the PLA’s perceived lack of military preparedness and the significant economic costs China would incur during and after a reunification attempt. However, as this essay highlights, China is keenly aware of these considerations and is taking proactive steps to limit the fallout, if not eliminate it. This essay doesn’t argue whether China would attempt a forceful unification campaign or the cost of its campaign. Instead, it argues that through a combination of military and civilian measures, an effort has been made to address the possible critical vulnerabilities in military and economic sectors. The question remains about the PLA’s ability to execute and sustain complex cross-strait operations, especially after targeted military purges in 2023 and 2024. Every measure mentioned here can be seen in isolation and not as a part of a complex puzzle that indicates that the PLA is preparing to invade Taiwan. However, these measures involve systemic integration with military logistics, enabling rapid deployment and sustainability when required. A steady accumulation of capabilities indicates deliberate preparation for eventualities that may align with China’s political-military objectives across the Taiwan Strait.

Forceful Taiwan Reunification: China’s Targeted Military And Civi...	By Suyash Desai (FPRI) -- For nearly a century, the People’s Republic of China (PRC) and Taiwan have largely avoided direct military confrontations across the Taiwan Strait. However, there have been four notable exceptions: the Taiwan Strait crises of 1954–55, 1958, 1995–96, and most recently, 2022–23. In the first three instances, the status quo was primarily restored following the crisis. However, recent events suggest worrying trends highlighting that Beijing is preparing for a forceful reunification with Taiwan. Chinese Communist Party (CCP) General Secretary Xi Jinping has already made reunification with Taiwan a part of his signature China Dream, announced during the 19th Party Congress meeting in 2017. However, this was not the first time Taiwan was featured prominently in speeches by top Chinese leaders. As political scientist Ketian Zhang highlights in her book China’s Gambit: The Calculus of Coercion, annexing Taiwan is considered a core interest of China, with official references to its significance appearing regularly since 2003. The most recent instance was Xi Jinping’s New Year’s speech on December 31, 2024, where he declared, 'No one can stop the historical trend of reunification of the motherland' (誰也不能充實祖國統一的歷史大勢). But beyond rhetoric and political posturing, the Chinese People’s Liberation Army (PLA) has taken concrete measures over the past decade to advance Beijing’s reunification agenda. Since the COVID-19 pandemic, these measures have intensified, reinforcing China’s willingness to use force. This article highlights the PLA’s systematic and incremental military and civilian-military measures—capabilities that might provide China with the tools to successfully conduct a potential forceful reunification with Taiwan in the near future. These measures include changing the institutions and patterns of PLA mobilization, constructing and using civilian infrastructure in military exercises, and establishing a new status quo through increasingly coercive military exercises around Taiwan. They also include standardization of the PLA for greater efficiency, effectiveness, combat readiness, stockpiling resources, and re-enlisting veterans with specific skills. This article builds upon Oriana Skylar Mastro’s arguments in her piece 'The Taiwan Temptation,' which contends that China’s expanding military capabilities and rising nationalism could drive Beijing to contemplate using force for reunification with Taiwan. It identifies granular military details, especially post-2020, but it doesn’t venture into arguments about the timing of the reunification, potential diplomatic backlash, or economic costs of the invasion. Recent Military-Civilian Measures Since 2015, the PRC has undertaken significant organizational, legal, and structural reforms to enhance the National Defense Mobilization System (NDMS) (國防動員系統). As China scholar Devin Thorne highlights in his recent testimony to the US-China Economic and Security Review Commission, NDMS enables the PRC to harness its political, economic, technological, cultural, social, and other civilian resources from peacetime to wartime. This helps China to address a wide range of threats, such as escalations on its border, domestic instabilities, natural disasters, and other crises. It also bolsters China’s military logistics. As Thorne highlights, the key developments include the enactment of the National Defense Transportation Law in 2017, the introduction of updated auditing and surveying data on natural resources protocols in 2018 and 2021, the establishment of new NDMS offices beginning in December 2022, the creation of a new type of highly trained and professional local militia force since 2021, and the enhancement of cross-militia training initiatives starting in 2024.

Renewed US–China Tensions Spell Trouble For Australia’s Economy –...	By Madison Cartwright Trump 2.0 is in full swing and it is already causing major anxieties for the global economy. Australia must navigate US–China tensions with careful consideration of its economic realities. Ongoing negotiations for exemptions from US President Donald Trump’s proposed tariffs on imported metals do not shield Australia from reinvigorated US protectionism, especially as most of Trump’s ire has been targeted at China. While Australia’s trade relationship with China gets a lot of attention, its importance is not always fully grasped. Australia’s access to the Chinese market has significantly impacted how Australia’s political economy developed, creating path dependencies that are costly to break. The China-fuelled mining boom of the 2000s influenced the allocation of economic resources, raised its standard of living and affected its political culture. It has also shaped expectations on government dealings with issues like fiscal policy and economic prosperity that benefit from the booming Chinese commodity imports and deflationary exports. What about now? When China banned Australian coal imports in 2020, many assumed that the industry would be devastated. Yet it was not. Australia found other buyers for its coal. In 2021, China accounted for less than 1 per cent of its coal exports, even as Australia’s total coal exports increased by US$19 billion. By 2023, trade in coal had resumed but China still accounted for only 8 per cent of Australian coal exports, less than half the share in 2020. If Australia could adapt to losing the Chinese market for its coal, will Trump’s tariffs on China really be so bad? It is important not to draw the wrong lessons from this experience. Australia’s vulnerability lies in how much its exports rely on the Chinese market, the high share of these goods on Australia’s total exports and China’s share of the market for these goods globally. Energy is crucial to Australia’s trade with China, but its most important commodity is by far iron ore. In 2023, China purchased 84 per cent of Australia’s US$85.4 billion iron ore exports. Iron ore accounted for 23 per cent of Australia’s total exports in 2023. Finding alternative buyers would be difficult — China purchased 69 per cent of global iron ore exports in the same year. Australia’s third largest export is petroleum gas, with a 13 per cent share of its export mix. China, the largest importer of petroleum gas in the world, accounts for just under a third of these exports. China is a big importer of Australian services as well as goods. In the 2024 financial year, China was the largest importer of Australian education services, with a 24 per cent share. Australia’s trade surplus with China accounted for 4 per cent of its GDP in the 2024 financial year. The growth in the trade surplus with China also accounted for 10 per cent of the growth in GDP — measured in current prices — from 2023–24. If the trade surplus with China was to shrink or even fail to grow due to tariffs imposed by Trump, it would have a significant impact on Australia’s economy. Australia must also understand that the threat is not just tariffs or Trump. Political consensus on US–China economic relations is souring in the United States. Trump started the trade war with China in 2018, but president Joe Biden retained the Trump-era tariffs. Trump first sanctioned Huawei and proposed a ban on TikTok, but Biden expanded these sanctions to the entire Chinese semiconductor industry and shepherded a TikTok ban through Congress. China is flexing its economic power too, imposing its own export bans on materials used in semiconductor manufacturing. Rising economic tensions between the United States and China is the new normal — and Australia is caught in the middle. The big risk for Australia is increasing US demands on its allies to join efforts to decouple from China. This is happening in semiconductors already. Can we expect the United States to demand Australia to follow a path of decoupling from China or else face sanctions, risks to AUKUS and ANZUS or other forms of coercion? And what would that mean for Australia’s economy, standard of living and political stability? These are the questions Canberra should be considering. Decoupling from China will be costly for Australia not just because of exports. If Australia and other US allies stop buying Chinese computers, toys or smartphones, where will they turn? China supplies 49, 60 and 59 per cent of global exports of these products respectively and dominates many other markets. Of course, all of this could be manufactured elsewhere, but that would require substantial investment in domestic manufacturing or foreign production. It could also significantly increase inflation, as new manufacturing would likely incur higher costs. Meanwhile, Australia’s ability to afford these higher priced imports would weaken as foreign exchange earnings from commodity exports and mining investments decline, ultimately lowering incomes. Despite the legitimate security concerns over China’s policies, Australia must be realistic about its economic vulnerabilities. The Australian government should embrace the ‘pragmatic’ approach that had previously characterised Australia’s foreign policy towards China. Policymakers should also focus on deepening ties within the Asia Pacific to reduce Australia’s security reliance on the United States and economic reliance on China. Existing institutions, such as the ASEAN-centred Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership, provide good mediums to engage with China productively. Cooperation with other regional actors which face common challenges is key to navigating the ramifications of rising great power tensions.

Renewed US–China Tensions Spell Trouble For Australia’s Economy –...	By Madison Cartwright Trump 2.0 is in full swing and it is already causing major anxieties for the global economy. Australia must navigate US–China tensions with careful consideration of its economic realities. Ongoing negotiations for exemptions from US President Donald Trump’s proposed tariffs on imported metals do not shield Australia from reinvigorated US protectionism, especially as most of Trump’s ire has been targeted at China. While Australia’s trade relationship with China gets a lot of attention, its importance is not always fully grasped. Australia’s access to the Chinese market has significantly impacted how Australia’s political economy developed, creating path dependencies that are costly to break. The China-fuelled mining boom of the 2000s influenced the allocation of economic resources, raised its standard of living and affected its political culture. It has also shaped expectations on government dealings with issues like fiscal policy and economic prosperity that benefit from the booming Chinese commodity imports and deflationary exports. What about now? When China banned Australian coal imports in 2020, many assumed that the industry would be devastated. Yet it was not. Australia found other buyers for its coal. In 2021, China accounted for less than 1 per cent of its coal exports, even as Australia’s total coal exports increased by US$19 billion. By 2023, trade in coal had resumed but China still accounted for only 8 per cent of Australian coal exports, less than half the share in 2020. If Australia could adapt to losing the Chinese market for its coal, will Trump’s tariffs on China really be so bad? It is important not to draw the wrong lessons from this experience. Australia’s vulnerability lies in how much its exports rely on the Chinese market, the high share of these goods on Australia’s total exports and China’s share of the market for these goods globally. Energy is crucial to Australia’s trade with China, but its most important commodity is by far iron ore. In 2023, China purchased 84 per cent of Australia’s US$85.4 billion iron ore exports. Iron ore accounted for 23 per cent of Australia’s total exports in 2023. Finding alternative buyers would be difficult — China purchased 69 per cent of global iron ore exports in the same year. Australia’s third largest export is petroleum gas, with a 13 per cent share of its export mix. China, the largest importer of petroleum gas in the world, accounts for just under a third of these exports. China is a big importer of Australian services as well as goods. In the 2024 financial year, China was the largest importer of Australian education services, with a 24 per cent share. Australia’s trade surplus with China accounted for 4 per cent of its GDP in the 2024 financial year. The growth in the trade surplus with China also accounted for 10 per cent of the growth in GDP — measured in current prices — from 2023–24. If the trade surplus with China was to shrink or even fail to grow due to tariffs imposed by Trump, it would have a significant impact on Australia’s economy. Australia must also understand that the threat is not just tariffs or Trump. Political consensus on US–China economic relations is souring in the United States. Trump started the trade war with China in 2018, but president Joe Biden retained the Trump-era tariffs. Trump first sanctioned Huawei and proposed a ban on TikTok, but Biden expanded these sanctions to the entire Chinese semiconductor industry and shepherded a TikTok ban through Congress. China is flexing its economic power too, imposing its own export bans on materials used in semiconductor manufacturing. Rising economic tensions between the United States and China is the new normal — and Australia is caught in the middle. The big risk for Australia is increasing US demands on its allies to join efforts to decouple from China. This is happening in semiconductors already. Can we expect the United States to demand Australia to follow a path of decoupling from China or else face sanctions, risks to AUKUS and ANZUS or other forms of coercion? And what would that mean for Australia’s economy, standard of living and political stability? These are the questions Canberra should be considering.

Why Did The ICC Arrest Ex-Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte? –...	By Jason Gutierrez Former Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte is in custody after authorities in his home country arrested him on a warrant from the International Criminal Court and put him on a plane bound for the Netherlands, where the world court is headquartered. Philippine authorities had served Duterte with an arrest warrant from the ICC, as part of the court’s years-long investigation into his past administration’s bloody crackdown on illegal drugs. The 79-year-old Duterte was arrested in Manila on Tuesday as he disembarked from a flight from Hong Kong. He was held for hours at an air base next to Manila’s international airport before being put on another plane that whisked him away to The Hague. Here’s what you need to know about the ICC arrest order against Duterte: What are the potential charges against Duterte? As detailed in the ICC warrant, the former leader stands accused of committing crimes against humanity in connection with thousands of killings that occurred during a counter-narcotics crackdown under his watch as president (2016-22) and dating back to 2011, when he served as mayor of southern Davao city. Human Rights Watch and other rights advocacy group have said that the police under Duterte had regularly falsified evidence to justify the killings of suspected drug dealers and addicts. The Philippine government has given conflicting figures on how many people were killed in his administration’s so-called drug war. The last figure it gave was 6,252 suspects, who were killed from July 1, 2016 to May 31, 2022. Rights groups, however, have put the death toll as high as 20,000-plus. They have noted that statistics for many of those who were killed had been placed into the government’s 'death under investigation' category, and were therefore not logged as fatalities of Duterte’s anti-narcotics campaign. What evidence is there that Philippine police used excessive force? Evidence has been piling up. Eight police officers have so far been convicted of murder carried out in the name of the drug war. In June 2024, a court convicted four officers for the September 2016 killing of Luis Bonifacio, 45, and his 19-year-old son, Gabriel, inside their home. The court had said the victims’ injuries – including multiple gunshot wounds to their bodies – 'glaringly show the brutality employed upon them, despite the pleading for mercy of the victims.' In November 2018, a court in northern Manila convicted three police officers for killing 17-year-old teenager Kian Loyd delos Santos while he begged for mercy. It was not a shootout as police had claimed, and evidence later showed that he was also mistakenly killed. His death galvanized opposition to Duterte’s drug war. In March 2023, another policeman was found guilty of torturing two teenagers who were later found dead. Duterte has made no effort to hide his 'kill, kill, kill' order, and during his appearance before Congress in October, doubled down on his reason for doing so. 'If you think you will be killed, shoot him in the head. That would be one less criminal,' Duterte had said. He also admitted to the existence of his own private army, 'I can make the confession now if you want. I’m really doing it, but don’t involve the police,' Duterte told the hearing. 'I have a death squad, seven men, but they’re not police. They’re gangsters.' The former president refused to name them. Is the ICC arrest warrant still valid, given that the Philippines withdrew from the world court under President Duterte? The warrant is valid because the ICC jurisdiction covers crimes that took place before the Philippines withdrew from the statute that created the international court, which is based in The Hague, Netherlands. However, crimes committed after the country’s withdrawal – which took effect on March 17, 2019 – aren’t covered. Does the ICC still have jurisdiction over Philippine cases? As a court of last resort, the ICC prosecutes cases only when a government is unwilling or unable to do so 'genuinely.' Duterte’s arrest on Tuesday was a sign that the ICC felt that the Philippines could not or would not conduct genuine investigations into the allegations. What are the political ramifications of Duterte’s international arrest? The Duterte and Marcos families are two of the leading political families in the Philippines. But Rodrigo Duterte has been openly feuding with his successor, President Ferdinand Marcos Jr., and has repeatedly taunted the chief executive in public appearances. Sara Duterte, Marcos’ vice president, is the former leader’s daughter. Despite leading in popularity surveys before the 2022 presidential election, Sara Duterte successfully opted to contest the polls as Marcos’ running mate. The political alliance, which trampled the opposition in the May 2022 national polls, ended acrimoniously amid pressure on the Marcos government to allow an international investigation into the drug war waged by former President Duterte. Last month, the House of Representatives impeached Sara Duterte for alleged constitutional violations, corruption, plotting to assassinate Marcos, betrayal of public trust and other high crimes – accusations which her family rejected as 'political persecution.' She is expected to face an impeachment trial before the Senate later this year.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWenZ2DRxfCFlKAsEdqddXRp	2025-03-11T17:45:46-07:00

Conclave: Is A Hungarian Pope In The Smoke? – Analysis	Prominent among candidates to succeed Pope Francis is Hungary’s primate, Cardinal Peter Erdo. His potential election raises questions about both the direction of global Catholicism and Viktor Orban’s scope to wield influence through the Vatican. By Alexander Faludy The 72-year-old Hungarian primate Peter Erdo is tipped as a frontrunner among the candidates to succeed Pope Francis: the 88-year-old pontiff has now been under treatment in Rome’s Gemelli hospital for over three weeks, where his condition continues to be described as 'complex'. Cardinal Erdo is a popular figure internationally among conservative Catholics, and has had a close – if sometimes complicated – relationship with Hungary’s nationalist-populist government since Fidesz returned to power in 2010. Erdo became archbishop of Esztergom-Budapest, and a cardinal, in 2003. A distinguished church lawyer, he first developed an international profile by leading the Council of Bishops' Conferences of Europe (CCEE), the representative body for Europe’s Catholic bishops, from 2006 to 2016. As rapporteur for the global Synod on the Family (2014-15), he resisted radical change to the church’s approach to divorced and gay Christians. His efforts, although not fully successful in halting reforms, won him sympathy among conservatives in Africa and America. More recently, his response to Pope Francis’s decree Fiducia Supplicans (December 2023), which permitted priests to bless same-sex couples informally, challenged the Vatican position. Preaching at midnight mass in Budapest’s St Stephen’s Basilica in December 2023, Erdo stated: 'If we are Christians, we must not only follow a pious philanthropic philosophy, perhaps with content that changes every decade according to fashion.' Instead, he said, 'the teachings, life, death and resurrection of Jesus are the eternal standard.' His words were widely viewed as a veiled criticism of the decree. Even so, Erdo, who is generally guarded in public statements, may still be able to position himself as a compromise candidate, offering the church an interval of calm after a period of accelerated change under Pope Francis. 'He is conservative but not reactionary, and comes across as both pragmatic and diplomatic,' observes Zoltan Laky, a Catholic journalist with the Hungarian outlet Valasz Online. While resistant to radical departures from church teaching, Erdo 'lacks the confrontational tone of some traditionalists', Laky continues, meaning that in the conclave he could 'appeal to both traditionalists and to moderate progressives as a stabilising force'. Orban’s man in the Vatican? The degree of Hungarian government interest in Erdo’s possible election worries some observers. Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban hinted at his concern with the topic in his annual set-piece policy speech at the Fidesz summer camp in the Romanian spa town of Ballie Tusnad in July 2024. Citing a number of historical missteps from which Hungary should learn lessons for its geopolitical positioning, Orban included the country’s failure in 1513 to secure the papal election of the Hungarian candidate Tamas Bakocz. This has prompted obvious questions about the example’s contemporary relevance. Fidesz communications efforts reveal clear signs of support for Erdo’s papal candidacy. According to BIRN’s sources, Catholic Church affairs are a 'restricted topic' for the government- and Fidesz-controlled media in Hungary, one on which journalists are known to require special clearance to write about. Notably, each time Erdo’s possible election to the papacy is mentioned in the foreign press, that is immediately reported by such outlets as a news item in its own right. Hungarian reporting of the foreign coverage is then, in turn, amplified in English translation on the websites of Fidesz-organised ‘civil’ organisations, suggesting a co-ordinated strategy to drive discussion of the topic. Erdo’s candidacy may also have been boosted by the 2021 International Eucharistic Congress in Budapest, attended by several hundred bishops and cardinals from around the world. This congress provided Erdo with a platform to impress peers and make useful connections, The event was underwritten by the Hungarian state at a cost of about 80 million euros. Such an approach would echo, in both objective and technique, the successful efforts of Hungary’s Cold War Communist regime to secure the election of Bishop Zoltan Kaldy as president of the Lutheran World Federation (LWF). The latter was achieved at the 1984 meeting of the LWF General Assembly in Budapest, again hosted at government expense and preceded by a focused international influence campaign lasting several years. Lately, Hungary has also played host to a number of individual visits by cardinal electors (and potential electors) attending conferences and events at a frequency surprising relative to Hungary’s size and location. Program costs for such visits are underwritten by government bodies, including the Prime Minister’s Office and the State Secretariat for Assisting Persecuted Christians. A mixed record During the 2015 migration crisis, Erdo declined to criticise the government’s hostile messaging about migrants, and in 2016 stormed out of a live TV interview when asked if Fidesz’s vilification of asylum-seekers was compatible with Catholic teaching on compassion for such people. He has also been silent in the face of the effective criminalisation of homelessness in a 2018 annexe to the constitution and the introduction of Russian-style legislation stigmatising the LGBTQ+ community in 2021. 'Not once did Peter Erdo speak out; he did not take the opportunity of prophetic criticism,' accuses Dr Rita Perintfalvi, a lay Catholic theologian from Hungary who teaches at the University of Graz in Austria. Indeed, Perintfalvi claims that when it comes to the mistreatment of vulnerable minorities, 'it has become clear that if Peter Erdo has to choose between papal guidance and the Hungarian government’s view on how churches should behave, he will always choose the latter.' The cardinal has also been notably silent on democratic backsliding in Hungary, rampant corruption, and the restriction of freedom of religion or belief for smaller faith communities. Yet Erdo’s relationship with Fidesz has not always been smooth. He opposed introducing compulsory religious education in Hungary’s state schools in 2013, warning it would compromise the viability of church youth groups, and he critiqued the quality of religion textbooks devised by government educators to support the curriculum. His opposition, together with other bishops, to the nationalisation of Hungary’s IVF clinics, citing church teaching on bioethics, caused an 18-month delay in implementing the policy while Fidesz unsuccessfully sought compromise with the church. The dispute occasioned public friction with then families minister (and later president) Katalin Novak. Overall, according to Zoltan Laky, 'While he [Erdo] hasn’t fully upheld the Church’s independence from political entanglements, neither did he align as closely with Viktor Orban’s government as have some other bishops.' Perintfalvi is more pessimistic: 'At a time when we are on the brink of the third world war and when Western civilisation, democracy and the future of human rights are at stake, I think the election of such a man as pope would be a disaster.'	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWenZ2DRxfCFlA8wE549_9fD	2025-03-11T17:44:06-07:00

Ukraine World’s Biggest Arms Importer: US’ Dominance Of Global Ar...	Ukraine became the world’s largest importer of major arms in the period 2020–24, with its imports increasing nearly 100 times over compared with 2015–19. European arms imports overall grew by 155 per cent between the same periods, as states responded to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and uncertainty over the future of US foreign policy. The United States further increased its share of global arms exports to 43 per cent, while Russia’s exports fell by 64 per cent, according to new data on international arms transfers published by the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI), The overall volume of arms transfers globally remained at roughly the same level as in 2015–19 and 2010–14 (but was 18 per cent higher than in 2005–2009), as increasing imports in Europe and the Americas were offset by decreases in other regions. The top 10 arms exporters in 2020–24 were the same as those in 2015–19 but Russia (accounting for 7.8 per cent of global arms exports) fell to third place behind France (9.6 per cent), while Italy (4.8 per cent) jumped from 10th to sixth place. At least 35 states sent weapons to Ukraine after Russia’s full-scale invasion in 2022, and substantial further deliveries are in the pipeline. Ukraine received 8.8 per cent of global arms imports in 2020–24. Most of the major arms supplied to Ukraine came from the USA (45 per cent), followed by Germany (12 per cent) and Poland (11 per cent). Ukraine was the only European state among the top 10 importers in 2020–24, although many other European states significantly increased their arms imports in the period. ‘The new arms transfers figures clearly reflect the rearmament taking place among states in Europe in response to the threat from Russia,’ said Mathew George, Programme Director with the SIPRI Arms Transfers Programme. ‘However, some major arms importers, including Saudi Arabia, India and China, saw large declines in import volumes for a variety of reasons, despite high threat perceptions in their regions.’ European NATO members increase dependence on US-supplied arms Arms imports by the European NATO members more than doubled between 2015–19 and 2020–24 (+105 per cent). The USA supplied 64 per cent of these arms, a substantially larger share than in 2015–19 (52 per cent). The other main suppliers were France and South Korea (accounting for 6.5 per cent each), Germany (4.7 per cent) and Israel (3.9 per cent). ‘With an increasingly belligerent Russia and transatlantic relations under stress during the first Trump presidency, European NATO states have taken steps to reduce their dependence on arms imports and to strengthen the European arms industry,’ said Pieter Wezeman, Senior Researcher with the SIPRI Arms Transfers Programme. ‘But the transatlantic arms-supply relationship has deep roots. Imports from the USA have risen and European NATO states have almost 500 combat aircraft and many other weapons still on order from the USA.’ USA further increases its share of arms exports, while Russian exports slide Arms exports by the USA increased by 21 per cent between 2015–19 and 2020–24, and its share of global arms exports grew from 35 per cent to 43 per cent. The USA supplied major arms to 107 states in 2020–24. For the first time in two decades, the largest share of US arms exports in 2020–24 went to Europe (35 per cent) rather than the Middle East (33 per cent). Nevertheless, the top single recipient of US arms was Saudi Arabia (12 per cent of US arms exports). ‘The USA is in a unique position when it comes to arms exports. At 43 per cent, its share of global arms exports is more than four times as much as the next-largest exporter, France,’ said Mathew George. ‘The USA continues to be the supplier of choice for advanced long-range strike capabilities like combat aircraft.’ In contrast to the USA, arms exports by Russia fell sharply (–64 per cent) between 2015–19 and 2020–24. The decline started before Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022: in 2020 and 2021 export volumes were much smaller than in any year in the previous two decades. ‘The war against Ukraine has further accelerated the drop in Russia’s arms exports because more weapons are needed on the battlefield, trade sanctions make it harder for Russia to produce and sell its weapons, and the USA and its allies pressure states not to buy Russian arms,’ said Pieter Wezeman. ‘Two of Russia’s most important arms-trading relationships had already weakened before 2022, with India increasingly favouring other suppliers, and China sourcing more arms from its own burgeoning arms industry.’ Russia delivered major arms to 33 states in 2020–24. Two thirds of Russian arms exports went to three states: India (38 per cent), China (17 per cent) and Kazakhstan (11 per cent). France became the world’s second largest arms supplier in 2020–24, delivering arms to 65 states. France’s exports of major arms to other European states almost trebled between 2015–19 and 2020–24 (+187 per cent). This was mainly due to deliveries of combat aircraft to Greece and Croatia, and arms supplies to Ukraine after Russia’s full-scale invasion in 2022. Nevertheless, India received by far the largest share of French arms exports (28 per cent)—almost twice the share that went to all European recipients combined (15 per cent). The second largest recipient of major arms from France was Qatar (9.7 per cent of French arms exports). China was the fourth largest exporter of arms in 2020–24, with 5.9 per cent of global arms exports. Despite China’s efforts to increase its arms exports, many large importers do not buy Chinese arms for political reasons. Asia and Oceania remains largest arms-importing region; China’s imports more than halve The share of global arms transfers going to states in Asia and Oceania fell from 41 per cent to 33 per cent between 2015–19 and 2020–24. A 21 per cent drop in imports to the region was in large part due to arms imports by China shrinking by 64 per cent between the two periods, as it increasingly substituted imports—mainly from Russia—with locally designed and produced weapon systems. China’s arms imports are likely to keep falling as the capacity of its domestic arms industry grows. Four states in Asia and Oceania ranked among the 10 largest arms importers globally in 2020–24: India, Pakistan, Japan and Australia. China dropped out of the top 10 arms importers for the first time since 1990–94. The main suppliers to the region in 2020–24 were the USA, which accounted for 37 per cent of regional arms imports, Russia (17 per cent) and China (14 per cent). India was the world’s second largest arms importer, with its imports reflecting perceived threats from both China and Pakistan. However, its imports decreased by 9.3 per cent between 2015–19 and 2020–24. The largest share of Indian arms imports (36 per cent) came from Russia, a significantly smaller share than in 2015–19 (55 per cent) and 2010–14 (72 per cent). Arms imports by Pakistan grew by 61 per cent between 2015–19 and 2020–24. China became even more dominant as its supplier, accounting for 81 per cent of Pakistan’s arms imports in 2020–24, compared with 74 per cent in 2015–19. With the sharp drop in China’s arms imports, and marked decreases in imports by Taiwan (–27 per cent) and South Korea (–24 per cent), arms imports by East Asian states shrank by 22 per cent between 2015–19 and 2020–24. Japan (+93 per cent) was the only East Asian state that saw an increase in its arms imports. ‘While arms imports to Europe and the Middle East continue to grab media attention, Asia and Oceania remained the largest arms-importing region in the world in 2020–24, as it has been almost invariably since the early 1990s,’ said Siemon Wezeman, Senior Researcher with the SIPRI Arms Transfers Programme. ‘Threat perceptions concerning China are behind much of the arms procurement in the region.’ Middle East arms imports dip Arms imports by states in the Middle East fell by 20 per cent between 2015–19 and 2020–24. Four of the top 10 global importers in 2020–24 were in the Middle East: Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Egypt and Kuwait. Qatar was the world’s third largest arms importer in 2020–24 (up from 10th largest in 2015–19). Between 2015–19 and 2020–24, Saudi Arabia’s arms imports decreased by 41 per cent. More than half of arms imports to the Middle East came from the USA (52 per cent), while 13 per cent came from Italy, 9.8 per cent from France and 7.6 per cent from Germany. ‘Regional conflicts and tensions continue to drive demand for arms imports in the Middle East,’ said Zain Hussain, Researcher with the SIPRI Arms Transfers Programme. ‘Given the volume of pending deliveries, the Middle East will remain a major arms-importing region.’ Despite the ongoing war in Gaza, arms imports by Israel remained largely stable between 2015–19 and 2020–24. In 2020–24 the USA supplied the biggest share of Israel’s arms imports (66 per cent), followed by Germany (33 per cent) and Italy (1.0 per cent). Israel was the 15th largest arms importer globally in 2020–24, down from 14th in 2015–19. ‘Israel has received substantial military aid from the USA following the Hamas-led attack on 7 October 2023,’ said Zain Hussain. ‘However, for its recent military operations, Israel has employed mainly US-supplied weapons it had received earlier. Israel’s adversaries Hamas, Hezbollah and the Houthis have relied on Iranian arms, and Hezbollah and the Houthis have used Iranian-supplied missiles and drones against Israel.’ Insecurity and conflict drive large increase in arms imports to West Africa Arms transfers to West Africa have been rising sharply in the past 15 years as the security situation has deteriorated. The combined arms imports of West African states almost doubled (+82 per cent) between 2010–14 and 2020–24. Nigeria accounted for by far the biggest share (34 per cent) of arms imports to West Africa in 2020–24. ‘The growth in arms imports to West Africa has been striking. While the volume of imports remains relatively small, it has important geopolitical implications,’ said Katarina Djokic, Researcher with the SIPRI Arms Transfers Programme. ‘States like Burkina Faso, Mali and Senegal seem to be rapidly increasing their imports. Arms suppliers are using arms exports to boost their influence in this part of the world, including emerging suppliers—primarily Türkiye—alongside more established actors such as China, France, Russia and the USA.’ Other notable developments African arms imports fell by 44 per cent between 2015–19 and 2020–24. This was mainly due to large decreases in imports by Algeria (–73 per cent) and Morocco (–26 per cent). Arms imports by states in sub-Saharan Africa increased by 4.2 per cent. Combat aircraft are the main long-range strike weapon imported by states, but interest in long-range land-attack missiles is increasing. In 2020–24 the USA supplied 45 per cent of global long-range land-attack missile exports, delivering them to 7 states, with deliveries to 13 states pending. Arms imports by states in the Americas increased by 13 per cent. The USA was the biggest importer in the region (accounting for 3.1 per cent of global arms imports and 50 per cent of imports by states in the Americas). Brazil’s arms imports increased by 77 per cent between 2015–19 and 2020–24, and accounted for 49 per cent of all arms imports to South America in 2020–24. The main suppliers to South America in 2020–24 were France (accounting for 30 per cent of South American arms imports), the USA (12 per cent) and the UK (11 per cent). North Korea exported artillery and missiles to Russia for use in Ukraine. With this, both states violated the United Nations sanctions on North Korea.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWenZ2DRxfCFlBG2QUsGO5nU	2025-03-11T17:42:06-07:00	
Ukraine World’s Biggest Arms Importer: US’ Dominance Of Global Ar...	Ukraine became the world’s largest importer of major arms in the period 2020–24, with its imports increasing nearly 100 times over compared with 2015–19. European arms imports overall grew by 155 per cent between the same periods, as states responded to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and uncertainty over the future of US foreign policy. The United States further increased its share of global arms exports to 43 per cent, while Russia’s exports fell by 64 per cent, according to new data on international arms transfers published by the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI), The overall volume of arms transfers globally remained at roughly the same level as in 2015–19 and 2010–14 (but was 18 per cent higher than in 2005–2009), as increasing imports in Europe and the Americas were offset by decreases in other regions. The top 10 arms exporters in 2020–24 were the same as those in 2015–19 but Russia (accounting for 7.8 per cent of global arms exports) fell to third place behind France (9.6 per cent), while Italy (4.8 per cent) jumped from 10th to sixth place. At least 35 states sent weapons to Ukraine after Russia’s full-scale invasion in 2022, and substantial further deliveries are in the pipeline. Ukraine received 8.8 per cent of global arms imports in 2020–24. Most of the major arms supplied to Ukraine came from the USA (45 per cent), followed by Germany (12 per cent) and Poland (11 per cent).

Ukraine Agrees To US-Brokered Cease-Fire Deal, Unlocking Military...	By Reid Standish (RFE/RL) -- Ukraine has agreed to a US proposal for a 30-day cease-fire in the war against the Russian invasion, prompting the United States to say it would immediately lift the suspension of military aid, including the sharing of intelligence. The outcome of nine hours of talks on March 11 in Jeddah marked a stunning turnaround less than two weeks after an acrimonious meeting between US President Donald Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. The clash between the two leaders preceded the US pause in aid and limits on intelligence sharing, which the United States said were imposed because of doubts that Ukraine was committed to seeking peace. 'The President wanted this war to end yesterday... So our hope is that the Russians will answer 'yes' as quickly as possible, so we can get to the second phase of this, which is real negotiations,' US Secretary of State Marco Rubio told reporters after the agreement was announced. A joint statement issued by the two countries said Ukraine expressed a 'readiness' to accept the US proposal to enact an immediate, interim 30-day cease-fire, 'which can be extended by mutual agreement of the parties, and which is subject to acceptance and concurrent implementation by the Russian Federation.' Speaking to reporters in Washington, Trump said a meeting with Russia would take place later on March 11 or the following day. Rubio, who attended the talks in Saudi Arabia along with national-security adviser Mike Waltz, said the cease-fire plan puts the ball in Russia’s court. 'We’re going to tell them this is what’s on the table,' he said of Russian President Vladimir Putin’s government. 'Ukraine is ready to stop shooting and start talking. And now it’ll be up to them to say yes or no.' Russian officials have repeatedly said that they want a comprehensive peace deal, not a cease-fire or other temporary arrangement. Russia's Foreign Ministry said it wouldn't rule out contacts with US officials over next several days, but gave no further comment. The US and Ukrainian delegations said they also discussed the importance of humanitarian relief efforts as part of the peace process, particularly during the cease-fire, including the exchange of prisoners of war, the release of civilian detainees, and the return of forcibly transferred Ukrainian children. 'I have confirmation that the security assistance from the United States has been restored,' Pavlo Palisa, deputy head of the Ukrainian President's Office and a member of the delegation, said in a post on Facebook. 'Arrangements are starting to be fulfilled.' In addition, Ukraine and the United States agreed to conclude a pact on joint development of Ukrainian critical minerals and other resources as soon as possible. That deal had been expected to be signed at the White House meeting on February 28, but Zelenskyy left early after the argument in the Oval Office, leaving it in limbo. The talks were closely watched across Europe, which has grown concerned Washington's renewed contacts with the Kremlin would sideline both Kyiv and Brussels from the peace process. British Prime Minister Keir Starmer, who recently traveled to the White House to meet Trump, congratulated the US and Ukrainian delegations, saying it is now up to Moscow to end the fighting. European Union Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said the proposal for a ceasefire agreement and the resumption of U.S. intelligence sharing and security assistance was a welcome development.'This is a positive development that can be a step towards a comprehensive, just and lasting peace for Ukraine. The ball is now in Russia’s court,' she added. The talks in Jeddah on March 11 followed a large-scale Ukrainian drone attack that struck the Moscow region and other Russian provinces overnight, killing three people. John Herbst, a former US ambassador to Ukraine, said before the joint statement that restoring intelligence cooperation should be seen as a positive result for Kyiv. He also said sequencing in future negotiations will be crucial. While an early cease-fire can be key part of a future peace process, he stresses that it's important that it be followed by further steps toward a lasting peace deal, such as continued military shipments to Ukraine, a potential demilitarized zone, and a greater role for European countries, including their forces deployed as peacekeepers. 'These are all serious ideas that have been floated,' Herbst said. 'That might not be a just peace, because a just peace wouldn’t see Ukraine have to concede territory, but it could still be a durable one that makes it very hard for Russia to renew aggression.' What Role Will Russia And Europe Play In Peace Talks? As Ukrainian and US officials met in Saudi Arabia, attention was also shifting to the other two players that will decide how the war ends: Russia and Kyiv’s European allies. Top military officials from more than 30 nations met in Paris on March 11 for talks on the creation of an international security force for Ukraine. The force is being envisaged by Britain and France. Its aim is to reassure Ukraine and deter another large-scale Russian offensive after any cease-fire. The force might include heavy weaponry and weapons stockpiles that could be rushed within hours or days to aid in Ukraine’s defense. Russia has so far said it is against accepting European troops in Ukraine as part of a deal. The Kremlin has also spoken about getting Western sanctions lifted on its economy as part of a peace process, including in Saudi Arabia where US and Russian officials held talks nearly a month ago. Marie Dumoulin, a former French diplomat and an analyst at the European Council on Foreign Relations, says that this gives European governments some leverage when the dust settles from the talks in Jeddah. She said that doubts remain in European capitals about whether Russia is willing to make any concessions of its own and that Europe can use both its own offer of security guarantees to Ukraine and the possibility of lifting European Union sanctions on Russia as a way to shape discussions in both Moscow and Washington. 'This gives Ukraine a few more cards to hold at the table,' Dumoulin told RFE/RL. 'These can give Ukraine some room to say whether the deal being offered to them is good enough yet or not.'	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWenZ2DRxfCFlIHs3l1_N3P3	2025-03-11T17:40:33-07:00

John Herbst, a former US ambassador to Ukraine, said before the joint statement that restoring intelligence cooperation should be seen as a positive result for Kyiv. He also said sequencing in future negotiations will be crucial. While an early cease-fire can be key part of a future peace process, he stresses that it's important that it be followed by further steps toward a lasting peace deal, such as continued military shipments to Ukraine, a potential demilitarized zone, and a greater role for European countries, including their forces deployed as peacekeepers. 'These are all serious ideas that have been floated,' Herbst said. 'That might not be a just peace, because a just peace wouldn’t see Ukraine have to concede territory, but it could still be a durable one that makes it very hard for Russia to renew aggression.' What Role Will Russia And Europe Play In Peace Talks? As Ukrainian and US officials met in Saudi Arabia, attention was also shifting to the other two players that will decide how the war ends: Russia and Kyiv’s European allies. Top military officials from more than 30 nations met in Paris on March 11 for talks on the creation of an international security force for Ukraine. The force is being envisaged by Britain and France. Its aim is to reassure Ukraine and deter another large-scale Russian offensive after any cease-fire. The force might include heavy weaponry and weapons stockpiles that could be rushed within hours or days to aid in Ukraine’s defense. Russia has so far said it is against accepting European troops in Ukraine as part of a deal. The Kremlin has also spoken about getting Western sanctions lifted on its economy as part of a peace process, including in Saudi Arabia where US and Russian officials held talks nearly a month ago. Marie Dumoulin, a former French diplomat and an analyst at the European Council on Foreign Relations, says that this gives European governments some leverage when the dust settles from the talks in Jeddah. She said that doubts remain in European capitals about whether Russia is willing to make any concessions of its own and that Europe can use both its own offer of security guarantees to Ukraine and the possibility of lifting European Union sanctions on Russia as a way to shape discussions in both Moscow and Washington. 'This gives Ukraine a few more cards to hold at the table,' Dumoulin told RFE/RL. 'These can give Ukraine some room to say whether the deal being offered to them is good enough yet or not.'	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfcyPosbFQglBCIcmNn89c7	2025-03-11T17:40:33-07:00	
What Was It Like for Our Sapiens Ancestors To Meet And Mix With C...	Between 50,000 and 35,000 years ago in Eurasia, the disappearance of hominin species or their biocultural assimilation with anatomically modern humans is one of the biggest questions in prehistory today. Until now, at least 14 different species have been assigned to the genus Homo since it emerged in Ethiopia some 2.8 million years ago revealing branching evolutionary stories of survival, intermixing, and extinctions. Archaeology is increasingly allowing us to glimpse into one of those epochs, from 50,000 to 35,000 years ago—the period of transition between the Middle and the Upper Paleolithic eras when modern humans emerged as the last representative of our genus on the planet. In 2017, new finds from the Jebel Irhoud site in Morocco were published, indicating that our species—H. sapiens—appeared on the scene as early as 300,000 years ago. Spreading into Eurasia l00,000 years later, these early anatomically modern humans rubbed shoulders with Neandertals and Denisovans, and may also have had encounters with five other distinct hominin populations that have only very recently been identified, including H. floresiensis, H. luzonensis, H. longi, and H. juluensis in Asia and Nesher Ramla Homo in the Levant. Given what we know from historical events that chronicle human population exchanges through time, many archeologists question whether the 'disappearances' of these other human lineages might have had anything to do with their coming into contact with modern humans. Taking an example of human interactions that took place more than half a millennium ago helps us to understand how these interactions can deeply impact the human condition on multiple levels, many of which would be incomprehensible in the prehistoric archeological record without written documents. The people of Western Europe living in hierarchized social configurations had reached a stage of technological readiness that led them to innovate ways to sustain life over extended periods of seafaring. As a result, they came into contact with the great civilizations established in the precolonial Americas over hundreds of generations. Before this encounter, the millions of people who lived in the Americas were oblivious to the existence of Europeans who would build powerful empires on the ruins of their treasured territorial and cultural heritage. The consequences of the ensuing exchanges were both cataclysmic and transformative. Notwithstanding their immeasurable human impact, this contact altered the course of animal demography and deeply affected the global distribution of countless species of plants and trees that the colonizing populations freely displaced and exploited to enrich their own countries. Against the backdrop of this extraordinary scenario was the unprecedented spread of bacterial, viral, and fungal assemblages that indelibly modified evolutionary systems established over millennia—decimating an estimated 90 percent of Indigenous populations in their wake soon after the consolidation of colonization. While it is difficult for us to conceive the magnitude of global turbulence generated after this event, we know that it led to a new world order that used human slavery to build systems of unidirectional wealth distribution whose ramifications still resound today. Written records provide information about this period of global turmoil that help us to build our understanding of complex events that occurred in the past. Thirty thousand years from now, how will the multilevel repercussions of this period of human history be reflected in the archeological record? Unlike the chaotic shifts that rocked the world at the cusp of the European Renaissance, archeologists studying the remote past cannot rely on written accounts of how ancient population interactions played out. In retrospect, it should be pointed out that the decimation of the Indigenous peoples of the Americas involved exchanges among a single human species, whereas the transition from the Middle to the Upper Paleolithic involved human forms with distinct or even mosaic genetic, anatomic and sociocultural traits, with only one species remaining by around 35,000 years ago. In conformity with the doctrines of their time, Europeans justified their actions by evoking cultural and racial differences that they believed made them superior to the populations they subjugated, while uneven levels of technological hegemony allowed them to consolidate domination. Scientific results emanating from ancient genomics are shedding light on these paleo-interactions and painting a new picture of how humanity evolved, migrated, adapted, and reproduced during this key period of prehistory. Each individual's genetic code is transcribed in the sequence of the base pairs composing the double-stranded helix of the DNA moleculecarrying biological information passed on by reproduction. Discrete sections of a DNA strand are composed of the genes that define phenotypic (observable) and genotypic (hidden) traits defining a population. Throughout the world today, the human genetic code differs between individuals by only around 0.1 percent. Under the right conditions, genetic data retrieved from ancient human fossils can be a powerful tool to study similarities and differences separating human lineages and is complementary to classical paleontological methods like Linnaean taxonomy and morphometric determination. Recent reconstructions of the genomic histories of fossil H. sapiens, Neandertals, and the Denisovans confirm not only that interspecific breeding took place but also that it produced fertile offspring, suggesting biological mixing played a role in the outcome of the modern human condition. Having successfully occupied a huge territorial range stretching from the Levant to Western Europe and northward into Siberia for thousands of generations, our cousin species H. neanderthalensis is at the center of the enigma. The paleo-genetic data obtained from Neandertal fossils indicates a complex scenario with physical encounters taking place with modern humans between 65,000 and 47,000 years ago. Meanwhile, a Neandertal genetic inheritance of between 1 and 4 percent has been documented in present-day non-African populations, and gene flow from early modern humans to some Neandertals also took place as early as 100,000 years ago. Analyzing genetic records from early modern humans living in Siberia and Central Europe 45,000-35,000 years ago revealed comparatively higher and relatively recent admixtures of Neandertal DNA, with these individuals believed to have contributed little to the gene pool of later European populations. In some cases, fossil human remains and their genomic signatures have even been found to display a mosaic of archaic and derived features, leading some paleoanthropologists to consider the possibility that Neandertals did not 'disappear,' but rather, they were assimilated into a modern human clade developing in Eurasia at the time. This raises the possibility of an ancestral population of anatomically modern humans that migrated out of Africa and subsequently underwent speciation as they spread into the ecologically diverse regions of Eurasia, where they evolved locally into diverse groups that occasionally interbred with one another, producing fertile offspring. From the Darwinian viewpoint, the decrease in Neandertal DNA genetic sequences shows that they were not selected in the natural evolutionary process that gave way to modern humans. To explore this puzzling scenario, some archeologists turn to the cultural record left behind by these ancient human groups. Specific methods applied to study human-made artifacts are used to link them to predefined stages of techno-social evolution traditionally equated with distinct cultural complexes. Since the early 20th century, prehistorians have ascribed these cultural entities to different types of humans. But the apparent inter-specific mixing evidenced by the genetic data and the emergence of H. sapiens far earlier than previously thought have contributed to changing this traditional human-culture equation. Once conveyed as brutish and primitive, Neandertals were alleged to have been incapable of matching the relatively 'advanced' esthetic and technological capacities of their modern human counterparts. But this premise has also changed with new data demonstrating that Neandertals lived in socially advanced groups, that they appear to have practiced some form of art and body ornamentation, and that they intentionally buried their dead, suggesting powerful symbolic and even ritual practices. So what do the artifacts tell us about the transitional period that saw the replacement of H. neanderthalensis by H. sapiens? A number of archeological sites preserve a record of this transitional phase, with Middle Paleolithic layers yielding the so-called Mousterian artifacts made from prepared stone cores attributed to Neandertals, overlain by strata containing Upper Paleolithic stone blades or bladelets attributed to H. sapiens. The blade industries attributed to modern humans are also associated with finely crafted bone, ivory, and antler artifacts, shell beads, ochre, and diverse forms of figurative art. Using detailed technological and typological criteria, archeologists further subdivide these cultural complexes, refining the cultural groupings to reconstruct a chrono-cultural framework reflecting human population turnover in time and space. Because only one species of Homo lived during the Upper Paleolithic (after around 35,000 years ago), changes observed in the tool kits are thought to reflect different traditions, rather than different hominins. These shifts are attributed to multiple factors, including cultural transmission through inter-populational contact. However, since multiple species of Homo were present during the Middle Paleolithic, cultural change is often thought to signal the disappearance of one lineage and its replacement by another. This begs the question: Do we observe a gradual or an abrupt transition from one phase to the next? If modern humans and Neandertals were interbreeding, then we might assume that they could also have exchanged cultural and technological know-how. This means that we might anticipate finding some blending of cultural evidence, just as we might expect to find hominin fossils with intermediate anatomical traits. Still, in most cases, the different cultural complexes defined for the Upper Paleolithic—generally beginning with the Early or Proto-Aurignacian cultures—appear sequentially above the Middle Paleolithic deposits, without intermixing of technological, typological, or stylistic features. Paradoxically, what we now know to have been a long period of contact between Neandertals and modern humans is not clearly reflected in the cultural materials found in the archeological record. But there are some intriguing exceptions. In Western and Central Europe, the Near East, and Siberia, where these intra-specific exchanges are being validated by paleo-genomics and comparative anatomy in several archeological sites, the 'intermediary' cultural scenarios are also becoming clearer. In some cases, transitional assemblages with elements inherited from the Middle Paleolithic combine with tools conveying innovative features commonly attributed to the Upper Paleolithic. For now, there is little consensus about which hominin was responsible for making these 'transitional' took kits in the timeframe that witnessed the disappearance or assimilation of the Neandertals and resulted in the ultimate domination of H. sapiens. Further research is needed to clarify humanity's complex evolutionary history that—in the 3 million years since the emergence of Homo—has only been condensed into a single representative species since around 35,000 years ago. When we compare this prehistoric chronicle to a transformative historical event for which we have a rich body of written information, we can see how huge revolutions can take place swiftly, almost imperceptibly, on the geological time scale. As archeologists discover more about the transitions in time that led us to where we are today, the subtleties of the complex biocultural mixing nascent to the contemporary globalization of our species are being revealed.

Remember Kerensky: The Failure of Reformist Regimes – OpEd	The Trump administration assumed power in the thick of public fury, following five years of brutal despotism, economic decline, and many years, if not decades, of declining trust. The intensity of the public mood is rarely reported by legacy media without condemnation. The denials of regime failure by the entire establishment in every sector has only caused incredulity to grow and spread. No matter how much you think people are angry, you are likely underestimating the level of public disgust with the regime, not just in the US but all over the industrialized world. In 2024, it reached such a fevered pitch that the seemingly impossible happened with the election of a former president who had been subject to nonstop media demonization, lawfare without precedent, and even assassination attempts. The attacks only helped him. Trump’s party was swept into power. That includes control of a Congress with many members who seem to be unaware of the urgency of the moment. Under such conditions, this cannot be the end of the story. There is a long history of reformist governments failing to act fast enough to quell public demand for change. It is typical that such governments underestimate the fire behind the historical forces at work. They come to believe that the problem is fixed by a personnel change, whereas the real issue is systemic and comprehensive. The classic case is Russia, 1917. The government of Alexander Kerensky (1881-1970) ruled Russia for only eight months, following the toppling of the Romanov monarchy and before the Bolshevik Revolution of October 1917. It was supposed to be an agent of calm reform; it ended as a parenthesis between the old regime and the new. Kerensky was a lawyer, a reformer, and a non-communist supporter of labor-led social democracy. Active in anti-government protests and denunciations for years, Kerensky seemed like the right man for the job. He had one foot in the old world and one in the new. On taking power, he found himself in the position of making judgments about the pace and path of reform efforts. He had to deal with a collapsing economy, revolutionary fervor among the workers and peasants, and grave suspicion toward the whole of the ruling classes, the military in particular. He proclaimed Russia to be a Republic of the Western variety and had every intention of holding elections and shepherding into being a new type of ruling regime in Russia. The war would end, land would go to the peasants, inflation would stop, and people would find their voice in government. Just not yet. It had to be orderly, in Kerensky’s view. His mistake was in thinking that he was in charge of the motion of history. He made a fateful judgment in thinking it was all about him and not the movement that gave rise to his position. He decided to continue the war and make one final push for victory. That included an intensification of conscription in the midst of inflation. That decision ended in disaster. What was he thinking? In his view, Russia had already sacrificed so much for the war effort. His plan was to make good on these sacrifices by granting the Russian people the pride of victory. He had hoped to tap into the magically forgiving power of patriotism, never more enlivened than by triumph in war. His gamble did not work out. His more fundamental error was in believing that his rule was more secure than it was. One can see why. The Russian state had a very long history of compelling assent. With church and state united, the public had a long history of acquiescence. He had not realized fully that the bond with the people broke when the Czar was unseated. Kerensky could not imagine the level of public doubt surrounding his position. He was brutal enough to draft people to get killed and maimed in war but lacked the military prowess and loyalty to enforce his new role. Plus, his stated role was to be provisional and bring about elections. That presented to the public a message of vulnerability. Meanwhile, in his own thinking, he was overly deferential to the financial and influence networks of the past. He wanted them on board with the next phase of Russian history, which he would lead. He underestimated the massive gap in perceptions that separated the ruling class and the people on the ground. He tried but failed to heal the chasm. The October Revolution seems inevitable in retrospect, but it was not. Had Kerensky acted quickly to dismantle the machinery of power, immediately withdraw the troops, unplug the money printers, and slash the spending and bureaucracy, his reformist efforts might have led to orderly elections and the normalization of society. Maybe. Instead, Russia experienced a revolution that began with great joy at home and abroad and quickly turned murderous as the entire royal family was slaughtered, the government turned on dissidents, the economy fully collapsed, and a regime far more ferocious than the one it replaced grabbed power and held it for 70 years. Kerensky’s failure to move quickly doomed his country to ruin for all but the last ten years of a full century. This is due to a single miscalculation: underestimating the public’s demand for dramatic change. He and his reformist cronies believed they could make the shift from the center, satisfying critics on all sides with slow-go moves and deference to the status quo. It is only obvious in retrospect that this plan was completely unworkable. It is typical for reformist governments to get carried away congratulating themselves for displacing their hated predecessors. They also tend to overestimate the extent of their hold on power. They are squeezed from two directions: legacy institutional corruption, which hates the intrusion of earnest newcomers, and a public deeply impatient for overthrowing evil. Navigating this maze of influence and pressure is not easy, obviously, but the error is usually the same: too much deference to the existing order and not enough push to accommodate public demands. Trump has his cabinet, which is earnest and includes top leaders of the dissident faction. He has DOGE and Elon Musk, who is said to be powerful due to his net worth, but maybe not. Trump has loyalists around him. He has the confidence of his movement and an aura of personal heroism in overcoming every attempt to defeat him. Trump’s political party has the Congress. But this Congress shows no signs of understanding the seriousness of the moment. Their budgets read as if nothing is going on, that there is no real need for drastic action. Even the foreign aid that Trump has tried to end is fully funded with a budget that adds more trillions to the debt. The larger problem is the machinery that undid his last tenure as president. The Trump administration, even if it is moving as fast and furiously as it is able, constitutes a small faction within a much larger apparatus, including hundreds of agencies, millions of employees, millions more in contractors, and unfathomable webs of finance and influence into every sector of life at home and abroad. It is not possible to describe the fullness of the opposition to change. On the fifth anniversary of lockdowns, X (formerly Twitter) has been subjected to DDOS attacks that took down a platform that was built to be impenetrable. The culprits are unknown. But those with an interest in stopping reform are known: they are the people powerful enough to have shut down the world five years ago. They want no upheaval and will use every resource to prevent it. The Trump administration came to power swearing to take on all of this, beginning with finally bringing some light on the financial books long held in secrecy. It had early successes with an avalanche of executive orders that deleted the most hated features of life under the regime. A month and weeks in, there has been a noticeable slowing of momentum with priority given to cabinet confirmations, budget battles, and trade concerns, which might turn out to be the obsession that distracts from myriad immediate needs. The hold that Trump has on government is more fragile than it looks from the outside. This might be the first administration in a century that has fully understood the problem of the administrative state and has had the determination to do something about it. Most other presidential administrations have either approved of the status quo, pretended not to notice that they are not in charge, or otherwise lacked the driving motivation and mandate to gut it. So too, the Kerensky government faced pressure in two directions: from the establishment that wanted the status quo and the people who wanted revolution. He chose a middle ground. Eight months later, he was gone and replaced by a new ruling junta that made the Romanovs look liberal by comparison. This is justified worry today: Can the reformist government in the US move hard and fast enough to please the fury at the grassroots? Can it stay focused enough to achieve the aim, overcoming myriad obstacles? Or will it go the way of previous post-despotic reformers and become a parenthesis in history, with every earnest aim foiled by a powerful establishment it failed to overthrow?

It was supposed to be an agent of calm reform; it ended as a parenthesis between the old regime and the new. Kerensky was a lawyer, a reformer, and a non-communist supporter of labor-led social democracy. Active in anti-government protests and denunciations for years, Kerensky seemed like the right man for the job. He had one foot in the old world and one in the new. On taking power, he found himself in the position of making judgments about the pace and path of reform efforts. He had to deal with a collapsing economy, revolutionary fervor among the workers and peasants, and grave suspicion toward the whole of the ruling classes, the military in particular. He proclaimed Russia to be a Republic of the Western variety and had every intention of holding elections and shepherding into being a new type of ruling regime in Russia. The war would end, land would go to the peasants, inflation would stop, and people would find their voice in government. Just not yet. It had to be orderly, in Kerensky’s view. His mistake was in thinking that he was in charge of the motion of history. He made a fateful judgment in thinking it was all about him and not the movement that gave rise to his position. He decided to continue the war and make one final push for victory. That included an intensification of conscription in the midst of inflation. That decision ended in disaster. What was he thinking? In his view, Russia had already sacrificed so much for the war effort. His plan was to make good on these sacrifices by granting the Russian people the pride of victory. He had hoped to tap into the magically forgiving power of patriotism, never more enlivened than by triumph in war. His gamble did not work out. His more fundamental error was in believing that his rule was more secure than it was. One can see why. The Russian state had a very long history of compelling assent. With church and state united, the public had a long history of acquiescence. He had not realized fully that the bond with the people broke when the Czar was unseated. Kerensky could not imagine the level of public doubt surrounding his position. He was brutal enough to draft people to get killed and maimed in war but lacked the military prowess and loyalty to enforce his new role. Plus, his stated role was to be provisional and bring about elections. That presented to the public a message of vulnerability. Meanwhile, in his own thinking, he was overly deferential to the financial and influence networks of the past. He wanted them on board with the next phase of Russian history, which he would lead. He underestimated the massive gap in perceptions that separated the ruling class and the people on the ground. He tried but failed to heal the chasm. The October Revolution seems inevitable in retrospect, but it was not. Had Kerensky acted quickly to dismantle the machinery of power, immediately withdraw the troops, unplug the money printers, and slash the spending and bureaucracy, his reformist efforts might have led to orderly elections and the normalization of society. Maybe. Instead, Russia experienced a revolution that began with great joy at home and abroad and quickly turned murderous as the entire royal family was slaughtered, the government turned on dissidents, the economy fully collapsed, and a regime far more ferocious than the one it replaced grabbed power and held it for 70 years. Kerensky’s failure to move quickly doomed his country to ruin for all but the last ten years of a full century. This is due to a single miscalculation: underestimating the public’s demand for dramatic change. He and his reformist cronies believed they could make the shift from the center, satisfying critics on all sides with slow-go moves and deference to the status quo. It is only obvious in retrospect that this plan was completely unworkable. It is typical for reformist governments to get carried away congratulating themselves for displacing their hated predecessors. They also tend to overestimate the extent of their hold on power. They are squeezed from two directions: legacy institutional corruption, which hates the intrusion of earnest newcomers, and a public deeply impatient for overthrowing evil. Navigating this maze of influence and pressure is not easy, obviously, but the error is usually the same: too much deference to the existing order and not enough push to accommodate public demands. Trump has his cabinet, which is earnest and includes top leaders of the dissident faction. He has DOGE and Elon Musk, who is said to be powerful due to his net worth, but maybe not. Trump has loyalists around him. He has the confidence of his movement and an aura of personal heroism in overcoming every attempt to defeat him. Trump’s political party has the Congress. But this Congress shows no signs of understanding the seriousness of the moment. Their budgets read as if nothing is going on, that there is no real need for drastic action. Even the foreign aid that Trump has tried to end is fully funded with a budget that adds more trillions to the debt. The larger problem is the machinery that undid his last tenure as president. The Trump administration, even if it is moving as fast and furiously as it is able, constitutes a small faction within a much larger apparatus, including hundreds of agencies, millions of employees, millions more in contractors, and unfathomable webs of finance and influence into every sector of life at home and abroad. It is not possible to describe the fullness of the opposition to change. On the fifth anniversary of lockdowns, X (formerly Twitter) has been subjected to DDOS attacks that took down a platform that was built to be impenetrable. The culprits are unknown. But those with an interest in stopping reform are known: they are the people powerful enough to have shut down the world five years ago. They want no upheaval and will use every resource to prevent it. The Trump administration came to power swearing to take on all of this, beginning with finally bringing some light on the financial books long held in secrecy. It had early successes with an avalanche of executive orders that deleted the most hated features of life under the regime. A month and weeks in, there has been a noticeable slowing of momentum with priority given to cabinet confirmations, budget battles, and trade concerns, which might turn out to be the obsession that distracts from myriad immediate needs. The hold that Trump has on government is more fragile than it looks from the outside. This might be the first administration in a century that has fully understood the problem of the administrative state and has had the determination to do something about it. Most other presidential administrations have either approved of the status quo, pretended not to notice that they are not in charge, or otherwise lacked the driving motivation and mandate to gut it. So too, the Kerensky government faced pressure in two directions: from the establishment that wanted the status quo and the people who wanted revolution. He chose a middle ground. Eight months later, he was gone and replaced by a new ruling junta that made the Romanovs look liberal by comparison. This is justified worry today: Can the reformist government in the US move hard and fast enough to please the fury at the grassroots? Can it stay focused enough to achieve the aim, overcoming myriad obstacles? Or will it go the way of previous post-despotic reformers and become a parenthesis in history, with every earnest aim foiled by a powerful establishment it failed to overthrow?

Europe Faces A MAGA ‘Vibe-Shift’ As Trump Moves To His Primordial...	President Trump wants Ukraine settled, full stop. This is so that he can move ahead quickly – to normalise with Russia, and begin the ‘big picture’ project of setting a new World Order, one that will end wars and facilitate business ties. The point here – which Europe feigns to not understand – is that the end to the Ukraine conflict simply is Trump’s ‘gateway’ to the entire rationale and platform on which he stood: The Great Reset of the Geo-Political landscape. Ukraine, simply said, is the obstacle to Trump’s pursuit of his primordial objective: The Global Reset. Starmer, Macron and the eastern wing of the Euro-élites are blind to the sheer scale of the global vibe-shift towards traditionalist U.S. politics and ethics. They miss too, the barely concealed fury in the Trump world that exists behind this nascent revolution. 'The Maga Right has none of the inhibitions of its predecessors. It is planning to leverage the power of a recaptured state to annihilate its enemies', Allister Heath writes. The European Ruling Class is in desperate trouble and increasingly isolated, in a world shifting ‘Rightward’ at breakneck speed. 'The U.S. is now the enemy of the West', the FT proclaims. European leaders wantonly won’t understand. The reality is that the U.S. is engaged now in rolling up Europe’s foreign policy. And, is about to start exporting U.S. traditional Republican values to roll up the European wokeist belief-system. The European Ruling strata – far removed from its base – has failed to grasp the threat to its own interests (a scenario outlined here). The Trump administration is trying to rebuild the ailing Republic, and Americans in this new era do not care for the European obsession with ancient feuds and their entailing wars. Trump reportedly views with utter disdain the UK and European boast that should the U.S. not do it, then Europe will. The Brussels class claims to be able still – after three years of losing in Ukraine – to be able to inflict a humiliating defeat on President Putin. More profoundly, however, Team Trump – committed to the task of taking down the American Deep State as the ‘inexorable enemy’ – perceives (rightly) the British security state to be co-joined at the hip with their American counterparts, as a part of its global meta-structure. And its oldest and deepest component has always been the destruction of Russia, and its dismemberment. So when Macron, in an address to the nation this week, rejected a ceasefire in Ukraine and declared that 'peace in Europe is only possible with a weakened Russia', calling the country a direct threat to France and the continent, many in ‘Trump world’ will interpret this defiant declaration (that ‘Ukraine defeating Russia is preferable to ‘peace’’) is nothing more than Macron and Starmer ventriloquising the aims of the Meta Deep State. This notion is lent substance by the sudden plethora of articles appearing in the European-(managed) MSM to the effect that Russia’s economy is much weaker than it appears and might collapse in the next year. Of course it is nonsense. This is about managing the European public to believe that keeping the war going in Ukraine is a ‘good idea’. The absurdity of the European position was perhaps best captured, as Wolfgang Münchau notes, in its full hubris last year by the historian and writer Anne Applebaum when she won a prestigious German peace prize. During her acceptance speech, she maintained that victory was more important than peace, asserting that the West’s ultimate goal should be regime change in Russia: 'We must help Ukrainians achieve victory, and not only for the sake of Ukraine,' she said. Zelensky and his European fans want ‘to negotiate’ – though later, rather than sooner (perhaps in a year, as one European Foreign Minister reportedly told Marco Rubio privately). 'This', Münchau writes, 'is what the very public disagreement in the Oval Office [last week] was all about. Peace through untrammelled victory — essentially the Second World War model — as the lens through which virtually all European leaders, and most commentators view the Russia-Ukraine conflict'. America sees things differently: It views almost certainly the European Deep State to be putting a spoke into Trump’s ‘normalisation with Russia’ wheel – a normalisation to which they are viscerally opposed. Or, at the very least, as the Europeans chasing a 'mirage that no longer exists, stubbornly hiking ‘tax and spend’, whilst doubling down on mass immigration and overpriced energy, oblivious to the flashing red lights in the [financial markets] as government debt yields rocket to their highest levels since 1998', as Allister Heath outlines. In other words, the suggestion is that Friedrich Merz, Macron and Starmer are talking about how they are going to turn around their countries – via a massive infusion of debt – into defence superstates. Yet, at some level of consciousness, they must realise that it is not doable, so they settle instead for presenting themselves as ‘world leaders on the international stage’. The European élites are deeply unstable ‘leaders’ who are risking the prosperity and stability of the continent. It is clear these countries do not have the military capacity to intervene in any concerted manner. More than anything, it is the European economy circling the drain that is the reality at the gates. Zelensky is accomplice to the European insistence that defeating Russia takes priority over achieving peace in Ukraine, in spite of lacking any strategic rationale as to how it may be achieved after three years of a worsening military situation. Both plans – crushing the Russian economy with sanctions and attrition of the Russian military to the point of collapse – have failed. Why then does Zelensky resist Trump’s peace proposals? On the surface, it makes no sense. The explanation likely goes back to the post-Maidan era when the western ‘Meta Security State’ (principally, the British and the Americans) entrenched hardline Banderites (then a tiny minority) into the Ukrainian Police, Intelligence and Security State. They are still today the controlling force. Even were this faction to acknowledge that their war cannot be won, they understand what happens if they lose: Russia will not deal with them. They view them as extremists (if not war criminals) who are in no way ‘agreement capable’ and must be replaced by a leadership who is actually capable of compromise. Russia would likely pursue and bring these men to trial. Zelensky has to be frightened at what the Banderites might do to him (despite his British team of bodyguards). Well, Trump is not entertaining these European ‘games’: He is administering a slap-down to Zelensky and European leaders, perhaps bringing Zelensky into line; or perhaps not … Team Trump, Politico reports, has now entered into direct talks with the Ukrainian opposition on holding early elections to unseat Zelensky – who is on his way to being removed, members of Team Trump say. Zelensky may be finished, but interestingly Zaluzhniy wasn’t discussed either. He is being groomed by the British as a replacement – it looks like the Americans are going to make this decision independently of the British, too. President Trump has ordered intelligence sharing with Ukraine stopped. What he technically did was to stop allowing Ukraine to use exclusive U.S. targeting systems controlled by U.S. Intelligence, the CIA, the National Reconnaissance Office and the U.S. National Geospatial Intelligence Agency. What has been suspended is the exchange of so-called ‘lethal’ data, including information for HIMARS targeting. However, the defensive information needed for protection is still being provided to Ukraine. 'The extent of the intelligence-sharing freeze, which appears to have been imposed alongside the halt in military aid Mr Trump announced on Monday, initially appeared to be somewhat limited … But by Wednesday afternoon it became clear that the Trump administration, ignoring overtures from Mr Zelensky the previous evening, had gone much further. A military intelligence officer in Kyiv told The Telegraph that the freeze amounted to 'more or less a total blackout''. Put bluntly, the earlier munitions freeze will undoubtedly affect Ukraine’s military abilities over time, however the impact might not be felt for some weeks. The loss of vital intelligence, however, will make its mark immediately. It will – simply put – blind Ukraine. In Ukrainian command posts, the battle tracking and satellite online feeds on tablets and TV screens have indeed been disconnected. What Trump’s slap-down has done is to puncture the fiction that Ukraine is able to defend itself with a little substitute of European support. That has always been nonsensical bravado. NATO, the CIA and the global Intelligence Community have been in control of the war fighting from the outset. And that, for now, has been switched off. So, Europe wants to shoulder the U.S. burden? Bloomberg reports that European bond markets are in meltdown. If Europe pretends to replace the U.S., it is going to be extremely expensive, very politically costly, and it will fail.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWenZ2DRxfCFlPZTyabhfd6j	2025-03-11T17:32:48-07:00

Spending Cuts Won’t Weaken The US Economy: They Will Strengthen I...	By Daniel Lacalle The Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta’s GDPNow model projection for real GDP growth in the first quarter of 2025 (Q1 2025) is now showing a slump to -1.5 percent. This marks a significant downward revision from the previous estimate of 2.3 percent on February 19, 2025. Such an enormous decline is strange. How did we go from +2.3 percent to -1.5 percent in less than a month? That kind of collapse in an economy as large as the United States is exceedingly rare. The immediate reaction from the media is to call this the beginning of a 'Trump recession' and blame it on President Trump’s policies. Interestingly, on June 1, 2022, the Atlanta Fed GDPNow estimated the second quarter of 2022 growth at +1.3 percent. By July 1, 2022, it had dropped to -2.1 percent, a shift of 3.4 percentage points in 30 days. What did the media call it? 'Growth scare'. A similar thing happened in the third quarter of 2021. The estimate fell from 6.1 percent (July 30) to 2.3 percent (October 1), a 3.8-point drop over two months. In 2022, real GDP declined for two consecutive quarters under Biden’s administration. According to the Bureau of Economic Analysis, the first quarter saw a decrease of -1.6 percent in the annualized rate, followed by a 0.6 percent drop in the second quarter. Hundreds of analysts, commentators, and economists, along with the NBER, swiftly declared that this was not a recession. Thus, it is hilarious to read the hundreds of comments arguing that the Atlanta Fed NowCast means that the new administration’s policies are causing a recession. As I wrote a few months ago, the United States has been in a private sector recession for months. However, an abnormal increase in government spending during a period of growth and a risky borrowing policy led to a bloated Gross Domestic Product (GDP). The United States had a $7.59 trillion nominal GDP increase between 2021 and 2024 compared to a rise of $8.47 trillion in government debt. This marks the worst GDP growth adjusted for government debt accumulation since the 1930s. Many analysts are warning that the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) efforts will cause a recession if government spending is aggressively reduced. However, cutting spending may 'reduce' GDP but does not harm productive economic growth; it will likely strengthen it. We must remember that US government spending financed by increasing federal debt accounted for about 22 percent to 25 percent of the total US GDP growth over 2021–2024. This extraordinary increase in government spending in the middle of a recovery led to record-high government debt and was the leading cause of money supply growth and, with it, the inflation burst that Americans are suffering today. A research study from MIT Sloan published on July 17, 2024, by Mark Kritzman et al., titled 'The Determinants of Inflation,' concluded that federal spending was the overwhelming driver of the inflation spike in 2022, estimating it was two to three times more significant than any other factors. Government spending was out of control, leading money supply growth to soar, and the cumulative inflation suffered by Americans in the past four years is over 20.9 percent, with groceries and gas prices rising by more than 40 percent. Excessive government spending was not only the cause of the rise in money supply growth and the burst of inflation but also led to an $8.47 trillion increase in debt and an unsustainable path to financial ruin if policies remained the same. According to the Congressional Budget Office, with no policy changes, the United States would have accumulated deficits of $12.6 trillion between 2025 and 2030. Net interest outlays were expected to grow from $881 billion in 2024 to $1.2 trillion by 2030, even assuming no recessions or unemployment increases. Cutting government spending is essential to reduce prices, bring inflation under control and stop the looming public finance disaster. By 2024, it became evident that revenue measures would not reduce the United States federal deficit. Deficits are always a spending problem. We must remember that 2024’s 2.8 percent GDP growth reflected almost $2 trillion in borrowing, a roughly one-to-one spending-to-growth ratio and a dangerous path to a debt crisis. Private GDP should measure the economy, as government spending and debt do not drive productive growth. Stripping government spending can give us a more accurate picture of the reality of the productive sector in America. The latest Atlanta Fed estimates show a massive decline in net exports (-3.7 percent) due to a large increase in imports, a small decline in consumption of goods (-0.09 percent) but strong services (+0.62 percent) and rises in government expenditure (+0.34 percent) and a healthy increase in investment (+0.62 percent). Thus, the surprising factor is an abnormal slump in exports and a rise in imports that may be revised, because the trade deficit in December 2024 rose to a record $98.4 billion and GDP did not reflect such a massive slump in net exports. The concerning thing is that government spending continues to be excessive, and the United States is running an annualized $2.5 trillion deficit. The United States will not enter a recession due to the change of administration, but because of the excess spending policies of the Biden years. Reducing federal spending, deficit, and debt accumulation is essential to recover the health of the economy. Bloating GDP with public spending and debt is not growing; it is the recipe for disaster.

According to the Congressional Budget Office, with no policy changes, the United States would have accumulated deficits of $12.6 trillion between 2025 and 2030. Net interest outlays were expected to grow from $881 billion in 2024 to $1.2 trillion by 2030, even assuming no recessions or unemployment increases. Cutting government spending is essential to reduce prices, bring inflation under control and stop the looming public finance disaster. By 2024, it became evident that revenue measures would not reduce the United States federal deficit. Deficits are always a spending problem. We must remember that 2024’s 2.8 percent GDP growth reflected almost $2 trillion in borrowing, a roughly one-to-one spending-to-growth ratio and a dangerous path to a debt crisis. Private GDP should measure the economy, as government spending and debt do not drive productive growth. Stripping government spending can give us a more accurate picture of the reality of the productive sector in America. The latest Atlanta Fed estimates show a massive decline in net exports (-3.7 percent) due to a large increase in imports, a small decline in consumption of goods (-0.09 percent) but strong services (+0.62 percent) and rises in government expenditure (+0.34 percent) and a healthy increase in investment (+0.62 percent). Thus, the surprising factor is an abnormal slump in exports and a rise in imports that may be revised, because the trade deficit in December 2024 rose to a record $98.4 billion and GDP did not reflect such a massive slump in net exports. The concerning thing is that government spending continues to be excessive, and the United States is running an annualized $2.5 trillion deficit. The United States will not enter a recession due to the change of administration, but because of the excess spending policies of the Biden years. Reducing federal spending, deficit, and debt accumulation is essential to recover the health of the economy. Bloating GDP with public spending and debt is not growing; it is the recipe for disaster.

What Should Republicans Do About Medicaid? – OpEd	Republicans are in a bind. In order to give substance to their new budget bill, they need to cut Medicaid spending by billions of dollars. Yet the White House and many congressional Republicans insist that they do not want to cut Medicaid benefits. Here is where DOGE can come to the rescue. In mainstream economics there is a technical definition of 'waste.' A system is wasteful if it is possible to make a change that can in principle make everyone better off. Fortunately, Medicaid is so inefficient that it provides us with a rich bundle of opportunities. We can make changes that vastly improve services for the beneficiaries and free up billions in savings for the tax bill—at the same time. Here are some examples. Paying market prices. When people are newly enrolled in Medicaid, their visits to the ER increase by 40 percent! A likely reason is that many doctors won’t see Medicaid patients and even if they do, they are the last patients doctors want to see. Also, many of our best medical centers won’t take Medicaid managed care. Medicaid rates are often half the prices charged at walk-in clinics and urgent care centers. Even if some accept Medicaid fees, they rarely locate in areas where Medicaid enrollees live. One answer is to let Medicaid patients buy medical care the way they buy food. In the supermarket, low-income shoppers are free to combine food stamp funds with out-of-pocket money and pay market prices. In health care we have made that option illegal. In a reformed system, Medicaid enrollees could still get free care at the emergency room, and possibly lose a day’s pay. (The in-and-out time at Parkland, a safety net hospital in Dallas, is almost 6 hours!) Or they could save time and taxpayer money by getting care where middle-class patients go. If this reform (coupled with the 24/7 primary care described below) cut Medicaid emergency room spending in half, it would save the federal and state governments as much as $135 billion over 10 years. Roth Health Savings Accounts. Private companies managing Medicaid (or the state itself) should be ableto make deposits to an account that would cover, say, all primary care. Enrollees would be restricted to using the money for health care during an insurance year. Afterward, they could withdraw any unspent funds for any purpose. If there were no penalties for non-medical withdrawals, health care and non-health care would trade against each other on a level playing field under the tax law. People wouldn’t spend a dollar on health care unless they got a dollar’s worth of value. An early study by the RAND Corporation suggests that these accounts would reduce Medicaid spending by 30 percent. Aside from payments for the disabled and nursing home care, if Medicaid spending could be reduced by 30 percent, the savings would amount to almost $1 trillion over ten years. This saving would be shared by the beneficiaries and the taxpayers who fund Medicaid. We could probably double that number by creative programs of self-management and self-directed care for the rest of the Medicaid population. 24/7 primary care. What we used to call concierge medicine is now commonly called 'direct primary care' (DPC) and the prices have come way down. In a national model that originated in Wichita, Kansas, the monthly fee is $50 for a mother and $10 for a child. In return the family gets the doctor’s phone number and 24/7 access to all primary care. This is a competitive market and if at any time the family is unsatisfied, they can switch to another DPC doctor. Currently, employers are not allowed to put funds in an HSA to be used for DPC. By contrast, the Roth HSAs for Medicaid described above would be a perfect vehicle to facilitate DPC. Reducing fraud. According to the General Accounting Office, fraud in Medicare and Medicaid amounts to $100 billion a year, and the office admits that’s a low estimate. In principle, credit card fraud should be much easier to commit than health care fraud. (Think of how often your card goes out of sight in the possession of a waiter or other vendor.) Yet losses to credit card fraud amount to a fraction of 1 percent of spending. If the federal government could manage Medicare and Medicaid as efficiently as the credit card industry (or maybe contract out to them) the savings would approach $1 trillion over ten years. An optional Medicaid block grant. State governments should have the option of receiving 90% of their federal Medicaid dollars in the form of a block grant—saving federal taxpayers the other 10%. With their share, the states could do some of the things already discussed. They could create Roth HSAs outside the federal tax system. They could make deposits to these accounts and let enrollees pay market prices for their care. They could also allow HSA money to be used to pay the fees of direct primary care doctors, providing 24/7 care. If every state accepts the deal, taxpayer savings would be about $630 billion over 10 years. Legislation. A number of the ideas discussed here are already in legislation co-authored by Rep Pete Sessions (R-TX) and his colleagues. So, a good part of the reforms described here could be achieved by little more than cut and paste.

The Democrats’ Necessary Apology – OpEd	An old friend asked me to write a short piece on what I think we (progressives) should do now. I mentioned some immediate ways to stem the Trump Blitzkrieg. I largely agree with the Nicholas Kristof price of eggs approach, although I think it’s also essential to demonize 'Elon the Nazi.' Politicians should be embarrassed to take his money, just as they would be embarrassed to take money from ISIS or Al Queda. But the Democrats really do need to take some big steps to reform themselves. There are many good progressive policies they should be pushing, like a big hike in the minimum wage, cracking down on drug prices, preventing insurers from ripping people off. But they also need a moment of reckoning with their past. The Democrats were considered the party of the establishment in the 2024 election. This is a bad place to be when people are angry. And people have cause to be angry. The Democrats supported a variety of policies that had the effect of redistributing income upward, from ordinary workers to highly paid workers (e.g. professionals, high-level corporate executives, and Wall Street types). The most visible policy in this category was trade. And Democrats have their fingerprint all over it, with NAFTA having been signed by Clinton and China being admitted to the WTO, also under Clinton. It’s true that more Republicans than Democrats in Congress supported these trade policies, but that doesn’t matter. The person sitting in the White House was a Democrat. And these deals really were bad news for workers without college degrees. By exposing manufacturing workers to direct competition with low-paid workers in China and other developing countries they cost the country millions of good-paying union jobs in manufacturing, and they lowered the pay for the jobs that remain. With unionization rates in manufacturing now only slightly higher than the rest of the private sector, the wage premium that workers used to enjoy in manufacturing has largely been eliminated. Not only was the Democrats’ trade policy very bad news for the country’s workers. They also lied about it. I don’t know how many times I have seen this graph showing manufacturing employment as a share of total employment. The story here is that there is a steady decline from the 1970s until 2010. In this story, there is nothing to see in the decade of the 00s, when the trade deficit exploded. But then there is the other graph showing manufacturing employment since 1970. The basic story is that there are cyclical ups and downs, but only a modest decline until 2000. Then we lost 3.4 million manufacturing jobs, 20 percent of all manufacturing jobs, from 2000 to 2007, before the Great Recession. This was the impact of trade. Millions of workers saw their lives ruined. Cities and towns across the Midwest saw their main employers lay off much of their labor force or go out of business altogether. The workers and communities affected have a right to be angry. Also, we should be clear, it was a lie to say this was 'free trade.' We didn’t expose our doctors to competition with their lower paid counterparts in the developing world or even Europe and Canada. As a result, our doctors get paid twice as much as doctors in other wealthy countries. We also made government-granted patent and copyright monopolies longer and stronger, a move that is 180 degrees at odds with free trade. This redistributed a huge amount of income upward, most obviously in the case of prescription drugs. We pay hundreds of billions of dollars a year ($4,000 per household) more than we would if drugs were sold in a free market. Pushing trade deals that were designed to screw ordinary workers and redistribute income upward predictably made the victims angry at the Democrats. An apology is definitely in order, even (especially) if that means throwing Bill Clinton under the bus.

Criticism Of Israel Is Misrepresented As Anti-Semitism – OpEd	By Jonathan Power In the New York Times, columnist Roger Cohen argued that anyone who queries the Jewish right to Israel is anti-Semitic. More than that, he accuses us of being racist, even though many of us fought against South African apartheid. He accuses us of 'pursuing the systematic 'Nazification' of Israel.' This is accusation by association. Israelis make this accusation daily. Let’s look at the facts. I’m anti-Israel, especially its present government, but for good reason I’m anti-Semitic. The Semitics bend history. After the destruction of Jerusalem by the Romans in AD 70 the Jews were thrust into the outer world — many into Arab countries, later to become Muslim, where they were extended protection, and later into the Roman and then Christian world where they were accepted for many centuries. There were no pogroms until the Middle Ages and then they were centuries apart. Over two millennia many big tribal groups have been dispersed — the Slavs, the Moguls, the Bantu, the Kurds, the Tamils, the Celts — the list is a long one — but only the Jews have had an idée fixe about where they want to go back to. During the last thousand years, while the Jews were in the diaspora, the Arabs reinforced their settlements on the same land that some Jews yearned for, just as pre-Arab tribes had settled it in the time before Moses — and just as the Celts settled in Ireland, the Europeans in North America, the Moguls in India and the Russians in Siberia. When in 1897 the rabbis of Vienna sent a fact-finding mission to Palestine, they reported back that the bride 'was beautiful but married to another man.' Theodor Herzl, the convenor of the first Zionist Conference, was not obsessed by a return to Palestine. Almost anywhere would do. Argentina was the first choice with its empty fertile spaces. The Uasin Gishu plateau near Nairobi, Kenya, was another. But the Zionist conference overruled him. The course of the First World War and the likely break-up of the Ottoman Empire led the British to think that Jewish control of Palestine would be more secure for British interests than Arab. In 1917 came the Balfour Declaration whereby the British cabinet declared that they viewed 'with favour the establishment in Palestine of a national home for the Jewish people.' Lord Curzon, the former Indian viceroy, denounced it as an act of 'sentimental idealism' and said ironically that Britain had a 'stronger claim to parts of France.' Old Testament According to the texts of the Old Testament, the ultra-religious, settlement inclined, Israelis have it partly right — the whole of Palestine did once belong to them. But only partly. Read Genesis. When the Lord spoke to Moses and told him that he would deliver the Jews from Egypt he also said he would bring them into 'a good land and a large, unto a land flowing with milk and honey; unto the place of the Canaanites, and the Hittites, and the Amorites, and the Perizzites, and the Hivites, and the Jebusites.' In other words, the Jews were to conquer and displace other tribes who had been long possessors of the land now called Palestine, and even other tribes further south such as the Midianites. Later in the Book of Numbers, the Lord told Moses to 'vex the Midianites and smite them'. Moses and his army did. 'They slew all the males' and took the women and children captive. Then Moses said to his commanders, 'Have you saved all the women alive?……Now therefore kill every male among the little ones and kill every woman that hath known a man by lying with him.' He claimed that God told him to do this. The Jews would stop at almost nothing. Genocide, on occasion, was the tool of total conquest. Is this the proud history that present day Jews are fighting to uphold millennia later? The Jews of the Old Testament were as cruel as the Moguls and Tartars, and it is as difficult to justify the present-day Israeli occupation of Palestine as it would be to justify a Mogul regime in Russia or an Islamic one in northern India. If the Jews want the rest of the world’s sympathy, they have to be able to justify their modern-day presence in Palestine better than they do. They have to recognize how wrong were their conquests, both old and present. But now the Jews are in Palestine in such significant numbers the only solution is to honour the rest of the text of the Balfour Declaration. 'Nothing should be done that may prejudice the civil and religious rights of the existing non-Jewish communities in Palestine', it said. This was the British condition. The Israelis overlook it today at their peril.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWenZ2DRxfCFlAf3IDnsLhOv	2025-03-11T17:20:54-07:00

Cracking Down On US Colleges, For Israel – OpEd	The United States government does not need to give a dime to any college. But, if it does continue its funding of colleges, the First Amendment of the US Constitution bars that funding from being denied to a college because the college is determined to have insufficiently prevented speech the US government opposes, such as speech the US government deems to be critical of the Israel government. For this reason, President Trump’s effort to crack down on and bar funding to colleges the US executive branch concludes have insufficiently prevented anti-Israel or 'antisemitic' speech should be, and can be expected to be, struck down by courts. ('Antisemitic' under the peculiar definition being pushed by the Trump administration includes speech against the Israel government, not just speech against an ethnicity or religion as the term 'antisemitic' is generally understood to indicate.) This conclusion of unconstitutionality follows from a basic understanding of constitutional law that System Update host and astute politics commentator Glenn Greenwald described well in a video monologue he released this week. Anyone tempted to give Trump the benefit of the doubt concerning this flagrant attack on constitutional rights would do well to give Greenwald a listen: This article was published at Ron Paul Institute	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWenZ2DRxfCFlKxloVk7f_a3	2025-03-11T17:19:14-07:00

Azerbaijan Creates Pathway To Reconciliation With Russia	(Eurasianet) -- An arrangement is in place that would allow Azerbaijan and Russia to move on from a bitter dispute over the accidental Russian shoot-down of an Azerbaijani civilian passenger jet. Russia and Azerbaijan have been at odds since late December when the Azerbaijani plane bound for the city of Grozny in the Russian republic of Chechnya was accidentally hit by anti-aircraft flak and ultimately crash landed in Kazakhstan, killing 38 of the 67 people aboard. The refusal of Russian officials to take responsibility for the crash and apologize stoked a series of acrimonious verbal exchanges between officials in Baku and Moscow, threatening to cause a rupture in their strategic partnership. In late February, however, the tone of the bilateral tiff shifted noticeably. It started with a post on the Telegram social media channel by Chechnya’s warlord, Ramzan Kadyrov, announcing that he will award medals for valor to the two plane crew members who survived the crash. He added that a memorial plaque to the crash victims will be installed in the Chechen capital. 'Their actions have become an example of true service and humanity,' Kadyrov wrote, referring to the plane’s crew members. Kadyrov’s comments apparently have soothed tempers in Baku and opened a pathway to reconciliation. In the days immediately after the crash, Azerbaijani leader Ilham Aliyev reportedly refused to take a call from Kadyrov. Azerbaijani anger stemmed from the fact that Kadyrov had awarded a medal to his nephew for supposedly leading a stout air defense against a Ukrainian drone attack on Grozny shortly before the Azerbaijani airliner was hit by flak. The official stance in Baku towards Chechnya immediately softened following Kadyrov’s good-will gesture. 'The decision by Chechen authorities to award certain individuals after the crash understandably sparked strong outrage in Azerbaijani society. However, investigations have confirmed—and Azerbaijan has precise information—that the Chechen leadership had no involvement or responsibility in the incident,' a government source was quoted as saying by the Trend news agency on February 27. The source also told Trend that Russian military personnel were directly responsible for bringing the plane down. 'In Azerbaijan, the voiced position on this matter is deemed acceptable, even if it comes late,' the source added, referring to Kadyrov. Economic considerations are likely the reason for Baku’s softening stance. 'Despite the tensions, both sides have too much to lose from a lasting fallout,' Maxim Trudolyubov, an expert at the Kennan Institute in Washington, stated in an analysis published by the institute’s website. 'Russia relies on Azerbaijan for transport routes vital to its relations with Iran and the Persian Gulf, while Baku’s geopolitical pragmatism and shared strategic interests will likely push both countries toward reconciliation—though on terms that reflect Azerbaijan’s growing assertiveness.' Baku’s apparent absolution of Chechen involvement makes it easier for Putin to find a way to satisfy Azerbaijani complaints. Chechnya is perhaps the only corner of Russia where Putin’s word is not law; Kadyrov controls a private army numbering in the tens of thousands and operates with a wide degree of latitude from Moscow. In short, Putin couldn’t easily pin the blame on Chechens and compel Kadyrov to come up with some scapegoats for punishment. Now, Putin has a bit more leeway to act. If he so desires, he can identify a few unfortunate Russian recruits for punishment and all parties involved can move on. The question now is whether Putin will walk through the door that Azerbaijan has opened for him?	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWenZ2DRxfCFlGa0gBnU2P4q	2025-03-11T17:16:27-07:00	
Azerbaijan Creates Pathway To Reconciliation With Russia	(Eurasianet) -- An arrangement is in place that would allow Azerbaijan and Russia to move on from a bitter dispute over the accidental Russian shoot-down of an Azerbaijani civilian passenger jet. Russia and Azerbaijan have been at odds since late December when the Azerbaijani plane bound for the city of Grozny in the Russian republic of Chechnya was accidentally hit by anti-aircraft flak and ultimately crash landed in Kazakhstan, killing 38 of the 67 people aboard.

Portugal’s Government Collapses After Confidence Vote (Again)	By Charles Szumski Portuguese Prime Minister Luís Montenegro's centre-right government lost a crucial vote of confidence amid a conflict of interest scandal, reigniting a cycle of dysfunction in the country's poiltics that stretches back years. Montenegro's government collapsed late Tuesday just over a year after his Democratic Alliance took power. President Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa is expected to announce a snap election for mid-May. Scandals The current political turmoil stemmed from allegations concerning Montenegro's family business, Spinumviva, a consultancy firm specialising in compliance and personal data protection services. Investigations revealed that the company continued receiving payments from clients, including the casino group Solverde, even after Montenegro assumed office as prime minister in 2024. Montenegro's transfer of shares in the company to his wife also raised questions about potential conflicts of interest. The revelations led opposition parties, notably the Socialist Party and the far-right Chega, to announce their intention to vote against the government's confidence motion. increasing the likelihood of early elections later this year instead of in March 2028. Critics said new elections alone would not solve the underlying culture of corruption that many observers fear has taken hold of Portuguese politics. 'Elections do not replace or dispense with explanations,' Portuguese commentator Pedro Norton wrote on Publico, warning that the scandal would further corrode the health of Portugal's battered democracy. Third time's the charm With the fall of the Montenegro government, Portugal will have held three general elections in three years. The first was in January 2022, following the rejection of the Socialist Party (PS) government's budget in October 2021. The impasse led President Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa to dissolve parliament and call early elections. The PS, then led by Prime Minister António Costa, the current Council president, secured an absolute majority and formed a new government in March of the same year. In November 2023 however, Costa's administration was embroiled in a corruption scandal of its own involving his chief of staff, Vítor Escária, and Infrastructure Minister João Galamba. The investigation, known as Operation Influencer, centred on alleged irregularities in the awarding of contracts for lithium mining, green hydrogen projects, and data centres in the country. Under mounting pressure, Costa resigned, leading to early elections in March 2024. These elections brought Montenegro's centre-right Democratic Alliance to power with a minority government. However, his tenure was short-lived. Far-right boon The succession of political crises has led to frequent electoral cycles and heightened public disenchantment with traditional political institutions. According to sociologist António Barreto, quoted by Publico, the repeated political crisis caused two of the most damaging phenomena in the country's life: abstention from politics and the far-right party Chega. The instability has created fertile ground for populist movements, notably the far-right party, which has capitalised on the prevailing discontent to expand its influence. During the last elections, Chega secured 18.1% of the vote, resulting in 50 seats in the 230-member Assembly of the Republic, ranking third after the Socialist party and the centre-right Social Democrats. Portuguese voters did not respond to calls for a 'meaningful vote,' resulting in the 'most fragmented parliament ever', and with Chega being the 'big winner' of the last election, according to political experts who then spoke to Euractiv's partner Lusa.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWenZ2DRxfCFlNy5i4sYWtgx	2025-03-11T17:10:57-07:00

Trump’s Address To Congress Highlights The Absence Of Opposition ...	The relentless resistance that defined Trump's first term has faded into an unsettling quiet. A perfect storm of factors has granted him relatively unchecked power to push drastic domestic and international changes. During his address to Congress on March 4, 2025, U.S. President Donald Trump faced brief heckling from Democratic Representative AI Green and scattered jeers from his colleagues. But the overwhelming response was silence, reflective of the reality that opposition to Trump has sharply weakened, even as his administration pushes sweeping domestic and international policy upheaval. The opening weeks of his first term in January 2017 were met with fierce resistance, and not just from combative Democrats. People came together to protest against Trump's immigration policies and his proposed travel ban on several Muslim-majority countries. Republican politicians openly defied him amid constant media scrutiny. Clashes with the so-called 'deep state' due to intelligence leaks escalated when the FBI publicly confirmed an investigation into the Trump-Russia collusion in the 2016 election. These combined tensions defined his first term, culminating in him being temporarily banned from most major social media platforms and leading to widespread condemnation and isolation after the January 6, 2021, Capitol attack. Now, at the start of his second term, opposition is notably subdued. The Women's March that drew millions in 2017, becoming 'the largest single-day public demonstration in U.S. history,' according to the New York Times, seems to have 'lost its luster' during his second term. The February 5 protest against Trump and Elon Musk's policies drew a low turnout, mostly confined to liberal enclaves, and the 2025 Oscars—once a stage for political grandstanding—avoided directly critiquing the president. Even Green's disruption caused dissent within his own party, with 10 Democrats censuring him the next day. Political and institutional fatigue, shifting cultural dynamics, and strategic alignment by corporations, billionaires, politicians, and other public figures have blunted resistance, leaving the Trump administration with fewer obstacles as it pushes forward with its agenda. One major factor is the weakness and division within the Democratic Party, preventing grassroots progressives from working with top-level establishment Democrats. After years of Biden attempting to balance the party's competing factions, tensions rose significantly following his response to the October 7, 2023, attack on Israel by Hamas. Trump's victory a year later—securing both the electoral college and popular vote—has only deepened these fractures, fueling a blame game that contrasts with the unity following Trump's narrower 2016 election victory. The party's electoral failures are compounded by the absence of a unifying figure. Nancy Pelosi is no longer speaker, and while Chuck Schumer is the Senate minority leader, both of them are old and unpopular. Bernie Sanders, who is in his 80s, represents a sidelined progressive movement that has struggled to elevate new, dynamic leaders due to years of suppression by establishment Democrats. House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries has failed to offer new solutions, only deepening apathy and fatigue. Without organizational cohesion and the ability to inspire its base, the Democratic Party has been unable to marshal its diverse coalition against Trump's agenda. The issue that has mobilized progressives in large numbers in recent years is Palestine, which establishment Democrats are reluctant to support, including the recent arrest and threatened deportation of pro-Palestinian student Mahmoud Khalil. Losing young male voters has further weakened the party's ability to generate active dissent. Its association with progressive identity politics has meanwhile alienated broader segments of the electorate, with Biden having failed to address glaring economic issues and matters like crime and immigration during his presidency. On the Republican side, dissenting voices like Mitt Romney and the late John McCain are gone, and those who still might challenge Trump within the party fear backlash and isolation. 'Never Trump' conservative groups have struggled to pull voters away, while Trump's systemic dismantling of government bureaucracy (historically staffed with left-leaning officials) and the appointment of loyalists to key positions have cemented his control over the government and prevented institutional attempts to undermine him. With Republican control over all three branches of government, a conservative-majority Supreme Court, and Trump loyalists installed across federal agencies, his power—though often overstated—far surpasses that of his first term. Executive orders, constrained by previous presidents, are now being deployed at an unprecedented rate. His administration's ambitious federal restructuring efforts, tied to the Project 2025 framework, go beyond the government overhauls of Ronald Reagan's Grace Commission or Bill Clinton's bipartisan National Performance Review. Yet, Democratic disarray has left these efforts largely unchecked. Trump's progress also hinges on the support of the ultrawealthy. The Democratic Party is experiencing a funding shortfall, not just from grassroots donors but from major oligarchs as well. Meanwhile, Trump has secured broader public backing from America's corporate elite. Years of frustration with Democrats and the political left over issues like diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) initiatives, taxation, and regulations have pushed many business leaders toward his camp. This repositioning was on full display at Trump's inauguration, where Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg, Google CEO Sundar Pichai, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, and many more wealthy individuals were given front-row seats. Google's decision to rename the Gulf of Mexico to the 'Gulf of America,' a Trump executive order, signals the larger realignment across corporate America. No billionaire has played a more consequential role than Elon Musk. Though his relationship with Trump was rocky just a few years ago, Musk's endorsement of Trump in July 2024 cemented a powerful alliance between them. Musk's control of X (formerly Twitter) not only reintroduced Trump to the media platform but also helped normalize his return to other social media networks. Meanwhile, Democrats have struggled to maintain their online presence amid declining engagement and financial strain. This realignment has extended into the corporate media landscape. The aggressive anti-Trump narratives that dominated his first term have softened, driven by audience backlash against media institutions and wider progressive messaging. With traditional media outlets facing declining viewership, and the growing influence of oligarchic forces now backing Trump, the media's pivot is as much about survival as it is about political recalibration. Signs of this emerged even before the election. Jeff Bezos, who has owned the Washington Post since 2013, withdrew the paper's endorsement of Kamala Harris, as did billionaire Patrick Soon-Shiong, owner of the Los Angeles Times. CNN, under new leadership since 2023, has steadily adopted a more centrist tone, shedding high-profile anti-Trump figures like Don Lemon. MSNBC is undergoing an even more dramatic transformation, with outspoken Trump critics like Joy Reid and Alex Wagner losing their primetime slots in February 2025, while there has been scaling back of influence of others like Rachel Maddow in favor of less combative voices. Emboldened by a changing media environment, Trump is increasingly punishing outlets. The Associated Press was banned from presidential events in February after declining to adopt the 'Gulf of America' name. CBS remains embroiled in a $20 billion lawsuit filed by Trump over an edited interview with Kamala Harris, with Musk declaring that CBS reporters 'deserve a long prison sentence.' Meanwhile, Disney-ABC settled a defamation lawsuit with Trump for $15 million and recently replaced a transgender character from a new series with a Christian one. Meta, too, in January 2025, settled for $25 million for banning Trump from Facebook and Instagram after January 6. While these are small fines for corporate giants, they symbolize an increasing subservience to Trump, with both payments directed toward funding Trump's presidential library. It's hardly surprising that Trump appears so powerful at this moment. Political opposition is fractured, leaving no effective barriers to Trump's agenda. Many oligarchs have given him their quiet or public approval, as seen during his inauguration. The media's softened stance has shaped a perception of reduced conflict. The absence of strong opposition has created new momentum as political, corporate, and media institutions adapt to this shifting power balance instead of fighting it, reducing the public's appetite for resistance as well. For now, Trump is riding high after his election victory. But cracks are beginning to show. Public resistance to Musk's influence is growing, and the economic turbulence triggered by Trump's policies is stirring unease. Without a strong and combative adversary, Trump and his most ardent supporters may find themselves without a rallying cause. International stability could further test his power, and the reality of governance may prove far more challenging than dismantling what came before. Is this already the peak of Trump's power, or can it be sustained? Opposition to Trump fluctuated during his first term, yet today, the political, business, and cultural landscapes have adjusted in his favor. His greatest advantage, however, may be the quiet acquiescence of elites from various backgrounds. While some may oppose him openly, many are content to let events play out due to self-interest or inertia. About the author: John P.

South Africa: Call For Collaboration To Boost Infrastructure Inve...	President Cyril Ramaphosa has emphasised the need for strong collaboration between government and business to scale up infrastructure investment and drive South Africa’s economic growth.Speaking during a Questions for Oral Reply session in the National Assembly on Tuesday, the President highlighted the importance of structural reforms to address key constraints, such as energy supply and inefficiencies in freight and logistics. 'For South Africa to achieve the levels of economic growth it needs, it is essential that government and business work together to scale up investment in infrastructure.'Government has committed to an ambitious infrastructure build programme. Infrastructure spend by government will encourage and enable greater private sector investment in sectors such as electricity generation, electricity distribution, rail rolling-stock, and water distribution,' the President said. However, he stressed the distinction between public and private financial resources, particularly pension funds held by financial institutions. These funds, he noted, belong to workers and are intended for their retirement, making them private assets rather than State resources.To facilitate infrastructure investment, the President said that government needs to provide these savers with a reasonable return and ensure that these funds are safeguarded. In 2022, National Treasury amended Regulation 28 of the Pension Funds Act to allow for longer-term infrastructure investments by retirement funds. The changes introduced a definition of infrastructure and set a 45% upper limit for pension fund investments in infrastructure projects.Further regulatory adjustments have been made to facilitate economic development, including separating the investment limits for hedge funds and private equity.

South Africa: Call For Collaboration To Boost Infrastructure Inve...	President Cyril Ramaphosa has emphasised the need for strong collaboration between government and business to scale up infrastructure investment and drive South Africa’s economic growth.Speaking during a Questions for Oral Reply session in the National Assembly on Tuesday, the President highlighted the importance of structural reforms to address key constraints, such as energy supply and inefficiencies in freight and logistics. 'For South Africa to achieve the levels of economic growth it needs, it is essential that government and business work together to scale up investment in infrastructure.'Government has committed to an ambitious infrastructure build programme. Infrastructure spend by government will encourage and enable greater private sector investment in sectors such as electricity generation, electricity distribution, rail rolling-stock, and water distribution,' the President said. However, he stressed the distinction between public and private financial resources, particularly pension funds held by financial institutions. These funds, he noted, belong to workers and are intended for their retirement, making them private assets rather than State resources.To facilitate infrastructure investment, the President said that government needs to provide these savers with a reasonable return and ensure that these funds are safeguarded. In 2022, National Treasury amended Regulation 28 of the Pension Funds Act to allow for longer-term infrastructure investments by retirement funds. The changes introduced a definition of infrastructure and set a 45% upper limit for pension fund investments in infrastructure projects.Further regulatory adjustments have been made to facilitate economic development, including separating the investment limits for hedge funds and private equity. The allocation for private equity assets has been increased from 10% to 15%, allowing for greater infrastructure investments.In the Medium-Term Budget Policy Statement of October 2024, the Minister of Finance announced work underway on mechanisms to complement the changes to Regulation 28 through the development of specific investment vehicles to simplify and incentivise institutional investors. The President said details on these mechanisms will be published in the upcoming Budget, which is expected to be delivered on Wednesday, 12 March 2025.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfcyPosbFQglPxN7_7_VsB8	2025-03-11T17:06:17-07:00	
Five Takeaways From China’s National People’s Congress	By Qian Lang, Yitong Wu and Ha Syut China’s 10-day National People Congress ended in Beijing on Tuesday amid sweeping promises from the country’s leaders to boost economic growth, support AI and to take control over democratic Taiwan. Delegates also shed light on Beijing’s intentions for Tibet and revealed for the first time that U.S. sanctions on companies in Xinjiang using Uyghur forced labor are hurting business. Here are five takeaways: China aims to spur consumer spending amid looming trade war with US In his March 5 work report, Premier Li Qiang pledged to boost domestic consumption as the driving force for economic growth, which he set at 5% for the coming year -- a target experts say is highly questionable and likely concocted for political reasons. For years, exports have driven China’s growth. But leaders have tried to shift the focus to consumer spending after three years of COVID-19 restrictions and a slew of U.S. tariffs prompted manufacturers to move away from China and spooked foreign investors. And now President Donald Trump has imposed additional tariffs on Chinese exports to America. To shore up the economy, the government plans to boost fiscal spending by 1.2 trillion yuan (US$165 billion) to 29.7 trillion yuan (US$4.16 billion), Li said -- but gave few details of how that money would be spent. He also pledged to implement 'an appropriately accommodative monetary policy' in the coming year. 'The impact of this National People’s Congress on the Chinese people is that their economy is now moving from strength to weakness, and this weakness will be long term,' social economist Ji Rong told RFA Mandarin in a recent interview. One proposal discussed by delegates to the 10-day National People’s Congress in Beijing was shortening the working week to four-and-a-half days to give people more leisure time. The government will also further cut the personal income tax rate in a bid to boost purchasing power among middle- and low-earners. An economic commentator who gave only the surname Hong for fear of reprisals said changes to the working week could prove effective, but that Li’s work report contained few other practical measures. AI and high-tech seen as key sources of growth Li Qiang also vowed to 'unleash the creativity of the digital economy,' particularly through the use of AI. 'We will support the extensive application of large-scale AI models and vigorously develop new-generation intelligent terminals and smart manufacturing equipment, including intelligent connected new-energy vehicles, AI-enabled phones and computers, and intelligent robots,' he told delegates. Li was speaking weeks after China’s launched its DeepSeek AI model, in what some called a 'Sputnik moment' for the country. Li also promised increased funding for AI, biomanufacturing, quantum technology and 6G, without giving further details. But experts said China will continue to be hampered by U.S. export and high-tech bans, including for cutting-edge semiconductors. China’s increasingly powerful AI surveillance systems use facial recognition and combine data streams to create sophisticated 'city brains' that can track events in real time, and are increasingly being exported around the world, according to a recent report. The technology is also raising concerns about its use to treat patients by medical professionals, as well as to aid cheating in competitions (in Chinese). Tibetan officials vow to expand ideological education and Sinicize Tibetan Buddhism The Tibet Autonomous Region delegation vowed to strengthen efforts to fight 'separatism' and prioritize 'long-term stability' by expanding ideological education, as well as accelerate the Sinicization of Tibetan Buddhism, which they said was key to 'changing the face of Tibet.' The delegates emphasized their commitment to ideological education guided by the 'Three Consciousnesses,' a phrase used in Chinese propaganda to refer to national -- or Han Chinese -- consciousness, civic duties and the rule of law. 'I believe this kind of education is highly effective,' said Karma Tseten, deputy head of the delegation and Chairman of the Tibet Autonomous Region, or TAR. 'Despite its value, it is constantly smeared and disrupted by the Dalai Lama and his group. But we will not be swayed.' The rhetoric was a clear sign, experts said, that Beijing intends to continue to impose its repressive policies in Tibet under the guise of maintaining stability and combating separatism. 'Regardless of what policies China implements in Tibet, their stated goal of ‘maintaining stability’ fundamentally reveals that Tibetans do not trust the Chinese government,' Dawa Tsering, director at the Tibet Policy Institute, told Radio Free Asia. Delegates said at a media briefing on Thursday that more than 90 percent of community leaders in Tibet now had basic knowledge of Mandarin. They also emphasized that they will continue to focus on promoting in Tibet what China calls the 'four major events' -– border security, environment, stability and economic and social development. Top official from Uyghur region admits US sanctions are hurting businesses During the congress, the Chinese government acknowledged for the first time that U.S. sanctions over the use of Uyghur forced labor have affected more than 100 companies in the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous region, or XUAR, proving that international sanctions do have bite. Ma Xingrui, the XUAR party secretary, told delegates that 'the United States, relying on fabricated evidence, has imposed sanctions on Xinjiang businesses based on allegations of genocide and forced labor, affected more than 144 companies,' according to the China Daily. Sanctions 'over accusations of ‘forced labor’ have become one of the biggest challenges in the region’s development,' Ma said during a panel discussion Friday at the NPC, according to the report. While Ma didn’t elaborate on which companies were affected, this marks the first time the region’s highest party official admitted the sanctions were hurting businesses. The United States and nearly a dozen Western parliaments have accused China of committing genocide and crimes against humanity against the 13 million Uyghurs and other Turkic peoples living in Xinjiang. In 2021, the U.S. government has passed the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act, which bans U.S. companies from doing business with Chinese businesses judged to be using Uyghur forced labor. Since then, some 144 companies have been blacklisted. These sanctions are undermining the economic development of Xinjiang, which is a chief way that Beijing 'wants to extend the legitimacy of its rule,' said Raymond Kuo, a China expert at Rand Corporation, a Washington think tank. 'Ultimately, the economic benefits that come from [Beijing’s] rule are going to be the key thing to increase the legitimacy of its rule as well as win over the population,' he said. 'Western sanctions inhibit that.' The sanctions are 'particularly politically important for Xinjiang,' Kuo added. 'They’re clearly having some impact, right?' China to boost military spending by 7.2% China is increasing its 2025 defense budget by 7.2% to US$246 billion amid growing rivalry with the United States and tensions over Taiwan, marking the fourth consecutive year of more than 7% growth in defense spending. Li said Beijing would continue to 'resolutely oppose separatist activities' in democratic Taiwan, as well as what he termed 'external interference.' China has ramped up military activities around Taiwan, conducting frequent air and naval incursions into the island’s air defense identification zone and staging large-scale drills near its waters. Beijing views Taiwan as an inseparable part of its territory and insists on eventual unification, by force if necessary. Yet Li also vowed a soft power charm offensive to push for what Beijing calls 'peaceful unification.' 'We will improve institutions and policies for promoting economic and cultural exchanges and cooperation across the Taiwan Strait and advance integrated cross-Strait development,' he said. 'We will firmly advance the cause of China’s unification.' Military expert Pang Xinhua said China’s neighbors in the region are also worried about escalating military tensions. 'As China increases its military activities in the South China Sea, East China Sea and other regions, neighboring countries may worry about rising regional tensions leading to an escalating arms race,' Pang told RFA Mandarin. 'That could in turn lead to an escalation of the situation in the Taiwan Strait, as China’s continued strengthening of its military capabilities is interpreted as pressure on Taiwan,' he said.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWenZ2DRxfCFlAEZI-TXy18H	2025-03-11T17:01:07-07:00

Was October 7 Avoidable? – OpEd	After the Hamas-led offensive of October 7, 2023, it was portrayed as 'Israel’s 9/11,' which came out of the blue. Yet, this assumption is not supported by verified facts, including ignored intelligence, abandoned hostages and neglected Israeli communities around Gaza. A day after October 7, Eurasia Group’s Ian Bremmer said that the 'massive attacks by Hamas leadership into Israel … is no less than Israel’s 9/11.' By contrast, in the same interview for CNBC, I said that October 7 did not come out of the blue. 'The Israeli-Hamas War is a logical result of 50 years of failed military policies.' Our views were diametrically opposed. I had warned of the ticking time bomb in Gaza already in 2018, half a decade before. A day or two before October 7, I wrote an essay on the coming explosion in Gaza. It was not prophetic insight. October 7, 2023, was the 50-year anniversary of the Yom Kippur War and I fully expected a high-profile reaction. After the brutal Hamas-led assault, Israeli authorities vehemently condemned what they called 'our September 11' and a 'surprise attack.' But the hard questions were conveniently ignored – and still are. A week ago, the Israeli Defense Forces’ landmark investigations into the October 7 attack disclosed severe, deep-rooted intelligence miscalculations and fundamental misconceptions on the nature of Hamas and its intentions by both the Israeli government and military. Probing the same attack, Shin Bet, Israel’s internal security service, recently pointed fingers at Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Typically, the prime mistakes featured the political conception of Hamas as an Israeli asset, the intelligence misjudgment that it couldn't launch a large-scale attack, and weak defensive deployment. The intriguing part of the story is that these facts were pretty well known already in the first days after October 7, 2023 – that is, more than a year ago – as I argue in The Fall of Israel. And there is more to the story. Why was the abundant intelligence on the impending Hamas attack deliberately ignored? Why were the Israeli hostages effectively abandoned? Why were the strategic border communities neglected? With all its might, backed up with U.S. military aid and financing, how did Israel fail to see the writing on the wall? Ignored intelligence After October 7, a high-level Egyptian intelligence official said Israel had ignored repeated warnings that 'an explosion of the situation is coming, and very soon, and it would be big.' Netanyahu denied receiving any such advance warning. Yet, the Egyptian confirmed that the Israeli PM had received direct notice from Cairo’s intelligence minister. Similarly, Michael McCaul, Chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, told reporters of the alleged warning. The inconvenient fact was that Israeli intelligence authorities had been aware of the threat for months yet ignored it. In November 2023, the New York Times reported that 'Israel knew Hamas’s attack plan more than a year ago.' Code-named Jericho Wall, the 40-page blueprint outlined a lethal invasion. The document had been circulated widely among Israeli military and intelligence leaders, but experts determined an attack of that scale and ambition was beyond Hamas’s capabilities. The Times report reverberated internationally. But it wasn’t a scoop. Right after October 7, several Israeli media released several reports indicating that many intelligence analysts’ warnings were ignored. What was new in the Times piece was the document verifying the story. There was also a potentially explosive issue behind the Israeli deaths. Not about 'friendly fire,' which is not uncommon amid fierce battles, but about the consequences of the Hannibal Directive, which many Israelis have charged was now the rule. This directive demands Israelis to kill their fellow soldiers and family members so that their kidnapping and the consequent prisoner exchanges can be avoided, presumably in the interest of a 'greater good.' The Hamas-led offensive was compounded by what some Israeli soldiers subsequently called a 'mass Hannibal.' Just days after October 7, testimonies from members of the mainly female lookout units bolstered accusations that Netanyahu’s leadership fatally misread the dangers from Gaza. In an Israeli TV segment, two soldiers, Yael Rotenberg and Maya Desiatnik, recounted their experiences in the months before the attack. Rotenberg frequently saw many Palestinians dressed in civilian clothing near the border fence with maps, scrutinizing the ground around it and digging holes. Once, when she passed the information on, she was told they were just farmers, and there was nothing to worry about. 'It’s infuriating,' said Desiatnik who served in Nahal Oz, where 20 other women border surveillance soldiers were murdered by Hamas. 'We saw what was happening, we told them about it, and we were the ones who were murdered.' Underpinning all these ignored warnings was the IDF’s assumption that Hamas lacked the capability to attack and would not dare to do so. The flawed supposition was fostered by two factors. First, gender bias. The longer the militarization has prevailed in Israel, the more the country’s gender gap –the difference between women and men as reflected in social, political, and economic attainments – has deepened. Today, Israel’s gender gap ranks at the level of El Salvador and Uganda. What, after all, did the 'girls' of the lookout units know? Moreover, the idea that Hamas lacked capability to attack was predicated on the belief the Palestinians were 'human animals,' as Netanyahu and the cabinet ministers called Hamas operatives. Subhumans cannot think out-of-the-box. In reality, based on over 1 year of evidence, Hamas militants had trained for the blitzattacks in at least six sites across Gaza in plain sight and less than 1.5 km from Israel’s heavily fortified and monitored border, as even the mainstream CNN concluded barely a week after October 7. Worse, many testimonies by Israeli witnesses to the Hamas attack indicate that the Israeli military killed its own citizens struggling to neutralize Palestinian gunmen, in accordance with the Hannibal Directive. As one witness said to Israel Radio: '[Israeli special forces] eliminated everyone, including the hostages.' Worse, in addition to the ignored intelligence, there were other issues that just didn’t add up, including the abandoned hostages, and the state of the long neglected Israeli communities surrounding Gaza. Abandoned hostages On October 7, 2023, as part of the overall Hamas-led offense, 251 people were abducted from Israel to the Gaza Strip, including children, women and elderly. Almost half of the hostages were foreign nationals or had multiple citizenships. The next day, Prime Minister Netanyahu appointed ex-military commander Gal Hirsch to coordinate the cross-governmental response to abducted civilians and soldiers. Internationally, the appointment was portrayed as the PM’s proactive move to ensure the timely release of the Israeli hostages. Little did they know. As brigadier general, Hirsch had commanded an IDF division during the 2006 Lebanon War, which saw the first test of the Dahiya doctrine, premised on the destruction of civilian infrastructure. Hirsch was seen as responsible for the blunder resulting in an abduction by Hezbollah militants and the battles of Bint Jbeil and Ayta ash-Sha’b, which the IDF failed to occupy, despite heavy casualties. Following a barrage of criticism, Hirsch was forced to resign. After years of career rehabilitation, he joined the dominant harsh-right party Likud at the behest of Netanyahu himself and became the favorite for the role of the national police chief in 2021 – until he and his business partners were indicted for tax evasion of $1.9 million in a case concerning arms sales to Georgia. Why did Netanyahu appoint as his hostage tsar a general who had already blundered one high-profile abduction affair, failed to protect his soldiers and had been indicted for corruption? Unsurprisingly, the families of the hostages concluded that, in the view of the Netanyahu government, the fate of the hostages was secondary to the pretext of October 7 for a massive ground assault. The realization led to bitter and divisive mass demonstrations against the government and for the release of the hostages that prevailed until recently. If the hostage families and many ordinary Israelis despised the government that seemed to ignore the fate of the abducted, they found it even harder to digest the idea that their government may have been responsible for the deliberate killing of their loved ones. Just days after October 7, early reports and interviews suggested that the IDF had detailed prior knowledge of the Hamas offensive three long weeks beforehand, based on information from military intelligence’s Unit 8200. Highlighting the extent to which the IDF’s Gaza Division was aware of a potential attack on Israel’s southern border communities, the document, which was ignored by senior officials, detailed a series of exercises conducted by Hamas’ elite Nukhba units in the weeks prior to its publication. One of the most shocking sections of the IDF report featured instructions relating to the taking of hostages, the number of which was estimated to be between 200–250, coming close to the actual 251 captives. Does this enumeration in the report reflect extraordinary foresight? Or does it – since its findings were blatantly ignored prior to October 7 – illustrate a deliberate intention to allow a certain extent of devastation, in order to permit a transformational event that would legitimize a broad-scale invasion and, ultimately, a war of obliteration? Such considerations, of course, have been quickly torpedoed as 'conspiracy theories.' However, as long as credible investigations are deferred or suppressed in advance, legitimate concerns prevail on the causes of devastation on October 7. And then, there was the odd issue of the Israeli communities surrounding the Gaza Strip, which had been regarded as 'strategic' since the creation of Israel in 1948. Why had they been ignored as if they were 'non-strategic' for several years? Neglected Israeli communities When Israel was established, its founding fathers considered its border areas strategic. Adjacent to the Gaza Strip, these are the populated areas in Israel’s Southern District located within 7 km of the border and thus within the range of mortar shells and Qassam rockets. If these areas were strategic to national security, why were they so vulnerable on October 7? It is one thing that Israeli intelligence ignored over a year of warnings about the ability and willingness of Hamas to launch a major offensive. But it is another that the security of the surrounding Israeli border areas was effectively downplayed. Some of these settlements were created at the eve of the 1948 Arab Israeli War, including Sa’ad and Nirim, the two kibbutzim. The bigger ones were established soon after the 1949 Armistice Agreement, including Sderot, a development town for Mizrahi immigrants – that is, the Jews from the Middle East – and the military Nahal Oz, designed to become a civilian settlement and serve as a first line of defense against possible Arab incursions. In the early days of the Israeli state, many new arrivals from the Arab countries found themselves treated as 'more primitive' second-class citizens by the predominantly European-born Ashkenazi-Jewish elite. These subtle and not-so-subtle ethnic differences, compounded by visible 'white' and 'non-white' distinctions, continue to haunt the Israeli civil society. Yet, the Mizrahi Jews near Gaza faced additional challenges, and there were many Ashkenazis in these communities as well. Many of these localities were neglected, while some, particularly the immigrant development towns, felt shunned by their government. When Israel occupied the Gaza Strip in 1967, border threats diminished until the First Intifada in the late 1980s and the rise of Hamas. Following Israel’s unilateral withdrawal from the Gaza Strip in 2005, cross-border shelling and rocket attacks into Israel increased accordingly. To protect these areas, which now became known as the Gaza Envelope, the Israeli parliament Knesset enacted a law to assist the 'confrontation-line communities.' But when these measures expired in 2014 – a decade before October 7 – the district command of the IDF cut the associated budgets. This enraged many of the communities. After all, the 2014 Gaza War had caused a substantial adverse impact on the proximate settlements, due to rocket and mortar attacks, tunnels, intrusions, even incendiary kites. The war was followed by another wave of violence in 2018. And on October 7, many communities in the Gaza Envelope were infiltrated, with hundreds of Israelis butchered and kidnapped. Instead of protecting its citizens, Israel had retreated from its traditional security obligations to the adjacent Israeli communities. As evidenced by the national budget for the Gaza Envelope localities in 2014–2024, these communities were, as critics said, 'slated for abandonment following the November 2022 elections.' In effect, the per capita budgets approved for the years 2023-2024 were almost a third lower than that of 2022. So, well before October 7, the strategic needs of the Gaza Envelope of adjacent Israeli communities were effectively neglected by the government. However, the huge military border barrier prevailed. Between 2017 and 2021, to counter the many tunnels Palestinians dug for infiltration, Israel also constructed an underground border wall, equipped with sensors several meters in depth along the entire border. In Israel, the high-tech security barriers were portrayed as impenetrable. And yet, the IDF was tricked by Hamas’s messaging, over-relied on a remote-controlled surveillance systems and weapons that were swiftly disabled by drones and snipers, enabling its infiltration and onslaught. Furthermore, the builder of the barrier had warned already in 2018 that it absolutely required a military presence. It was not designed to prevent mass assault on its own. Unsurprisingly, the Hamas offensive caused a full breakdown in trust between the Israeli localities and their state, with residents reluctant to return to homes until security was fully ensured. As regional escalation spread to northern Israel, it shared the Gaza Envelope’s challenges, facing the rockets of the Hezbollah. By summer 2024, local leaders were warning the Netanyahu cabinet they planned to leave if the situation wouldn’t improve. 'Where is the government?' asked the chief of the regional council, Moshe Davidovitch. 'Even a banana republic does not work like this,' he added. 'The government is destroying the North.' Convenient narratives and inconvenient truths By May 2024, new evidence indicated that Israel’s intelligence failure was the net effect of a 'chain of failures' that pervaded the entire security sector, both in the Shin Bet and the IDF. The common denominator was the fallacy that Hamas was only able of firing long-range rockets against Israel. Whatever did not fit this theory was rejected. So, the warnings of the IDF female spotters were systematically ignored. What they saw as an impending mass attack intelligence officers dismissed as 'routine Hamas training.' Second, after the Gaza war in 2021, it was decided to cease intelligence-gathering on Hamas’ tactical array and the intermediate ranks of its military arm, to focus only on few individuals. Opposing views to this intelligence concept were marginalized. These failures were coupled with a sense of disdain in the intelligence culture, which viewed the border fence, together with the underground border barrier between Israel and Gaza, as denying Hamas the possibility of invading Israel. The 'Iron Wall' was considered impenetrable; for all the wrong reasons. In effect, Hamas operatives breached the border barrier at 44 different points. Consequently, the so-called intelligence failure on October 7 can be attributed primarily to the rejection of external warnings, denial of internal evidence, suppression of tactical intelligence, autocratic culture, and inflated perception of the effectiveness of the separation barriers. The ongoing investigation of the military is likely to stress similar factors. But was that the full story or a part of the story? In effect, what was the story? In the early conventional narrative, 'intelligence failure' was framed as the prime narrative. But the thesis is hard to argue when tactical intelligence was delivered exceptionally well, despite reduced resources, and it outlined the threats in detail well before the attack, including the almost exact number anticipated to be abducted. There are too many anomalies and happy coincidences in the current narratives. So, if 'intelligence failure' is not the story, what is? This leaves open the question, was the 'neglect of intelligence evidence' just unprofessional conduct? In the United States, September 11, 2001, provided the kind of catastrophic and catalyzing event – like 'a new Pearl Harbor' – that the leading neoconservatives, gathered around the Project for the New American Century in 2000, envisioned as critical to achieve massive rearmament in America. Subsequently, it served as a flawed pretext for the war against Iraq and global war on terror. Netanyahu was well aware of this neoconservative Project; he funded some of its pioneers. The rise of neoconservatism in the U.S. went hand in hand with the emergence of Netanyahu’s Likud in Israel. It resulted in a neoconservative policy document, A Clean Break: A New Strategy for Securing the Realm, described as 'a kind of U.S.-Israeli neoconservative manifesto.' In Israel, the Hamas offensive was immediately followed by a coordinated nationwide outcry that 'October 7 is our September 11' by PM Netanyahu, who had built his rise to power in the 1990s in cooperation with the very same U.S. neoconservatives, as well as the rise of Hamas at the expense of the Palestinian Authority, which his policies had tacitly supported for years. With October 7, he used the Hamas offensive to legitimize the subsequent ground assault and genocidal atrocities, which many in his war cabinet hoped would result in ethnic expulsions that would open Gaza for Jewish resettlement. Meanwhile, his Messianic far-right cabinet partners used the fog of war to disguise their ongoing (and largely successful) effort at the effective annexation of the West Bank to Israel proper. The point is not to argue that one or another of these narratives is conclusive. Too much evidence is still missing.

Was October 7 Avoidable? – OpEd	After the Hamas-led offensive of October 7, 2023, it was portrayed as 'Israel’s 9/11,' which came out of the blue. Yet, this assumption is not supported by verified facts, including ignored intelligence, abandoned hostages and neglected Israeli communities around Gaza. A day after October 7, Eurasia Group’s Ian Bremmer said that the 'massive attacks by Hamas leadership into Israel … is no less than Israel’s 9/11.' By contrast, in the same interview for CNBC, I said that October 7 did not come out of the blue. 'The Israeli-Hamas War is a logical result of 50 years of failed military policies.' Our views were diametrically opposed. I had warned of the ticking time bomb in Gaza already in 2018, half a decade before. A day or two before October 7, I wrote an essay on the coming explosion in Gaza. It was not prophetic insight. October 7, 2023, was the 50-year anniversary of the Yom Kippur War and I fully expected a high-profile reaction. After the brutal Hamas-led assault, Israeli authorities vehemently condemned what they called 'our September 11' and a 'surprise attack.' But the hard questions were conveniently ignored – and still are. A week ago, the Israeli Defense Forces’ landmark investigations into the October 7 attack disclosed severe, deep-rooted intelligence miscalculations and fundamental misconceptions on the nature of Hamas and its intentions by both the Israeli government and military. Probing the same attack, Shin Bet, Israel’s internal security service, recently pointed fingers at Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Typically, the prime mistakes featured the political conception of Hamas as an Israeli asset, the intelligence misjudgment that it couldn't launch a large-scale attack, and weak defensive deployment. The intriguing part of the story is that these facts were pretty well known already in the first days after October 7, 2023 – that is, more than a year ago – as I argue in The Fall of Israel. And there is more to the story. Why was the abundant intelligence on the impending Hamas attack deliberately ignored? Why were the Israeli hostages effectively abandoned? Why were the strategic border communities neglected? With all its might, backed up with U.S. military aid and financing, how did Israel fail to see the writing on the wall? Ignored intelligence After October 7, a high-level Egyptian intelligence official said Israel had ignored repeated warnings that 'an explosion of the situation is coming, and very soon, and it would be big.' Netanyahu denied receiving any such advance warning. Yet, the Egyptian confirmed that the Israeli PM had received direct notice from Cairo’s intelligence minister. Similarly, Michael McCaul, Chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, told reporters of the alleged warning. The inconvenient fact was that Israeli intelligence authorities had been aware of the threat for months yet ignored it. In November 2023, the New York Times reported that 'Israel knew Hamas’s attack plan more than a year ago.' Code-named Jericho Wall, the 40-page blueprint outlined a lethal invasion. The document had been circulated widely among Israeli military and intelligence leaders, but experts determined an attack of that scale and ambition was beyond Hamas’s capabilities. The Times report reverberated internationally. But it wasn’t a scoop. Right after October 7, several Israeli media released several reports indicating that many intelligence analysts’ warnings were ignored. What was new in the Times piece was the document verifying the story. There was also a potentially explosive issue behind the Israeli deaths. Not about 'friendly fire,' which is not uncommon amid fierce battles, but about the consequences of the Hannibal Directive, which many Israelis have charged was now the rule. This directive demands Israelis to kill their fellow soldiers and family members so that their kidnapping and the consequent prisoner exchanges can be avoided, presumably in the interest of a 'greater good.' The Hamas-led offensive was compounded by what some Israeli soldiers subsequently called a 'mass Hannibal.' Just days after October 7, testimonies from members of the mainly female lookout units bolstered accusations that Netanyahu’s leadership fatally misread the dangers from Gaza. In an Israeli TV segment, two soldiers, Yael Rotenberg and Maya Desiatnik, recounted their experiences in the months before the attack. Rotenberg frequently saw many Palestinians dressed in civilian clothing near the border fence with maps, scrutinizing the ground around it and digging holes. Once, when she passed the information on, she was told they were just farmers, and there was nothing to worry about. 'It’s infuriating,' said Desiatnik who served in Nahal Oz, where 20 other women border surveillance soldiers were murdered by Hamas. 'We saw what was happening, we told them about it, and we were the ones who were murdered.' Underpinning all these ignored warnings was the IDF’s assumption that Hamas lacked the capability to attack and would not dare to do so. The flawed supposition was fostered by two factors. First, gender bias. The longer the militarization has prevailed in Israel, the more the country’s gender gap –the difference between women and men as reflected in social, political, and economic attainments – has deepened. Today, Israel’s gender gap ranks at the level of El Salvador and Uganda. What, after all, did the 'girls' of the lookout units know? Moreover, the idea that Hamas lacked capability to attack was predicated on the belief the Palestinians were 'human animals,' as Netanyahu and the cabinet ministers called Hamas operatives. Subhumans cannot think out-of-the-box. In reality, based on over 1 year of evidence, Hamas militants had trained for the blitzattacks in at least six sites across Gaza in plain sight and less than 1.5 km from Israel’s heavily fortified and monitored border, as even the mainstream CNN concluded barely a week after October 7. Worse, many testimonies by Israeli witnesses to the Hamas attack indicate that the Israeli military killed its own citizens struggling to neutralize Palestinian gunmen, in accordance with the Hannibal Directive. As one witness said to Israel Radio: '[Israeli special forces] eliminated everyone, including the hostages.' Worse, in addition to the ignored intelligence, there were other issues that just didn’t add up, including the abandoned hostages, and the state of the long neglected Israeli communities surrounding Gaza. Abandoned hostages On October 7, 2023, as part of the overall Hamas-led offense, 251 people were abducted from Israel to the Gaza Strip, including children, women and elderly. Almost half of the hostages were foreign nationals or had multiple citizenships. The next day, Prime Minister Netanyahu appointed ex-military commander Gal Hirsch to coordinate the cross-governmental response to abducted civilians and soldiers. Internationally, the appointment was portrayed as the PM’s proactive move to ensure the timely release of the Israeli hostages. Little did they know. As brigadier general, Hirsch had commanded an IDF division during the 2006 Lebanon War, which saw the first test of the Dahiya doctrine, premised on the destruction of civilian infrastructure. Hirsch was seen as responsible for the blunder resulting in an abduction by Hezbollah militants and the battles of Bint Jbeil and Ayta ash-Sha’b, which the IDF failed to occupy, despite heavy casualties. Following a barrage of criticism, Hirsch was forced to resign. After years of career rehabilitation, he joined the dominant harsh-right party Likud at the behest of Netanyahu himself and became the favorite for the role of the national police chief in 2021 – until he and his business partners were indicted for tax evasion of $1.9 million in a case concerning arms sales to Georgia. Why did Netanyahu appoint as his hostage tsar a general who had already blundered one high-profile abduction affair, failed to protect his soldiers and had been indicted for corruption? Unsurprisingly, the families of the hostages concluded that, in the view of the Netanyahu government, the fate of the hostages was secondary to the pretext of October 7 for a massive ground assault. The realization led to bitter and divisive mass demonstrations against the government and for the release of the hostages that prevailed until recently. If the hostage families and many ordinary Israelis despised the government that seemed to ignore the fate of the abducted, they found it even harder to digest the idea that their government may have been responsible for the deliberate killing of their loved ones. Just days after October 7, early reports and interviews suggested that the IDF had detailed prior knowledge of the Hamas offensive three long weeks beforehand, based on information from military intelligence’s Unit 8200. Highlighting the extent to which the IDF’s Gaza Division was aware of a potential attack on Israel’s southern border communities, the document, which was ignored by senior officials, detailed a series of exercises conducted by Hamas’ elite Nukhba units in the weeks prior to its publication. One of the most shocking sections of the IDF report featured instructions relating to the taking of hostages, the number of which was estimated to be between 200–250, coming close to the actual 251 captives. Does this enumeration in the report reflect extraordinary foresight? Or does it – since its findings were blatantly ignored prior to October 7 – illustrate a deliberate intention to allow a certain extent of devastation, in order to permit a transformational event that would legitimize a broad-scale invasion and, ultimately, a war of obliteration? Such considerations, of course, have been quickly torpedoed as 'conspiracy theories.' However, as long as credible investigations are deferred or suppressed in advance, legitimate concerns prevail on the causes of devastation on October 7. And then, there was the odd issue of the Israeli communities surrounding the Gaza Strip, which had been regarded as 'strategic' since the creation of Israel in 1948. Why had they been ignored as if they were 'non-strategic' for several years? Neglected Israeli communities When Israel was established, its founding fathers considered its border areas strategic. Adjacent to the Gaza Strip, these are the populated areas in Israel’s Southern District located within 7 km of the border and thus within the range of mortar shells and Qassam rockets. If these areas were strategic to national security, why were they so vulnerable on October 7? It is one thing that Israeli intelligence ignored over a year of warnings about the ability and willingness of Hamas to launch a major offensive. But it is another that the security of the surrounding Israeli border areas was effectively downplayed. Some of these settlements were created at the eve of the 1948 Arab Israeli War, including Sa’ad and Nirim, the two kibbutzim. The bigger ones were established soon after the 1949 Armistice Agreement, including Sderot, a development town for Mizrahi immigrants – that is, the Jews from the Middle East – and the military Nahal Oz, designed to become a civilian settlement and serve as a first line of defense against possible Arab incursions. In the early days of the Israeli state, many new arrivals from the Arab countries found themselves treated as 'more primitive' second-class citizens by the predominantly European-born Ashkenazi-Jewish elite. These subtle and not-so-subtle ethnic differences, compounded by visible 'white' and 'non-white' distinctions, continue to haunt the Israeli civil society. Yet, the Mizrahi Jews near Gaza faced additional challenges, and there were many Ashkenazis in these communities as well. Many of these localities were neglected, while some, particularly the immigrant development towns, felt shunned by their government. When Israel occupied the Gaza Strip in 1967, border threats diminished until the First Intifada in the late 1980s and the rise of Hamas. Following Israel’s unilateral withdrawal from the Gaza Strip in 2005, cross-border shelling and rocket attacks into Israel increased accordingly. To protect these areas, which now became known as the Gaza Envelope, the Israeli parliament Knesset enacted a law to assist the 'confrontation-line communities.' But when these measures expired in 2014 – a decade before October 7 – the district command of the IDF cut the associated budgets. This enraged many of the communities. After all, the 2014 Gaza War had caused a substantial adverse impact on the proximate settlements, due to rocket and mortar attacks, tunnels, intrusions, even incendiary kites. The war was followed by another wave of violence in 2018. And on October 7, many communities in the Gaza Envelope were infiltrated, with hundreds of Israelis butchered and kidnapped. Instead of protecting its citizens, Israel had retreated from its traditional security obligations to the adjacent Israeli communities. As evidenced by the national budget for the Gaza Envelope localities in 2014–2024, these communities were, as critics said, 'slated for abandonment following the November 2022 elections.' In effect, the per capita budgets approved for the years 2023-2024 were almost a third lower than that of 2022. So, well before October 7, the strategic needs of the Gaza Envelope of adjacent Israeli communities were effectively neglected by the government. However, the huge military border barrier prevailed. Between 2017 and 2021, to counter the many tunnels Palestinians dug for infiltration, Israel also constructed an underground border wall, equipped with sensors several meters in depth along the entire border. In Israel, the high-tech security barriers were portrayed as impenetrable. And yet, the IDF was tricked by Hamas’s messaging, over-relied on a remote-controlled surveillance systems and weapons that were swiftly disabled by drones and snipers, enabling its infiltration and onslaught. Furthermore, the builder of the barrier had warned already in 2018 that it absolutely required a military presence. It was not designed to prevent mass assault on its own. Unsurprisingly, the Hamas offensive caused a full breakdown in trust between the Israeli localities and their state, with residents reluctant to return to homes until security was fully ensured. As regional escalation spread to northern Israel, it shared the Gaza Envelope’s challenges, facing the rockets of the Hezbollah. By summer 2024, local leaders were warning the Netanyahu cabinet they planned to leave if the situation wouldn’t improve. 'Where is the government?' asked the chief of the regional council, Moshe Davidovitch. 'Even a banana republic does not work like this,' he added. 'The government is destroying the North.' Convenient narratives and inconvenient truths By May 2024, new evidence indicated that Israel’s intelligence failure was the net effect of a 'chain of failures' that pervaded the entire security sector, both in the Shin Bet and the IDF. The common denominator was the fallacy that Hamas was only able of firing long-range rockets against Israel. Whatever did not fit this theory was rejected. So, the warnings of the IDF female spotters were systematically ignored. What they saw as an impending mass attack intelligence officers dismissed as 'routine Hamas training.' Second, after the Gaza war in 2021, it was decided to cease intelligence-gathering on Hamas’ tactical array and the intermediate ranks of its military arm, to focus only on few individuals. Opposing views to this intelligence concept were marginalized. These failures were coupled with a sense of disdain in the intelligence culture, which viewed the border fence, together with the underground border barrier between Israel and Gaza, as denying Hamas the possibility of invading Israel. The 'Iron Wall' was considered impenetrable; for all the wrong reasons. In effect, Hamas operatives breached the border barrier at 44 different points. Consequently, the so-called intelligence failure on October 7 can be attributed primarily to the rejection of external warnings, denial of internal evidence, suppression of tactical intelligence, autocratic culture, and inflated perception of the effectiveness of the separation barriers. The ongoing investigation of the military is likely to stress similar factors. But was that the full story or a part of the story? In effect, what was the story? In the early conventional narrative, 'intelligence failure' was framed as the prime narrative. But the thesis is hard to argue when tactical intelligence was delivered exceptionally well, despite reduced resources, and it outlined the threats in detail well before the attack, including the almost exact number anticipated to be abducted. There are too many anomalies and happy coincidences in the current narratives. So, if 'intelligence failure' is not the story, what is? This leaves open the question, was the 'neglect of intelligence evidence' just unprofessional conduct? In the United States, September 11, 2001, provided the kind of catastrophic and catalyzing event – like 'a new Pearl Harbor' – that the leading neoconservatives, gathered around the Project for the New American Century in 2000, envisioned as critical to achieve massive rearmament in America. Subsequently, it served as a flawed pretext for the war against Iraq and global war on terror. Netanyahu was well aware of this neoconservative Project; he funded some of its pioneers. The rise of neoconservatism in the U.S. went hand in hand with the emergence of Netanyahu’s Likud in Israel. It resulted in a neoconservative policy document, A Clean Break: A New Strategy for Securing the Realm, described as 'a kind of U.S.-Israeli neoconservative manifesto.' In Israel, the Hamas offensive was immediately followed by a coordinated nationwide outcry that 'October 7 is our September 11' by PM Netanyahu, who had built his rise to power in the 1990s in cooperation with the very same U.S. neoconservatives, as well as the rise of Hamas at the expense of the Palestinian Authority, which his policies had tacitly supported for years.

Meanwhile, his Messianic far-right cabinet partners used the fog of war to disguise their ongoing (and largely successful) effort at the effective annexation of the West Bank to Israel proper. The point is not to argue that one or another of these narratives is conclusive. Too much evidence is still missing.

The Deepening Deterioration Of The Situation In Afghanistan – Ana...	By Zhou Chao Since the United States' hasty withdrawal from Afghanistan in 2021, the Taliban quickly overthrew the pro-Western government that had been supported by the U.S. and other Western nations, establishing their own regime. Subsequently, the international community maintained a long-standing stance of non-recognition and isolation towards the Taliban authorities, and the Chinese government also did not officially recognize the Taliban. However, the Chinese government and the Taliban authorities have had considerable practical contact, with China formally accepting the Taliban's appointed ambassador to China, and Chinese companies beginning to reinvest in the Afghan region. In 2023, China's Central Asia Petroleum and Natural Gas Company (CAPEIC) signed an investment agreement with the Afghan authorities totaling USD 540 million. In 2024, China and Afghanistan signed a cooperation agreement for a key supporting project of the Mes Aynak copper mining, the Baghdara hydropower project, with a total investment of USD 10 billion. In the summer of the same year, there was an official announcement on the commencement of the construction of a new road from the Kabul-Gardez intercity highway to the entrance of the Mes Aynak copper mine, marking a significant step forward in the China-invested mine project. Since the Taliban took control of the Afghan government, analyses have consistently pointed out that the internal situation in Afghanistan has not fully stabilized. Internal conflicts in Afghanistan still show signs of resurgence, and the Taliban remains isolated internationally, with economic difficulties also intensifying. However, some Chinese analyses suggest that this situation might actually present an opportunity for China to increase its investment in Afghanistan. Recently, Transparency International, in its 2024 report, stated that Afghanistan ranked 165th out of 180 countries in terms of public sector corruption. According to the report, Afghanistan scored 17 out of 100 on the Corruption Perceptions Index, 3 points lower than its score in 2023. The country had previously scored 20 points in 2023 and 24 points in 2022. Although the Taliban regime's scores have decreased in recent years, it still remains better than the situation under the previous government. In March 2024, the Taliban authority publicly stated that all forms of corruption within government departments had been eradicated and that Afghanistan would welcome foreign investment with efficiency, integrity, and a proactive attitude. Overall, the feasibility of investing in Afghanistan seems to have been strengthened. However, a series of developments in Afghanistan's internal situation since the second half of last year suggest that the possibility of the situation worsening significantly should not be underestimated. For the Taliban regime, its governance is based on Islamic law, with Supreme Leader Hibatullah Akhundzada controlling core policies through religious edicts. Military and political leaders are required to obey his decisions. Beneath the Supreme Leader, the Taliban regime is primarily divided into four factions: 1. Kandahar Faction (Akhundzada, etc.): Representing the traditional Pashtun forces, this faction emphasizes religious orthodoxy. 2. Haqqani Network: An independent military-economic group closely linked to cross-border armed organizations. 3. Doha Faction (led by Mullah Abdul Ghani Baradar, among others): Advocates for limited openness to gain international recognition, but its influence has significantly weakened in recent years. 4. Local Warlords: Some local commanders have gained more autonomy in areas such as taxation and security, creating centrifugal tendencies against the central Taliban government. Outside the Taliban regime, there are still opposition forces in Afghanistan. The more active ones include ISIS, former Afghan government officials, and opposition armed groups led by former Northern Alliance commanders. Since last year, in terms of Afghanistan's internal political and security situation, the Taliban authorities have primarily faced two major challenges. Firstly, there is a growing trend of internal power struggles within the regime. Taliban spokesperson Zabihullah Mujahid recently stated on social media that there are indeed differences of opinion within the Taliban, but he insisted that these differences would not escalate into violent conflict or open clashes. However, observers have pointed out that serious divisions have already emerged within the Taliban leadership and are continuing to intensify. Several months ago, the Taliban's Interior Minister, Sirajuddin Haqqani, disappeared after traveling to the UAE, while the Deputy Foreign Minister, Abbas Stanikzai, fled to the UAE after issuing harsh criticisms of the Taliban's senior leadership. Related analyses suggest that Afghanistan's supreme spiritual leader Akhundzada, is continuously consolidating power, strengthening the Kandahar faction's control over Afghanistan's highest authority. Meanwhile, the senior leadership of the Haqqani Network is being increasingly marginalized, leading to intense struggles between the two factions. The internal conflict within the Taliban seems to be intensifying, which could directly exacerbate instability in Afghanistan. A recent commentary in Pakistan's Dawn newspaper even pointed out that there is a risk of the Taliban's highest leader being overthrown. Secondly, the strength and destructive power of opposition forces have increased. The Taliban has made slow progress in establishing an inclusive government and has shown excessive bias toward the Pashtun, which has caused strong dissatisfaction among other ethnic groups in the country. Opposition armed groups have seized this opportunity to gain widespread support from Tajik, Hazara, and other ethnic communities, frequently operating in the northern and central regions of Afghanistan. Among them, the organizations led by Ahmad Massoud, leader of the National Resistance Front (NRF), and Yasin Zia, leader of the Afghanistan Freedom Front (AFF), have been the most active. Previously, the AFF has even launched attacks in Kabul, causing casualties among several Taliban members, demonstrating its strong combat capabilities and a determined spirit of resistance. Meanwhile, the NRF has been steadily expanding its forces in its operational areas, strengthening military training, and enhancing its stance against the Taliban. The resurgence of opposition forces, coupled with the intensification of internal struggles within the Taliban, is likely to accelerate the deterioration of Afghanistan's internal situation. Moreover, negative factors outside the political and security situation are also quite evident. According to a report from the World Bank, Afghanistan's GDP has declined by 26% over the past two years, with the economy continuing to suffer from a recession, high unemployment, and a large portion of the population losing their sources of income, resulting in a dire living situation. In such an economic environment, sectors like infrastructure development, education, and healthcare in Afghanistan have struggled to develop effectively, leading to a worsening quality of life for the people. In terms of international recognition, despite the Taliban authorities actively engaging in diplomatic activities, expanding foreign relations, and increasing interactions with Russia, Turkey, China, and some Gulf countries, they recently held high-level meetings with India and even sent delegations to Japan, the international community's recognition of the Taliban government remains minimal. The Taliban authorities are finding it difficult to secure the necessary aid to improve the internal situation, and a significant portion of the population, in search of a livelihood, either flee abroad or align with armed groups, ultimately creating a vicious cycle. Furthermore, the worsening relationship between Afghanistan and Pakistan is also worth noting. Data released by the United Nations shows that the operational capabilities of Pakistan's largest terrorist group, the Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), have significantly increased, severely worsening Pakistan's security situation. The report indicates that between July and December 2024, the TTP launched over 600 terrorist attacks against Pakistan, including attacks originating from Afghan territory. Despite the Taliban's assurances that Afghan territory will not be used for terrorism against any country, the Afghan Taliban continues to provide logistical support, operational space, and financial backing to the TTP, including funding for TTP leadership and establishing new training centers in Afghanistan's Kunar, Nangarhar, Khost, and Paktika provinces. Afghanistan's support for the TTP severely impacts Pakistan's security, further escalating tensions between the two countries. Recently, Pakistani authorities have made it clear that they do not rule out the possibility of fully deporting the millions of Afghan refugees still residing in Pakistan. Should Pakistan take formal action, the influx of millions of refugees would further strain Afghanistan's social resources and exacerbate the country's already volatile situation. Another important point to consider is that, with the deepening deterioration of the situation in Afghanistan, it is certain to create a regional spillover effect. Refugees and armed militants are likely to spread to neighboring countries, which would, in turn, have a negative impact on the entire Central Asian region. Final analysis conclusion: Since the Taliban's return to power, the international community generally acknowledges that violence within Afghanistan has decreased. However, existing analyses also point out that the Taliban regime has failed to effectively integrate internal forces, and its relationship with its most important neighbor, Pakistan, continues to deteriorate. Now, with the intensifying infighting within the Taliban leadership, the possibility of a deepening internal crisis in Afghanistan cannot be overlooked. If this trend continues to escalate, the regional spillover effects could be quite significant.

The Nantha Kumar Case Is Destroying The Integrity Of The Malaysia...	Its time to abolish this institutionally corrupt organization When Anwar Ibrahim became prime minister in November 2022, he promised that fighting corruption would be his first priority. The Chief Commissioner of the Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission (MACC) Azam Baki himself said, that approximately 30 percent of government spending is lost through leakage connected with corruption. Although Malaysians at first had high hopes, the further rapid decay and politicization of the MACC since Anwar came to power has created much disappointment. The Nantha Kumar case, now playing out is highlighting the lack of integrity of the MACC, which has openly appeared to have been working in cahoots with the allegedly corrupt parties to entrap an investigative journalist, who has been uncovering their illegal operations. Nantha Kumar is an investigative journalist working for the well-known independent news portal Malaysiakini. Nantha had been uncovering a 'fly' syndicate operating at Kuala Lumpur International Airport (KLIA) and had published a series of articles about a 'Pakistani agent' and immigration officials who have been allegedly falsifying entry and exit stamps of foreign workers, without their physical presence. Nantha cooperated with the state immigration director, and a senior official of the home ministry. Nantha also gave the names of corrupt officials allegedly involved in a medical visa scam to the home ministry Saifuddin Nasution Ismail personally. Nantha was well known within Malaysian government, civil service and media circles as an honest journalist with integrity. As part of his investigation, Nantha met with two Pakistani agents at a restaurant, which was registered under the name of a former high ranking immigration officer, where one of the agents claimed that someone had asked for RM400,000 to settle the case with the police, MACC, immigration department and Malaysiakini. They made an offer to Nantha to pay him RM 50,000 (20,000 on the spot) to stop writing about the subject. Nantha upon reporting the attempted bribe to the immigration officer said, there was no financial transaction evidence to make anything stick. This senior immigration officer asked Nantha to meet with the agents once again to gather evidence as an ‘undercover’ agent. A meeting was arranged at the Concorde Hotel in Shah Alam. Nantha informed the state immigration director, he would meet with the agents and later hand over any evidence to them. At the meeting, one of the 'Pakistani' agents handed Nantha an envelope. However, within seconds, a dozen MACC agents descended upon him. Nantha was then remanded for four days, locked up alone in a cell for 15 hours each day. He slept on a hard floor with no blanket or pillows. Treated sub-humanly as a means of humiliation. Detention aftermath The major question is why was only Nantha arrested and no the 'Pakistani' agents who remain free? This is after Nantha went out of his way to cooperate with authorities. Why had the MACC collaborated with those upon who corrupt activities were alleged? Nantha has been released for a number of days, and unlike other cases, Nantha was never taken to a court and formally charged. It appears the MACC has colluded with criminals, attacked the whistleblower, imprisoned him as a means of torture and humiliation, rather than investigate one of the numerous immigration frauds going on. This action also implicates the immigration department and home ministry. Its yet to be determined as to whether Nantha will actually be charged and given a fair opportunity for a trial. This would provide the correct platform for Nantha to tell the court the names of government officials he had dealt with. Any charges and corresponding trial would provide an opportunity for the public to see how corrupt government law enforcement agencies are, in this case both the immigration department and MACC. The attack on a hard working journalist, leaving the real perpetrators of corruption still running about and operating today, is a travesty of justice and major breach of human rights that one would only expect to see in a lawless land. Its time to abolish the MACC The MACC has long been controversial. Back in 2009, Teoh Beng Hock fell to his death from the MACC building in Shah Alam, where the truth until today has not been allowed to come out. The Teoh case shows that whistleblowers are not even safe within MACC buildings. There is no provision for an ombudsman to look at cases such as Nantha’s. Should there had been an ombudsman overseeing such arrests, whistleblowers might be better protected. What is sure, no matter, what is the outcome of the Mantha Kumar case, the integrity of the MACC has been given another blow. It is clear the MACC is not doing the job it is meant to be doing, allowing senior government officials to break the law freely. What is even more dangerous, is that these same people are only too willing to abuse their power to cover up. Structurally, the MACC is not an independent body. The MACC must have permission from the attorney general, who is also the public prosecutor to prosecute any suspects. This leaves the possibility of political interference wide open in who to investigate and prosecute. This allows the MACC to humiliate people without actually charging them with any crime. The MACC reports to the executive, so its operations are opaque. The MACC advisory board is full of members who are closely connected with the political elite, and thus harbour potential conflicts of interest. The MACC should be considered a failed organization, full of political agendas. The MACC appears to be spending a lot of time in pursuing foes of the current administration, settling old scores, where impartiality is in question. Its time to abolish the MACC, so as to clean out the embedded corruption within it. The MACC could be replaced with a fully independent anti-corruption body with the power to investigate and prosecute alleged offenders free of the interference of the attorney general and executive. An ombudsman is required to protect the interests of those taken into custody, to ensure the MACC is not over-stepping its powers.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWcZeBxCpHJYJC0zIz6vxNFk	2025-03-08T18:52:43-08:00	
China’s Ambitious Economic Roadmap For 2025: Innovation, Consumpt...	China has laid out an ambitious economic roadmap for 2025, signaling its intent to solidify its position as a global powerhouse through strategic fiscal expansion, technological innovation, and policies aimed at boosting domestic consumption. Premier Li Qiang’s government work report, delivered at the opening of the third session of the 14th National People's Congress (NPC) on March 5, underscores Beijing’s determination to sustain a growth target of around 5%, despite global economic uncertainties. Former United Nations Under-Secretary-General Erik Solheim emphasized China’s role as a stabilizing force in the world economy. 'With an expected economic growth of around 5% for 2025, China will continue to be the biggest source of global economic growth,' he noted in an interview with China Economic Net. This projection underscores Beijing’s confidence in its long-term strategy, even as the global economic order remains in flux. At the heart of this strategy is China’s effort to transition from an export-driven economy to one fueled by domestic consumption and cutting-edge technological advancements. The government work report outlines a proactive fiscal policy, expanding the fiscal deficit target from 3% to 4%, thereby creating additional leverage for investment in key sectors. This shift is designed to enhance economic resilience while ensuring stability amid external pressures. Bernardo Mendia, Board Advisor at the EU Young Entrepreneurs Association, described China’s evolving economic model as a shift from labor-intensive growth to capital- and technology-driven expansion. 'The planned measures to stimulate domestic consumption and the incentives for skill development provide strong endogenous power for long-term growth,' he explained. This transition is further reinforced by China’s move to inject 1.3 trillion yuan in ultra-long special treasury bonds—an increase of 300 billion yuan from last year—while issuing 4.4 trillion yuan in local government special-purpose bonds. China’s commitment to fostering a more open market for investment is another key pillar of its 2025 plan. The government has announced regulatory reforms aimed at expanding access to sectors such as telecoms, medical services, education, and the cultural industries. This move is expected to attract foreign investors by offering greater opportunities for reinvestment and deeper integration into China’s industrial supply chains. David Perez-Des Rosiers, Director of the Canada China Business Council Beijing Chapter, highlighted China’s commitment to an open business environment. 'China’s efforts to expand service sector openness and attract foreign investment offer a positive perspective for Canadian businesses, particularly in services and education, which form a large part of Canada-China bilateral trade,' he noted. A recent business survey revealed that 70% of Canadian companies still consider China a top-five priority for investment, signaling continued confidence in the Chinese market. China’s ambitious 2025 strategy also underscores its focus on innovation, with significant investments in cutting-edge sectors such as biomanufacturing, quantum technology, embodied AI, and 6G. The newly launched 'AI Plus' initiative aims to integrate artificial intelligence into manufacturing, further cementing China’s position as a global leader in technological development. Patrick Nijs, co-founder of the EU-China Joint Innovation Center, stressed the importance of collaboration in technological advancements. 'For a successful ecological transition, we need a structured platform for cooperation between Europe and China to address climate change and enhance industrial innovation,' he stated. His remarks reflect growing European recognition of China’s technological leadership and the necessity of avoiding a technological decoupling between global powers. China’s economic roadmap is also deeply intertwined with its commitment to sustainability. Solheim pointed to 'stability' and 'innovation' as the two defining themes of this year’s Two Sessions, emphasizing China’s leadership in both economic and environmental sustainability. 'Europe will realize that we need Chinese technology,' he remarked, underscoring the growing interdependence between global economies. The government’s plans also include a strong focus on employment and social welfare. In 2025, China aims to create over 12 million new urban jobs while keeping the surveyed urban unemployment rate around 5.5%. With every percentage point of GDP growth generating approximately 2.4 million jobs, this target appears well within reach. Additionally, efforts to promote free preschool education and introduce policies to boost birth rates further demonstrate China’s commitment to long-term demographic stability. In the international sphere, China is reinforcing its high-standard opening-up strategy by stabilizing foreign trade, encouraging foreign investment, and advancing high-quality Belt and Road cooperation. Hong Kong's deputy to the NPC, Ronick Chan Chun-ying, expressed confidence in Beijing’s ability to sustain its growth trajectory. 'China has consistently sustained medium-to-high-speed economic growth, and its ability to maintain a 5% growth rate demonstrates the country’s confidence, which in turn strengthens global investor confidence,' he stated. China’s economic plan for 2025 represents a strategic pivot towards innovation-driven growth, increased domestic consumption, and financial stability. At a time of increasing global uncertainty, Beijing is sending a clear message: its long-term ambitions remain firmly intact, and it intends to achieve them through a calculated blend of fiscal expansion, technological leadership, and global cooperation. As the world watches China’s next moves, one thing remains clear—its trajectory will continue to shape the global economic landscape for years to come.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWcZeBxCpHJYJD8NOjERTJH6	2025-03-08T18:51:04-08:00	
Worrying Echoes Of The Past In The Balkans – Analysis	By Luke Coffey Russia and Ukraine, Israel and Hamas, trade wars between America’s friends and foes — there has been no shortage of crises around the world. At times, it feels like several months’ worth of geopolitical events have taken place in just the past week alone. But another potential conflict that is not getting much attention can be found in southeastern Europe in the Balkan country of Bosnia and Herzegovina. Bosnia and Herzegovina emerged from the aftermath of the breakup of Yugoslavia in the 1990s, followed by a very bloody inter-religious and inter-ethnic sectarian war. The Bosnian Muslim community was targeted mainly by the ethnic Serbian community. In 1995, a historic peace deal was signed in Dayton, Ohio, known now as the Dayton Peace Agreement. This resulted in Bosnia and Herzegovina being formed by two sub-state entities. One was the ethnically Bosnian and Croat Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina, and the other was the ethnically Serb Republika Srpska. The current leader of the latter, Milorad Dodik, has long been an advocate for independence from the rest of Bosnia. He does this with rhetoric but also with actions. In recent years, he has taken steps to undermine the legitimate state structures and institutions of Bosnia and Herzegovina and has started the process of creating parallel state institutions inside Republika Srpska. Dodik has long pursued independence for Republika Srpska and has actively worked to weaken the state institutions of Bosnia and Herzegovina. The situation took a dramatic turn in January this year, when Dodik was sentenced to one year in prison and banned from holding public office for six years after refusing to comply with recommendations from the High Representative for Bosnia and Herzegovina, Christian Schmidt. Even though Dodik was obligated to do so under the terms of the 1995 Dayton Agreement, he refused. If this was not enough to start a political crisis in Bosnia, this week Dodik signed into law legislation from the Republika Srpska parliament that banned Bosnia and Herzegovina’s police force and judiciary from operating inside Republika Srpska. This was viewed by many as an affront not only to Bosnia’s sovereignty but also to the Dayton Agreement, which has been the key factor in keeping the country at peace and together. Along the way, he is encouraged by his neighbor, Serbia, and also, by extension, Russia. The situation in Bosnia is made worse by developments in neighboring Serbia. Serbian President Aleksandar Vucic, who has a close and supportive relationship with Dodik, is experiencing his own political difficulties. Since November 2024, when a roof at a train station collapsed, killing 15 people, he has faced mounting anti-government street protests. These demonstrations have expanded into a broader movement against corruption, culminating in dramatic scenes this week, when opposition MPs set off smoke bombs and flares inside the Serbian parliament. Three lawmakers were injured in the chaos. Vucic is trying to find a way to solve his own domestic political challenges, and encouraging a crisis in Republika Srpska to divert attention might be seen as a solution to his problems. There are numerous examples throughout history where geopolitical circumstances that seem to be regional or even local can have a global impact. The Balkans before the First World War is a great example. There is reason to worry that the region could serve as another flashpoint for a greater conflict, especially as relations between major global powers appear to be strained. As Russia continues to ramp up the pressure over Ukraine and apply more pressure on Europeans, it could well use its influence in Serbia and Republika Srpska to cause a diversion that Europe will have to address. If ever there was a 'European problem,' then what is happening in Bosnia and Herzegovina is certainly one. It is highly unlikely that US President Donald Trump will repeat America’s response to a crisis in the region in the 1990s, when thousands of US troops were deployed as peacekeepers inside Bosnia to stop the killing, or when the US Air Force was used in 1999 to prevent genocide by Serbia against ethnic Albanians in Kosovo. The Trump White House is focused on dealing with Russia, Ukraine, China, and Iran, along with the situation at America’s southern border. There will likely be little bandwidth to address the situation in southeast Europe. This week, Russia called for a closed-door UN Security Council meeting to discuss the political situation in Bosnia. It will be interesting to see how the US sides in this meeting. Will there be a repeat of the US siding with Russia at the recent UN General Assembly vote over Ukraine, or will the US stick to its more traditional position of supporting the Dayton Peace Agreement and the territorial integrity and sovereignty of Bosnia and Herzegovina? Russia may even try to use this issue as a bargaining chip in the bigger issue of peace negotiations over Ukraine. With Europe focused on what it will do about Ukraine in the event that there is a ceasefire, there is likely to be little capacity for any meaningful European response if war breaks out in the Balkans. While events in the Balkans may not be on the minds of Europeans, events in Bosnia and Herzegovina and the region are certainly on the minds of the local leaders. Therefore, it would be incumbent on American and European policymakers not to ignore the region and to stay committed to the hard-fought peace won in the 1990s. Even with everything going on around the world, from Eastern Europe to the Middle East to East Asia, policymakers must keep a close eye on the Balkans. The international community must remain vigilant and committed to preventing the kind of instability that led to war in the 1990s. As history has shown, tensions in the Balkans have the potential to ignite wider conflicts if left unchecked. • Luke Coffey is a senior fellow at the Hudson Institute.

Greenland Elections: Go American, Stay Danish, Or Go It Alone? – ...	By Rikard Jozwiak (RFE/RL) -- Normally the elections for the 31-member Inatsisartut, the parliament of Greenland, would get scant attention. The world's biggest island, with a population of just 60,000, is rarely in the news. That changed in January, when incoming US President Donald Trump expressed an interest in taking control of the strategically located and resource-rich territory. The move sent shockwaves throughout Europe, notably for fellow NATO ally Denmark, to which Greenland in fact belongs. (While Copenhagen oversees foreign and monetary policy, Greenlanders control most domestic issues.) That has meant all eyes will now be on the March 11 elections, called by Greenland's prime minister, Mute Egede, after Trump's pronouncements. And while regular domestic issues are part of the election campaign, the overriding issue is clear: Go American, stay Danish, or aim for independence? To be clear, most Greenlanders don't want to become American, and none of the five parties in parliament is advocating for it. Along with Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen, Egede has made clear that Greenland -- which is an autonomous territory in the Kingdom of Denmark -- is not for sale and that only Greenlanders can decide its future. Interestingly, the parliament recently passed a law banning both anonymous and foreign donations in the election campaign. But what if an offer they can't refuse comes their way? The United States first expressed an interest in the island in the 19th century, and the territory is actually closer to North America than the European continent. Greenland's security is already guaranteed by virtue of an US air base in the north. And the Arctic is certainly not off-limits for the major powers. Both China and Russia are active in the region, not only for the region's lucrative rare earth materials but also due to warmer temperatures melting sea ice and opening up lucrative trade routes. Even if the island doesn't become American anytime soon, there could be some sort of free trade or association deal with Washington in the future. Then again, the Greenlanders can be a conservative bunch. Where others may see lucrative business opportunities, many of them see a homeland that should be preserved. Only two mines currently exist in Greenland, and the last election, in 2021, was dominated by the popular decision to limit oil and gas exploration and ban the mining of uranium. It is here where Denmark comes into the picture. Three of the five political parties want independence from Denmark, including Prime Minister Egede's left-wing Community of the People party, which finished first four years ago and is likely to finish on top again. The same is true for the ruling party's current coalition partner, the social-democrat Forward party, which aims to finish second. The liberal Democrats party, which prefers to remain in a union with Denmark, is also doing well in recent polls and could well complicate any coalition-building and the direction Greenland will eventually take. While most Greenlanders say they want independence, they also want to maintain their living standards. For that the territory is largely dependent on Denmark. Loyal to the Danish crown since 1814, 50 percent of Greenland's exports go to Denmark and 60 percent of its imports are from Denmark. Half of the population works in the public sector, which Copenhagen to a large degree finances via grants. And to boost security across the island, the Danish government last month pledged 2 billion euros ($2.16 billion) to improve its Arctic defenses. There is a commission in Greenland working on what a possible divorce from Denmark would look like, but essentially it would require three steps. Firstly, there would have to be a deal with Copenhagen on what separation would look like; secondly, there would have to be a positive result in a Greenland-wide referendum on independence; and finally, the Danish parliament would need to green-light the whole endeavor. The pro-independence parties want a referendum to take place sometime during the next four-year mandate, but, given the uncertainties surrounding the territory, that certainly doesn't look like it will happen in 2025.

He previously worked as RFE/RL’s Brussels correspondent, covering numerous international summits, European elections, and international court rulings.

Ron Paul: Yes, You Can Protect Liberty And Security At The Same T...	When I served in Congress, I was regularly lectured about how the people needed big government to keep them safe and secure, whether it was through welfare and regulations to ensure their economic security, the Patriot Act to protect their personal security, or forever wars to protect global security. Of course, the government’s track record when it comes to providing economic, personal, and global security proves that Ben Franklin was right, and my fellow representatives were wrong, about the dangers of trading liberty for security. The best example of this is the Transportation Security Administration (TSA). The TSA is very good at treating law-abiding airline passengers as criminal suspects—but not so good at catching real threats to passenger safety. According to the polling company YouGov, 'Homeland Security conducted an investigation in 2015 which found that undercover investigators were able to successfully smuggle mock explosives and banned weapons through TSA checkpoints in 95% of trials.' Responsibility for passenger security should be given to airlines who have an incentive to provide effective security that does not violate their passengers’ privacy and dignity. Private security companies would compete for the airlines’ business. These private companies would prove far more effective at providing safety than a federal bureaucracy like the TSA. This is because the TSA, like all government bureaucracies, is immune from market competition and thus market discipline. This means they have no incentive to improve their operations. In fact, while failures to stop future attacks would cause a private security company to lose business, government services often get their budgets increased when they fail, whilst the federal employees and agency heads are rarely held accountable for their mistakes. The TSA’s monopoly on airline security also prevents the development of innovative ways to ensure safety. While the TSA does not appear to be going anywhere anytime soon, my son, US Senator from Kentucky Rand Paul, recently helped to protect free markets with another national security matter—the National Public Warning System and Emergency Alert System, which are used to provide emergency alerts. He did this by drastically improving a bill known as the AM Radio for Every Vehicle Act. Police groups, attorneys general, and other public safety leaders have stated that AM radio is currently the only communications signal with enough reliability during storms and other emergencies to power the National Public Warning System and Emergency Alert System. Fair enough. I recall during Hurricane Harvey, many of my fellow Texans had no other way of accessing this system as their cellphones and Internet remained out for days. But the problem with the AM Radio for Every Vehicle Act in its 2023–2024 form was that, with no sunset provision, it would have frozen today’s AM-reliant system in place, disincentivizing private companies from ever developing newer, innovative ways to effectively deliver emergency alerts over new technologies in the future. Rand blocked the bill in 2023. As he often does, Rand took a principled stand for liberty. Now, Rand’s efforts have paid off as, to prevent the bill from being blocked again, longtime supporters of the legislation added a sunset provision to the AM radio bill when they recently reintroduced the legislation for consideration this year. The sunset provision offers incentives to entrepreneurs to develop new ways to ensure all Americans have access to emergency alerts. The sunset provision makes it a vast improvement over the prior legislation. It’s evidence that even Congress can be convinced to better respect classical liberal principles from time to time, and that’s great news all around.

Protests And Strikes In Iran: Growing Public Outrage Against Corr...	On March 8, Iran witnessed a new wave of strikes and protests in multiple cities, as workers from various sectors took to the streets to express their anger over deteriorating living conditions, widespread corruption, and the authorities’ failure to respond to their demands. These protests included employees of the Telecommunications Company of Iran, healthcare workers, truck drivers, farmers, and oil sector employees, reflecting the widespread dissatisfaction with the Iranian regime. Strikes in the telecommunications sector Several provinces in Iran, including Khorasan Razavi, experienced widespread strikes by employees of the Telecommunications Company of Iran (TCI). In Mashhad, workers protested against unpaid wages, the flawed implementation of the job classification system, and the continued presence of intermediary companies that exploit their rights without providing adequate guarantees. Protests in the healthcare sector In East Azerbaijan Province, in the city of Tabriz, the surgical staff at Imam Reza Hospital went on strike, refusing to perform surgeries in protest against the authorities’ neglect of their demands. Healthcare workers have long complained about deteriorating working conditions, low wages, and lack of government support. In northern Iran, in the city of Bandar Anzali, nurses and staff at Beheshti Hospital also went on strike, demanding the payment of their overdue salaries and Nowruz bonuses, which the government has yet to pay. This reflects the ongoing neglect of healthcare workers by the regime. Demonstrations and protests in other sectors Protests extended to other parts of the country as well. At the Turkish border, truck drivers gathered to denounce corruption in the industry and mining sector and demanded the release of their trucks, which had been unlawfully seized by authorities. In Isfahan, farmers staged a protest against the government’s failure to fulfill its promises, particularly regarding the provision of water for agriculture and compensation for their losses due to the regime’s failed agricultural policies. In the oil sector, employees who had passed the 2013 employment examination staged a protest in Ahvaz, denouncing the systemic discrimination and marginalization they face from government officials. Implications of protests These strikes and protests highlight the growing public outrage against the Iranian regime’s policies, which continue to ignore citizens’ demands and fail to provide even the most basic living conditions. The persistence and expansion of these protests indicate that Iran’s economic and political crisis is worsening. While the regime remains focused on its regional interventions instead of addressing domestic hardships, the question remains: Will the Iranian regime reverse its oppressive policies, or is the country heading toward greater escalation?	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWcZeBxCpHJYJF9R-LfGYFIe	2025-03-08T18:40:05-08:00	
Starmer Is Ditching Zelensky To Avoid Trump Tariffs And Land A Tr...	Prime Minister Keir Starmer’s visit to Washington majored on an historic invitation for President Trump to make a second state visit to Britain. Despite considerable pre-visit hype among the UK mainstream media, Ukraine was barely mentioned. The cold truth is, Starmer is ditching Zelensky to avoid tariffs. The subtle art of diplomacy is often hard to fathom for the outsider. When Keir Starmer called on Donald Trump in the Oval Office on 27 February, there was an air of conviviality that belied what some considered to have been, hitherto, a difficult relationship. The set piece moment was the Prime Minster handing the President a letter from His Majesty, King Charles II. While it has attracted little comment, The King’s letter to President Trump was a diplomatic masterstroke. A section of the first page was captured by a photographer. These were words crafted by His Majesty himself, with his distinct syntax, rather than written by an anonymous committee of officials in 10 Down Street. The preambular second paragraph appears to contain mere niceties about a possible Trump visit to Scotland, but it was so much more. Donald Trump’s mother was born in Scotland, and the President famously owns golf courses there. The King extends a deeply personal invitation for the President to stay at Balmoral, the favoured Residence in Scotland of Her Late Majesty Queen Elizabeth II, and the place she passed. There is also an offer to visit and stay at Dumfries House, which was His Majesty’s seat in Scotland before ascending to the throne, when his Royal title in Scotland was the Duke of Rothesay. He mentions that underprivileged young people are trained at the House and many end up working at the President’s golfing establishments. Scotland holds a special place in the hearts of both Heads of State. And Diplomacy, ultimately, is about human connection. This was King Charles addressing President Trump as an equal, a peer and a cherished friend. And then the coup de grace, an invitation to an historic second State visit, historic because no US President has been afforded two State visits. President Trump appears to value the form of diplomacy at least as much as its substance. The style and class of King Charles’ letter sits in stark contrast, to the truculent, unshaven President Zelensky arguing in the Oval Office on 28 February. And the theatre behind Keir Starmer’s handing the letter to President Trump was designed to reinforce two perceptions. The first was that The King continues to regard the United States as a dear and trusted friend. The second, and perhaps more significantly, that Prime Minister Starmer was the messenger, not the peer. Some British journalists jokingly referred to Prime Minister Keir Starmer’s meeting in the Oval Office on Thursday 27 February as a visit to the King. Clearly, President Trump isn’t a monarch, nor is he Elvis Presley. But in the game of diplomacy between the United States and the United Kingdom, His Majesty King Charles II and President Trump are peers as Heads of State, and Prime Minister Starmer is a more junior Head of Government. While the first sentence of the letter is not fully visible, His Majesty is clearly thanking President Trump for receiving the British Prime Minister – i.e. His Head of Government – so soon after the inauguration. I don’t believe the optics of this would have been lost on the President. The Labour Prime Minister’s has had a bad start with Donald Trump. The King’s letter brings the adults back into the conversation in a way that can only help the UK repair some of the damage caused. In inviting President Trump to Britain, with all the pomp and ceremony that Britain offers like no other country, the UK government wants to reprioritise its trade and investment relationship with the United States. As Europe and America teeter on the brink of a trade war, Britain wants a genuinely open trading relationship with America that both prevents the risk of US tariffs but also gives the UK economy a much-needed boost post-Brexit. America is Britain’s largest export partner accounting for 15.7% of business and trade in goods is fairly balanced, with a tiny surplus of £2.5bn going Britain’s way in 2023. This may help to explain why Britain appears less in the firing line for US tariffs than the European Union, which President Trump said was designed to ‘screw the US’ flooding America with a surplus of $300bn in goods trade. After President Obama famously said that Britain would have to join the back of the queue in any post-Brexit trade talks with America, UK-US trade talks were not prioritised under the Biden administration. This has now become a top priority for the UK in its relationship with the Trump administration. And Starmer has recognised that he can’t have it all – he can’t criticise Trump on Ukraine, backing Zelensky and steering Europe on a pro-war course, while at the same time landing a lucrative trade deal and avoiding Trump tariffs. He has therefore decided quietly to ditch Zelensky and to line up behind Trump’s plans for a peace deal. After Zelensky’s catastrophic Oval Office meeting on 28 February, 10 Downing Street issued a statement saying the Prime Minister had spoken to both US and Ukrainian Presidents. But while it expressed Britain’s ‘unwavering support for Ukraine’, it did not go so far as to side with President Zelensky over the dispute. Having travelled to Washington seeking to avoid causing offence to the President, the stakes are too high for Starmer now to leap onto the bandwagon of unquestioning Zelensky support. Indeed, Starmer is now positioning himself as the bridge between Europe and the US, and has indicated that, with President Macron, he will develop ideas for peace in Ukraine to put to President Trump. This represents a significant shift in UK position, recognising US leadership in landing a peace deal, rather than corralling the European wagons against a change in policy. His Lancaster House Summit of EU Leaders on 2 March, which Zelensky attended, was a long-overdue sign of the UK providing some thought leadership on Ukraine policy. At the very least, it suggests that the UK recognises the greater benefit of delivering strengthened trading relationship with America, rather than clinging on to a losing war in Ukraine. The Brits finally appear to be getting realistic.

With Hezbollah’s Influence Eroded, Can Lebanon Forge A Brighter F...	By Nadia Alfaour For the first time since its creation in 1982, Lebanon’s Iran-backed Hezbollah militia has seen its political and military clout diminished after a devastating war with Israel gutted its leadership, emptied its coffers, and depleted its once formidable arsenal. Despite the grand funeral of its slain leader, Hassan Nasrallah, attended by thousands of mourners at Beirut’s Camille Chamoun Stadium on Feb. 23 to project an image of resilience and strength, the group’s influence over Lebanon and the wider region is undoubtedly on the wane. 'The Lebanese are certainly ready for a new period in the country where the state has a monopoly over weapons,' Michael Young, a senior editor at the Beirut-based Malcolm H. Kerr Carnegie Middle East Center, told Arab News. 'As for Hezbollah, it is not going to disappear, on the contrary, it is still around. The big question is whether it can transform itself or not.' The fall of the Bashar Assad regime in neighboring Syria — once a critical supply line for weapons from Iran — has compounded Hezbollah’s woes, leaving it isolated, unable to rearm, and increasingly powerless to dictate Lebanese affairs. Hezbollah is reportedly facing a financial crisis, leaving it scrambling to provide monetary support to the families of its injured members and to finance reconstruction work in its southern and eastern strongholds devastated by Israeli bombardment. 'Some Hezbollah supporters have embraced the change while others are still screaming,' a waiter at one of the cafes along Beirut’s Hamra Street who did not wanted to be identified told Arab News. 'If we have to drag them into this new era kicking and screaming, then we will. It has been about them for so many decades. They left the country broken and darkened. It’s time to move on.' Many Lebanese have warmly welcomed the end of Iranian hegemony and the crippling of its biggest proxy in the Middle East. The election of former army chief Joseph Aoun as president and ICJ judge Nawaf Salam as prime minister in January is emblematic of this shift. Backed by the US, France, and Saudi Arabia, Aoun’s election by Lebanese lawmakers is the clearest indication yet that Iran’s influence in Lebanon is spent, opening the way to reforms and international support to help pull the nation out of the mire. Aoun’s recent visit to Saudi Arabia — the first by a Lebanese leader in eight years — has been regarded as a positive step in resetting ties between the two countries. During the visit, Prime Minister and Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman promised to reactivate a $3 billion funding package for the Lebanese army, and a released joint statement declared both sides are looking into ways to allow Saudi citizens to visit Lebanon again. Both countries are also looking into the resumption of Lebanese imports into the Kingdom, which had been halted due to the smuggling of millions of amphetamine and Captagon pills into the Arab Gulf states via Lebanon, often hidden in regular cargo. To be sure, not everyone in Lebanon is pleased with the dramatic political shift taking place. Hezbollah supporters have been left reeling since the loss of their charismatic leader and the forced acceptance of the US-brokered ceasefire with Israel, which has been interpreted as a major blow to the 'Axis of Resistance' of Iran-backed proxies throughout the region. 'The Shiite community in Lebanon had their golden days under Nasrallah, and now it’s a new phase where they’re mourning the golden days,' Hanin Ghaddar, a senior fellow at the Washington Institute, said in an interview with an Israeli TV channel. Ghaddar, who is originally from southern Lebanon, said that Hezbollah called for a mass demonstration in downtown Beirut on March 8, 2005, to 'ascertain that they’re taking over, inheriting the Syrian army and taking over the Lebanese institutions.' The war between Israel and the Lebanese militia began on Oct. 8, 2023, when fighters in south Lebanon began firing rockets into northern Israel in solidarity with the Palestinian militant group Hamas, which a day earlier had attacked southern Israel, triggering the war in Gaza. What began as a tit-for-tat exchange of fire along the Israel-Lebanon border suddenly escalated in September 2024 when Israel intensified its aerial bombardment of Hezbollah positions, attacked its communications networks, and mounted a ground offensive. On Sept. 17-18, thousands of pagers and hundreds of walkie-talkies in the possession of Hezbollah members suddenly exploded in synchronized waves after being sabotaged by Israel. The attack killed 42 and injured 3,500, crippling the militia’s communications. According to one of Nasrallah’s sons, Jawad, his father was left spiritually broken by the pager and walkie-talkie attack and the death of Fuad Shukr, a senior commander and long-time Hezbollah member, in an Israeli strike. In an interview with Lebanese television network Al-Manar, Jawad described his father as 'spiritless and sad' after these blows. 'You could see that he was hurt,' he said. 'There were times I could not bear to hear his voice when he was in that state. You listen to him trying to seek encouragement, but once you hear his voice, it hurts your heart. Later, I learned that he was crying.' On Sept. 27, 2024, Nasrallah was killed in an Israeli airstrike on an underground Hezbollah headquarters in Beirut’s Dahiyeh suburb. The attack, carried out by Israeli F-15I fighter jets, involved more than 80 bombs, destroying the bunker and nearby buildings. The Israel military confirmed Nasrallah’s death on Sept. 28, and his body was recovered the following day. The strike resulted in at least 33 deaths and nearly 200 injuries, including civilians. As the conflict threatened to drag the US and Iran into direct confrontation, with the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps and Israel trading missile strikes, the international community acted to secure a ceasefire in November 2024, which has by and large held. Hezbollah’s battering by Israel has left it politically enfeebled, allowing independent lawmakers and parties not affiliated with the militia to establish a new government after more than two years of political deadlock. 'Up to now there are no signs that the party is going through a reassessment of its previous strategy, although some say within the party such discussions are taking place,' Carnegie Middle East Center’s Young told Arab News. 'Given the hardening of the Iranian position recently, with Supreme Leader of Iran Ayatollah Ali Khamenei saying there can be no negotiations with America, I am not sure that is correct.' Lebanon remains in the midst of a devastating economic crisis, with the local currency having lost more than 90 percent of its value since 2019 and up to 80 percent of the population living in poverty — at least 40 percent of them in extreme poverty. Unemployment rates have skyrocketed and banks continue to impose strict controls on withdrawals and transfers. Meanwhile, the World Bank estimates it will cost $8.5 billion to repair the damage of the Israel-Hezbollah conflict. For the thousands of Lebanese who were forced to flee their homes in the south under Israel’s bombardment, the mere suggestion that Hezbollah was somehow victorious in the conflict, as some hardline supporters like to claim, is utterly delusional. 'If my parents return to their village, when should we expect them to be expelled again?' Ali, a university student who now lives with his parents in a cramped Beirut apartment and did not want to give his full name, told Arab News. 'How many more times? We are caught in the crossfire, doomed to be a football between Hezbollah and Israel. 'We are tired of being kicked around. It is shameful. Then you get a deluded supporter who tells you we’ve won. What did we win?' The international community and Arab donors have so far refused to release any aid funds until UN Security Council Resolution 1701 is fully implemented, which calls for the disarmament and disbanding of all armed groups in the country except for the Lebanese army. After several years of political gridlock and a power vacuum once filled by Hezbollah and the Amal bloc led by Nabih Berri, Lebanon is now in a unique position to stabilize and integrate itself once again into the Arab fold. President Aoun’s remarks during the Arab League summit in Cairo on March 4 reflect his apparent determination to set Lebanon on this new course, with some describing his speech as 'resistance through diplomacy.' The Washington Institute’s Ghaddar believes that while the current phase may not be 'the end of Hezbollah for the (Lebanese Shiite) community,' the lack of money, jobs, services, and reconstruction has led people to seek alternatives. 'It’s very clear that Hezbollah is no longer an option for them,' she said in the interview with the Israeli TV channel. Today, 'Hezbollah is a new entity, which cannot provide, cannot protect, obviously cannot preserve, and cannot rebuild.'	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWcZeBxCpHJYJGeAz6S70lLV	2025-03-08T18:32:56-08:00	
The Thai Way To End Human-Elephant Conflict – Analysis	Sri Lanka could adopt Thailand's Bajrasudha Gajamurak model, which effectively balances the needs of both elephants and humans through a unique blend of traditional and modern techniques. The human-elephant conflict in Sri Lanka continues unabated. Although efforts by successive governments since the 1970s have reduced the rate of attrition, the issue remains a pressing concern. Various mitigation methods have been attempted with mixed success. Given this, it may be worthwhile for the Sri Lankan government to consider adopting Thailand's Bajrasudha Gajamurak model, which successfully integrates traditional and modern strategies to harmonize human-elephant coexistence. The Significance of the Asian Elephant The Asian elephant inhabits diverse ecosystems, ranging from dry to wet forests and grasslands across 13 countries in South and Southeast Asia. While their preferred diet consists of forage plants, they have adapted to consuming a wide variety of resources depending on habitat availability. Historically, human societies in these regions have had a close association with elephants. In the past, elephants were revered rather than seen as adversaries. Even today, they hold a sacred place in religions such as Hinduism and Buddhism, despite being viewed as a menace by modern villagers due to their frequent raids for food. Elephants in Hinduism and Buddhism According to Hindu mythology, the gods (Devas) and demons (Asuras or Yakshas) churned the ocean in search of the elixir of life, during which nine sacred jewels emerged—one of them being the elephant. This divine origin made the elephant a symbol of good fortune in Hinduism. The elephant-headed deity Ganesha is venerated as the remover of obstacles. In South India, before entering temples dedicated to Lord Shiva, devotees first pay homage to Ganesha. Similarly, in North Central Sri Lanka, villagers install Ganesha statues to ward off wild elephants. In both South India and Sri Lanka, elaborately decorated elephants are central to religious processions. Records of the use of elephants in Sri Lankan Buddhist rituals date back to the 3rd century BCE. Historical sources even mention the donation of elephants to temples, with the earliest recorded instance occurring in the 1st century CE. Prior to the advent of cavalry warfare, elephants were a vital asset in battles, and Sri Lanka engaged in a thriving trade of elephants with India. Despite this historical reverence, human-elephant relations have deteriorated over time. The exponential growth of the human population and encroachment on elephant habitats have intensified conflicts. However, poaching in Sri Lanka remains relatively low since only 5% of its elephants are tuskers. Rising Conflict and Slaughter Sri Lanka's Minister of Environment, Dammika Patabendi, recently reported alarming statistics in Parliament. Between 2015 and 2019, 1,466 wild elephants were killed. This number increased to 2,011 between 2020 and 2024. Human casualties also rose sharply. Between 2015 and 2019, 456 people were killed due to elephant encounters. The figure surged to 734 between 2020 and 2024. In total, Sri Lanka lost 3,477 wild elephants and 1,190 human lives from 2015 to 2024. To combat this crisis, the Sri Lankan government has implemented several measures, including: Constructing electric fences Reopening blocked elephant corridors Increasing food availability in elephant habitats Establishing wildlife reserves Deploying security task forces to deter elephant incursions into human settlements Developing regulated tourism However, these efforts require stronger enforcement, greater investment, and more strategic planning. Thailand's Effective Approach to Human-Elephant Conflict Thailand, often called the 'Land of the White Elephant,' has a long-standing cultural reverence for elephants. However, the country has faced a severe human-elephant conflict due to habitat destruction and rapid urban expansion. The issue escalated to hundreds of deaths annually among both humans and elephants. Recognizing the urgency, Thailand launched the Bajrasudha Gajamurak Project in 2019, initiated by the Thai royal family. This project, implemented in five eastern provinces—Chachoengsao, Chonburi, Rayong, Chanthaburi, and Sa Kaeo—focuses on creating a sustainable balance where both humans and elephants can coexist. Three-Zone Strategy The project strategically divides areas bordering forests into three distinct zones: Forest Conservation Zone – A designated area where elephants can thrive naturally with sufficient food and water. Buffer Zone – A transition area with food sources and artificial water bodies that prevent elephants from venturing into human settlements. Community Zone – Exclusively for human habitation, with strategies to deter elephant encroachment and promote coexistence. Forest Conservation Zone To encourage elephants to remain within their natural habitat, the project: Established 60 water sources with a combined capacity of 1.8 million cubic meters. Undertook reforestation efforts to restore natural food sources. Planted bamboo, mango, and banana trees, ensuring a sustainable food supply for elephants. Buffer Zone Buffer zones act as temporary dwellings for elephants before they are guided back to conservation areas. Key measures include: Constructing grassy meadows and check dams to ensure consistent water availability. Introducing strongly scented plants, such as climbing wattle and cassia, which elephants avoid. Establishing community forests with medicinal plants to benefit both villagers and wildlife. Use of Artificial Intelligence A Comprehensive Elephant Surveillance System equipped with AI-powered automated cameras was implemented. These cameras, installed in buffer zones, detect elephant movements and send real-time alerts via the LINE chat app to villagers and trained volunteer teams, who then guide the elephants back to their habitats. Community Zones In the community zones, local populations received: Awareness training on elephant behavior and conflict mitigation. Skill development programs to diversify livelihoods. Financial support for alternative income sources, such as medicinal herb cultivation, basket weaving, and food processing. As a result, communities transitioned from single-crop farming to multiple cropping systems, reducing dependence on land encroachment. The project fostered solidarity among villagers, strengthening communal efforts toward sustainable coexistence. Conclusion: A Model for Sri Lanka? The Bajrasudha Gajamurak model provides an effective, structured, and sustainable solution to human-elephant conflict. Sri Lanka, facing a worsening crisis, could benefit immensely from trialing a similar approach, particularly in conflict-prone areas. Implementing Thailand's zoning strategy, AI-based surveillance, and community-driven conservation could pave the way for a more harmonious coexistence between humans and elephants.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWcZeBxCpHJYJJs92If7RKzr	2025-03-08T18:29:17-08:00	
The Return Of Geopolitics Vs. ‘America First’: Europe’s Strategic...	1. Introduction The slogan 'America First' used by the Trump administration and continued in various forms by American policy, has brought about a strong return to traditional geopolitics. This change has had and is expected to have a series of consequences for Europe. These consequences will be reflected first and foremost in the weakening of multilateralism and, above all, of NATO. This strategy, gradually but with accelerated steps, has already given signs that it is in full compliance with the project for a New World Order that is based on an equally new trajectory, which has nothing to do with the conventional trajectory of American foreign policy. His administration’s approach towards Russia, demonstrated on the third anniversary of the start of the all-out Russian war for the complete annexation of Ukraine, in the UN General Assembly [1] in relation to the resolution sponsored by Ukraine’s allies, which demanded the withdrawal of Russian troops from sovereign Ukrainian territory, marks the first step towards the New World Order. The US vote in this case, aligned with Russia, was the clearest sign of the historical turning point in geopolitical realignment. All this is done by counting Russia's withdrawal from the alliance with the rising China. In this process of voting on the resolution, 93 votes were in favor, while 18 were against - among those who voted against were the US!!! With this act, the Transatlantic Alliance was severely hit... but the New World Order also took its first step. This new American course raises legitimate critical questions regarding its consequences, especially for the transatlantic alliance and global stability. The Western Hemisphere thus suffers the greatest rift in its history. What Milosevic had not achieved, despite having resisted NATO bombing for 78 days [1999], after three years of war in Ukraine, Putin achieved. 2. Strategic approach to separating Russia from China – wrong investment The US strategy to separate Russia and China has some parallels with the EU’s strategy to separate Serbia from Russian influence, despite the fact that they seem at first glance to have fundamental differences. In both cases, we are dealing with attempts to separate alliances that were and are perceived to be dangerous to Western interests. However, there are factors that make each case unique. The US strategic approach to China and Russia, like the EU’s approach to Serbia, aims to offer economic, political and diplomatic alternatives to mitigate dependence on Moscow. In this regard, both the US and the EU use economic and diplomatic means to achieve their goals, whether through investments, trade agreements, or integration into international organizations. In both cases, Russia is a key factor that does not easily accept the loss of its allies and reacts with political, economic and military pressure. In this parallel, however, there are also profound differences. Russia and China, despite their strong partnership, have historical differences and interests that do not always coincide. Serbia, on the other hand, has a deeper emotional and historical connection to Russia, which makes it more difficult for it to break away from Moscow. The EU has promised Serbia membership, but the process has been slow and often disappointing. Meanwhile, the US has difficulty detaching China from Russia because Moscow and Beijing see the West as a common threat. Russia and China are both major superpowers and can more easily resist American pressure. In the case of Russia, this resistance was clearly reflected in the three-year war in Ukraine and the insistence on not giving up on the strategic objective of creating the Russian World. Meanwhile, Serbia, although with strong ties to Russia, is more dependent on the EU economically and politically. Therefore, this investment, in both cases, seems to be wrong. In the case of the US, the attempt to separate Russia from China is very difficult and unlikely to succeed in the short term. Both countries have a strategic interest in confronting the West together. Meanwhile, in the case of the EU and Serbia, the EU's attempt to attract Serbia seemed more realistic at first glance, but the stagnation of the accession process and Brussels' hesitation, not only in relation to Serbia, but to all the countries in the region aspiring to EU accession, have made success uncertain. In both cases, the strategy turns out to be wrong. Trump’s approach to Russia is reminiscent of President Richard Nixon’s 1972 China Overture, in which Washington exploited the Sino-Soviet divide to contain Moscow. This time, however, the roles are reversed, as the United States seeks to engage Russia in an effort to weaken China’s strategic position. The administration envisions diplomatic engagement, the lifting of selected sanctions, and a possible easing of tensions over Ukraine as mechanisms to bring Russia back to a more balanced relationship with the West. [2] The premise of this strategy is based on purely transactional incentives, which cannot fail to work. Soviet Russia’s partnership with communist China at the time had a common ideological bedrock. This Russia-China partnership has for years, with emphasis since the end of the Cold War onward, been built on a shared opposition to Western dominance. 'Both countries benefit from economic cooperation, joint military exercises, and diplomatic coordination in multilateral institutions such as BRICS and the Shanghai Cooperation Organization.'[3] The BRICS alliance is de facto led by President Putin, who is considered the initiator and architect of the multipolar world. The New World Order has precisely this objective at its core – the creation of a multipolar world. BRICS lacks the military power of the United States, but it does not lack economic power, which over time could be a good guarantee for the development of its military wing. In this regard, the likelihood of Russia abandoning BRICS, and especially its partnership with China, seems highly unrealistic. President Donald Trump’s recent statements about the withdrawal of US troops from Europe and changes in the world order have sparked numerous discussions about the possible consequences for international security and transatlantic relations. According to diplomatic sources, President Trump has proposed a reduction of about 20,000 US troops in Europe, which represents about 20% of the current US military presence on the continent. The move aims to review the US commitment to the defense of Europe and requires European countries to contribute more financially to cover the costs of the remaining troops, arguing that these forces serve as a deterrent and that the costs cannot be borne solely by US taxpayers. However, some European leaders have expressed their belief that the US has no concrete plans for a complete withdrawal of military troops. Polish President Andrzej Duda, after a meeting with the US special envoy for Ukraine and Russia, Keith Kellogg, declared that 'there is absolutely no American intention to reduce activity in our part of Europe, especially in terms of security, or to reduce the number of US troops'.[4] This was the response given to the alarm raised by the German daily in its article with the headline: 'In case of an agreement between Trump and Putin: Europe in fear! Intelligence agencies fear the withdrawal of US troops'.[5] Similar statements were also made by NATO command and US officials in relation to the Balkans. Recently, reports have emerged suggesting the possibility of withdrawing US troops from the Balkans, especially from Kosovo. These reports in the media owned by the oligarchs in Kosovo have been published at lightning speed. These concerns were raised after negotiations between the United States and Russia in Saudi Arabia, where it was speculated that Russia may request the withdrawal of US troops from NATO countries that joined the alliance after 1990. However, senior US and NATO officials have denied these claims. An official from the US Mission to NATO stated that there has been no discussion about reducing or withdrawing US troops from Kosovo. A NATO official also stressed that the US commitment to the Alliance and the presence of US troops in Europe remain strong, and that KFOR continues to implement its mandate to contribute to the establishment of a secure environment in Kosovo. Currently, the US has over 600 troops stationed in Kosovo as part of the KFOR mission, playing a key role in maintaining stability in the region. Italy also contributes over 1,200 troops to this mission. Security experts warn that a possible withdrawal of US troops could have serious consequences for the stability of the region, increasing insecurity and encouraging Serbia to take military action in favor of its already promoted expansionist policies related to the objective of creating a Serbian World. Overall, despite speculation, official statements from the US and NATO confirm the continuation of the US military presence in the Balkans, especially in Kosovo, to ensure peace and stability in the region. 3. The New World Order and Trump's Strategy Authors and strategists gathered around 'MAGA' have long promoted the pro-Russian course by bringing Donald Trump and Musk back to the White House. Only the first month of Trump's return and the installation of Elon Musk in the White House has shown that this pro-Russian course is unstoppable. This process of transition to the Russian sphere, of course claiming Russia's separation from China and the dissolution of the BRICS, will be accompanied by the installation of autocracyin the USand its separation from Europe. This process is being claimed to be a fait accompli even before the mid-term elections. The US thus claims that it will also change the course of the transfer of the global balance of power under China's control. BRICS, led by Russia, China and India, is challenging dedollarization and with it the loss of the US's weight in the Western economic and political order. To avoid this course of events, the victimization of Ukraine is just irredeemable collateral damage in the logic of MAGA strategists. For this reason, they believe that the future of America lies in the creation of a united and integrated entity – a superstate that would dominate in all spheres: from the economy and technology to military and geopolitical power, as one of its authors believes. It is no coincidence that some of Trump’s vision points in this context have already been publicly affirmed, such as his talk about integrating Canada, Greenland and the Panama Canal into the United States. These territories are not only geographically important - they are, according to the new MAGA strategists, crucial for the strategic and economic power of America’s future and its role in the New World Order. 'America First' alias MAGA has set forth its concrete objective, which is to completely change the paradigm that Trump had communicated to voters. The Trump administration under the influence of Elon Musk is now acting in accordance with the doctrine that would guarantee the preservation of the status of the hegemonic superpower, even strengthening it. Meanwhile, Europe, alias EU leaders have already realized that the liberal democracy established in European society, is in immediate need of an autonomous strategy that guarantees the state independence of each member and the community as a whole. The prosperity of the hegemonic doctrine of MAGA is based on the development of new technologies such as Artificial Intelligence, Blockchain, renewable energies, etc.; they require rare minerals. Today in Washington, in the name of MAGA [Make America Great Again], work is being done to change the international institutions that bear the seal of the USA. All this in the name of creating the New World Order. At the foundation of the current Order, let us remember the fact that, it is precisely the institutions created by the US itself – International Law, the UN, NATO, etc. President Trump’s policies, which are de facto the product of the experts who drafted the Make America Great Again platform, have brought about significant changes in the world order. His 'America First' approach has challenged traditional international institutions and alliances, including NATO and the European Union. This approach has raised questions about the US commitment to its allies and has prompted discussions about a new world order, where European countries may be forced to take more responsibility for their own security. In an interview with Euronews Albania, analyst Mentor Beqa emphasized that Trump’s decisions could have major consequences for the world order, including the weakening of traditional alliances and the increasing influence of other powers such as China and Russia. However, President Trump’s statements and actions regarding the withdrawal of US forces from Europe and changes in the world order have sparked debate on the future of global security and international relations. While a quarter of European leaders remain confident in the continuation of American commitment, others warn about the possible consequences of such a withdrawal. It has been a full month since a leader like Donald Trump was installed in Washington, who is challenging the liberal international order, putting narrow national interests ahead of traditional alliances (America First). If the US distances itself from Europe and withdraws from the Alliance, which is unlikely to happen, Albania risks being left without geopolitical protection. NATO may no longer be the umbrella that protects us from the storms, while EU enlargement may continue to remain an open and never-ending story, similar to the fate of the young officer in Dino Buxati’s The Tatar Desert, writes Tirana-based publicist Lutfi Dervishi. But if developments in the new world order include a closer alliance between Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin, this could have significant consequences for the Balkans. Given that the Balkans have been a sensitive area for the geopolitical influences of great powers, this development could create tensions and strategic shifts. 4. Changing the geopolitical balance We are currently living in an era of the return of empires. Great powers and regional powers are seeking to reclaim or redefine their spheres of influence, as was the case in the eras of classical empires. The return of great rivalries, clashes for resources, territories, and cultural and economic influence, has become more evident, especially after the major geopolitical changes of recent decades. The return of empires in a modern form does not necessarily mean the construction of classical empires with conquered and directly administered territories, but rather an expansion of economic, political, military, and cultural influence. Some superpowers and regional powers show clear tendencies towards a new imperial model. Superpowers with modern imperialist tendencies such as the United States, China, and Russia have already taken the first steps that the change in the geopolitical balance imposes. The United States of America (USA) continues to maintain a vast network of military bases around the world. It controls global financial institutions (such as the IMF and the World Bank). Meanwhile, the use of 'soft power' and 'dollar diplomacy' has enabled it to prevent the BRICS from promoting its currency. While their cultural and technological dominance through corporations such as Google, Apple, Microsoft and Hollywood is evident. China, on the other hand, has projected its rise as a power through the 'Silk Road' initiative (BRI), economically and politically connecting the world to itself. In addition, it has created the first military bases abroad (e.g., in Djibouti). Meanwhile, it uses economic capital and investments to increase its influence (in Africa, Latin America, Europe). But China also has clear ambitions for technological dominance (AI, 5G, etc.). Russia is using military power to restore influence in the post-Soviet space (Ukraine, Georgia, Belarus, Central Asia). It is deepening the diplomatic course to maintain alliances with autocratic regimes to oppose the West [case in Serbia, Hungary, Republika Srpska of Bosnia…] For years it has created a monopoly in the energy field and relies on its export as a political instrument and blackmail. Meanwhile, it continues to intensify the use of mercenaries and disinformation to influence other countries, not only in the Balkans. Regional powers with imperialist tendencies have not been left behind in this race. Turkey is reviving the Ottoman legacy through cultural and religious diplomacy in the Balkans, the Middle East and North Africa. It has intervened militarily in Syria, Libya, Azerbaijan and has become a key player in the Eastern Mediterranean. Its military industry is growing significantly, making it more strategically independent.Iran has built an 'empire' through militias and armed groups in Iraq, Syria, Lebanon, Yemen (through the Houthis). It uses a combination of religion and ideology to expand its influence in the Shiite world. It has ambitions to become a nuclear power, challenging the West and its Arab rivals. India is increasing its influence in the Indian Ocean and is trying to rival China in Southeast Asia and Africa. It has a large military force and a rapidly growing economy. It is trying to create a sphere of influence through cultural and technological ties. In the modern era, there is no need for military conquests to build an 'empire'. Instead, economics, technology, cultural influence and clever diplomacy are used to create a large sphere of control. The US and China are the two superpowers with the most potential to build their own 'empires', while Russia, Turkey, Iran and India are trying to create their own spheres of influence. Europe is now being forced to prepare to defend Ukraine even without America. It is convinced that this is the only way it can do its best at these historic junctures. If they cannot do this together, as the EU and as Europe, then an alliance of states ready to stop Putin's march will do it. The emergency meeting in Paris proved precisely this expected and necessary strategy of action. This neighborhood of European states has clearly understood that Ukraine must be defended, even without Donald Trump's America. After the scandal during the visit of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to the White House, Europe wants to take the initiative. The urgently called summit on Ukraine, which was held in London on March 2, 2025, at which Zelensky was welcomed, Starmer described it as a 'unique moment for European security'. The summit, hosted by the British prime minister, was attended by a dozen European heads of state and government. It came against the backdrop of a public spat between Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and Donald Trump and his vice president J.D. Vance at the White House on Friday. [6] British Prime Minister Keir Starmer announced after a special summit in London what steps Ukraine’s allies had agreed to maintain support for the Russian-occupied country. Starmer said Britain, France and others had agreed to work with Ukraine 'on a plan to end the fighting.' [7] That ceasefire plan would then be discussed with the Trump administration in the United States 'and taken forward together.' Starmer stressed the importance of continued US support. What are the US president’s options after this meeting? The first is about waiting for Zelensky to bow to him, apologize, and agree to sign a deal on Ukraine’s mineral resources without the additional US security guarantees that Kiev and key European countries – the UK, France, and the EU – insist on. Trump, on the other hand, believes that this deal is a sufficient guarantee that the Russians will not be able to launch any new military campaigns against Ukraine in the future, i.e. most of it will remain under Kiev’s control. The second option is for Trump to abandon Ukraine altogether and leave it to the fate of European aid in its ongoing war with Russia, if they so wish. This option is a nightmare for Europe (and certainly for Ukraine, which knows very well who its main strategic partner is and why it managed to preserve its statehood in the first place). Because the European political elites would gladly wage war with Russia with Ukrainian soldiers 'until final victory,' but without sending their own soldiers, as was the case for three years under Joe Biden. They would send them only if the US provided them with security guarantees and only after signing a peace agreement.[8] 4.1 The Curse of Geopolitics: Does the EU Want the Ukraine Negotiations to Fail? Big Issues Are Changing Alliances. Meanwhile, EU Foreign Policy Chief Kaja Kallas is boldly asserting that the 'free world' needs a new leader and that Europe is the right leader. This statement is widely seen in geopolitical decision-making circles as a Brussels bubble and is not taken seriously. But the negotiations that de facto have not yet taken place are another matter. The bloodshed of a section of European diplomacy over the failure of Trump’s diplomacy in Ukraine is another matter. It seems that Americans and Europeans have returned to the Cold War era, but with opposite roles than they had before. The Trump administration has questioned the US commitment to NATO, demanding that European countries increase their military spending. Even after the changes in the Biden administration, the pressure on Europe to take on more defense responsibilities continues. This has prompted some countries, such as Germany and France, to push for a common European defense, although with no concrete results yet. Meanwhile, as the war in Ukraine continued, Europe was forced to increase its military capabilities and find long-term security solutions without relying solely on the United States. Now it is the Europeans who are advocating tough stances towards Moscow, while Washington is seeking understanding.[9] The different views within the Alliance today have to do exclusively with realpolitik, they are the result of a different geopolitical situation. During the Cold War, Europeans feared that their continent would become a battlefield for a limited nuclear war. For a long time, conflict management through detente seemed to be the best solution for Europe.[10] The new US administration is pursuing its own version of the Heart of the Earth Theory. From this perspective, China and Russia are the heart of Eurasia that will continue to decide the fate of the world in the 21st century. But the real fact that has changed on the ground is China. It is now the dominant power, while Russia is its vassal within the BRICS and vis-à-visthe USA. Moscow, in this context of the curse of geopolitics, especially in relation to Ukraine, has the possibility of becoming a pawn of its own kind in the game of chess. 4.2 Triarchy Plus In 1841, the Jewish-German philosopher Moses Hess published the book 'The European Triarchy'. Hess's basic thesis was that the fate of Europe was determined by three states: Great Britain, France and Germany. Moses Hess, in his theory of the triarchy, focused his analysis on the three main European powers of the 19th century: Great Britain, Germany and France. He argued that these three powers represented three different aspects of political and social development: 1. France as a symbol of revolution and social equality. 2. Germany as a representative of philosophy and intellectual development. 3. Great Britain as a symbol of capitalism and industrialization. Meanwhile, Poland was added to the theory of the triarchy, with emphasis during the course of the war in Ukraine, thus creating a more stable quadrilateral for the new geopolitical circumstances. The war in Ukraine has revealed its role in a modern context, naturally contributing to the shaping of the thesis on the Triarchy Plus. Poland can be considered in many ways as a typical representative of nationalism and self-determination as well as a center of security and geopolitical balance in Central Europe, being at the same time also as a mediator between East and West. So, a Triarchy Plus could function in this way: • Great Britain –representative of the Anglo-Saxon tradition and free-market capitalism. • France – as a leader of European integration and the republican spirit. • Germany – as an economic locomotive and a model of social-democratic stability. • Poland – as the center of a new Europe, which is defining its own strategic role in the East. The role of Poland in the strategic plane in the East could easily be played by Albania and Kosovo in Southeast Europe. 4.3 An imposed peace on Ukraine does not guarantee long-term security in Europe 'America First' has inspired populist and nationalist movements in Europe, fueling more skepticism towards the EU and international institutions. Political forces that follow this approach have gained ground in countries such as Italy, France, Hungary and Poland. Meanwhile, the American intervention [by the Trump administration] in favor of the AfD on the eve of the elections in Germany has raised concerns throughout the liberal and progressive camp. The new German government is meanwhile expected to position itself clearly in support of the course already proclaimed by its European partners such as France, Great Britain, Poland and other states; they are facing a battle to save not only Ukraine. An imposed peace on Ukraine does not guarantee long-term security in Europe. All that the proclaimed agreement can be expected to provide is a ceasefire for an indefinite period. Russia’s expansionist policies continue. Especially in relation to countries that have Russian minorities within their territory. See for this, Putin's Russia must be stopped. The creation of a resistance front is in the interest of European security; it guarantees freedom and life itself. Europe at these historical moments is facing a major geopolitical dilemma. It must strengthen its strategic autonomy in order not to depend on the US for security and economy. In any case, the return of geopolitics is forcing Europe to take more responsibility for its fate. 4.4 The Balkans Faced with a Geopolitical Dilemma In these circumstances, the Balkans are once again faced with the geopolitical dilemma of the pre-Cold War era. Each alternative could have significant strategic, economic or military consequences. This confrontation is related to the challenges and limitations that come from the international environment, the balance of power and national interests. But in this context, if for Albania and the Albanians, as well as for most of the countries in the region, there is no geopolitical dilemma, Serbia, Bulgaria and Hungary are faced with a more serious geopolitical dilemma. Their decisions in this geopolitical confrontation could have profound consequences for the European security architecture, but also for the international order and the balance of power. Serbia is once again faced with the pressure to choose between different alliances - between the EU and Russia. Some Balkan countries, especially those with real aspirations to join the EU, should, in these circumstances, seek greater support and engagement from the European Union to safeguard regional stability. This development could lead to an increase in military tensions in the Balkans, with the possibility of scenarios of direct or indirect involvement of major powers in local conflicts. There could be increased opportunities for destabilization, as is the case with efforts to maintain control over territories that Serbia marks as 'disputed' whether in Bosnia [Republika Srpska] or Kosovo [its north]. In these circumstances, the Balkans could easily become an arena for competition between major powers, such as Russia and China on the one hand, and Turkey and the West on the other. If the Trump-Putin alliance strengthens, Russian and Chinese influence in the region could increase, improving investment, helping the economic development of some Balkan states, and increasing the influence of these states in global politics. Overall, the consequences for the Balkans will depend on how the region reacts to these changes and how international powers coordinate to maintain stability and security in this part of the world. 4.5 The EU and its future In this changing geopolitical balance, the EU continues to be one of the most powerful organizations in the world. At the same time, it is also demonstrating the real possibilities for its transformation into a Military Alliance. However, current challenges show that its future will depend on the ability to maintain unity; on a clear position in favor of Ukrainian sovereignty and finding ways to create the preconditions for a long-term ceasefire or the imposition of peace between Ukraine and Russia; and on its ability to address economic and political crises and adapt its strategies to an increasingly complex world. A closer alliance between Trump and Putin could fuel tensions between Balkan countries that are aligned with the West and those that have closer ties to Russia. Countries like Serbia, which has maintained a stable policy, if not outright vassalage, towards Russia, can feel supported, while the two Albanian republics – Albania and Kosovo, which are engaged side by side with NATO and the European Union, can and should increase the pressure to protect their territorial integrity and independence from Russian influences. In fact, the two Albanian republics in this situation urgently need to move towards the unification of the Strategy, namely the creation of a single defense command. 5. Conclusion: the position of the Albanians The essence of parliamentary democracy and its applied form in established Western liberal democracies is currently under pressure, both from within and from without. Seen in the light of developments on the global level, first of all after the return of Donald Trump to the White House, Transatlantic relations are entering a new historical phase that is expected to face profound tectonic upheaval. The EU is currently facing a threat coming from three directions simultaneously: first, from Russia and its expansionist project; second, from Donald Trump’s America; [11] third, from neo-fascism that is returning in the form of aggressive nationalism within the largest European states themselves. In addition to this upheaval that the age of the New World Order is imposing, the EU and the future of democracy are facing unusual competition with authoritarian-technocratic and authoritarian-autocratic systems. Meanwhile, in the environments of the Nation-State and the EU institutions, democracy is facing the storms brought by the return of neo-fascism in the form of political populism and especially the significant and growing loss of the importance of explicit political engagement by the Western intellectual elite and in particular the social democratic parties which have lost the role they had as functional equivalents since the end of the Second World War. However, the existence of the Nation-State and democracy itself is completely dependent on the presence of the latter in the active life of citizens and the commitment to preserving and establishing the nation-state and democracy simultaneously. The Nation-State turns out to be the bed where democracy can continue to thrive, but with the precondition imposed by the new realignment, namely the New World Order in the making and postmodern geopolitics. In this context, the future of democracy and the nation-state takes on a new meaning, but it is clear that at this historical stage both democracy and the nation-state are expected to undergo profound changes. In this terrain of geopolitical developments, reviewing the future position of our two republics - political Albania and the Republic of Kosovo, but also the Nation as a whole, is crucial. A decisive step in the field of security and defense, see for this, must be taken urgently. This act must be accompanied by the legal-political one, that is, by organizing a referendum on the unification of our two republics. This step will be crucial at the beginning of the process of creating the Albanian Federation and positioning the Nation within the concept of an autonomous European strategy, as an adequate response to the new geopolitical changes that are taking place. 1.

Trust Erodes In India’s Electoral System – OpEd	On March 4, 2025, as I sit to unpack the unfolding saga of duplicate Electors Photo Identity Card (EPIC) numbers in India, the air feels thick with suspicion, political maneuvering, and a palpable sense of betrayal among voters. The allegations, spearheaded by the Trinamool Congress (TMC) in West Bengal, have cracked open a Pandora’s box, revealing a glitch in the electoral system that the Election Commission of India (ECI) now scrambles to address. The claim is stark: voters in Haryana and West Bengal share identical EPIC numbers, voter IDs meant to be unique, raising questions about the sanctity of the democratic process. The ECI’s admission in a press note dated March 2, 2025, that this mess stems from a decentralized, manual system predating the ERONET platform, only deepens the intrigue. How did this happen? Why was it overlooked? And what does it mean for India’s elections, past and future? Let us start with the basics. The EPIC number, a 10-digit alphanumeric code, is the backbone of voter identification in India. Introduced under the Registration of Electors Rules, 1960, and later bolstered by the digital ERONET system, it is designed to ensure every voter has a distinct identity, safeguarding against impersonation and fraud. The ECI has long touted its uniqueness, back in June 2019, it tweeted confidently that 'Every EPIC or Elector’s Photo Identity Card has a unique EPIC Number which can be used to check one’s name in the Electoral Roll.' That assurance now rings hollow as evidence mounts of overlapping numbers across state lines. The TMC’s allegations are not just a regional grumble; they have ignited a national debate, with opposition parties smelling blood and citizens questioning the very foundation of their electoral trust. The ECI’s explanation, detailed in its March 2 press note, offers some clarity but little comfort. Before ERONET, a web-based platform for managing electoral rolls, came into play, voter registration relied on a fragmented, manual process. Different state Chief Electoral Officer (CEO) offices, operating in silos, sometimes used the same alphanumeric series for EPIC numbers. The result? Voters in Haryana and West Bengal, for instance, might share an identical EPIC number, a flaw the ECI insists does not translate to fake voters or fraud. Why? Because these voters are registered in different constituencies, with distinct demographic details and polling booths, making it improbable for one to impersonate another across state borders. It is a technical defense, rooted in logistics rather than intent, but it is done little to quell the storm. Digging deeper, the ECI’s press note and subsequent clarifications, reported by outlets like The Hindu and The Times of India, promise a fix. ERONET 2.0, the next iteration of the platform, is being rolled out to ensure every EPIC number is unique. It is a forward-looking commitment, but it does not erase the past. If duplicates existed for years, how many elections were affected? The ECI insists there is no evidence of fraud, each voter’s identity remains tied to their specific constituency, but the opposition is not buying it. TMC leaders, including West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee, have cried 'voter fraud,' alleging 'fake' and 'outsider' voters propped up the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in past polls. The Congress has joined the chorus, slamming the ECI’s oversight as 'bizarre,' while calls for Supreme Court intervention and election boycotts gain traction. This brings us to a proposed solution that is both tantalizing and divisive: linking EPIC numbers with Aadhaar, India’s 12-digit biometric identification number. Proponents argue it is the silver bullet, tie every voter to a unique Aadhaar ID, and duplicates vanish overnight. The ECI already offers a voluntary linking program, with step-by-step guides circulating online. Fill out Form 6B, submit your Aadhaar details, and you are synced. Simple, right? Not quite. Privacy advocates balk at the idea, warning of data breaches and surveillance creep. Yet, as critics point out, Aadhaar is already demanded for everything from bank accounts to mobile SIMs, why the uproar when it comes to voting? The ECI, for its part, keeps it optional, assuring no voter will be excluded for not linking. That stance, while diplomatic, leaves the core issue unresolved: voluntary measures will not catch every duplicate. The political stakes could not be higher. In West Bengal, where TMC faces a resurgent BJP, the duplicate EPIC scandal is a rallying cry. Banerjee’s claims of electoral manipulation, outsiders ferried in to vote with bogus IDs, echo a narrative of systemic sabotage. The Quint reports her pointing to this as a prelude to the 2026 state elections, a warning shot to both the ECI and her rivals. Across the aisle, the BJP dismisses it as sour grapes, but the ECI’s admission lends credence to at least part of the opposition’s case: the system was not watertight. Meanwhile, overseas Indian voters, who pay taxes but often lack voter IDs or Aadhaar, add another layer of grievance. Why, they ask, cannot the system streamline identity for all citizens, wherever they reside? The ECI’s credibility is on trial here. Once hailed as a pillar of Indian democracy, it is now mocked as a 'caged parrot,' singing to the tune of political masters, an allusion to its perceived coziness with the ruling duo of BJP and its allies. That 2019 tweet, boasting of EPIC’s uniqueness, has come back to haunt it, exposing a gap between rhetoric and reality. The Handbook for Electoral Registration Officers, a dense ECI manual, lays out the process for issuing EPICs, but it is silent on how duplicates slipped through. Citizens like one exasperated X user, struggling for three months to correct a voter ID online, vent frustration at a bureaucracy that preaches digitization while stumbling over basics. 'No voter left behind,' the ECI proclaims, yet the reality feels more like 'no glitch left unexposed.' Could this be the tip of an iceberg? Theories swirl that BJP’s electoral victories, particularly in tight races, owe something to voter roll manipulation. Bogus IDs, duplicate voters, and lax oversight form a shadowy trinity in these accusations, though hard evidence remains elusive. The ECI’s defense, that duplicates do not equal fraud, holds water logically but not emotionally. Trust, once cracked, does not mend with press notes. Opposition leaders demand accountability, with some suggesting a return to ballot paper voting, a nostalgic but impractical fix in a digital age. Others, like legal minds cited on X, urge the Supreme Court to step in, arguing that only judicial oversight can force transparency and punish culprits. Let us weigh the options. The ECI’s ERONET upgrade is a start, promising unique IDs through better tech. It is less invasive than Aadhaar linking, sidestepping privacy debates, but its success hinges on execution, something the ECI’s track record now casts doubt on. Aadhaar, by contrast, offers a robust check, leveraging biometrics to root out overlaps. Yet, making it mandatory risks alienating voters and sparking lawsuits, while keeping it voluntary limits its reach. A hybrid approach, mandatory Aadhaar with ironclad data safeguards, might split the difference, but political will and public buy-in are shaky. For now, the ECI’s hurried note feels like a Band-Aid on a festering wound. The fallout is undeniable. Faith in institutions, already fragile in an era of polarized politics, takes another hit. The ECI, once a referee above the fray, now looks like a player caught off-guard. Opposition parties have a cause to rally around, but their boycott threats could backfire, alienating voters who want reform, not chaos. Civil society, from lawyers to activists, has a role to play, pushing for answers, not just outrage. And the public? They are left sifting through the noise, wondering if their vote, that sacred act, is as secure as they were told. In the end, this is not just about duplicate numbers, it is about what they symbolize: a system stretched thin, a democracy tested, and a trust betrayed. The ECI must do more than patch the holes; it needs to rebuild confidence with transparency, accountability, and perhaps a dash of humility. Linking EPIC to Aadhaar could be part of the fix, but only if paired with guarantees that privacy is not the price. As India barrels toward its next elections, the stakes are too high for half-measures. The dirty linen is out; now, it is time to clean it.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWcZeBxCpHJYJIHRyY6yUCqE	2025-03-08T18:21:31-08:00	
HHS Is Opposing Experimental Bird Flu ‘Vaccines’ For Poultry: USD...	Last week, I wrote about experimental 'vaccines' that the United States government has been working with pharmaceutical companies to develop — different ones for poultry and people. I asked if Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) Secretary Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. and Department of Agriculture (USDA) Secretary Brooke Rollins, both new to their jobs in February, would stand up against this and other aspects of 'the US government’s bird flu scheme ramped up during the previous presidential administration.' Here is an update. In a new interview at Fox Nation, Kennedy indicated that HHS opposes giving chickens the bird flu 'vaccine.' Kennedy stated: 'There’s no indication that those vaccines actually provide sterilizing immunity, and all three of my health agencies at NIH, CDC, and FDA — the acting heads of those agencies — have all recommended against the use of the bird flu vaccine.' This conclusion is supported, Kennedy stated, by the fact that 'the vaccine could actually promote antigenic shift, which means your turning those birds into mutant factories, and that could actually accelerate the jump [of the bird flu] to human beings.' The catch, though, is that the authority over this in regard to poultry raised in America largely resides in the USDA. Therefore, it is important what Rollins decides. So far, she seems to be 'on the vaccine train' as was her predecessor in the Joe Biden administration. On February 26, Rollin released the USDA’s Five-Pronged Approach to Address Avian Flu that includes substantial boosting of giving a bird flu 'vaccine' to poultry in its fourth of five sections. Here is that section: Explore Pathways toward Vaccines, Therapeutics, and Other Strategies for Protecting Egg Laying Chickens to Reduce Instances of Depopulation USDA will be hyper-focused on a targeted and thoughtful strategy for potential new generation vaccines, therapeutics, and other innovative solutions to minimize depopulation of egg laying chickens along with increased bio-surveillance and other innovative solutions targeted at egg laying chickens in and around outbreaks. Up to a $100 million investment will be available for innovation in this area. Importantly, USDA will work with trading partners to limit impacts to export trade markets from potential vaccination. Additionally, USDA will work alongside the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services to ensure the public health and safety of any such approaches include considerations of tradeoffs between public health and infectious disease strategy. USDA will solicit public input on solutions, and will involve Governors, State Departments of Agriculture, state veterinarians, and poultry and dairy farmers on vaccine and therapeutics strategy, logistics, and surveillance. USDA will immediately begin holding biweekly discussions on this and will also brief the public on its progress biweekly until further notice. Will President Donald Trump step in to settle any disagreement between HHS and USDA on the matter? Notably, the USDA report also indicated that USDA will continue to back the mass slaughter of poultry in the name of countering bird flu, stating that the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service 'will continue to indemnify producers whose flocks must be depopulated to control the further spread of HPAI.' HPAI is short for highly pathogenic avian influenza — bird flu. As I wrote last week, Kennedy has in his early actions provided reason to expect that he would support ending US involvement in developing and promoting bird flu shots for people, something under the control of his department. He has yet to implement such a change. This article was published at Ron Paul Institute	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWcZeBxCpHJYJLjmhE2TKDTJ	2025-03-08T18:17:54-08:00	
Myanmar Junta Chief Says Election To Be Held By January 2026	Myanmar will hold parliamentary elections by January next year, the leader of the ruling military said, without setting a date for a vote that the generals who seized power in 2021 will be hoping will end widespread opposition to their grip on politics. The junta’s opponents say a vote under the military while the most popular politicians are locked up and their parties banned will be a sham. The junta is in control of only about half the country after significant losses to pro-democracy and ethnic minority insurgents fighting to end military rule. Senior Gen. Min Aung Hlaing announced the timing of the election while on a visit to Belarus on Friday, the military-run Global New Light of Myanmar newspaper reported. 'The election is slated for December 2025, with the possibility of … January 2026,' the newspaper quoted Min Aung Hlaing as saying. There was no immediate comment from forces opposed to military rule but a parallel civilian government in exile, the National Unity Government, has previously dismissed the junta’s plan for an election as window-dressing to bolster the military’s legitimacy at home and abroad. Allied ethnic minority insurgent groups fighting for self-determination have also rejected an election under military rule. Nobel laureate Aung San Suu Kyi – by far the most popular political leader in Myanmar – has been jailed since the military ousted her elected government on Feb. 1, 2021. Suu Kyi’s National League for Democracy party, which swept elections in 2015 and 2020, has been dissolved under military regulations and thousands of its members and supporters are in jail or have fled to rebel zones or into self-exile. China, which has major investments in Myanmar and is keen to see an end to its turmoil, supports the vote and has offered help to organize it, as have some of Myanmar’s Southeast Asian neighbors. Min Aung Hlaing, in a speech in Belarus, said 53 political parties had submitted paperwork to take part in the election. 'We also invite the observation teams from Belarus to come and observe,' he said. Voting is expected to be held in fewer than half of Myanmar’s 330 townships in the first phase of a staggered vote, a political party official said late last year after discussion with the election organizers. In Myanmar’s last election in 2020, voting was held in 315 out of the 330 townships. After Suu Kyi’s party swept the vote, as it did in a 2015 election, the army complained of cheating and overthrew her government. She has been jailed for 27 years. Election organizers said at the time there was no evidence of any significant cheating. Min Aung Hlaing was in Belarus after a visit to Russia where he held talks with President Vladimir Putin.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWcZeBxCpHJYJHBLrZUSNRzZ	2025-03-08T18:14:00-08:00	
Germany’s Coalition Deal Inches Closer	By Bárbara Machado (EurActiv) -- Germany's Christian Democrats and Social Democrats are ready to start formal coalition negotiations, after exploratory talks ended positively. Christian Democrats (CDU) leader Friederich Merz, who won Germany's federal elections last month, told reporters on Saturday that preliminary talks on a future coalition with the SPD ended in agreement, Tagesschau reports. After exploratory talks, the conservatives and SPD agreed on a final paper, based on which negotiations can now start. According to Taggeschau, Merz said in Berlin that an agreement was reached on several issues, including migration and finance, topics that until now divided the groups. Formal negotiations to close a governing coalition can begin as early as next week, and should last until Easter.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWcZeBxCpHJYJDDFtH9RotFd	2025-03-08T18:07:20-08:00	
Pray For A Peaceful Al-Aqsa Mosque – OpEd	Tens of thousands of Muslim worshipers prayed peacefully at the Al-Aqsa Mosque on the Temple Mount in Jerusalem on the first Friday of Ramadan despite fears of unrest due to tensions over the Gaza war. The Islamic Waqf, which manages the holy site, announced that some 90,000 people attended the Friday midday prayer. Israel had implemented safety restrictions at the Al-Aqsa Mosque in Jerusalem's Old City during the Muslim holy month of Ramadan. During Ramadan, over ninety thousand Palestinians came to pray at Al-Aqsa Mosque, the third holiest site in Islam that is located in East Jerusalem. This year Ramadan coincides with a fragile ceasefire in Gaza, which has largely halted fighting after a devastating war that left many thousands dead in Israel and Gaza. Last year, amid the Gaza war, Israeli authorities imposed restrictions on visitors coming to the Al-Aqsa Mosque. Only men aged 55 and older and women over 50 were allowed to enter the mosque compound for security reasons, while thousands of Israeli police officers were deployed across Jerusalem's Old City and no major violence occurred. By long standing convention, Jews are allowed to visit but not pray in the compound, which they revere as the site of their second temple, destroyed by the Romans in 70 AD. The Israeli government has said repeatedly that it intends to uphold the status quo at the Mosque, but many Palestinian use fears about the future of the Mosque as a flashpoint for violence. Last year, Israel allowed Muslims to worship at Al-Aqsa Mosque in the same numbers as in the previous year despite the war raging in Gaza and no major violence occurred. There is open land on the Temple Mount, and a small Jewish house of worship 'hologram', which is a 3D projection created with lasers, could be built adjacent to the Dome of the Rock and 600 feet north of the Al-Aksa Mosque, provided that Muslims would agree to cooperate. Anyone who could arrange such Jewish-Muslim cooperation would really be the Messianic Ruler of Peace (Isaiah 9:5). Christian support for such a cooperative venture would also be important, and anyone who can bring Jews, Christians and Muslims together in mutual respect and cooperation would surely fulfill the greatest of all Messianic predictions, 'They shall beat their swords into plowshares and their spears into pruning knives; nation shall not take up sword against nation, they shall never again teach war.' (Isaiah 2:4) Indeed, Jewish/Christian/Muslim agreements establishing world wide peace would not be possible without great spiritual leadership in all three communities. Thus, each Jewish-Christian-Muslim community could consider its leadership to be essentially Messianic, Indeed, such Jewish/Christian/Muslim cooperation would not be possible without great spiritual leadership in all three communities. Thus, each community could consider its own leadership to be essential Messianic aids as is foretold: 'Saviors [plural] will come up on mount Zion' (Prophet Obadiah 1:21) and this would fulfill the culminating verses of Isaiah's Messianic prophecy as enlarged upon by Prophet Micah (4:3-5): 'They shall beat their swords into plowshares and their spears into pruning knives. Nation shall not take up against nation, they shall never again teach war, but every man shall sit under his grapevine or fig tree with no one to disturb him, for it is the Lord of Hosts who spoke. Though all peoples walk, each in the name of its God, we will walk in the name of the Lord our God for ever and ever.' If each people truly follows the best of its own religious teachings; the Messianic Age of world wide peace will surely have arrived, and then-and only then-will the Jerusalem Temple of Solomon be rebuilt, and God's Holy Kingdom established on earth. A total of 51,600 deaths in Gaza were reported by the UN, as of January 14, 2025, including 7,000 from natural causes and 2,000 killed by Hamas. War-related fatalities were: 22,600 civilians and 20,000 combatants for a civilian/combatant ratio: ~1:1 The writer, a board member of Honest Reporting, has closely reviewed the data for 15 months. Congresswoman Rashida Tlaib says, 'From the river to the sea is an aspirational call for freedom, human rights, and peaceful coexistence, not death, destruction, or hate.' I say we can make it truly aspirational by making it focus on both people first and the land second. 'From the river to the sea Palestinians and Israelis should be freed of hatred and suffering by 'a two state for two peoples sharing of the land peacefully solution.'' As the Qur'an states: 'Good and evil deeds are not equal. Repel evil with what is better; then you will see that one who was once your enemy has become your dearest friend...' (41:34) And as the Qur'an states: ''Believers, be steadfast in the cause of God and bear witness with justice. Do not let your enmity for others turn you away from justice. Deal justly; that is nearest to being God-fearing.' (5:8)	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWcZeBxCpHJYJCUZlNZE-2vR	2025-03-08T18:05:06-08:00	
Trump Confident Putin Wants Peace Despite ‘Bombing The Hell Out O...	By Jeff Seldin Russia’s latest aerial barrage against targets in Ukraine is not dampening expectations by U.S. President Donald Trump that he can broker a deal to end the fighting between Moscow and Kyiv. Ukrainian officials Friday accused Russia of launching more than 200 overnight missile and drone strikes against Ukraine’s energy infrastructure across a broad swath of the nation, hitting targets in five regions while damaging residential buildings and injuring residents. But Trump, speaking to reporters Friday in the Oval Office, said he takes Russian President Vladimir Putin at his word when Putin says he wants peace. 'I believe him. I think we're doing very well with Russia,' Trump said, acknowledging that for the moment 'they're bombing the hell out of Ukraine.' 'He’s doing what anybody else would do,' the U.S. president said of Putin. 'I think probably anybody in that position would be doing that right now.' Trump also expressed continued frustration with Kyiv. 'I'm finding it more difficult, frankly, to deal with Ukraine. They don’t have the cards,' he told reporters. When asked if the United States would consider giving Ukraine additional air defenses, Trump said it depended on Ukraine. 'I have to know that they want to settle. I don’t know that they want to settle,' he said. 'If they don't want to settle, we're out of there because we want them to settle.' Other U.S. officials, meanwhile, have pushed back against the notion that Trump’s tactics to bring Russia and Ukraine to the negotiating table — which has included a pause on military aid and intelligence sharing with Kyiv — have made Ukraine more vulnerable. U.S. Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard told Fox News late Thursday that the pause on intelligence sharing is designed only to prevent Ukraine from launching offensive operations against Russia. 'Any intelligence going toward defending Ukraine against attacks coming into their country would continue,' Gabbard said. A U.S. defense official Friday confirmed to VOA that there has been no pause on intelligence that would allow Ukraine to defend itself, adding that Ukraine also maintains access to Starlink, the satellite internet system owned by Trump ally Elon Musk. As for the overnight attack by Russia, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy posted on social media that many of the drones were taken out by antiaircraft defenses. He said that for the first time, French-made Mirage fighter jets were deployed in air defense, and that U.S-made F-16s were also used. Zelenskyy, in a statement on his X social media account Friday, said that despite the Russian attacks, Kyiv is committed to seeking peace. 'Intense work with President Trump’s team has been ongoing at various levels — numerous calls,' he wrote. 'The topic is clear — peace as soon as possible, security as reliably as possible. Ukraine is fully committed to a constructive approach.' In a separate statement on Telegram, however, Zelenskyy expressed frustration with Moscow. 'Every day, new Russian attacks and reality itself prove that it is Russia that must be forced to make peace — to stop the war, to engage in real diplomacy,' he said, according to a translation of his comments. The latest barrage of Russian missiles and the responses from the U.S. and Ukraine come as Zelenskyy plans to travel to Saudi Arabia Monday for meetings with U.S. Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff to discuss a possible ceasefire with Russia. The meeting would be the first between Zelenskyy and U.S. officials since the Ukrainian leader’s contentious White House meeting last week with Trump and Vice President JD Vance, as reporters looked on. Earlier this week in a letter sent to Trump, Zelenskyy said the way the meeting went was 'regrettable' and Ukraine was 'ready to come to the negotiating table as soon as possible.' VOA’s Patsy Widakuswara and Jeff Custer contributed to this report.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWcZeBxCpHJYJDwEB3BCQvc6	2025-03-08T18:00:12-08:00	
Cutting Off Terror’s Lifeline – OpEd	Yet once again, a troubled geopolitical landscape in Afghanistan has become the focus of international attention. The fears were revived that nation could once again become a fertile breeding ground for global terrorism since the U.S. withdrew in 2021. The development of this crisis hinges on the deeply disturbing fact that donations of humanitarian and monetary aid meant to assist Afghanistan’s civilian population are being used to perpetuate terrorist networks. U.S. legislators, however, have rose up rising to the situation in the form of the ‘No Taxpayer Funding for Terrorists Act’—a legislative move that aims at reconstructing the United States approach in providing aid for than the Taliban has profited with the help of international help. The financial leakage is overwhelmingly high. The United Nations and non-governmental organizations, according to reports, receive roughly $40 million a week in U.S. aid to flow into Afghanistan’s Central Bank. Secretary of State Antony Blinken has confirmed that the transfers to these funds are ostensibly earmarked for humanitarian relief, but the Taliban regime withdraws nearly $10 million from these transfers in tribute to the oppressive governance it implements — and to its army of influence including Al-Qaeda and ISIS-K. This diversion points to a depressing paradox: well-intended aid is in fact subsidizing precisely the perpetrators of violence and instability for whom the world’s most severe humanitarian crisis is desperately needed. A further tactic of Taliban’s strategic co-opting of international aid channels and stealing the goodwill of the greater global sympathy is that it leaves Afghan citizens caught between their deprivation and terror. Senator Tim Sheehy’s legislation is aimed at cutting this lifeline. The law, called ‘The ‘No Taxpayer Funding for Terrorists Act’, introduced by Congressman Tim Burchett, prevents U.S. financial aid to Afghanistan under current oversight guidelines, a status critics say creates loopholes and easy avenues for them to funnel money in. Wading into unfamiliar territory with a change of face to the Taliban has given momentum to the bill that previously languished in Senate committees. The sort of hardening consensus reflected by the act, with robust support in the House, is that America’s $2.35 billion per year in aid to Afghanistan should entail stringent safeguards or outright cessation to avoid further infiltration by malign actors. By pushing further, Sheehy pursues a broader Biden administration strategy to recalibrate counterterrorism to financial attrition through economic erosion of the economic infrastructure supporting extremist operations. Nevertheless, there’s dissent among lawmakers. It is humanitarian organizations that warn about the potential increase in Afghanistan’s crises, as the 28 million people there rely on external aid for their very survival. Afghans survive on 3$ a day and there is rampant food insecurity and collapsing healthcare systems, says the UN estimates, 97 percent live in poverty. They argue that isolating the Taliban economically would merely expose it to collective punishment, further destabilize the area and help radicalization. However, proponents say it is necessary to suspend the system because the current aid arrangement is not transparent enough to prevent abuse and it should only resume when clear safeguards are in place. What you have here is this idea of dichotomy, moral obligations to civilians being soothed against this imperative of neutralising the existential threats, this is the ethical dilemma of modern counter terrorism. The U.S.’s stance also represents a drastic change in foreign policy from a reactive military to a pre-emptive financial containment. Washington is targeting revenue streams to tear down terrorism’s economic underpinnings, a tactic adopted around the world after it was proven successful in forcing melancholy on Iran and North Korea. This approach forces Afghanistan to rely on multilateral collaboration to shut down the banking operations of Taliban financed institutions and facilitate aid through other delivery mechanisms, either through direct partnerships at the grassroots level or via secure digital platforms. The problem involves not only fashioning a method neither entirely leaving Afghan civilians nor stiffening up at their oppressors but doing so with diplomatic delicacy and technological flair. Following Recommendations Build up a NATO, EU and UN partner team to develop a unified task force to audit aid disbursement and implement tough accountability protocols. The aid should proceed through decentralized ledgers in real time to bypass Taliban controlled channels. Imposing secondary sanctions against foreign entities that engage with Taliban linked businesses to disrupt illicit financing related to narcotics, mining, or taxation. Work with neighbouring countries Pakistan and Uzbekistan to agree on an aid route on the border managed by trusted NGOs and international observers. Public and diplomatic pressure on to delegitimize the Taliban’s governance, amplify the voices of Afghan civil society through international platforms.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWcZeBxCpHJYJH4RBoSl11hh	2025-03-08T17:52:57-08:00	
Pakistan And Azerbaijan: Strengthening Bilateral Cooperation – Op...	Recently, Pakistan and Azerbaijan have signed several agreements and Memorandums of understandings (MoUs) to boost bilateral cooperation in their trade as well as energy sectors. The visit of Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif to Baku proved to be a watershed visit where he held productive exchange of views with Azerbaijani President Ilham Aliyev. These things are the beginning of a good and strategic partnership to the two countries. The agreements mark a milestone in the transformation of Pakistan Azerbaijan relations to much more substantive economic cooperation than what has been possible by limited traditional diplomatic ties. However, the most important of all agreements includes the act of increasing bilateral investments to $2 billion through projects which will be beneficial to both parties. Beyond showing Azerbaijan’s confidence in Pakistan’s economic potential, this financial commitment helps boost Pakistan’s readiness as a profitable investment location. These collaborative efforts will be upgraded further with the signing of formal agreements during the upcoming visit of President Aliyev to Pakistan. The next important development in this context is the MoU signed between the State Oil Company of Azerbaijan Republic (SOCAR) and Pakistan’s Frontier Works Organization (FWO) and Pakistan State Oil (PSO). The MoU outlines collaborative efforts in association with Machike Thallian Tarujabba White Oil Pipeline Project- a strategic initiative to augment Pakistan’s energy security and reducing of transportation cost. The project will hold significant importance in ensuring easy transportation of oil and its use for the sake of progress of Pakistan’s industrial and economic landscape. In the tourism and education fields, outside the energy field, there is more long-term profit that can be derived. These sectors where the MoUs have been inked will encourage cultural exchange, educational cooperation and will help to strengthen the people to people ties between the two nations. Both Pakistan and Azerbaijan have a rich cultural history, and the scenery are beautiful, and these agreements will pave new ways for students, professionals, and investors to come and enjoy it as well as academic and tourism collaboration. In addition, the agreements further focused on strengthening the bilateral defense ties. Pakistan and Azerbaijan have agreed to produce defense equipment in joint manufacturing, that has economic and strategic importance. JF 17 Thunder fighter jet sale to Azerbaijan is a fulfillment of Pakistan’s growing ability to produce defense production and confidence of the international community of Pakistan defense manufacturing capabilities. Besides increasing Pakistan’s defense exports, this deal fortifies Azerbaijan’s military capabilities. In fact, Pakistan’s struggle to overcome its long-standing energy shortages is a long fought battle. But the recent agreements with Azerbaijan come at a turning point. Smooth flow of oil shall be taken care of in White Oil Pipeline and for greater flexibility in procuring energy supply agreements of LNG are given. Consequently, Pakistan would be able to cut down financial burden on its foreign exchange reserves, to procure energy in a manner which is sustainable and cost effective. Now, the economic collaboration between Pakistan and Azerbaijan also reflects the improvement taking place in Pakistan’s business environment. Azerbaijan’s plan to invest in Pakistan is a result of the country’s increasing attractiveness as investment destination as the government is focusing on policy reforms and ease of doing business. Currently the two countries conduct trade worth $55 million in total, yet with the newly signed agreements and development projects, the trade volume between two countries is expected to cross $2 billion within the next few years. This is milestone in the economic growth and regional integration of Pakistan. Additionally, both Pakistan and Azerbaijan hold significant geostrategic importance. Both Pakistan is a gateway to South Asia and the Middle East and so is Azerbaijan bridging Europe and Central Asia. Increased trade and connectivity between the two countries will enhance their economic cooperation as both strengthen the performance of regional economies at large. The partnership portends a model of regional economic collaboration particularly amongst the Organization of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) member states. The agreements also fit into Pakistan’s long-term aspirations to diversify its energy sources. As a player in the oil and gas sector, Azerbaijan is an apt partner to help Pakistan transit to a sustainable energy future. The ventures on LNG and pipeline projects will allow technological advancements and expertise to enter Pakistan for the benefits of the energy infrastructure. Moreover, Pakistan’s emerging manufacturing industry is also recognized worldwide as Azerbaijan continues buying Pakistan defense products. This is an indication of the country’s capacity to generate high quality exports of goods and the country being a strong player in defense industry as well as the world industrial fields. The China Pakistan Economic Corridor in conjunction with these new trade agreements, is locking Pakistan into a position as a trade hub to South and Central Asia. The Pakistan – Azerbaijan agreements strengthen this position by adding further to infrastructure and logistical and investment channels. Following Recommendations: Build institutional frameworks that sufficiently promote the smooth implementation of agreements and MoUs. Encourage public private partnerships to maximize the economic benefit from the $2 billion investment. Promote technological exchange in the energy, defense and industrial sectors for the sake of innovation. Engage in joint venture with respect to manufacturing aimed at increasing industrial productivity. Determine comprehensive trade policies so that the increasing trade volume could be maximized. Encourage policies that will further attract foreign direct investments. Use Azerbaijan’s experience of working with the energy to modernize oil and gas infrastructure of Pakistan.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWcZeBxCpHJYJGmqW57PoU7Q	2025-03-08T17:50:20-08:00	
Iran Rules Out Talks With US Under Maximum Pressure	Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araqchi said Tehran won’t hold any negotiations about its nuclear program with the US as long as the Trump administration applies its 'maximum pressure' policy. Iran will maintain talks with other negotiators but will not engage with the US under Trump's approach of ramping up sanctions, Araqchi said in an interview with AFP in Saudi Arabia’s Jeddah on Friday. AFP: Is Iran prepared to reopen negotiations with the US on its nuclear program? Araqchi: We will not enter any direct negotiations with the US so long as they continue their maximum pressure policy and their threats but it doesn't mean that regarding our nuclear program, we will not negotiate with other parties; we are talking with the three European countries, we are negotiating with Russia and China, other members of the JCPOA, and these talks can continue and I think we can reach a result from this path too. As long as the US government continues its pressure, we will also continue our resistance. If America wants to return to a new nuclear agreement with Iran, naturally it should observe the conditions of a fair and just negotiation and we have proven that we will not answer the language of pressure and threat but will respond to the language of respect and dignity as we did in the past. Regarding our nuclear program, I repeat, we are currently engaged in negotiations with the three European countries. We are in close consultation with Russia and China, and we are continuing our discussions with other countries that are interested. It is natural that our points of view will be conveyed by these countries to the American government. AFP: How do you respond to Israel's threat to attack Iran's nuclear program? Araqchi: Look, first of all, Iran's nuclear program cannot be destroyed through military operations, for several reasons. The first reason is that this is a technology that we have achieved, and the technology is in the brains and cannot be bombed. Second, Iran's nuclear facilities are scattered in many different parts of the country and are properly protected, and we are sure that they cannot be destroyed. Third, we have the ability to respond very strongly and in a completely proportionate and balanced manner. The Israelis themselves know, and others in the region know, that any action taken against Iran will be followed by a similar action against Israel. Therefore, I think that the threat of war against Iran is a threat that is just talked about. Implementing this threat would be a very big danger and would turn into a widespread fire. I think that if the Israelis or others were sure that they would achieve their goals through a military attack, they would have done so by now, but such a possibility is not feasible. I believe that if an attack on Iran were to take place, this attack could turn into a widespread fire in the region; not that we will do that. It is Israel's desire to involve the other countries in the region in a war. It is Israel's desire to draw America into a war. This is precisely an Israeli plan to drag America into war, and America is extremely vulnerable if it enters a war in the region. They themselves know this. I think that both Israel and America and others are fully aware of our capabilities, and therefore, if rationality prevails, even the permission for threatening Iran should not be given, let alone an actual military attack. AFP: Turkey has accused Iran of using militias to destabilize other countries. How do you respond? Araqchi: I don't think anyone doubts that the developments in Syria were directly influenced by Turkey and a few other countries, and therefore the problems that have arisen now, such as the widespread occupation of Syrian territory by Israel, the destruction of all of Syria's defense and scientific infrastructure by Israel, and all of the conflicts that exist, naturally, the responsibility lies with those who carried out these changes and developments. However, this does not mean that we are in conflict with Turkey; no, we will continue our friendly relations and continue our consultations on regional issues. AFP: Will Iran establish ties with the new Syrian government? Araqchi: There are many illegal groups in Syria, some of which are still on the UN list of terrorist groups. The policy of the Islamic Republic of Iran is quite clear. We want stability and peace in Syria. We want to preserve the territorial integrity of Syria. We want to preserve the territorial unity of Syria and oppose the division of Syria. We want an end to the foreign occupation in Syria. We want the progress and development of the Syrian people. Finally, we want the formation of an inclusive government in Syria. Any military confrontation with the people, any incident that leads to the death of people, and any military conflict that destabilizes Syria are condemned in our opinion and must be prevented. The Islamic Republic of Iran is currently only an observer of Syrian issues; we have no relationship with the current Syrian government, and we are not in a hurry in this regard. However, we hope that the developments in Syria will move towards an inclusive popular government, and we hope that all illegal groups whose work has led to the instability in Syria will return to the rule of law.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWcZeBxCpHJYJE3v2dZmQm4T	2025-03-08T17:47:06-08:00
