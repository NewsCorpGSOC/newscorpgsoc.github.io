Thailand’s Citizenship Boon – Analysis	By Bridget Welsh Without fanfare but with consequences, Thailand’s cabinet in late October approved granting citizenship to nearly half a million stateless people. It is Southeast Asia’s governance decision of the year – empowering 335,000 long-term immigrants and members of ethnic minorities as well as 142,000 of their children who were born in Thailand. The decision makes sense. It includes the new citizens in Thailand’s revised tax system set to be implemented next year (allowing for more contributions to the social welfare programs), expands the workforce and helps reduce the demographic pressures from an aging population. It also addresses a long-standing security problem. By providing legal documentation for settler communities, the decision reduces illicit activity and corruption concentrated around illegal documentation. Thailand is being forward-looking through grasping that tackling corruption involves reducing opportunities for corruption, especially that which targets vulnerable communities. This decision also allows security personnel to focus their activities on illegal human trafficking and the region’s growing scam problem. Over half a million Thais have been victimized by cybercrime scamssince March 2022, with Thailand bordering scam centers in Myanmar and Cambodia. Most important of all, the decision builds a humanitarian approach towards statelessness. Last January, Thailand expanded universal health insurance for stateless communities, putting in place healthcare for more than 500,000 people and in the process strengthening public health. Before the recent citizenship decision, around half of the stateless children were also able to access education. Southeast Asia has 50% of the world’s stateless population. The largest number of undocumented persons is in Malaysia, estimated to be over one million and concentrated in Sabah. Thailand, with her expansion of rights, has been a role model globally for the treatment of stateless persons. Thailand’s recent citizenship decision may have been unanticipated in its timing and scope, but it has been in the works for more than 20 years. In 2001, King Bhumibol, Thailand’s monarch from 1946 to 2016, gave a speech that called for equality for those who had lived in the country for a long time. His moral authority opened up discussions on reframing citizenship more inclusively, created space for civil society that is active in addressing discrimination against stateless communities, and created momentum in the expansion of rights. Under Thaksin Shinawatra’s government, from 2001 until 2006, there were policy shifts that expanded the rights of stateless people, especially children. Yet, it was the relentless activism of civil society that has been critical in pushing for these rights. Mindsets and practices took time to change. Two earlier cabinet decisions, in 2010 and 2021, set out criteria for inclusion and signaled wider pathways for citizenship. The decision this year is the most progressive. Those who would benefit from the cabinet’s decision include long-term immigrants who settled in Thailand from 1984 to 1999 and from 2005 to 2011, children of ethnic minorities in Thailand and children born in Thailand to persons without registration status. This includes minority settlers from Myanmar and hill tribe communities – among the most vulnerable and discriminated. Labor migrants who have been in Thailand during these time windows can also qualify. The rest of Southeast Asia should learn from Thailand’s forward-looking example. It is possible to resolve a large group of stateless people sustainably. Leadership can make a difference, especially when it listens to civil society. A lens that focuses on children can help change mindsets, as does an appreciation that inclusion can bring broader societal benefits in public health and a stronger economy. The path ahead will still be challenging for Thailand’s stateless people, who have to apply to the Ministry of Interior. It is not clear how long this process will take. Civil society activists worry it still may take years for individual decisions to be finalized. Yet, for the communities who now have a pathway to greater security and inclusion, a reason to celebrate finally came.

EU–Japan Security Partnership Shows Promise But Lacks Action – An...	By Paul O’Shea In early November 2024, Japan and the European Union signed a security and defence partnership. Amid a flurry of other events — North Korean troops in Ukraine, the US election, another looming trade war and Germany’s political and economic crises — this agreement may have gone unnoticed. Even as the world speeds up, EU–Japan relations continue to progress according to their own slow and incremental logic, as if from another era. The November 2024 agreement reflects this dynamic — it is the next step following the 2018 Economic and Strategic Partnership Agreement. Both agreements promise deeper cooperation across a wide range of economic, social and security issues. But for now, they remain too vague and exploratory to keep pace with accelerating geopolitics. The 2018 agreement was concluded in a period of geopolitical uncertainty. The European Union was dealing with the fallout from Brexit while struggling to manage relations with the first Trump administration. Japan, under Abe, was managing Trump in its own way while building partnerships to hedge against US decline and growing isolationism. Six years later, the outlook for both parties is even bleaker. The European Union successfully managed Brexit but right-wing populism continues to rise across the continent. Trump’s return threatens the global economic and security order underpinning European prosperity. In Washington, the so-called ‘prioritisers’ — those that favour focusing on China while reducing involvement in other regions — are coming to power, leaving Europe to consider deterring Russia without US support. Japan’s position, though less dire, remains uncertain. Trump’s pick for Commerce Secretary, Howard Lutnick, has previously targeted Japan for tariffs. Even if Japan avoids the coming Trump tariffs, his re-election sends an ominous signal to US allies. While Japan can take comfort in the fact that the United States needs its support to contain China, four more years of Trump means that nothing can be taken for granted. Looking beyond the next four years, US transactionalism and isolationism can no longer be dismissed as a blip. This is clearly a trend. The 2018 agreement provided a broad framework to formalise cooperation across a range of issue areas, including trade, climate change, energy and human rights. While two structurally similar advanced economies will struggle to achieve massive gains from trade, bilateral trade and investment flows have increased significantly. Non-tariff barriers remain an obstacle but these are expected to fade as the two economies become more deeply interconnected. The 2018 strategic partnership aimed to lay a foundation for future cooperation, focusing on ‘safe’ areas such as climate change. Since then, cooperation has deepened and moved into ‘harder’ sectors. Japanese former prime minister Kishida attended the NATO summits in 2022, 2023 and 2024, while the European Union and Japan implemented a new strategic dialogue at the foreign minister level. In November 2023 and again in 2024, former vice-president of the European Commission Josep Borrell met with Japanese Minister of Foreign Affairs Iwaya Takeshi, and it was at this latter meeting that the Defense Partnership was formalised. This new agreement highlights a wide range of potential fields of cooperation — just as the 2018 agreement did. It includes important new steps, most notably increasing maritime security cooperation, including proposed joint exercises and port calls. While neither China nor Russia are mentioned, the agreement explicitly links the security of Europe with that of the Indo-Pacific’ and vice-versa. The agreement also calls for ‘exploring the opportunity’ to build maritime capacity in third-party Indo-Pacific states among other initiatives. But there lies a key issue — much of the agreement is ‘exploratory’. The text is littered with references to ‘exploring the possibility of cooperation’ in various fields. Given the acute crisis that US alliance partners face today, the language is vague and unhurried. The progress since 2018 is evident but pales in comparison to the dramatic geopolitical shifts in the same period. If there was a time to move from ‘exploration’ to ‘cooperation’, it is now. The shared interests are obvious — both parties have built their prosperity on the rules-based international order. They also share a growing fear of the authoritarian challenge posed by China and Russia, and of the threat to the most basic norms of the post-World War II international order. But despite these shared values and fears, a rapid response seems beyond their reach for several reasons. Kishida’s reaction to Ukraine was lauded, promising major increases in military spending, circumventing restrictions on arms exports and seeking to develop ties with NATO. But even at the time, there were questions about where the money would come from. The October election left the ruling Liberal Democratic Party without a coalition majority, adding political constraints to the existing fiscal and demographic challenges. Meanwhile in Europe, substantial deepening of security ties with Japan would require the unlikely unanimity of member states — a feat that is difficult to achieve given their divergent interests, particularly when it comes to issues that, if only tangentially, involve China. The trajectory and pace of EU–Japan security relations indicate that neither side is currently in a position to be a major geopolitical player outside their immediate neighbourhood. This may change, especially if the China–Russia entente deepens or further significant events occur. But the new agreement, exploratory as it is, marks the limits of possible cooperation.

Afghanistan: Now It Can Be Told, After All The Harm Has Been Done...	This week, the New York Times reported that the U.S. government made war in Afghanistan while helping to 'recruit, train and pay for lawless bands of militias that pillaged homes and laid waste to entire communities.' Those militias 'tortured civilians, kidnapped for ransom, massacred dozens in vendetta killings and razed entire villages, sowing more than a decade of hatred toward the Afghan government and its American allies.' Written by a former Kabul bureau chief for the Times, the article appeared under a headline saying that 'U.S.-backed militias' in Afghanistan were 'worse than the Taliban.' Now they tell us. The new reporting made me think of a chapter in my book War Made Invisible titled 'Now It Can Be Told.' Here’s an excerpt: * * * Timing is crucial in media and politics — and never more so than when war is at stake. It’s completely unsatisfactory for journalists to toe the war line for years and then finally report, in effect: Now it can be told — years too late. Virtually the entire U.S. media establishment gave full-throated support to the U.S. attack on Afghanistan in early October 2001. Twenty years later, many of the same outlets were saying the war was ill-conceived and doomed from the start. Immediately after the invasion of Iraq began in March 2003, with very few exceptions, even the mainstream news organizations that had been expressing trepidation or opposition swung into line to support the war effort. Two decades later, many of the same media outlets were calling the invasion of Iraq the worst U.S. foreign-policy blunder in history. But such framing evades the structural mendacity that remains built into the military-industrial complex, with its corporate media and political wings. War is so normalized that its casualties, as if struck by acts of God, are routinely viewed as victims without victimizers, perhaps no more aggrieved than people suffering the consequences of bad weather. What American policymakers call mistakes and errors are, for others, more aptly described with words like catastrophes and atrocities. Attributing the U.S. wars to faulty judgment — not premeditated and hugely profitable aggression — is expedient, setting the policy table for supposed resolve to use better judgment next time rather than challenging the presumed prerogative to attack another country at will. When the warfare in Afghanistan finally ended, major U.S. media — after avidly supporting the invasion and then the occupation — were awash in accounts of how the war had been badly run with ineptitude or deception from the White House and the Pentagon. Some of the media analysis and commentaries might have seemed a bit sheepish, but news outlets preferred not to recall their prior support for the same war in Afghanistan that they were now calling folly. A pattern of regret (not to say repentance or remorse) emerged from massive U.S. outlays for venture militarism that failed to triumph in Afghanistan and Iraq, but there is little evidence that the underlying repetition compulsion disorder has been exorcized from America’s foreign-policy leadership or major news media, let alone its political economy. On the contrary: the forces that have dragged the United States into an array of wars in numerous countries still retain enormous sway over foreign and military affairs. For those forces, over time, shape-shifting is essential, while the warfare state continues to rule. The fact that strategies and forms of intervention are evolving, most conspicuously in the direction of further reliance on airpower rather than ground troops, makes the victims of the USA’s firepower even less visible to American eyes. This presents a challenge to take a fresh look at ongoing militarism and insist that the actual consequences for people at the other end of U.S. weaponry be exposed to the light of day — and taken seriously in human terms. Despite all that has happened since President George W. Bush vowed in mid-September 2001 to 'rid the world of the evil-doers,' pivotal issues have been largely dodged by dominant U.S. media and political leaders. The toll that red-white-and-blue militarism takes on other countries is not only a matter of moral principles. The United States is also in jeopardy. That we live in one interdependent world is no longer debatable. Illusions about American exceptionalism have been conclusively refuted by the global climate emergency and the Covid-19 pandemic, along with the ever-present and worsening dangers of thermonuclear war. On a planet so circular in so many ways, what goes around comes around.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWeSAohndYMaVAp3P8pU0lWd	2024-12-27T17:12:37-08:00	
US Share Of Electric And Hybrid Vehicle Sales Increased In Second...	The share of electric and hybrid vehicle sales in the United States increased in the second quarter of 2024 (2Q24) after a slight decline in 1Q24. Combined U.S. sales of hybrid vehicles, plug-in hybrid electric vehicles, and battery electric vehicles (BEVs) increased from 17.8% of total new light-duty vehicle (LDV) sales in 1Q24 to 18.7% in 2Q24, according to estimates from Wards Intelligence. This slight increase in the electric and hybrid vehicle market share was driven primarily by hybrid electric vehicle (HEV) sales, which increased by 30.7% year over year. Hybrid sales accounted for 8.6% of the total light-duty market in 1Q24 and increased to 9.6% in 2Q24. Plug-in hybrid electric vehicle sales increased slightly from 1.7% to 2.0% of the total light-duty market year over year. Following slower growth in 1Q24 compared with the previous year, in 2Q24, BEV sales accounted for 7.1% of the U.S. LDV market, a similar share to 2Q23. Luxury electric vehicles continued to sell well, accounting for 32.8% of total luxury sales in 2Q24. U.S. luxury vehicle sales accounted for 16.6% of the total light-duty market in 2Q24, while luxury vehicles made up 73.8% of total battery electric sales, 8.3% of hybrid sales, and 29.2% of plug-in hybrid sales. The average transaction price of BEVs in the United States, not including any government incentives, decreased from $57,405 in January 2024 to $56,371 in June 2024, according to data from Cox Automotive. BEV transaction prices were 21.1% higher than the overall average light-duty vehicle transaction price in January 2024 and 15.9% higher in June 2024. Although Tesla is still the leading manufacturer in the electric vehicle market, it no longer holds the majority share of electric vehicle sales. Tesla’s market share accounted for 48.9% of the total electric vehicle market in 2Q24, decreasing to less than 50% of the light-duty vehicles sold for the first time since 4Q17. The sales have shifted to legacy manufacturers such as Ford, Chevrolet, Hyundai, and Kia. Ford accounted for 8.0% of sales in the electric vehicle market in 2Q24, the second-largest share, driven by the sales of the Mustang Mach-E and F-150 Lightning. Chevrolet’s sales shifted to its newly introduced electric Blazer, Silverado, and Equinox models following the manufacturer’s decision to stop producing the Bolt, a decision that decreased overall sales in 1Q24. BEV manufacturers are producing vehicles both domestically and globally. According to estimates from Wards Intelligence, 74.4% of electric vehicles sold in the United States were manufactured in North America in 2Q24 compared with 78.7% in 2Q23. A year-over-year comparison shows that the total share of electric vehicles sold in the United States and manufactured in South Korea increased from 8.0% in 2Q23 to 12.2% in 2Q24 while the share of electric vehicles manufactured in Japan increased from 2.4% to 7.2%. To qualify for the clean vehicle tax credits in the Inflation Reduction Act, manufacturers must comply with domestic content requirements for final assembly, battery components, and critical mineral inputs that extend beyond simply manufacturing in North America. Therefore, not all vehicles classified as manufactured in North America qualify for this credit.

What Lies Ahead For Switzerland: An Economic Outlook For 2025 – A...	By Samuel Jaberg, Jessica Davis Plüss, Anand Chandrasekhar, Matthew Allen, and Reto Gysi von Wartburg The Swiss economy has proven to be resilient against global economic volatility and inflationary pressures in recent times. In 2025 the economy is expected to grow at a slightly faster pace but remain below its potential. The Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), for example, has raised its growth outlook for Swiss gross domestic product (GDP) from 1.4% to 1.5% for the coming year. Meanwhile, the Swiss National Bank (SNB) faces the ongoing challenge of balancing controlling inflation with supporting economic growth. Interest rates may remain relatively low, though the central bank may adjust its monetary policy stance depending on global trends and domestic inflationary pressures. A strong labour market, particularly in high-skill sectors, such as finance, pharmaceuticals, and technology, will likely support consumption levels. Inflation is expected to be moderate, providing some relief to Swiss households after a period of rising costs. In many industries wage increases decided for 2025 amount to 1.7-2% and lie above inflation, the Swiss union Unia has reported. This should lead to an actual improvement in real wages. Let us have a closer look at six Swiss key industries: 1. Swiss pharma braces for US regulatory uncertainty and global price pressure The two big Swiss pharmaceutical companies, Roche and Novartis, will look to gain momentum in 2025 after corporate restructurings. In November, Novartis lifted its 2023-2028 sales forecast in a sign of confidence after top-selling drugs exceeded quarterly growth targets. Roche is hoping a suite of new weight-loss drug candidates will show positive results in 2025 and help cement its place in what analysts predict could be a $100 billion (CHF88 billion) market in ten years. Although it is a newcomer to obesity, Chief Executive Officer Thomas Schinecker told reporters in July he believed Roche could bring the new drugs to market 'much faster' than investors expect. The companies’ optimism faces headwinds though. Donald Trump’s return to the White House could lead to sweeping changes on drug prices, public health, and biotech funding in the industry’s largest market. Any attempts by Trump to expand drug pricing negotiations agreed under Biden will likely face strong pushback from industry. Pressure on drug prices is mounting beyond the United States. Even at home in Switzerland, companies will be under more scrutiny to justify the price tag for newly launched therapies amid rising healthcare costs. The Swiss pharma and biotech companies are also bracing for disruptions to global trade if the US and China continue to isolate each other. The life sciences industry, which makes up 40% of Swiss exports, relies heavily on global cooperation. Any move to cut off one part of the world from the supply chain could create hurdles for innovation in the sector. 2. Food prices are likely to stabilise in 2025 – except chocolate The continued rise in prices of raw materials like coffee and cocoa have put Swiss food companies in a bind. Six months after former Nestlé CEO Mark Schneider referred to food prices rises as a '50-year event', he was no longer with the company. Nestlé’s sales were down, and the general feeling was that the company had scared away inflation-hit shoppers who had gone on to buy cheaper products. This dent in the customer base will be hard to turn around with new Nestlé CEO Laurent Freixe warning of a 'soft demand environment' during the release of third quarter results this October. The year 2025 will be all about trying to bring cost-conscious consumers back. This task will be a painful one. Food companies will have to absorb the rise in prices of raw materials without passing them on to consumers. This will mean serious cost-cutting. In November, Nestlé announced that it planned to cut CHF2.5 billion in costs by 2027. The food industry is also getting rid of surplus capacity. For example, the Hero Group is closing its jam factory in Lenzburg, Switzerland, and moving production to its existing facility in Murcia, Spain. Despite cost-cutting measures, fans of Swiss chocolate will continue to have to pay more for their treats. Recent record cocoa prices will not be fully absorbed by chocolate manufacturers like Lindt & Sprüngli. Swiss chocolate firms can therefore expect stagnation or even decline in sales volumes in 2025 and loss of market share to cheaper competition who use less cocoa in their products. 3. Financial sector on its way to recovery The Swiss financial sector appears to have rebounded from the shock collapse of Credit Suisse last year. A stock market revival has inflated the assets of the richest people in the world, which is good news for Switzerland’s storied wealth management industry. But uncertainties and storm clouds continue to lurk, never far away. The Credit Suisse saga is far from over, despite the apparent seamless integration into its larger rival UBS. A parliamentary report into the debacle will likely spark a fresh regulatory shake-up next year. The Swiss government has already proposed a raft of measures, including extra capital requirements for banks and increased power for the financial regulator. Banks and asset managers are also campaigning against further regulations surrounding sustainable finance as they face increased pressure from non-governmental organisations. The Swiss stock market, under the new leadership of new CEO Bjørn Sibbern, will be watching how markets react to the new Trump presidency from next year. And the cloud of money laundering refuses to budge over the Swiss banking sector. Just as UBS was cleared of allegations relating to the Bulgarian mafia towards the end of the year, private bank Lombard Odier was hit with money laundering charges by Swiss prosecutors. 4. Swiss watchmakers are no longer celebrating After three years of post-Covid euphoria, the Swiss watchmaking industry returned to a more normal level in 2024. Watch exports fell by nearly 3% in value terms (provisional figures), due to sharp drops in demand in China (-26% at the end of November) and Hong Kong (-20%). No fundamental improvement is expected for 2025, however. 'The lack of appetite among Chinese consumers for luxury products is the main reason for this complicated situation for the industry,' Jean-Philippe Bertschy, a watchmaking expert at Bank Vontobel, told SWI swissinfo.ch. Other markets have also begun to show negative trends in recent months. The downward trend in the number of watches exported and the consolidation of strong brands is likely to continue. 'The top-of-the-range brands that offer high-quality, emotional products with a strong connection to their customers will continue to gain market share. It promises to be a very difficult year for the other brands, and for all the industry’s suppliers,' said Bertschy. 5. A gloomy outlook for the machinery industry For the second year in a row, the Swiss machinery, electrical equipment and metals industry (MEM industries) saw sales fall in 2024 (-4% for the first nine months of the year). The industry’s umbrella association, Swissmem, blames this economic weakness on falling demand from the European Union, and Germany in particular. Germany and its crisis-hit automobile sector is a major source of concern for Swiss subcontractors. Exports to Switzerland’s biggest sales market fell by 8.4% in the first nine months of the year. A recovery is not expected any time soon. 'In the best-case scenario, we can expect a stabilisation next year,' said Stefan Brupbacher, director of Swissmem, in a statement in mid-November. 'On the other hand, if a ‘trade war’ were to break out between the United States, China and the EU, this would drag the Swiss tech industry, which exports 80% of its products, even further down.' 6. Swiss tourism stabilises The Swiss tourism sector had a very good year in 2024, with overnight stays expected to hit a new record of almost 47 million (up 14% on 2023). The coming months also look promising. The KOF Swiss Economic Institute is forecasting External linkgrowth in overnight stays of around 0.8% this winter. Travellers from the United States should continue to benefit from the strong dollar. During summer this year, the number of overnight stays recorded for tourists from North America rose by almost 300,000 (+14%), following an increase of 26% in 2023. Despite the weakening of the euro and the ongoing recession in Germany, the KOF expects overnight stays by European tourists to grow by 2% this winter. Meanwhile, local tourists are likely to 'remain the most important group of visitors,' it says, even if a further decline is expected (-0.5%) in favour of long-distance travel. As far as the 2025 summer season is concerned, the KOF is forecasting an increase of 0.2% in overnight stays. While the European market is expected to remain stable, uncertainty reigns about China. Despite slow growth, total overnight stays by Chinese guests are only expected to reach 60% of the pre-Covid level (2019).	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWeSAohndYMaVMw3SOG_ZyYT	2024-12-27T16:55:43-08:00	
Chinese Soft Power Strategy In Bangladesh – Analysis	Introduction What are the key elements of the Chinese ‘soft power’ strategy in Bangladesh? How has China's soft power strategy influenced Bangladesh's economic, social and cultural landscape? These questions are addressed in this article. On March 2, 2023, Brand Finance – the world's most famous consultancy agency – published a report on Global Soft Power Index (GSPIS) in London which examined the brands of 121 nation-states. The report reveals that among the top 20, Western countries are much ahead in pursuing soft power compared to South Asian or African countries. Soft power is a term used in international relations to describe a country's ability to influence others through cultural appeal, values, and diplomacy rather than coercion or force. Coined by political scientist Joseph Nye in the late 1980s, soft power contrasts with 'hard power', which involves military might and economic sanctions. Soft power involves the power of attraction in international politics. Nye developed the concept of soft power in a Cold War context. The concept of soft power refers to the ability to achieve desired outcomes through attraction rather than coercion or monetary incentives. Since the end of the Cold War, the concept of soft power has evolved over time into a broader concept. Bangladesh-China Trade The magnitude of the Bangladesh–China relationship has assumed a phenomenal shape in the post- Cold War era. Bangladesh–China relations started to grow in the post-1990s on wider issues. Notably, China became a key partner of Bangladesh in every dimension of bilateral ties. Historically, numerous Chinese monks, scholars, and traders traveled to Bengal as early as the Qin dynasty. Bangladesh and China have maintained a longstanding friendly relationship. Trade between the two nations is a significant aspect of their bilateral cooperation, with China being Bangladesh's largest trading partner and Bangladesh ranking as China's second-largest trading partner in South Asia. In 2019, their bilateral trade volume amounted to $18.33 billion. The import from China constitutes 34% of the total imports of Bangladesh. China is a key strategic trading partner for Bangladesh. The Chinese government has announced a zero-tariff policy for 97% of Bangladeshi exports. Chinese Foreign Direct Investment Chinese Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) in Bangladesh has grown significantly over the years, becoming a cornerstone of the bilateral relationship between the two countries. Infrastructure Development: Significant Chinese investments have gone into large-scale projects such as the Padma Bridge, Chattogram and Mongla seaports, and power generation facilities. China has invested in SEZs, notably the Bangabandhu Industrial Park, to promote manufacturing and exports. Investments in coal, solar, and other power projects have been substantial, helping to meet Bangladesh’s growing energy demand. Chinese firms are also exploring opportunities in Bangladesh’s burgeoning tech and fintech sectors. Chinese firms have shown interest in partnering with local industries in Bangladesh's leading export sector. Chinese FDI has been invested in industries such as garments, telecommunications, energy, manufacturing, infrastructure, leather, and chemicals. Between 2016-22, Chinese state-owned and private companies invested nearly US$26 billion in Bangladesh. In 2022, Beijing emerged as the country’s largest FDI provider as its investments topped almost US$1 billion—a 30 percent increase from US$700 million in 2021. Belt and Road Initiative The Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) has become a prominent feature of the current global economic system. The estimated cost of the BRI is approximately $2.1 trillion, impacting on the lives of around 80% of the world’s population. In September 2013, Chinese President Xi Jinping introduced the One Belt and One Road Initiative (OBOR). Initially, BRI garnered limited attention, but a decade later, its English name evolved into the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI). Today, it stands as one of the world’s most ambitious and widely debated development projects. To date, 148 countries and several international organizations have signed memorandums of understanding (MoUs) with China regarding the BRI, which China promotes as an open and inclusive platform for global cooperation. The initiative comprises two main components: the Silk Road Economic Belt and the 21st Century Maritime Silk Road. The Economic Belt focuses on developing and expanding land routes for trade and connectivity across Europe, the Middle East, Central Asia, and Asia. The Maritime Road, on the other hand, aims to enhance sea routes linking East Asia, South Asia, the Middle East, and Africa. The BRI is guided by five core priorities: policy coordination, facilities connectivity, unimpeded trade, financial integration, and people-to-people connections. In 2017, the Communist Party of China formally incorporated the advancement of the BRI into its constitution. The Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) previously estimated that the BRI would generate an additional $1 trillion in global funding between 2017 and 2027, while the World Bank reported that BRI-related investments, including energy projects, totaled approximately $575 billion between 2013 and 2018. While African nations have praised the BRI, countries like India and the United States have criticized it, accusing China of employing ‘debt-trap diplomacy’ to seize control of assets in cases where nations fail to repay loans. Beyond defense and economic cooperation, Bangladesh and China maintain multifaceted bilateral relations encompassing cultural and educational exchanges, sports, exhibitions, scholar and student exchanges, and trade delegations. The BRI is often negatively portrayed in the Bangladeshi press. Public Diplomacy The Pandemic transformed and reshaped the structure of the geo-political landscape of the planet. Vaccine diplomacy is a subset of global health diplomacy and refers to the use and delivery of vaccines to achieve a country’s global health goals and foreign policy objectives. China's vaccine diplomacy started in July 2020 when the first Chinese vaccine trial outside China commenced in Brazil. In December 2020, Egypt became one of the first countries to accept vaccines from Chinese state-owned vaccine producer Sinopharm. Beijing targeted mainly low and medium-income countries for early vaccine deliveries. It has supplied vaccines to EU member Hungary and EU candidate countries Serbia and Turkey. China was the first country to deliver vaccines to COVID-19 hard-hit Southeast Asia, having donated more than 7 million doses across nine ASEAN countries by July 2021. China also supplied the Covid 19 vaccine to the South Asian Countries including Bangladesh. Confucious Institutes & Cultural Engagement The establishment of Confucius Institutes since 2004 to promote the understanding of Chinese language and culture is a striking example of how the Chinese government promotes soft power through cultural means. In Bangladesh, there are several Confucius Institutes dedicated to promoting Chinese language and culture. Established in 2016 as a collaboration between Yunnan University, China, and the University of Dhaka, the Confucius Institute offers Chinese language courses, cultural exchange programs, and research opportunities to strengthen ties between China and Bangladesh. Inaugurated in 2006 in partnership with Yunnan University, the Confucius Institute at North South University provides Chinese language instruction, cultural activities, and resources to foster understanding of Chinese culture in Bangladesh. Officially inaugurated in November 2023, Shanto Mariam-Honghe Confucius Classroom is the first Confucius Classroom in Bangladesh, established to further promote Chinese language education and cultural exchange. These institutions play a significant role in enhancing educational and cultural exchanges between Bangladesh and China. Scholarships and Exchange Programs China has become a popular destination for Bangladeshi students pursuing higher education, particularly in fields like medicine, engineering, business, and technology. This growth is driven by China's globally recognized universities, affordable tuition fees, and government scholarships, including the Chinese Government Scholarship (CGS) and funding under the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI). The presence of Confucius Institutes in Bangladesh also encourages students to study in China by offering language training and cultural orientation. With opportunities to engage in cultural exchange and research collaborations, Bangladeshi students play a key role in strengthening bilateral relations and enhancing people-to-people ties between the two countries. The Skills and Training Enhancement Project (STEP) between Bangladesh and China's Yunnan Province is a leading example of Sino-Bangladesh partnership. Under this initiative, Chinese expert trainers actively assist their Bangladeshi counterparts in strengthening their abilities in a variety of areas, such as student exchange, teacher development, and information sharing. Research Centers & Collaboration The Centre for China Studies (CCS) at the University of Dhaka stands as a collaborative research institution, committed to implementing the spirit of the 2023 Johannesburg Summit between the top leaders of China and Bangladesh. The establishment of the CCS is not only an affirmation of the profound friendship between Bangladesh and China but also an important milestone in the educational and academic exchanges and cooperation between the two sides. The vision of the CCS is to provide a 'valuable platform for Bangladeshi scholars to gain an in-depth understanding of Chinese culture, history and society, which is of great significance for Bangladesh to realize Smart Bangladesh and Vision 2041'. A research center namely, the China-South Asia Center for Socio-cultural Studies (CSCSS) is setup at North South University under the South Asian Institute of Policy and Governance (SIPG). CSCSS aims to emerge as a collaboration hub dedicated to fostering mutual understanding, cultural exchange, and academic collaboration between China and South Asia. The center serves as a bridge between these dynamic regions, aiming to promote socio-cultural harmony and sustainable development through comprehensive research and community engagement Soft Power: A Comparative Analysis An attempt is made here to compare and discuss China’s soft power with that of some regional and global powers. India is a South Asian country and the world's most populous nation, with over 1.4 billion people. India is known for its cultural diversity, rich heritage, and landmarks like the Taj Mahal. The country has a fast-growing economy, driven by sectors like IT, manufacturing, and agriculture. Indian television shows, music, and literature have gained popularity abroad. A comparative analysis of Chinese and Indian Soft Power reveal that China’s soft power strategy is more cohesive than that of India. China excels in cultural initiatives, fostering people-to-people exchanges, attracting international students from various backgrounds, and presenting itself as a progressive and resilient economy. In contrast, India holds an advantage in projecting an image of a nation with a dynamic civil society and a robust democratic framework The U.S. leads in soft power with global cultural dominance through Hollywood, technology, and democratic values. China leverages economic diplomacy, the Belt and Road Initiative, and cultural programs to enhance influence, especially in the Global South. India capitalizes on its rich cultural heritage, spirituality, and growing IT and education sectors. The UK relies on its historical legacy, English language, and prestigious educational institutions, though its influence has slightly diminished post-Brexit. Japan is globally known for its technological advancements and democratic nation. Japan is home to some of the most innovative and renowned technology companies in the world, each contributing uniquely to global industries. Several companies such as Sony, Toyota, Panasonic, Toshiba, Hitachi and Canon symbolize Japan’s commitment to innovation, quality, and technological progress, earning a worldwide prominent with its soft power. Nuclear diplomacy in South Asia is an example of soft power development. Both India and Pakistan are nuclear powers in the South Asian region. Thus, every nation employs distinct soft power strategies, tools and resources that reflect its cultural, social, economic, and political contexts. In 2007, Chinese President Hu Jintao told the 17th Congress of the Chinese Communist Party that they needed to invest more in soft power, and this continued under President Xi Jinping. China’s success story in the economic domain was prominently noticeable when its GDP growth rate averaged 10.5% between 2001 and 2010. Yet, China ‘lags behind the United States in overall attractiveness in most parts of the world, including Asia’ (Nye 2021, p. 205). China is an advocate of multilateralism at the global stage. As a result, the Asian Infrastructure and Investment Bank (AIIB) stands as a significant milestone for Chinese multilateralism, representing China’s successful endeavors to establish a complementary institution to the World Bank. China is a member of The BRICS includes 9 countries - Brazil, China, Egypt, Ethiopia, India, Iran, Russian Federation, South Africa, United Arab Emirates. Another Chinese example of multilateralism is the creation of Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO). The SCO is a permanent intergovernmental international organization established on June 15, 2001, in Shanghai (PRC) by the Republic of Kazakhstan, the People's Republic of China, the Kyrgyz Republic, the Russian Federation, the Republic of Tajikistan and the Republic of Uzbekistan. In Africa, only South Africa and Nigeria consistently display the regional power feature of an Afrocentric foreign policy posture woven around sufficient material preponderance and strong soft power influence. In terms of territory, resource and population, Nigeria is a large country in Africa. China has made huge hard and soft power investments in African states like Nigeria. Conclusion This article argues that China has had mixed success with its soft power strategy in Bangladesh. It explained a few weaknesses or pitfalls of China’s soft power image in Bangladesh: negative portrayal of the Chinese BRI, debt trap discourse and cultural barrier; especially through the Chinese Mandarin language. China's soft power strategy in Bangladesh focuses on fostering goodwill and strengthening bilateral ties through cultural, social and economic initiatives. Key elements include public diplomacy, such as promoting language and cultural exchange through Confucius Institutes, and educational scholarships for Bangladeshi students. Economically, China leverages its BRI to finance major infrastructure projects and deepen trade relations, further enhanced by offering tariff-free access to Bangladeshi products. China emphasizes people-to-people connections through exchange programs and development assistance, portraying itself as a reliable partner in Bangladesh’s growth. This strategy complements China’s hard power investments, aiming to solidify its influence in the South Asian region amid competition from other regional and global powers like India, Japan and the U.S. Chinese soft power in Bangladesh is indeed a shared interest rather than a debt trap.

Is Peace Possible Today? – OpEd	In this Christmas season, with its connotations of peace and goodwill to all people, and the New Year, when one traditionally comes up with ‘resolutions’ for the year ahead, with the intention of compensating for mistakes made during the past year, and of initiating creative projects for the future, one has to ask: is all of this just Heideggerian ‘idle talk,’ or is peace a realistic possibility? This seems to be an easy question to answer. Despite President-elect Donald Trump’s repeated assurance that he would bring about an end to the war in Ukraine, it is by no means certain that he would be able to do that, not only because his enemies, both in the US and abroad, are heavily invested in keeping the war going at all costs, but also in light of the improbability that President Vladimir Putin of Russia would be a pushover when it comes to conditions for a peace agreement. Such an arrangement would suit Ukraine and NATO very well, insofar as it would provide them with the opportunity to rearm and recruit more soldiers for the likely recommencement of hostilities in the future – something that was done before (after the 2014-2015 Minsk agreements), as Angela Merkel and Francois Hollande have admitted. Besides, that this is not a novel tactic, and a disingenuous one to boot, should be evident, as Immanuel Kant knew in the 18th century already, when he wrote his famous essay on the conditions for ‘perpetual peace,’ on which I have elaborated before. I am thinking of a specific condition stated in this essay, in the very first of the ‘preliminary articles,’ which reads: ‘No treaty of peace shall be regarded as valid, if made with the secret reservation of material for a future war.’ Kant’s elaboration on this article shows that he was not sufficiently shortsighted to confuse peace with ‘a mere truce, a mere suspension of hostilities’ – possibly to gain valuable time for strengthening one’s military to recover after relinquishing some of their capabilities in battle. The article is therefore clearly aimed at preventing any ‘mental reservation’ of demands to be used as casus belli to be revitalised on a more auspicious occasion in the future. This is essentially what was done before, as acknowledged by Merkel and Hollande in the RT article linked above, which reported that ‘…former German chancellor Angela Merkel [who] described the Minsk accords in December [2014/2015] as ‘an attempt to give Ukraine time’ to build up its armed forces.’ That Vladimir Putin is not as ingenuous as to fall for such a ruse again – in the guise of the imposition of a temporary ‘freeze’ on military activities in Ukraine – is obvious, however, where RT reports that: Moscow has repeatedly ruled out freezing the conflict, stressing that all the goals of its military operation, including Ukraine’s neutrality, demilitarization and denazification, must be met. Russian President Vladimir Putin said this summer that Moscow would immediately declare a ceasefire and start peace talks once Kiev withdraws troops from all Russian territories, including the Donetsk and Lugansk republics, and Kherson and Zaporozhye regions. Furthermore, the prospects of peace are bedevilled by the non-military actions of NATO against Russia. This is amply demonstrated by the recent murder of Russian General Igor Kirillov and his aide, Major Ilya Polikarpov, by means of a remotely controlled explosive device outside of Kirillov’s Moscow apartment. This is bound to aggravate, rather than ameliorate, the conflict, given that it is not part of conventional military operations. The reasons for NATO resorting to such terrorist actions become clearer where Strategic Culture Foundation reports, in a manner that one would not find in any mainstream news outlets, that: Since 2017, Kirillov served as the Chief of Russia’s Radiological, Chemical and Biological Defense Forces. He was assigned to protect the Russian nation from weapons of mass destruction. Since Russia launched its special military operation in Ukraine to neutralize NATO-backed aggression, Kirillov’s team of investigators uncovered an alleged network of bioweapons laboratories in Ukraine run by the Pentagon. The Russian allegations appeared to be based on intercepted classified U.S. documents that confirmed the operation of bioweapons labs. Kirillov’s presentations and detailed reports caused international alarm about sinister Pentagon involvement in producing biological weapons of mass destruction. According to the Russian investigations, the bioweapons programs were authorized by the Obama and Biden administrations. The programs also involved major U.S. pharmaceutical, engineering and financial companies in a clandestine operation. For the United States, this controversial work by Kirillov and his team was a source of huge embarrassment, although the Western media brusquely dismissed it as ‘Kremlin disinformation.’ It purportedly exposed Washington as being implicated in a systematic bioterrorism project facilitated by a NeoNazi regime that believes in the genocidal destruction of Russia – as its Third Reich forebears did. The discovery of an alleged U.S. bioweapons industry in Ukraine made Lt. Gen. Kirillov a priority target. Former CIA analyst Larry Johnson opines that it was this background that resulted in his murder. Other commentators have claimed that the assassination was aimed at killing the truth about the alleged U.S. bioweapons program. Then, of course, apart from Ukraine there is the situation in and around Syria, which has changed fundamentally (compared to what had existed there before), in a very short time, when Islamist ‘terrorists’ recently carried out a Blitzkrieg, ousting Bashar al-Assad and imposing Islamic rule. With Assad having been given asylum in Russia, the previously secular Islamic Syria – where Jews, Muslims, and Christians co-existed in relative peace – seems to be gone forever, and rather than improving the prospects of peace in the region, it seems to be the other way around, as former weapons inspector Scott Ritter explains in conversation with Clayton Morris. The gist of Ritter’s explanation of the geopolitical implications of the whirlwind regime change in Syria, if I understand him correctly, is that it has been a major blow to the ‘axis of resistance’ (of Iran, Hamas, and Hezbollah) by the Israel-American alliance in the region, insofar as Syria used to provide a lifeline of sorts to Hezbollah, located in Lebanon (and Hamas, in Gaza). That no longer exists, leaving the door wide open for both Israel and Turkey – which have been major backers of the Jihadist takeover of Syria – to pursue expansionist goals, with the probable aim of occupying, and possibly incorporating, parts of the former Syria into their own territory. The upshot of all of this as far as prospects of peace in the region are concerned is anything but reassuring, even if one ignores the ongoing conflict in Gaza – which, according to Ritter, has been largely ignored by the world since the military incursion into and conquest of Syria began. What he has in mind is the position of Iran, which is much better armed than most people seem to think, and which is very close to being able to produce nuclear weapons. This, Ritter believes, is what creates the alarming possibility of a ‘pre-emptive’ strike against Iran by the US, and given the unpredictability of the Biden regime – specifically of Anthony Blinken – in this regard, he is not willing to rule something like this out. However, he does believe that, once President-elect Donald Trump is in the White House, the latter would probably pursue a diplomatic resolution regarding Iran’s capability of becoming a nuclear power (parallel to the hands-on diplomacy that Trump practiced with Kim Jong-Un of North Korea). In light of the information outlined above, together with relevant evidence, one would be forgiven for being pessimistic about Kant’s hope, more than two centuries ago, for an ‘everlasting peace’ among nations (discussed at length in the article linked earlier) sometime in the future. Given the current events of a bellicose nature, discussed above, this is undeniable, and when one scrutinises the three ‘Definitive Articles’ identified by Kant in his peace essay, which would (ideally) provide a foundation on which to build ‘lasting peace,’ and not only a ‘termination of hostilities,’ this is only reinforced. These articles are, first, ‘The civil constitution of all states shall be republican,’ which articulates Kant’s belief, that it is the ‘only constitution which has its origin in the idea of the original contract, upon which the lawful legislation of every nation must be based.’ This constitution is in accordance with the liberty of citizens as human beings; and such freedom depends on shared legislation, and on their equality as citizens. The reason why it is, for Kant, the only constitution that can prepare the way to ‘perpetual peace,’ is that it requires the agreement of citizens before the ‘bad business’ of war can be initiated. Although it is the case, today, that most countries in the world are ‘republican’ in the sense of being representative, instead of ‘direct’ democracies, evidence suggests that, in allowing financial, material, and advisory assistance to Ukraine in the current conflict, the US has circumvented the principle that, as representatives of the American people, Congress has the sole right to declare war against a perceived enemy. This has not been done. Moreover, because American taxpayer funds and military personnel have been utilised in the Ukrainian military conflict, the American public has arguably been implicated in it. The second ‘definitive article,’ namely, ‘The law of nations shall be founded on a federation of free states,’ is essential for enduring peace because such a federation, where states would be subject to federal laws, is comparable to a state with a republican constitution. Nonetheless, when comparing current events in Ukraine and Syria with Kant’s expectations regarding the role of a ‘federation of states’ in the promotion of peace, the UN Preamble rings somewhat hollow. The third of the ‘definitive articles’ named by Kant, to wit, ‘The rights of men, as citizens of the world, shall be limited to conditions of universal hospitality’ is virtually unthinkable today. Needless to spell out, ‘universal hospitality’ does not obtain in the world of the 21st century; on the contrary, virtually everywhere that one travels, you are subjected to stringent requirements before entry into a ‘foreign’ country is granted. Therefore, judging contemporary events related to the ongoing military conflict in Ukraine and Syria against Kant’s requirements for lasting peace, it is obvious that the present seems to be further than ever from the possible actualisation of such ‘perpetual’ peace.

Senator Chris Coons And The Cult Of Patent Monopolies – OpEd	Last week, Delaware Senator Chris Coons, the chair of the Senate Subcommittee on Intellectual Property, made an assertion about the nature of patents that is flat out wrong. Senator Coons said: 'OUR FOUNDING FATHERS MADE IT CLEAR THAT INVENTORS SHOULD HAVE EXCLUSIVE RIGHTS TO THEIR INVENTIONS. IN OTHER WORDS, THE CONSTITUTION IN ITS SCRIPT GUARANTEES TO INVENTORS THE ABILITY TO PREVENT OTHERS FROM USING OR SELLING THEIR INVENTIONS WITHOUT THEIR PERMISSION.' This assertion is directly at odds with what the constitution explicitly says. The constitution absolutely does not provide any guarantees to inventors about exclusive use of their inventions. The wording that provides the basis for government-granted patent and copyright monopolies can be found in Article 1, Section 8, where the Constitution lays out the powers of Congress. 'The Congress shall have Power To lay and collect Taxes, Duties, Imposts and Excises, to pay the Debts and provide for the common Defence and general Welfare of the United States; but all Duties, Imposts and Excises shall be uniform throughout the United States; …. 'To promote the Progress of Science and useful Arts, by securing for limited Times to Authors and Inventors the exclusive Right to their respective Writings and Discoveries;' The granting of patent and copyright monopolies is a power of Congress, like the power to tax and the power to declare war. Patent and copyright monopolies are not a right granted to individuals, like the right to free speech or the right to practice the religion of one’s choosing. Rights Versus Policy This is not just a gotcha where Senator Coon has inaccurately described the wording in the constitution, the mistake matters hugely for how we think about patents and copyrights. As Senator Coon has described the constitutional wording, Congress is obligated to provide patent and/or copyright monopoles to allow people the opportunity to profit from their inventions. The actual wording in the Constitution says that Congress has the power to grant these monopolies as a way to promote innovation and creative work. It no more has obligation to grant patent and copyright monopolies than it has an obligation to impose taxes and declare wars. Furthermore, the Constitutional language says nothing about the length or strength of these monopolies. Presumably, Congress would look to structure them in a way that it deems most efficient for the purpose of promoting innovation and creative work. If we recognize that patents and copyrights are simply one set of policies for promoting innovation and creative work, and not an individual right, then we can ask questions like whether they are the best policy. As I and others have argued, there is good reason to believe they are often not the best policy. This especially the case with prescription drugs and medical devices. We will spend over$650 billion this year for pharmaceutical products that would likely cost us around $100 billion in a free market without patent monopolies. This difference between the patent protected price and the free market prices comes to more than $4,000 a year for an average family. It also creates the absurd situation where people with serious health conditions may be looking at paying tens or even hundreds of thousands of dollars for drugs that would sell for a few hundred dollars in a free market. And the enormous profits created by patent monopolies gives drug companies a huge incentive to mislead doctors and the public about the safety and effectiveness of their products. We very much need to have a serious discussion about the relative merits of patent and copyright monopolies as mechanisms for supporting innovation and creative work. (I discuss alternatives in chapter 5 of Rigged. [It’s free.]) But that discussion cannot take place as long as we have prominent senators like Chris Coon blatantly misrepresenting the Constitution’s wording on intellectual property. Unfortunately, our public debate is so skewed by the people who benefit from these government policies, that Senator Coon’s misrepresentation will likely go unnoted by almost everyone. Needless to say, the Senator is not likely to feel any obligation to correct his mistake.

Queenstown As Low-Carbon City Of Conservation And Efficiency – An...	By Liu Lidan ANBOUND's founder Mr. Kung Chan has recently pointed out that the global issue of climate change is gradually evolving from a scientific matter into a political movement. China's response to global climate change should start from a 'Chinese green perspective' and actively build a Chinese green cultural movement. Moreover, China should help the world understand its perspective on climate change better. The core strategies for China's climate change response are 'conservation' and 'efficiency,' which are quite helpful in mitigating the large-scale cost increases associated with addressing climate change. These cost increases, which have led to inflation, have already become very evident in the United States and Europe. In terms of implementation, China's green perspective should focus on 'energy-saving and emission reduction' reinvestment and reconstruction as the main feature, contributing to global climate change efforts. This should especially become a key focus of the 14th Five-Year Plan. Regarding urban development, centered around China's green perspective and the Pedestrian-Oriented Development (POD) principle, urban renewal should be based on 'conservation and efficiency'. Large-scale renovations aimed at energy saving and emission reduction can create substantial investments and GDP, promoting urban economic growth and making cities more livable. In this regard, some cities like Shanghai have already been promoting planning transformation, although comprehensive and effective strategic policy support has not yet been fully established. By contrast, some cities in other countries, through recent explorations, have developed strategic concepts and progress in low-carbon urban construction. They are achieving more sustainable local development methods with 'conservation and efficiency' at their core. For example, Queenstown, New Zealand, has applied ANBOUND's POD principle along with the 'conservation and efficiency' perspective to develop and practice its 'carbon-zero visitor economy', helping the city's development and tourism industry undergo a low-carbon transformation. Located in the Otago region of New Zealand's South Island, Queenstown has been developing its adventure sports tourism economy around its stunning lake and mountain landscapes since the 1960s. The region is one of the most popular destinations in New Zealand, and tourism has become a driving force behind its economic development. In 2020, tourism accounted for 39% of the town's GDP and 52% of total employment. In 2023, nearly 400,000 international visitors came to Queenstown, nearly 20% more than in 2019 before the outbreak of the pandemic, while the town's permanent population is only around 50,000. As climate change and environmental issues have become increasingly severe, coupled with the continuous rise in the number of visitors, Queenstown has realized that the old model of expansion has led to massive energy consumption and is unsustainable. In order to protect the local natural environment and improve the quality of life for its community, Queenstown decided to develop its tourism industry in a more sustainable way and set an ambitious goal: to become the world's first destination to fully achieve a 'carbon-zero visitor economy' by 2030. In 2021, the Destination Queenstown, Queenstown Lakes District Council, and Lake Wānaka Tourism proposed this plan, which has garnered support from tourism operators and local residents. The plan, from concept to implementation, fully embodies the POD principle and the 'conservation and efficiency' green perspective proposed by ANBOUND. First, Queenstown is gradually introducing low-carbon and renewable energy tourism projects, innovatively organizing investments and consumption within the tourism industry. A key strategy is the promotion of electric public transportation, along with the development of a comprehensive network of walking paths and bike lanes, creating a 'slow-moving' transportation system. This design not only reduces carbon emissions but also promotes economic activities and social interactions within the community, reflecting the POD principle that advocates for the creation of vibrant, pedestrian-centered urban hubs. Specifically, by 2030, it is expected that visitors arriving in Queenstown, possibly on an electric aircraft operated by Air New Zealand, will then take an electric gondola or a hydro-powered ferry to cross the town's famous glacial lake, Lake Wakatipu, to reach the town center. With the increasing influx of visitors during the winter season, skiers will be able to take an electric gondola to the mountaintops of nearby ski resorts. Additionally, the world's first fully electric jet boat will begin operating on Lake Manapouri from early 2025, powered entirely by batteries. This Swedish-designed electric jet boat is expected to reduce carbon emissions by over 240 tons annually, equivalent to removing 52 gasoline cars from the road. The local dock has recently been upgraded to provide electric jet boat charging services for all watercraft users. Moreover, the region has developed 130 kilometers of bike trails, stretching along the edge of Lake Wakatipu and extending into remote areas outside the town. Some of these trails cross swaying suspension bridges over the emerald-green Kawarau River, making Queenstown a globally recognized cycling destination. By 2026, it is expected that cycling tourism will account for 50% of the region's tourism economy, surpassing the carbon-intensive ski tourism that currently dominates the area. At the same time, Queenstown is undertaking green and low-carbon urban renewal initiatives aimed at energy conservation and emission reduction. This allows tourists to enjoy eco-friendly travel while experiencing the region's rich history and culture. This aligns with ANBOUND's 'conservation and efficiency' green perspective and the POD principle, which advocates for 'preserving historical context and passing down the city's cultural memory in urban renewal'. In Queenstown, the Sherwood Queenstown, a hotel with a 40-year history, was renovated and ranked by Expedia as one of the top 10 eco-friendly hotels in 2019. The motel is almost entirely powered by 248 solar panels, and a full-time gardener grows nearly half of the hotel's restaurant produce on a hillside overlooking Lake Wakatipu. All food waste at Sherwood is turned into compost, which is then used to grow more food, creating a cycle of waste management and resource utilization. Additionally, RealNZ, a tourism experience company, is working to decarbonize one of Queenstown's most popular adventure activities, the 112-year-old coal-fired ship TSS Earnslaw. This ensures that the TSS Earnslaw, which has been carrying day-trippers since the 1970s, retains its historical features during the refurbishment while adopting environmentally friendly fuels, such as hydrogen. This integration of new and old elements with a focus on energy conservation and emission reduction not only makes Queenstown a contributor to environmental protection but also helps maintain the city's unique cultural charm. In addition, as Queenstown promotes its zero-carbon tourism economy, it focuses on resource conservation and efficient utilization to achieve energy saving and emission reduction. Local tourism operators are actively promoting the implementation of green building standards, particularly in key tourism facilities such as hotels and resorts, where energy-efficient designs and equipment are extensively used to reduce the energy consumption of buildings and facilities. This aligns with ANBOUND's core principles of 'conservation and efficiency'. For example, the Headwaters Eco Lodge in Queenstown is the world's first accommodation facility to receive the Living Building Challenge certification. Located in the picturesque village of Glenorchy, a 45-minute drive west of Queenstown, the lodge is surrounded by the Southern Alps and winding river valleys. It is built entirely using regenerative building materials. The lodge uses the world's most advanced composting toilets, and every liter of wastewater irrigates the vast wetland in the center of the property. All of the lodge's electricity comes from one of the largest solar gardens on the South Island, which includes nearly 600 solar panels. The energy generated is so substantial that excess power is used to supply another business on the nearby road. This architectural design not only meets functional requirements but is also environmentally friendly, perfectly integrating with the natural surroundings. It fully embodies the POD principle, which emphasizes prioritizing environmental space and ensuring that buildings harmoniously coexist with the urban environment. Finally, the transformation of Queenstown's tourism industry is dedicated to promoting low-carbon and high-efficiency tourism models, avoiding excessive development and consumption of land and infrastructure. This also reflects the POD principle, which emphasizes selecting industries based on the carrying capacity of social resources and developing the economy while preventing environmental degradation. In Queenstown, innovations like the fully electric jet boat provide opportunities for economic diversification. Many New Zealand manufacturers have participated in this project, and the jet boat industry is rapidly emerging globally. Queenstown's zero-carbon tourism economy plan aims to upgrade industries and renew the city with energy-saving and emission-reduction goals, with its economic benefits far outweighing those derived from traditional tourist spending. Final analysis conclusion: Queenstown demonstrates its commitment to achieving a zero-carbon tourism economy by promoting electric and hydrogen-powered public transportation, supporting eco-friendly accommodation facilities, green renovating existing infrastructure, implementing waste management, and utilizing renewable energy. With comprehensive strategic policy support, widespread community participation, and technological innovation, the town is on track to meet its zero-carbon tourism goal. The development approach focuses on driving industrial upgrades and urban renewal with energy-saving and emission-reduction objectives, ensuring that economic development and environmental protection progress sustainably in balance. Ultimately, this will help Queenstown realize its goal of becoming the world capital of ecotourism.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWeSAohndYMaVNhVaL_UTFh6	2024-12-27T16:27:15-08:00	
Tariffs Won’t Save The US Dollar – OpEd	By Vincent Cook In a November 30 Truth Social post, President-elect Trump threatened BRICS states—Brazil, Russia, India, China, South Africa, Iran, Ethiopia, Egypt, and the United Arab Emirates, plus more states in the process of joining—with 100 percent tariffs on their exports to America if they dared to attempt replacing the US dollar as an international trade currency: 'The idea that the BRICS Countries are trying to move away from the Dollar while we stand by and watch is OVER. We require a commitment from these Countries that they will neither create a new BRICS Currency, nor back any other Currency to replace the mighty U.S. Dollar or, they will face 100 percent Tariffs, and should expect to say goodbye to selling into the wonderful U.S. Economy. They can go find another 'sucker!' There is no chance that the BRICS will replace the U.S. Dollar in International Trade, and any Country that tries should wave goodbye to America.' When one examines international trade data in detail, however, some curious anomalies in Trump’s statements become evident. For one thing, the world needs the BRICS economies for both merchandise exports and imports far more than the world needs America. China (including Hong Kong) all by itself is a bigger importer and far bigger exporter of goods than America. America only accounts for 13 percent of the world’s merchandise imports and less than 9 percent of its merchandise exports. If the world’s economy were to fragment into rival currency/trade blocs, most countries outside of North America would regard access to BRICS markets, not to America’s markets, as being a higher priority. A NAFTA bloc and its US dollar would be competing on unfavorable terms with a BRICS bloc, a Euro bloc, and maybe a Japanese-led bloc for access to the natural resources and other factors of the less-industrialized countries. Fears of being cut off from natural resources, in turn, incentivizes hostile blocs to turn into hostile military alliances, and for their trade and currency wars to turn into world wars. For another thing, Trump’s threats mean nothing to states that are already under severe sanctions like Russia and Iran. They export practically nothing to America. It is Chinese manufacturers who have the most to lose by the BRICS bloc antagonizing Trump, with their annual export revenues on the order of $450 billion at stake (about 3/4ths of all BRICS exports to America). However, Chinese dictator Xi has undoubtedly calculated that China’s economy is likely going to be targeted by American statists anyway, so he has every incentive to preemptively create a sanctions-proof international medium of exchange in spite of risks to export markets, just as BRICS has already created an independent wire payments system and an independent multinational credit institution to bypass American-aligned institutions. Trump’s brazen threat only provides more evidence that the American government is not a trustworthy steward of an international monetary system, and thus makes migration away from a dollar-dominated system towards some sort of alternative money even more urgent and compelling for every state that fears arousing Washington’s ire. Yet another odd thing about Trump’s threat is that trade barriers hurt Americans as well as foreigners. It is not simply that case that big box retailers are filled from floor to ceiling with inexpensive Chinese-made consumer goods that Americans can’t seem to get enough of. The data show that China is a critical supplier of electronics and machinery too, something which American businesses depend heavily on for their own productivity. Tariffs do nothing to address the root causes of America’s deindustrialization, but suddenly cutting off access to Chinese-made capital goods and forcing diversions of scarce inputs to sectors where America lacks comparative advantages to make up for lost imports means tremendous losses of productivity and real incomes for American workers. Tariffs can certainly accelerate the deindustrialization process and the decline of the middle class and make dollar-denominated accounts and assets even more unattractive to foreigners. Carrying out Trump’s threat would be spectacularly counterproductive for the Americans who voted for Trump. To be sure, a fragmentation of the world’s economy into rival blocs hurts everyone, not just Americans, so Trump’s threat might just be a bluff to gain an advantage in trade negotiations, and won’t do any real damage unless his bluff gets called. Even as a mere negotiating ploy, Trump’s demands don’t make sense. What Trump doesn’t seem to understand is that the continual creation of fiat dollars and dollar substitutes out of thin air hurts everyone too. Continued dependency of the world on fiat dollars is not an acceptable outcome, not even for Americans. Using threats of economic chaos to try to keep the current failing system in place is madness. Not only are America’s predatory elites (who happen to be fiercely anti-Trump) ruthlessly exploiting the entire world with what former French President Valéry Giscard d’Estaing famously called the American government’s 'exorbitant privilege' of fiat dollar creation to commandeer the productivity of others, the use of dollar-denominated US Treasury securities as the principal reserve asset for the world’s banking system means that this system is at risk of a catastrophic collapse in the event of a dollar hyperinflation. The dollar’s role as the leading trade currency is a mere byproduct of the foreign demand for dollar-denominated US Treasury securities. It is this dubious choice of reserve asset as a substitute for gold that poses an existential hyperinflationary threat to the entire global monetary system. With the fiat US dollar having lost well over 98 percent of its purchasing power in terms of gold since President Nixon cut the last links to gold in 1971, calling it 'mighty' as Trump did, is a gross exaggeration. The US dollar in its current form is not mighty, it is an absolute disgrace. It is doomed to failure even without an overt challenge from the BRICS states. Some heavy fiscal distress followed by a sudden loss of confidence in our ever-inflating dollar would be quite sufficient to bring it down and all dollar-dependent currencies along with it. A dollar hyperinflation under the present system is the single greatest man-made risk threatening the continuity of civilization apart from a nuclear war. Imagine a world where all the world’s supply chains are broken and even the 'essential businesses' are all shut down everywhere due to all money becoming worthless. Instead of vainly defending the fragile monetary status quo with threats of economic destructionism, Trump should be leading America—and as much of the rest of the world as he can—away from the fiat dollar and back towards a decentralized gold standard, or better yet, towards an improved, decentralized gold standard that is coupled to a 100 percent reserve rule for all risk-free money substitutes. Americans too need a better form of money than the fiat dollar. To the extent that America’s enemies can find a way to escape a failing fiat dollar by turning towards some sort of basket of gold and fiat currencies, is it wise for America not to implement an even better gold-based monetary reform of its own, and encourage its allies to do the same? Instead of fearing international monetary competition and attempting to hide from it, why not try to win the competition by coming up with an even better form of money? While many economists outside the Austrian school may scoff at calls for sound money and concerns about hyperinflation risks, it is curious that their misguided allegiance to 'empirical' and econometric methods has not led them ponder the dreadful history of the hundreds of fiat money experiments that have been tried and have invariably failed over the past millennium, beginning with the very first example of a fiat currency dating from exactly 1,000 years ago in China. Surely even those who are immune to the indisputable logic of purposeful action must concede that, in all the historical records available to us, tariffs and other more severe interventions have never been successful in saving fiat monies from the scourge of continual depreciations (usually over a span of decades) followed by utter oblivion and economy-wide chaos. Only a transition back to precious metals has ever averted a hyperinflationary disaster. There isn’t the slightest indication that the dollar differs from these historical precedents in any important respect, aside from the fact that the threat of monetary destruction is now universal. A restoration of gold backing for the dollar, not tariffs, is the only viable plan for making the US dollar great again.

With Trump Again Talking About Greenland, Moscow Focusing On Faer...	Two Danish possessions in the north Atlantic, Greenland and the Faroe Islands, are attracting increasing attention in Washington, where President-elect Donald Trump has again suggested that he would like the US to acquire the former, and in Moscow, where a well-connected commentator suggests the Kremlin is now focusing on the Faeroes. During his earlier term in office, Trump said he would like to acquire Greenland from Denmark. Although Copenhagen rejected the idea, Moscow focused on it as a potential threat to Russian interests (windowoneurasia2.blogspot.com/2020/05/us-wants-greenland-as-second-alaska.html, windowoneurasia2.blogspot.com/2023/05/moscow-sees-greenlands-moves-toward.html, jamestown.org/program/greenland-set-to-become-cockpit-of-controversy-between-east-and-west/ and jamestown.org/program/russia-expects-growing-conflict-with-us-over-greenland/). Until Trump was again elected and again spoke about acquiring Greenland, Moscow focused more on other islands in the North Atlantic and the Baltic Sea as places of Russian interest (jamestown.org/program/moscow-focusing-on-gotland-and-other-baltic-sea-islands-as-potential-targets/, jamestown.org/program/spitzbergen-a-new-hotspot-in-the-cold-north-between-russia-and-the-west/ and jamestown.org/program/moscows-first-move-against-nato-could-take-place-in-norways-svalbard-archipelago/). While Spitzbergen, Gotland, and the Aaland Islams received more Russian attention, Moscow occasionally focused on the Faroes, an autonomous Danish possession between Scandinavia and Iceland that has been more willing to continue to cooperate with (windowoneurasia2.blogspot.com/2023/05/the-faroe-islands-autonomous-part-of.html). In a new article, Moscow security commentator Aleksey Chichkin says that Russia is interested in continuing its close cooperation with the autonomous Faroes because the autonomous region of 1400 square kilometers and 53,000 people wants to do so as well (stoletie.ru/rossiya_i_mir/farery_poshhochina_jes_702.htm). Because it is autonomous, the Faroe Islands are not part of the EU and have not gone along with the EU and Denmark in imposing sanctions on Russia after the Anschluss of Crimea and Putin’s launch of the expanded invasion of Ukraine in 2022. Instead, they have worked to expand trade and fishing rights with Russia. Some in Denmark, the Faroes and Russia see this as presaging an eventual move toward independence by the Faroe Islands and suggest that events during World War II set the stage for that. Not only did the two Danish territories refuse to surrender to Germany after the latter’s occupation of Denmark, but Iceland moved to acquire independence from Copenhagen. Chichkin suggests that the Faroes could follow the same course now, a possibility that would likely increase if Russian assistance to the Faroes fishing industry expands and American interest in Greenland does as well. Were that to happen, it would likely give Russia expanded leverage over the North Atlantic as well as the entrance to the Northern Sea Route. Consequently, a place few in most of the countries of the West have ever heard of except for its salmon may now be on its way to becoming a cockpit of conflict between Russia, on the one hand, and the West, on the other, especially given the Kremlin’s current interest in expanding its position in these and other islands in the region.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWeSAohndYMaVJA77tKuim5g	2024-12-27T16:19:08-08:00	
The Evolution Of Baltic Military Divisions – Analysis	By Lukas Milevski (FPRI) -- Ten years ago in 2014, Baltic defense was paltry. The defense budgets of the three Baltic states, but especially Latvia and Lithuania, were suffering from the financial crisis of 2008, and their armies were all negligible. Baltic defense was measured in battalions of about 400-1,000 men, while trying to form brigade-sized forces of 3,000-5,000. Alliance contributions were minimal. In the aftermath of the Russian invasion of Crimea, the US deployed mere companies to the Baltic states; after the 2014 Wales and 2016 Warsaw Summits, NATO finally deployed battalion-sized battlegroups. Compared to the Russian hordes across the border, force sizes were limited. Yet now, with Russian forces in the Baltic region largely drawn away to fight and die in Ukraine, defense forces in the Baltic states have become ever larger and can be measured not in battalions, nor even brigades, but in divisions: Each Baltic state is defended by at least one division. It is worth exploring what this looks like and what it means. One must first understand what a division as a military formation actually is. Critically, there is no single divisional template; divisions are structured differently among countries and even within the same country. Moreover, because countries can vary even in the structure of their basic infantry squads, it is important not to overanalyze when discussing divisions. Rather than trying to account for any division, down to the numbers of individual soldiers and the quality and quantity of their equipment, the vehicles a division operates, and so on, the focus should be mostly on the subunits which report directly to divisional headquarters and the kinds of military assets they essentially represent. For example, the US 1st Infantry Division fields two armored brigade combat teams, each with a cavalry regiment, an infantry regiment, two armored regiments, as well as engineer and support battalions; two regiments of artillery; a combat aviation brigade; and a logistics brigade. The US 1st Cavalry Division similarly fields three armored brigade combat teams; divisional artillery, including a battalion of air defense; a combat aviation brigade; and a logistics brigade. The German 1st Panzer Division fields two armored brigades, two mechanized infantry brigades (one of which is Dutch), as well as artillery, signals, engineer, and support battalions. The key points ultimately are: 1) these are large formations, often much closer to 20,000 than 10,000 soldiers, if not over 20,000; 2) divisional headquarters do not just command frontline brigades but also organically oversee and coordinate artillery, air defense, engineers, signals, and logistics assets as well. The real tests of a division’s capabilities lie in both its size and its breadth of organic assets. Estonia, the smallest of the Baltic states, has been in the process of establishing its own — purely Estonian — division since December 2022. Its order of battle comprises two relatively light infantry brigades, a headquarters and signal battalion, and artillery, logistics, and ISTAR (Intelligence, Surveillance, Target Acquisition, and Reconnaissance) battalions. The second infantry brigade is as yet incomplete and would have to be filled with reservists in case of war, while the first brigade is rather more substantial and organically includes even air defense and engineer battalions, as well as an anti-tank company. It is anticipated that in the event of war in the Baltic, one British armored brigade combat team (either 12th or 20th) from the British 3rd Division would also be deployed to Estonia under the operational command of the 1st Estonian Division, besides other NATO enhanced forward presence units in the country. Unlike its northern and southern neighbors, Latvia does not aim to field a national division but already since 2019 has instead contributed to a multinational division, MND North, with Denmark and Estonia, and has remained committed to it. It is therefore the oldest division set up for Baltic defense and as such its headquarters were certified by NATO as operationally ready in July 2023. However, its force structure does not appear to be publicly available. It should include two brigades, the Latvian mechanized infantry brigade and the Canadian-led enhanced forward presence brigade, the latter of which should achieve full brigade-level operationally-ready status by 2026. Yet MND North has additionally become the formal affiliation of the 1st Danish Brigade, which is gearing up to be operationally ready, but it is still unclear how this brigade may eventually fit into divisional operations in Baltic defense, if at all. The Latvian army has artillery, combat support, and combat service support units at battalion level, which presumably would also fall under divisional command, while heavy armor is provided by two squadrons of Leopard 2s, one Polish and one Canadian. A Lithuanian national division has been an ambition of the Lithuanian Ministry of Defense since the 1990s. Serious realization of this vision has received impetus only from Russia’s full scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, with the intention being to bring it to operationally ready status by 2030, which will require substantial investment to achieve. The division will be created around the three existing Lithuanian infantry brigades, of which the first is a complete mechanized infantry brigade, the second is incomplete and light, and the third, as described in early 2023, is 'just a name and a flag.' The Lithuanian division also needs substantial investment into the various other assets that divisional command entails and requires, including air defense, more artillery, and tanks, among other critical capabilities. The intended size of the division is about 17,500 soldiers. A heavy German armored brigade is expected to be permanently deployed and operational in Lithuania by 2027 and will incorporate the existing enhanced forward presence forces, but as part of Germany’s 10th Armored Division, rather than slotting into the host’s national division like the British armored brigade combat team in Estonia or the Canadian-led brigade group into MND North in Latvia. Given strenuous national efforts and NATO allies expanding their enhanced forward presence, Baltic defense is on a better footing than it ever has been since the three countries regained independence in 1990-91. Yet the divisions they are deploying or planning to deploy remain substantially works in progress, substantially light infantry, and with comparatively few combat support enablers compared to what observation of the on-going warfare in Ukraine suggests they may need to fight the Russians. The heavier elements mostly derive from allied forces, and here Latvia will be somewhat disadvantaged compared to its two neighbors, each of which would have — at the very least, eventually — an entire allied armored brigade in-country while Latvia will not. Moreover, each Baltic state has further light infantry forces in its national guard or defense league units, which apparently are not intended to be folded under divisional command. Ultimately, much work remains to be done, as reflected by all three Baltic states currently expanding their respective defense budgets significantly to well over 3% of GDP.

China Approves Construction Of Mega-Dam In Tibet	China is moving ahead with plans to build the world’s largest hydropower dam on Tibet’s longest river despite environmental, water security and displacement concerns raised by India, Bangladesh and Tibetan rights groups. The Chinese government granted approval to build the Medog Hydropower Station on the lower reaches of the Yarlung Tsangpo river, where it is expected to generate 300 billion kilowatt-hours of power annually, three times the power of China’s massive Three Gorges Dam, according to the state-run Xinhua news agency. The river originates in the glaciers of western Tibet and flows into India and Bangladesh, where it is known as the Brahmaputra and the Jamuna rivers, respectively. China did not disclose details about when construction was likely to start and end, or the likely impact of the new dam project, including the number of people displaced or the ecological, environmental and cultural consequences of what Tibetans consider as one of their most sacred and biodiverse regions. But experts and activists say the impact will be significant Yarlung Zangbo Grand Canyon in Nyingchi city and that China could use the dam to promote its interests. It will almost certainly affect water flow patterns and native flora and fauna, and it also raises concerns about water security as China may use the dam to control the flow of water downstream. 'Any dam on a river has huge ecological consequences downstream,' India-based water conservation expert Vishwanath Srikantaiah told Radio Free Asia. 'China may use it as a tool by withholding and not being transparent with data on dam operations.' 'Lessons that India can take are from the dams on the Mekong River that China has built [in Laos] and which have impacted downstream nations particularly in years of drought, and how China has operated them broadly on principles of self-interest,' Srikantaiah said. Research has shown that China’s 11 mega-dams on the upper reaches of the Mekong River have resulted in an increase in the frequency and severity of downstream drought over the past two decades. The dams have restricted or blocked water from reaching downstream countries like Thailand, Vietnam, and Cambodia, as well as disrupted biodiversity and eroded river banks. Tibetan protests China’s dam projects have generated protests in the past. Earlier this year, more than 1,000 Tibetans were arrested for protesting against China’s planned construction of the Kamtok, or Gangtuo, Dam project on the upper reaches of the Drichu River, known as Jinsha in Chinese, expected to impact at least two villages and six monasteries in Dege county. Beijing’s investment to build the dam is expected to exceed 1 trillion yuan (US$137 billion) Yarlung Zangbo Grand Canyon in Nyingchi city more than four times the total investment of 250 billion yuan (US$34.5 billion) for the Three Gorges Dam project. The hydropower station will be built in Medog county (Motuo in Chinese) in Nyingtri (Nyingchi) prefecture in the Tibet Autonomous Region, bordering the Indian state of Arunachal Pradesh. 'As far as hydropower projects in the Himalaya are concerned, there is already substantial evidence of their negative impacts,' Manshi Asher, a climate activist and researcher based in North India, told Radio Free Asia. 'This project will undoubtedly alter the environmental flows of the river,' Asher said. 'The larger the dam, the greater the impact on the river flows.' It isn’t clear how many people will have to move to make way for the dam and reservoir it will create. The Three Gorges dam resulted in the displacement of around 1.4 million people, but the area around the Yarlung Tsangpo River where the Medog Hydropower Station is expected to be built is less populated than the area around the Yangtze River, where the Three Gorges dam was built. Earthquake concerns Another major concern is the Medog hydropower dam’s location in a geologically unstable area prone to earthquakes and landslides, that could be exacerbated by the huge volume of water it would hold, said Srikantaiah. According to a study by the advocacy group International Campaign for Tibet, China has built or plans to build at least 193 hydropower dams in Tibet since 2000, of which, almost 80% are large or mega-sized. Of the 193 dams, over 60% are reportedly still in the proposal or preparation stages. But if completed, they could displace over 1.2 million people and destroy religious sites, the rights group said. Dechen Palmo, climate researcher at the Dharamsala, India-based Tibet Policy Institute, noted that while the specific details of the dam on the Yarlung Tsangpo river have not been disclosed, the project would likely result in the displacement of Tibetans and the destruction of ancient monasteries. The new mega-dam also would pose environmental risks with significant impact on neighboring countries, including India, as has been the case with multiple dams that China has built on Tibet’s rivers, he said.

Taliban Hint At Shielding Anti-Pakistan Militants In Afghanistan ...	By Ayaz Gul A senior Taliban leader in Afghanistan has indicated that they will continue to provide refuge to anti-Pakistan militants, describing them as 'guests' under the country's traditions. Taliban Information Minister Khairullah Khairkhwa made the rare remarks just days after the Pakistani military reportedly conducted airstrikes against suspected terrorist locations in an eastern Afghan border province. The Taliban claimed that Tuesday's attack in Paktika resulted in the deaths of nearly 50 civilians, predominantly refugees from Pakistan. While the claims could not be verified from independent sources, the United Nations said that it had 'received credible reports' from the remote Afghan province that dozens of civilians, including women and children, were killed in the Pakistani airstrikes. Islamabad has refrained from publicly acknowledging the cross-border strikes, but Pakistani security officials anonymously confirmed and told reporters that the military action had targeted and destroyed several 'terrorist hideouts' of the Tehrik-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), an outlawed group engaged in lethal attacks against Pakistan. Several key TTP commanders were also said to be among more than a dozen militants killed. 'We must honor the Afghan nation's commitment to safeguarding these guests, friends,' an angry Khairkhwa said while denouncing the Pakistani attack. He was apparently referring to the TTP in his speech aired by Taliban-controlled state television and shared via X social media platform Friday. The Taliban minister emphasized the need for Pakistan 'to draw lessons from the consequences of military interventions' in Afghanistan by Britain, the former Soviet Union and the United States, respectively, since the 19th century. 'Anyone who attacks Afghanistan or harbors such intentions must learn from the defeat of three superpowers,' Khairkhwa asserted. This is the first public admission by a senior Taliban leader regarding the presence of TTP operatives in the country. Previously, Taliban officials have vehemently denied their existence, claiming that no foreign militants are permitted to operate and pose a threat to other nations from Afghan soil. TTP, designated as a global terrorist organization by the United Nations, has escalated attacks in Pakistan since the Taliban's August 2021 resurgence to power in Kabul, killing hundreds of Pakistani civilians and security personnel. On Friday, Pakistani Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif expressed his government's intention to enhance economic and trade relations with Afghanistan. However, he stated that the threat of TTP-led cross-border terrorism impedes that progress. 'Unfortunately, the TTP continues to operate from there and killing innocent people inside Pakistan. This cannot go on,' Sharif said in his televised remarks to a Cabinet meeting in Islamabad. 'They must rein in TTP. … This constitutes a red line for us. The TTP operating from Afghan soil is unacceptable under any circumstances,' he stressed. Sharif said his country was ready to talk with the Afghan government to address the issue. 'But there can be no progress if, on the one hand, they seek to foster relations with Pakistan while simultaneously permitting TTP to operate with impunity,' he emphasized. Separately, the Pakistani military reported Friday that its counterterrorism operations and clashes with TTP militants resulted in the killings of over 900 'terrorists' this year, including 27 Afghan suicide bombers and fighters. The violence also left nearly 400 Pakistani security forces and officers dead, said Lieutenant General Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry, the military spokesperson. Who is Khairkhwa? Khairkhwa, a U.N.-sanctioned Taliban leader, was captured by U.S. forces in collaboration with Pakistani counterparts in early 2002 and subsequently transferred to the U.S. Guantanamo Bay prison center. He was freed along with four other senior Taliban leaders in 2014 as part of a Qatar-mediated exchange for the release of U.S. soldier Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl. Following the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks on the United States, American and Western-allied forces invaded Afghanistan, overthrowing the then-Taliban government due to its refusal to surrender Osama bin Laden, the leader of al-Qaida, who was accused of orchestrating the deadly attacks from his Afghan bases. The Taliban leadership at the time justified its refusal to surrender bin Laden, asserting that he was a 'guest' in the country and that surrendering him would violate local traditions. Subsequently, the Taliban regrouped and launched an insurgency against U.S.-led foreign forces, using sanctuaries on Pakistani soil. Bin Laden evaded capture and fled to Pakistan, where he was eventually tracked down and killed by American troops in 2011. Taliban leaders pledged to combat transnational militant networks to prevent them from using Afghanistan as a haven for global attacks after they seized power three years ago. However, an annual U.S. terrorism report released earlier this month cast doubts on Taliban counterterrorism commitments, citing TTP's growing attacks against Pakistan from Afghan sanctuaries and the threat transnational groups pose to regional stability from Afghanistan.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWeSAohndYMaVMBbxmj5gdmq	2024-12-27T15:51:34-08:00	
Tough Energy Poker In Eastern Mediterranean After Assad’s Fall In...	By Sarantis Michalopoulos (EurActiv) -- Turkey’s growing influence in Syria’s situation since the fall of Bashar al-Assad has raised eyebrows in Greece and Cyprus, as Ankara reportedly wants to demarcate maritime zones with the new rulers in Damascus. Europe is directly impacted as it searches for Russian gas alternatives, and the demarcation of maritime zones will unlock crucial energy projects. This occurs in the context of fierce competition among regional players, while Europe's position remains fragile. Since the early hours of 8 December, when Assad left Damascus, a geopolitical game has been taking place. The former ruler's forces were defeated by the Islamist militant group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), which was supported by Turkish forces.A few days later, Turkey sent an envoy and other high-level officials to start discussions on various matters, making them the first on the scene along with Qatar. Among Ankara's group were Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan and the intelligence agency chief Ibrahim Kalin. By 24 December, media reported that Ankara was in advanced talks with Syria to sign a deal demarcating maritime zones in the Mediterranean Sea. 'We will conclude a maritime jurisdiction agreement with the Syrian administration […] we are working on a contingency plan that includes air, rail, road and communication services in Syria', Transport Minister Abdulkadir Uraloğlu said. The news triggered reactions in Athens after a similar deal between Turkey and Libya in December 2019 ignored the existence of the island of Crete. The EU then described the deal 'illegal' because it 'infringed upon the sovereign rights of third States.' For its part, Greece said Turkey wants to set a legal precedent with an 'illegal' Memorandum of Understanding under international law. The Cyprus issue While in the case of Syria, Athens and Nicosia fear that Cyprus’ sovereignty rights will be affected. Turkish forces have occupied the north of Cyprus following an Athens-backed failed coup d'etat in the 1970s. Ankara refuses to relinquish control, making it the only divided country in the EU. Cypriot government spokesperson Konstantinos Letymbiotis said in a statement that any intention to conclude an agreement between Turkey and Syria, as countries with adjacent coasts, should be 'based on international law, specifically the customary international law of the sea as reflected in UNCLOS, and should take into account the rights of the Republic of Cyprus in the area'. Meanwhile, Turkey has not ratified the UNCLOS, and insists that it is not bound by its provisions that award islands maritime zones. The future of both Turkey-Syria and Turkey-Libya maritime deals are crucial for the region, as Greece and Turkey have not signed a similar deal amid strong disagreements between the two neighbours. EU made aware Greek diplomatic sources explained this week that the borders in the region are European and stressed that the issue has already been raised with the EU in a joint statement with Austria and Cyprus. They also noted that Syria is facing a 'transitional situation' that does not 'legitimise anyone to make such an agreement'. The government in Athens also faces pressure from opposition parties, who call on the ruling centre-right New Democracy party (EPP) to set EU sanctions against Ankara. The hard-right 'Hellenic Solution' party (ECR) – which is on the rise in polls fishing votes from New Democracy – said it had warned about 'the Islamic terrorists who occupied Syria are fully controlled by Turkey and that Greece should fight for their non-recognition in any way'. The developments in Syria and Turkey’s ambitions in the region came as a surprise in Athens as Greece-Turkey relations have been calm for quite some time. When it comes to Syria, the EU has adopted a wait-and-see approach while it has not taken a position on Turkey’s growing influence in the country. However, Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen visited Ankara on 17 December, considering migration is high on the EU agenda. After she acknowledged Turkey’s help in hosting Syrian refugees, she promised to provide Ankara with an additional €1 billion. In Washington, incoming US President Donald Trump has not revealed his cards but publicly acknowledged Turkey’s role in overthrowing Assad. Pipeline games The demarcation of maritime zones is tightly connected with the energy agenda in the region. For its part, Europe is directly affected as the bloc has been in search for alternatives to Russian gas and the Eastern Mediterranean has a role to play. However, the complex interests among the players in the region (Greece, Cyprus, Turkey, Israel, Egypt) make the equation tough to solve. Earlier this week, Reuters reported that a delegation from Turkey's energy ministry will visit Syria 'soon' to discuss possible energy cooperation. Turkey is already providing electricity to some parts of northern Syria where the Turkish army has invaded four times since 2016. On 23 December, Greece and Israel signed an energy deal aiming to create a 'green' electricity corridor from Israel to the EU, via Greece and speed up the Greece-Cyprus-Israel electrical interconnection project. The latter has been delayed as the Greece-Cyprus section is facing a stalemate. It’s considered the 'world’s longest' subsea high-voltage cable. It will link European transmission networks to Cyprus and later extend to Israel. Turkey, which has rising tensions with Israel over Gaza, has opposed this project. Instead, analysts in Athens suggest that Turkey aims to increase its geopolitical leverage and become Europe’s energy hub. An old, ambitious plan to build a pipeline to transport Qatar's natural gas to Europe through Saudi Arabia, Jordan, Syria, and Turkey has resurfaced. Greek media report that another project in the spotlight is connecting western Syria with the existing Arab Gas Pipeline, which connects Syria with Jordan and Egypt and could provide Europe with Egyptian and Israeli natural gas. However, analysts in Athens estimate that Tel Aviv will not let Turkey handle its main geopolitical weapon. Lastly, all energy projects under discussion will be affected by Turkey’s future handling of Syria’s Kurds, as Turkish President has threatened with full-scale invasion, a scenario opposed by Israel.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWeSAohndYMaVExxD8v6_czl	2024-12-27T15:49:46-08:00	
Russia Says Ready To Help Armenia In Rapprochement With BRICS	Russia has completed its chairmanship of BRICS, Russian Ambassador to Armenia Sergey Kopyrkin said Friday, December 27, Sputnik Armenia reports. The ambassador noted that if Armenia shows interest in rapprochement with BRICS, Russia is ready to provide assistance 'in the spirit of allied relations'. Thus, according to him, Russia, as the BRICS chair in 2024, vigorously promoted cooperation in three key areas: 'politics and security', 'economics and finance', and 'cultural and humanitarian contacts'. The culmination of Russia's BRICS presidency was the October summit in Kazan, which was attended by some twenty thousand guests, delegations from thirty-five countries and six international organizations. 'The official delegation of the Republic of Armenia, headed by Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan, took part in the Kazan summit,' the Ambassador said. 'A significant event were the productive Armenian-Azerbaijani high-level talks on the normalization of relations on the sidelines of the Kazan forum. This proved in practice that BRICS can act as a convenient and neutral platform for interstate dialogue on the settlement of contentious issues. If Armenia shows interest in rapprochement with BRICS, Russia is ready to provide all possible assistance in the spirit of alliance and strategic partnership.'	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWeSAohndYMaVL2kt_BOm3bj	2024-12-27T15:48:31-08:00	
Justice As Infection: A Wild Reading Of Jaun Elia – OpEd	In today’s age of neo-fascism and neoliberal capitalism, there is a rising pressure to conform to social norms. The decimation of state welfare, the rise of precarious employment, violent xenophobia, right-wing hysteria against sexual self-determination etc. have created a society in which the individual is left powerless to decide their own fate. Instead of figuring out how we can collectively annihilate an unjust order, contemporary psychology has sought to justify individual quiescence. Mark Manson, for instance, says that it is impractical to hate society and completely disengage from it. That only leads to 'indifference' – people hide in an 'emotionless pit of their own making, self-absorbed and self-pitied, perpetually distracting themselves from this unfortunate thing demanding their time and energy called life.' Since there will always exist a society that sets up norms for us to follow, Manson asks us to accept that'everything sucks, some of the time.' There will always be people who will 'laugh you off the stage over and over again'. We will never 'feel comfortable and happy at all times'. That’s why Manson says that we have to be concerned only with 'the big things, the important things'. Human beings are mortal creatures who have to think carefully about how they want to use their limited time. They can’t be everywhere at all times, resolving every single problem. They are characterized by the 'unfortunate tendency…to inhabit only one place in space and time'. From the individual’s perspective, the inability to change the entirety of society means that we have to 'recognize our life’s inevitable limitations and then prioritize what we care about based on those limitations'. So, it is the fact of mortality that allows us to focus on what really matters to us. Thinking about death foregrounds questions that possess urgency: 'What is your legacy going to be? What are the stories people are going to tell when you’re gone? What is your obituary going to say? Is there anything to say at all? If not, what would you like it to say? How can you start working towards that today?' In the end, the mental health discourse of the present conjuncture boils down to an ideology of death: the fact that individuals cease to exist becomes an excuse for accepting hardships. Manson thinks that becoming a 'hotshot court lawyer' means tolerating '80-hour workweeks'. He obviously doesn’t stop to reflect if this personal 'sacrifice' doesn’t reflect historical norms of capitalist productivity. For him, it is just a trans-historical necessity: 'Everything involves sacrifice. Everything includes some sort of cost. Nothing is pleasurable or uplifting all of the time.' Manson’s ideology leads to the assertion of a strong self that can weather the inevitable imperfections of life and thus doggedly pursue its goals. But from where does Manson derive this strong self? Are we always capable of confronting difficulties and creating a new future for ourselves? Manson thinks so. For him, 'uncomfortable emotions' can’t be considered as an independent entity. They exist only as a 'source of motivation' for us, spurring 'positive change in our lives'. Thus, mainstream psychology converts negative affects into mere inputs for the machine of optimism. An alternative to the machine of optimism can be found in the poetry of Jaun Elia, where pessimism silently and aggressively voices the necessity for a radical change. Consider these lines: 'dād-o-tahsīn kā ye shor hai kyuuñ/ham to ḳhud se kalām kar rahe haiñ' (Why is there such a commotion of praise and applause? / We are merely conversing with ourselves.) One can find here an attitude of indifference to society. While Manson wants us to carefully focus on things that we are capable of pursuing and exclude those that are out of our control, Elia is absolutely ignorant of such distinctions. He converses with himself without assessing how it would be received by others. He doesn’t care if his inner conversation has succeeded in overcoming difficulties and earning applause from society. Rather, he is confused as to why does a society even exist, why are there people who are applauding him. So, does Elia basically deny the existence of society? If so, how do we even make sense of his monologue? Even a monologue relies upon the social infrastructure of language. One is never alone while thinking, as thoughts arise from a history of interaction. How, then, do we understand Elia’s incredulity towards applause? The word dād has a variety of meanings: praise, justice, help and the fungal skin infection called 'ringworm'. Here, a curious equivalence occurs between the domain of social conventions and the domain of morbidity. Is social recognition and mutuality like a skin infection that itches, inflames, and swells? In this graphic imagery, the act of applause becomes an irritant to the human body. Appreciation from others no longer validates the goals that we pursue or the values that we hold. It becomes an infection that demands treatment. In this morbid sociality, there exists no secure selfhood that can convert negative affects into a determined struggle for personal goals. On the contrary, Elia presents us with brute negativity, an affect of inflammation that doesn’t provide any comfort. For Manson, difficulties have to be faced if people wish to fulfill their goals. The fact of mortality continually reminds us that humans can’t have it all, that they have limited time to execute their plans in a harmonious manner. Thus, the negativity of difficulties becomes a principle that has to remembered, constantly reminding us to invest our energies in a judicious manner. Elia, on the other hand, presents us with a negativity that is enacted in a fit of confident forgetfulness, instead of being remembered as a principle that can help us in navigating society. Nothing, not even death, can guide us in the creation and maintenance of social relations. Sociality is always a form of morbid astonishment: people start applauding and assisting when one least expects it. Words spoken to oneself somehow invite the irritant gaze of the other. Society can’t be neatly categorized into a set of necessary imperfections that the individual has to rationally manage to fulfill their own goals. Our goals are overridden by an intense monologue wherein praise and appreciation lose their normative force, just as infection disturbs the integrity of the body that till now had seemed as if it completely belonged to me. Insofar as there is no stable selfhood that can rationally pursue its goals, who is the subject that confusedly looks at the applause that it is receiving from others? Here, one can replace the smooth language of social recognition with the rasping abrasion of resistant materials. In the former, there is a psychologically motivated individual who is discriminating between what they should care about and what they should accept as an inevitable imperfection. In this totalized individuality, the other doesn’t need to disseminate itself. It is always concentrated in the mind of the rational individual, who knows how to deal with society. Even difficulties are accepted by the individual as an inevitable aspect of life, motivating them to try harder. But in the ontology of infection, no difficulty can be legitimized as a trans-historic principle of life. Difficulties are not inevitabilities that are smoothly integrated into the worldview of the individual. Rather, there has to be a dissemination, a passage of social signs: the infection of sociality has to spread from the portal of entry to the wider body. Infection doesn’t involve the entirety of the body. It initially operates upon specific structures or molecules that the pathogen can exploit, such as receptors on cell membranes, open wounds or mucosal surfaces that allow entry etc. It is only later that pathogens may spread beyond the initial entry site through the bloodstream, lymphatic system, or nerves. The dissemination of the infection of sociality may or may not take place. Life’s difficulties may or may not be accepted as inevitabilities. In other words, the necessity of dissemination attests to the possibility of changing the world. There is no reason why the world should be fatalistically legitimized as an inherent aspect of life. Just like an infection, the world, too, can be diagnosed and treated. Thus, there is a space where the reasonableness of things is not yet guaranteed. Whereas Manson begins with the rigid individual whose selfhood has already internalized the trans-historic inevitability of suffering, Elia asserts the presence of a singularity that is not convinced of the reasonableness of anything. A singularity keeps conversing with itself, without attempting to participate in the social verification of beliefs. Instead of possessing social coordinates that would allow it to face outwards and map the exterior, the singularity mutters its way through society. It is as if the ears of the singularity are blocked by the loudness of its own internal conservation. And from where does it get so much sonic power? The explanation is to be sought in its positioning at the infectious niche, the point at which the body of the singularity possesses the capacity to function as a microhabitat for pathogens. Located at this meeting-point, the singularity keeps receiving social signals from the machine of history. This endows it with a vastness of material. But at the same time, the material is subject to the pressures of dissemination: the pathogenic substance has to cover a distance in order to spread itself. The indetermination of the passage means that the material of history can be recklessly deformed into a rambling monologue that pays no heed to the normal rules of functioning. Dād, we saw, also means justice. Elia can be said to inaugurate a new notion of notion: justice as infection, an order in which everything becomes dry, flaky and crusty, as it is detached from the nurturing atmosphere of the status quo. Before anything can be changed, it needs to be subjected to the withering gaze of ruthless critique. According to Manson, 'Meaning is like the water of our psychological health. Without it, our hearts and minds will shrivel and die. And like water, meaning flows through us'. For Elia, on the other hand, meaning is like ringworm: it is the infectious dryness that subsists beneath the surface of water. This dryness keeps irritating us, foregrounding the flakiness of all that exists. From this cauldron of inflammation, there arises the monstrosity of the singularity, annihilating injustice in the flames of monologue, absolutely indifferent to social norms.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWeSAohndYMaVGtTB3uCJS-k	2024-12-27T15:43:18-08:00	
NATO Vows To Bolster Baltic Presence Amid Suspected Undersea Sabo...	(RFE/RL) -- NATO has said it would bolster its presence in the Baltic Sea after undersea power lines and Internet cables were damaged by suspected sabotage believed to be carried out by vessels belonging to Russia’s so-called 'shadow fleet.' Estonia also announced on December 27 that it had begun a naval operation to guard a crucial electricity line in the Baltic Sea in coordination with allies as tensions mounted in the region. NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte said in a social media post following discussions with Finnish President Alexander Stubb that 'NATO will enhance its military presence in the Baltic Sea.' Both Finland and Estonia have coastlines on the Baltic Sea. When asked for details about planned actions, NATO officials told AP that the alliance 'remains vigilant and is working to provide further support, including by enhancing our military presence' in the region. 'We have agreed with Estonia, and we have also communicated to NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte, that our wish is to have a stronger NATO presence,' Stubb told a news conference. Stubb added that investigators did not want to jump to conclusions, but a day earlier he had said that 'it is necessary to be able to prevent the risks posed by ships belonging to the Russian 'shadow fleet.'' The 'shadow fleet' is a reference to old, uninsured oil vessels typically used to bypass Western sanctions on Russia and maintain a source of revenue. European government and the United States have accused Russia of intensifying 'hybrid attacks' following reports of damage to Baltic Sea communications cables, although they have not yet directly tied Moscow to the damage. NATO stepped up monitoring critical infrastructure in the Baltic following Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022 and the destruction of the Nord Stream natural gas pipeline seven months later. Chinese-linked ships have also been suspected of sabotaging undersea infrastructure over recent years. Sweden -- NATO's newest member, which also has a coastline on the Baltic Sea -- said its coast guard had stepped up surveillance of sea traffic and had deployed aircraft and vessels in concert with regional allies. The European Commission on December 26 said a cargo ship suspected of having deliberately damaged power and Internet cables in the Baltic Sea was part of Russia's 'shadow fleet.' The poor condition of these ships has also raised concerns about environmental disasters. Finnish authorities on December 26 boarded and took command of the Cook Islands-registered Eagle S oil tanker in the Baltic Sea as part of its investigation into the damages, saying it likely belong to the 'shadow fleet.' Investigators have said the damage could have been caused by the ship intentionally dragging its anchor. The Kremlin said it had no connection to the ship seized by Finland. It has regularly denied that it is involved in any of the many incidents involving Baltic Sea region infrastructure assets.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWeSAohndYMaVGsrqf-fXwMp	2024-12-27T15:36:32-08:00	
A Tribute To Former PM Manmohan Singh: Remembered For Empowering ...	Manmohan Singh (September 26, 1932 - December 26, 2024) was an Indian statesman, economist, scholar, and bureaucrat. From 2004 to 2014, he served as the 13th Prime Minister of India. He was born in Gah (Pakistan); however, his family relocated to India during the partition of India in 1947. Dr. Singh possessed unparalleled academic intellect. He pursued his studies in Punjab prior to graduating with First Class Honours in Economics from the University of Cambridge in 1957 and subsequently obtained a D. Phil in Economics from Nuffield College, Oxford in 1962. Singh occupied several significant roles in the Indian government during the 1970s and 1980s, such as Chief Economic Advisor (1972–1976), Governor of the Reserve Bank (1982–1985), and Chairman of the Planning Commission (1985–1987), as well as serving in the United Nations from 1966 to 1969.The apolitical in 1991, during a significant economic crisis in India, P. V. Narasimha Rao, the newly elected prime minister, appointed Singh as finance minister. Notwithstanding substantial resistance, he executed several structural reforms that liberalized India's economy in the subsequent years. Although these measures effectively averted the economic crisis and enhanced Singh's reputation as a notable reform-oriented economist globally. Notwithstanding, the incumbent Congress Party lost the 1996 general election. Singh subsequently headed the opposition in the Rajya Sabha, India's upper parliamentary chamber, during the Atal Bihari Vajpayee administration from 1998 to 2004. The United Progressive Alliance (UPA), an alliance led by the Congress, assumed power in 2004. Singh was elected Prime Minister and led the United Progressive Alliance I and II. Under the astute leadership of PM Singh, several significant laws and initiatives were formulated, including the Rural Employment Guarantee program, the National Rural Health Mission, the Unique Identification Authority, and the Right to Information Act. The persistent issues of rural poverty and unemployment in India prompted the initiation of these welfare programs, led by Prime Minister Manmohan Singh. The inception of a national employment guarantee scheme occurred when multiple Indian states-initiated pilot programs to provide work opportunities for rural households in the 1970s and 1980s. Although limited in scope, these initial programs established the foundation for a nationwide initiative. The notion of a national employment guarantee program gained prominence in the 1990s, accompanied by various central government proposals and deliberations. Despite India's progress in various socioeconomic domains, the conditions of rural populations, particularly marginalized communities have been moderately improved. These individuals have long suffered been from rural unemployment and poverty. A significant portion of India's rural population remained in poverty and unemployment despite economic expansion. Their heightened vulnerability to drought and natural disasters exacerbated poverty and food insecurity, thereby further exacerbating the conditions and status of rural households. The predominant number of rural households engage in seasonal employment within the agricultural sector. Consequently, there are often inadequate employment opportunities, leading to underemployment and migration. To rectify these disparities, demands for social justice and inclusion have emerged from various marginalized groups, including women, scheduled castes, and scheduled tribes. In response to this scenario, the UPA government implemented significant measures such as MGNREGA, Food Security, and Rural Development to enhance the status of marginalized individuals. Right to Work (2005) The introduction of National Rural Employment Guarantee Act-2005 (rename as MGNREGA in 2009), has been a significant Indian social welfare initiative designed to ensure the 'right to work', particularly for the rural marginalized people. The act was passed on 23 August 2005 and was implemented in February 2006 under the UPA government led by Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and the Minister for Rural Development, Raghuvansh Prasad Singh. It is a bold step towards ensuring an inclusive India by social safety net for rural households, providing a lifeline for millions of marginalized people struggling with poverty and unemployment. The program's focus on job creation, rural advancement, and social inclusion has established it as a fundamental component of India's development strategy. The initiative aims to enhance livelihood security in rural areas by guaranteeing a minimum of 100 days of assured wage employment annually for at least one member of every Indian rural household, contingent upon the adult members' willingness to undertake unskilled manual labor. Women are guaranteed one-third of the employment opportunities generated under the MGNREGA, with efforts aimed at achieving a minimum of 50% participation. A primary objective of MGNREGA is to create enduring assets, such as roads, canals, ponds, and wells. Employment will be offered within a 5 km radius of the applicant's residence, and the minimum legal wage as mandated by law will be compensated. Applicants are eligible for an unemployment benefit if employment is not offered within 15 days of their application. If the government fails to provide employment opportunities, it is required to furnish designated unemployment benefits to those impacted. Consequently, employment under MGNREGA represents a legal entitlement. Proponents of NREGA claim that, in addition to providing economic security and creating rural assets, it also aids in environmental protection, empowers rural women, reduces rural-urban migration, and fosters social equity, among other advantages. In its World Development Report 2014, the World Bank described this program as a 'stellar example of rural development' (The Economic Times, 10 October 2013). National Rural Health Mission (NRHM) 2005 On April 12, 2005, the Prime Minister launched the National Rural Health Mission (NRHM) to provide the rural population, especially the most vulnerable, with access to quality, affordable healthcare. The primary goals of NRHM are to establish a decentralized, community-driven, autonomous health delivery system and to address the social determinants of health. The NHRM sought to reduce maternal and infant mortality rates, as well as to prevent and manage both infectious and non-communicable diseases and to promote a healthy lifestyle. To attain these objectives, various measures regarding staff and infrastructure were implemented. The initial step in this direction was the establishment of the Accredited Social Health Activists (ASHA). The same was comprised of volunteers who work to create a connection between the targeted community and the health system. This mission has benefited from the contributions of over 8.84 lakh community health volunteers. For marginalized populations, especially women and children, facing difficulties in accessing healthcare in rural regions, ASHA serves as the primary resource for any health-related requirements. This initiative, proliferating across the states, has proven particularly effective in reintegrating individuals into the public health system. Moreover, it has resulted in an increase in the utilization of inpatient care, diagnostic facilities, outpatient services, and institutional deliveries. The subsequent step in the same mission was the formation of the Patient Welfare Committee. It is a legally sanctioned entity that governs the operations of hospitals as a board of trustees. Financial assistance and support for these communities involved in patient welfare initiatives are managed by a consolidated fund. Auxiliary Nurse Midwives (ANMs) in the field now exhibit increased confidence due to enhanced tools, including weighing scales, stethoscopes, and blood pressure monitors, provided by Sub-Centre Grants. The Village Health Sanitation and Nutrition Committee (VHSNC), functioning at the grassroots level, is an essential tool for community empowerment. NRHM has endeavored to address human resource deficiencies by contractually providing approximately 170,000 personnel for health services to States, including 8,871 doctors, 2,025 specialists, 76,643 ANMs, and 41,609 staff nurses, among others. Mobile Medical Units (MMU) have delivered services in various underserved regions. The government initiated the Janani Shishu Suraksha Karyakram (JSSK) program to promote universal healthcare, providing complimentary transportation, medications, diagnostics, blood, and food for pregnant women delivering in public health facilities and for ill newborns. In 2014-15, 1,04,38,905 beneficiaries were documented under the NHRM, with 87% of beneficiaries originating from rural areas. Food Security Act of 2013 The National Food Security Act (NFSA) 2013 is a legislative initiative implemented by the Government of India under Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, aimed at guaranteeing subsidized food grains to approximately two-thirds of the nation's population. The NFSA includes the Midday Meal Scheme, Integrated Child Development Services scheme, and the Public Distribution System. The NFSA 2013 also recognizes maternity entitlements. The Midday Meal Scheme and the Integrated Child Development Services Scheme are intended to be universal, whereas the Public Distribution System aims to serve roughly two-thirds of the population, with coverage of 75% in rural regions and 50% in urban areas. The Targeted Public Distribution System (TPDS) sought to cover 75% of the rural population and 50% of the urban population by guaranteeing a monthly allocation of 5 kg subsidised grain per person. The national coverage rates for rural areas are 75%, while for urban regions, they are 50% within each state. According to the TPDS regulations, foodgrains will be available at subsidized prices of Rs. 3, 2, and 1 per kg for rice, wheat, and coarse grains, respectively, for a period of three years following the enactment of the Act. The identification of households is the responsibility of the States and Union Territories, as specified by the coverage defined for the Targeted Public Distribution System in each State. Pregnant women, nursing mothers, and children aged 6 months to 14 years will be provided meals that adhere to the nutritional standards set forth by the Integrated Child Development Services (ICDS) and Mid-Day Meal (MDM) programs. Improved nutritional standards have been implemented for children under six years old suffering from malnutrition. The maternity benefit provision mandates that pregnant women and nursing mothers shall receive a minimum sum of Rs. 6,000. The oldest female member of the household, aged 18 or older, shall assume the position of head of the household for the purpose of issuing ration cards. The Central Government will provide assistance to States in managing the expenses related to intra-State transportation and handling of foodgrains, along with the margin for Fair Price Shop dealers, in accordance with the standards to be set for this initiative. Conclusion The Government of India, led by Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, implemented various substantial initiatives to promote socio-economic inclusivity in the country. The right to employment under MGNREGA, the guarantee of food security through NFSA, and the provision of affordable and accessible universal healthcare under NHRM for disadvantaged and marginalized groups have been notable social welfare initiatives for which the Prime Minister will be historically acknowledged. His legacy would act as a beacon for both marginalized communities and future governments in their efforts to develop effective policies. India has lost an exceptional statesman whose legacy will be commemorated for its inclusivity and progressive vision.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWeSAohndYMaVPOoqveAkDLE	2024-12-27T15:30:51-08:00	
Will Pope Francis Visit Ukraine In 2025?	By AC Wimmer Media reports about Pope Francis potentially visiting Ukraine have raised hopes the Holy Father could accept an invitation to visit the war-torn country in 2025. According to a report by Ukrainska Pravda, Major Archbishop Sviatoslav Shevchuk, the head of the Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church, said in a recent interview that while no visit was confirmed, 'Pope Francis sometimes likes to make surprises.' The prospect of a papal visit to Ukraine has been discussed multiple times since Russia’s full-scale invasion began. In June 2022, speaking to children during the 'Children’s Train' initiative in Rome, Pope Francis explained his approach to such a visit: 'I would like to go to Ukraine. But, I have to wait for the right time to do it, because it is not easy to make a decision that could do more harm to the whole world than good.' The new speculation about a potential visit follows the pope’s Christmas message on Dec. 25 in which he specifically mentioned the ongoing conflict in Ukraine, calling for its end and for negotiations toward a just peace. 'May the sound of weapons be silenced in Ukraine,' the pope urged on Christmas Day. 'May there be the boldness needed to open the door to negotiation and to gestures of dialogue and encounter.' Shevchuk has long advocated for a papal visit to Ukraine. In April 2022, following Pope Francis’ comments during an in-flight press conference returning from Malta, the Ukrainian Catholic leader said he hoped the pope would visit Kyiv 'as soon as possible.' At that time, Shevchuk noted that the local Catholic Church and government officials were 'working to ensure that the Holy Father’s visit to Ukraine takes place.' In his latest interview, the Ukrainian Church leader reportedly expressed hope for peace in the coming year. 'We enter this new year with hope, with the hope that a just peace will eventually prevail in Ukraine,' he said.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWeSAohndYMaVNfEERM4J_G7	2024-12-27T15:29:04-08:00	
The Merz Doctrine: What A CDU-Led Government Would Mean For Germa...	By Jeremy Cliffe and Jana Puglierin Friedrich Merz’s long and winding journey towards the German chancellery is a tale of the federal republic’s past and present. Marinated in the determinedly pro-European, pro-Western politics of Helmut Kohl’s Christian Democratic Union (CDU) in the 1990s, he became co-leader of its Bundestag group in 2000, before Angela Merkel elbowed him aside. But Merz’s outspoken conservatism also clearly chimes with the harsher, more doubtful and sometimes more inward-looking mood of mid-2020s Germany. This is one reason why the CDU is polling around 30% to 34% ahead of the federal election on 23 February. The election result is far from certain—these are volatile political times, and Merz is relatively untested—but his victory would align with the broader German zeitgeist. Understand that, and one starts to understand the nuances of Merz’s foreign-policy philosophy, as well as what a CDU win would mean for Germany’s international role. It also sheds some light on the most important issue: whether the election result will see Europe’s keystone country provide more leadership in the coming years than it has in recent ones. Germany’s now-collapsed 'traffic light' coalition—Olaf Scholz’s Social Democrats (SPD), the centre-left Greens, and the right-liberal Free Democrats (FDP)—framed European and German interests as tightly interlocking, but often acted otherwise. An unpredictable actor in Brussels, it would often abstain or change its mind at the last minute. It delayed the European Union’s adoption of sanctions against Russia, reflexively rejected Mario Draghi’s report on the single market’s competitiveness, and opposed tariffs on Chinese electric vehicles. Berlin’s relations with Paris and Warsaw have deteriorated. In other European capitals, policymakers often remark that Germany appears to have gone missing[1]. The country that—under Kohl and, in her better moments, Merkel—rowed Europe through its storms now seems to be swept along by the current of events. Whether Merz can change this depends on the interaction between the three main pillars of his foreign policy—and the complementarities and tensions between them. *** The first is a profound commitment to a more integrated Europe. Merz came up in the Kohl era; the age of German reunification and the Maastricht Treaty. A member of the European Parliament from 1989 to 1994, he sat on the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, which helped mould the single market. Merz has called Wolfgang Schäuble 'the closest friend and adviser I ever had in politics', and seems especially influenced by his mentor’s belief in a Europe of concentric circles centered on France and Germany. In 2018, Merz echoed this sentiment in a call jointly authored with the philosopher Jürgen Habermas for a European army, 'European rather than national terms when setting wages and prices', and even a European unemployment insurance scheme. Today Merz calls for a grand reset in Germany’s relations with France and Poland, chides Europeans for being too reliant on American support for Ukraine, and blasts Scholz for refusing to provide Kyiv with Taurus cruise missiles. In what will likely be a major dividing line in the upcoming campaign, Merz has upbraided the would-be Friedenskanzler, or 'peace chancellor', with the words: 'Peace you can find in any cemetery. It is our freedom that we must defend.' This European Merz was most visible at an event in Berlin with Enrico Letta, the Italian former prime minister and author of a bold blueprint for a deeper single market, on the day after the US presidential election. As the reality of a new Donald Trump term settled over the German capital, the German conservative and the Italian social democrat found far-reaching common ground on the need to integrate European energy, telecommunications, defence and capital markets. *** The second pillar of the Merz doctrine is a market-liberal Atlanticism that goes beyond the 'Westbindung', the federal republic’s almost existentially Western geopolitical identity. Merz has a deeper personal connection with the US and the Anglosphere than Konrad Adenauer, Helmut Kohl, or either Merkel or Schäuble. After he was sidelined by Merkel in the early 2000s, he pursued a transatlantic business career; heading the German board of the asset manager Blackrock and serving as chairman of Atlantik-Brücke, a campaign for closer US-German relations. Merz also has an affinity with the United Kingdom, chiding Merkel for not doing enough to stop Brexit. He speaks almost accentless English. But realism tempers his emotional connection with the English-speaking world. Merz is rare in Germany for presenting Trump’s re-election as a justification for transatlantic engagement: at the Letta event he argued that the failed EU-US free trade deal (TTIP) would have helped insulate Europe’s economy from looming American tariffs, and that EU should not necessarily respond to those tit-for-tat. But he also acknowledges that Joe Biden was America’s last traditionally Atlanticist president. He has publicly asserted that the 'Europe of yesterday', with its 'confidence associated with the solitary leadership of the US', is a thing of the past. And he recognises that the transatlantic relationship must change radically to survive, with a more balanced burden of responsibility. *** Such Europeanism (albeit conservative) and Atlanticism (albeit realistic) might make Merz seem a throwback to Kohl-era Germany. But the third pillar of ‘Merzianism’ complicates that picture: as well as being a product of the idealistic 1990s, he is also a creature of the more introspective and less exceptionalist Germany of the 2020s. In his own distinct way, the CDU chancellor candidate is prone to just as defensive and narrow a conception of the German national interest as that which has marked Scholz’s Europe policies at their most parochial. Merz has described Ukrainian refugees in Germany as 'social tourists' (though subsequently apologised). On Berlin’s temporary imposition of border controls, a main cause of its current poor relations with Warsaw, he only wishes Scholz’s government had acted sooner. He has a cool relationship with his CDU party comrade Ursula von der Leyen, having disagreed with the European Commission president on the EU’s migration and asylum pact; on EU tariffs on Chinese electric vehicles; and its 2035 target to end the sale of new polluting cars. Most of all, this 'Germany first' approach comes across in Merz’s steely refusal to countenance the measures required for Europe to fund a more sovereign future. When Draghi published his competitiveness report, the CDU chancellor candidate dismissed common borrowing as 'a debt spiral' that he would 'do everything to prevent'. He has made it clear that the Next Generation EU pandemic recovery fund was an exception, rather than a basis for future common borrowing for shared priorities like defence. These positions are striking not in their divergence from Scholz’s traffic-light coalition, but in their continuity with it. *** Combine those three pillars—Europeanism, Atlanticism, and 'Germany first'—and the broad contours of a Merz chancellorship become clear. It would be most active where the three overlap; for example, European initiatives to placate Trump in the interests of German business (especially to curb American tariffs). A Merz government would shy away from proclamations of European 'autonomy' and seek to shore up NATO, while urging greater European leadership within the alliance. It would be more robust than its predecessor on Ukraine and Russia; with Merz confident in personally associating himself with the Bundeswehr and German defence. It would seek to relaunch Germany’s place in Europe, focusing especially on France and Poland but also the Nordics and Baltics. Yet it would also bridle at putting serious German money behind this European reset. On China, it would be torn between an instinctive geopolitical hawkishness and a business-friendly inclination to hedge German bets. Viewing the Merz doctrine as the fusion of those three pillars also highlights some inherent tensions. Where, during the Kohl years, Europeanism and Atlanticism mostly fitted neatly together, under a second Trump term Merz’s stated desire to do German 'deals' with the incoming president may well clash with any Schäublerian quest for a more robust and united European core. Meanwhile the conflict between the narrowly German sense of Merz’s mission and his European calling is expressed in his reluctance to countenance deeper European fiscal integration or a genuinely shared migration regime. And in the age of Trump 2.0, there are also tensions between the Atlanticist pillar and 'Germany first'. The more nationalist branches of the CDU in eastern states like Saxony are significant parts of Merz’s base and tend to be relatively more sceptical about NATO and Germany’s alignment with America. *** Quite how these tensions play out depends a lot on the details of Germany’s federal election. One important factor is whether the overall campaign, which will reach its crescendo in first weeks of the new Trump administration, favours a united European stance or bilateral German attempts to seek special deals with the incoming president. Another concerns the result. The better the Eurosceptic, anti-NATO fringe parties—the far-right Alternative for Germany and the left-conservative Sahra Wagenknecht Alliance—do at the polls, the more Merz’s commitments to Europe and the US will come under pressure, including from within his own party. Another significant variable is the influence of Merz’s inner circle of advisers. Key names if he becomes chancellor could include Thorsten Frei (a tough-on-migration CDU MP poised to run the chancellery), Jacob Schrot (Merz’s chief of staff and a keen Atlanticist), and Daniel Andrä (a foreign policy adviser with close links to the Bundeswehr). Merz’s team reflects his own instincts. But especially when those instincts are in tension, such voices could shape which of them prevail. The biggest variable, however, is what sort of coalition emerges from the election. It is likely (at the time of writing) that the CDU/CSU will have to rely on a coalition with the SPD and/or the Greens. The latter are somewhat closer to Merz on Ukraine but farther from him on the climate and migration. More important than the exact makeup of the coalition, however, is whether it has the vision and cohesion to rise to Germany’s manifold challenges. The country’s old model of 'cheap energy from Russia, trade orders from China, security from the US' no longer works. Scholz’s government has slowly, fitfully edged Germany on from it, while too-often neglecting necessary European solutions. But the new Trump presidency greatly increases the urgency. Whether any Merz-led coalition has the internal and external political room to act accordingly will be decisive. So, too, will be whether it sees Europe more as an obstacle to that action, or a vessel for it.

Spain’s Stressful Water Problem – Analysis	By William Chislett The flash flooding that hit the region of Valencia last month, killing 239 people, would seem to suggest Spain does not have a problem of lack of water. In some places, more rain fell in a day than in a whole year. That natural disaster, one of the worst in the country’s modern history, however, was one of extreme weather, known as a ‘DANA’ (depresión aislada en niveles altos), and not representative of Spain as a whole. DANA weather systems are formed when an area of low pressure gets ‘cut off’ from the main flow of the jet stream. As a result, instead of moving through a region relatively quickly, they get blocked over the same area producing persistent rainfall for days. In stark contrast, other parts of Spain have recently suffered prolonged bouts of drought (in November 2023 nine million people, one fifth of the population, faced water restrictions). Both the tragedy in Valencia and persistent droughts have brought home the rising threat of climate change for which Spain, like so many other countries, is unprepared. Last month was the hottest November in Spain since records began more than 60 years ago, according to the State Meteorological Agency (Aemet). The average temperature was three degrees higher at 12.4ºC, and, despite the torrential rain from the DANA, Spain’s total rainfall was 40% lower than normal for November. As climate change intensifies, Spain’s water management faces significant challenges, and this in a country which has a wealth of tradition and culture in relation to the careful use and exploitation of water; Romans, Arabs and other civilisations that settled in the Iberian Peninsula were more mindful than we tend to be today of the need not to waste water. The Alhambra and Generalife in Granada, the Aqueduct in Segovia and the Water Court in Valencia, the oldest existing institution of justice in Europe, bear testimony to this. Water management suffers, as do so many other issues, from political polarisation and the lack of cooperation and coordination between Spain’s four levels of government (central, regional, provincial and municipal). The authorities’ initial response to Valencia’s deadly floods was woefully inadequate. The civil protection agency (Agencia Valenciana de Seguridad y Respuesta a las Emergencias or AVSRE), which is overseen by the Popular Party-led regional government of Valencia, only sent out a text message warning residents hours after the first floods were reported. Help from the Socialist-led central government, which said it was up to the regional government to ask for what it needed, was slow to come in the first days. While an army of volunteers stepped into the gap, political opponents wasted no time in starting a blame game. The water problem is well known and has been endlessly diagnosed, particularly in a 600-page long White Paper published in 2004, but little has been done, particularly executing planned hydraulic works, many of which have either not been started or are going way behind schedule. A project to channel Valencia’s Poyo ravine, which caused some of the worst flooding, was designed in 2006 and given priority in 2009 by the Hydrographic Confederation (Confederación Hidrográfica del Júcar) but was shelved by successive governments. A report, published last month by the environmental consultant OIKOS, sounds alarm bells on Spain’s ‘increasing water stress’, which at 43% is well above Germany’s 34% and Italy’s 30%, but far lower than Israel’s dramatic 110% (see Figure 1). Figure 1. Level of water stress: freshwater withdrawal as a proportion of available freshwater resources, taking into account water’s environmental needs (Indicator 6.4.2.)

Agriculture is a huge and inefficient user of water, consuming 65%, while only generating 14% of the value of EU agriculture. Drip irrigation, which is more economical and efficient, as it falls drop by drop on the roots of plants, thereby reducing consumption and loss of water, is underutilised (see Figure 2). Figure 2.

Climate change has produced a sharp fall in Spain’s average annual rainfall and consequently more prolonged periods of drought, particularly in Andalusia and Catalonia, the two regions that attract the most international tourists. Tourism is a vital part of the Spanish economy (12.8% of GDP); last year’s record number of 85.3 million tourists was the main driver of economic growth. Water reserves in Catalonia fell below 16% in February, triggering a state of emergency that extended water restrictions in other parts of the region to Barcelona and the surrounding area. The drilling of illegal wells –some estimates put the number at more than 500,000– and the excessive use of water in vulnerable areas, such as the Doñana Natural Space, one of Europe’s most important wetlands, which includes a Unesco-listed national park, and Las Tablas de Daimel, requires much stricter control. At Doñana, strawberry farms have depleted the aquifers holding groundwater. The first report denouncing the increasingly critical situation was made in 1988 and nothing began to be done until 2019, most importantly last December when the central government, which had been at loggerheads with the Popular Party regional government in Andalusia for two years, agreed a landmark €1.4 billion deal to help protect Doñana and diversify the local economy away from reliance on soft fruit. More than 1,000 illegal wells have been shut down. Another problem is the defective infrastructure. Up to 25% of drinking water supplied in distribution networks is lost, well above the ‘best practice’ target of less than 10%. This is not just a waste but reduces the availability of water for other uses. The average price of water in urban areas of €2/m3 is lower than the €3 EU average and well below the €5 charged in some countries, encouraging wasteful and inefficient use. Spain is a laggard in using non-conventional sources for water, which have been developed over the years, such as desalination plants and reclaiming water from a variety of sources, treating it and re-using it for beneficial purposes such as agriculture. OIKOS says only between 30% and 33% of total residual water treated undergoes tertiary treatment, which is the final phase of the wastewater cleaning process making it totally safe for re-use. Valencia’s flooding left residents in the affected areas without basic needs including drinking water. When the supply was restored, people were advised to boil the water or use bottled water, a profitable business for water-bottling plants, some run by multinationals, particularly those in the immediate area of the disaster. This prompted questions in some quarters on whether restrictions should be placed on these companies in times like that of Valencia’s tragedy or more broadly during periods of drought. Water governance clearly needs to be improved. OIKOS calls for the creation of a national water authority in order to better coordinate national, regional and municipal policies. It is to be hoped that the idea will not fall on deaf ears. About the author: William Chislett (Oxford, 1951) is Emeritus Senior Research Fellow at the Elcano Royal Institute.

Myanmar’s Poverty Trap: Inflation And Unemployment Collide – Anal...	By Windia Soe Myanmar’s efforts to reduce poverty (Sustainable Development Goal 1) face significant setbacks due to escalating inflation and unemployment driven by political instability, economic crises, and conflict-induced disruptions. Key Takeaways: Inflation surged from 3.64% in 2021 to 30.2% by late 2023, fueled by currency depreciation, foreign currency shortages, and rising oil prices, pushing nearly half the population below the poverty line. The military coup and COVID-19 caused mass job losses, with unemployment peaking at 4.34% in 2021, forcing millions into informal, unstable jobs and prompting a mass emigration of skilled laborers. Political instability, military conscription, and declining investment have weakened Myanmar’s labor market, reducing job quality, wage levels, and overall productivity, compounding poverty. Progress and Setbacks in Poverty Reduction Myanmar, one of the least developed countries, has significantly reduced poverty over the last decade. Myanmar began a political and economic transition in 2011 under a controversial elected government led by a retired military leader, which led to its first semi-democratic transition in 2015. The 2017 Myanmar Living Conditions Survey (MLCS) reports that the percentage of the population living below the national poverty line decreased significantly, dropping from 48.2% in 2005 to 24.8% in 2017. Between 2011 and 2019, the country achieved significant economic growth, averaging 6 percent annually, and notable reductions in poverty. This progress was driven by economic reforms, increased foreign direct investment, the lifting of sanctions, and growing optimism for stability. However, Myanmar’s development journey is complex, with the positive trends observed in 2017 were soon disrupted by the COVID-19 pandemic and subsequent political instability in 2021. By the end of 2020, the poverty rate was projected to rise from 6 to 11 percent, driven by declining incomes and limited coping mechanisms among vulnerable households. The 2020 Household Vulnerability Survey revealed that 83.3% of households reported income losses, particularly those reliant on small-scale family businesses. In 2021, the economy contracted to 10%, with widespread job and income losses, inadequate government relief, and halted public investments. This contraction from the dual crisis shows no sign of recovery, pushing millions into poverty. Poverty has more than doubled, rising from 24.8% in 2017 to 49.7% in 2023; nearly half of the population was living below the poverty line, struggling to meet even their basic daily needs on just 1,590 Kyats a day (around $0.75). In 2023, the estimated average income per person in Myanmar was just 75,000 Kyats per month (about $35). In rural areas, incomes were even lower, 24% less than the national average, averaging around 75,000 Kyats. Inflation: A Major Driver of Poverty Amid ongoing crises, inflation has emerged as a pivotal factor driving the surge in poverty levels across Myanmar. After reaching a five-year low of 3.64% in 2021, inflation escalated dramatically, with consumer price inflation rising to 30.2% by the September quarter of 2023, according to Statista. This stark increase reflects deepening economic vulnerabilities exacerbated by external shocks and internal instability. The Asian Development Bank forecasted an average inflation rate of 8.5% in 2023, building on a 16% rate in 2022, underscoring the persistent inflationary pressure within the economy. Food price fluctuation, a critical component of household expenditures, has further strained vulnerable populations. The World Food Program reported a 27% increase in food prices between October 2023 and April 2024, with conflict-affected regions such as Kayah and Rakhine experiencing even sharper spikes of 40–50% and up to 200%, respectively. These disproportionate increases highlight the compounded effects of regional instability and supply chain disruptions. The rapid erosion of purchasing power has pushed an alarming number of families below the poverty line, emphasizing the urgency for targeted interventions to stabilize prices and protect the most affected communities. Several key factors contribute to this alarming rise in inflation, including; Local currency (Kyat) depreciation: As of August 2024, the kyat has fallen to an all-time low of about 7,500 kyats per US dollar in the black market, a sharp drop from approximately 5,000 kyats earlier in the same month. Increase in oil prices: Oil prices rose by 13% from December 2023 to April 2024, increasing 31% compared to last year. In response to escalating prices, the Central Bank of Myanmar implemented measures in early 2024 to provide fuel importers with access to subsidized exchange rates. However, persistent foreign currency shortages have hindered importers' ability to fully utilize these preferential rates fully, increasing local fuel prices. Foreign currency shortage: The country has experienced significant foreign currency shortages due to a sharp decline in trade activity, which fell sharply by 55–64% within two months of the military takeover, as port operations were hampered by clearance delays, logistical challenges due to political unrest, and the temporary suspension of shipping services. This decline limits the availability of foreign currency as exports decrease. Increase in the money supply by printing: Following the coup, Myanmar faced widespread civil disobedience movements that severely disrupted economic activities and caused cash shortages. In response to the cash shortage, the CBM increased the money supply by printing to address the cash shortages. As of March 2024, Myanmar's Money Supply M1 was reported at 23.245 billion USD, marking an increase from 21.523 billion USD in December 2023. Although these are significant factors contributing to inflation in Myanmar, they are not exhaustive. Other elements, such as supply chain disruptions, rising production costs, and broader economic instability, play critical roles in shaping inflationary trends. Unemployment’s Contribution to Poverty The labor market in Myanmar has been severely affected by the military coup in February 2021. These disruptions have led to significant unemployment and underemployment, which in turn contribute to rising poverty levels across the country. In 2021, an estimated 18.9 million people were employed, reflecting a loss of 1.6 million jobs (8%) compared to 2020 due to the military takeover and COVID-19. Industries such as construction, garments, and tourism were hit hardest, with employment dropping by 31%, 27%, and 30%, respectively, compared to the previous year. Since 2019, the combined impacts of the pandemic and political crisis have resulted in 3.2 million people (14% of the workforce) losing employment. Despite a reported decline in official unemployment rates—from 3% in 2022 to 2.8% in 2023—these figures fail to reflect the true challenges in the labor market. Many workers have been pushed into informal, low-paying, and unstable jobs, while reports of labor rights violations further underscore the precarious conditions faced by workers across the country. Current Labor Market Situation As of December 2024, Myanmar's population is approximately 54.6 million, with a working-age population between 15 and 64 years at 68.4%. Of 22 million employed in the country, approximately 48.8 percent work in agriculture, 16.9 percent in industry, and 34.2 percent in service industry. The working-age population is projected to rise, reaching 39.2 million by 2030. However, employment gains have not kept pace with population growth, leading to a decline in the employment-to-population ratio, which dropped to 54.5% in 2022- a decline of 8.2 % from 2017. The decline is particularly severe in conflict-prone regions, where instability eroded economic activity and labor opportunities. A significant recent development affecting the labor market is the enforcement of a military conscription law in February 2024, which mandates military service for men aged 18 to 35 and women aged 18 to 27, with evasion punishable by up to five years’ imprisonment. This has triggered widespread fear and migration, especially from urban areas to rural regions and neighboring countries such as Thailand. Labor shortages have become critical, as many employees have resigned to evade conscription. The mass exodus of young people has intensified the labor crisis, further straining an already fragile economy and contributing to the rise of child labor. In response, the garment and construction industries have been forced to increase wages to retain employees, but these efforts have not been enough to attract skilled laborers. Trends in Unemployment From 2004 to 2020, unemployment in Myanmar remained low, typically below 1.5%. However, unemployment spiked sharply to 4.34% in 2021, the highest in nearly two decades. This jump is attributable to mass layoffs in the public and formal private sectors after the coup. Additionally, international sanctions—including targeted measures by the EU and other countries—and Myanmar’s FATF blacklisting in 2022 deterred foreign investment, prompting the withdrawal of numerous Western companies and exacerbating the economic downturn. The garment sector shed an estimated 300,000 jobs after the closure of over 200 factories. Unemployment rates slightly decreased to 2.83–2.84% in 2022 and 2023, but the recovery remains fragile due to ongoing political instability and sanctions. The trends suggest that Myanmar may face challenges in stabilizing its labor market without substantial governance and economic policy changes. Economic Consequences of Unemployment The sharp rise in unemployment since the 2021 coup has worsened poverty and weakened the labor market. Key consequences include: Declining Job Quality: The share of wage employment decreased from 36.8% in 2017 to just 28.9% in 2022, indicating that many workers have shifted toward self-employment or informal jobs with lower returns. Impact on Women: Women have been disproportionately affected; their unemployment rate increased fivefold from just 2% in 2017 to approximately 10.2% in 2022, reflecting severe job losses across both public and private sectors. Real Wage Decline: Real wages have declined by approximately 15% between 2017 and 2022, forcing over 70% of households into asset liquidation or borrowing as coping mechanisms due to wage losses. Reduced Labor Productivity: Labor productivity has also suffered significantly; estimates show an 8% drop in productivity during 2021, followed by a further 2% loss early in 2022. This indicates that skilled workers are increasingly channeled into low-value sectors like agriculture. Brain Drain: Since the coup, 1.6 million people have lost their jobs, including many from high-skill sectors. The emigration of skilled workers—especially those aged 18–25 years—has further weakened Myanmar's labor market. These trends underline Myanmar’s economy’s deep structural challenges, with long-term implications for growth, poverty alleviation, and social stability. The interconnectedness of unemployment and poverty creates a vicious cycle, further undermining the well-being of vulnerable populations in Myanmar. Conclusion The relationship between inflation and unemployment is complex. High unemployment keeps wages low, while low unemployment can drive wages up, leading to inflation. In Myanmar, inflation and unemployment are rising, creating unique challenges that deepen poverty. Studies by the University of Ibadan show that rising inflation, unemployment shocks, and population growth strongly affect poverty in the short term. But, long-term strategies focusing on sustainable economic growth, stable governance, and investment in human capital are essential to breaking the cycle of poverty and achieving the SDG of eradicating poverty by 2030. However, the success of long-term strategies is deeply tied to political stability, which unfortunately appears increasingly uncertain and fragile in Myanmar.

Thailand’s Defective Democracy Under Elite Control – Analysis	By Paul Chambers Thailand’s political landscape in 2024 continued to reflect a deeply compromised democratic system — characterised by human rights violations and persistent authoritarian tendencies. While the country maintained a superficial pluralism through elected institutions, real power remained concentrated between the royal palace and the Shinawatra political dynasty. The Pheu Thai–led coalition government demonstrated some progressive impulses. It improved social equality by introducing legislation to legalise same-sex marriage and granting citizenship for 483,000 long-term migrants and children born in Thailand. It also attempted to increase government control over the military, though this initiative ultimately failed due to opposition from coalition partners. But human rights violations have remained appalling in Thailand. According to Thai Lawyers for Human Rights, from 18 July 2020 to 31 August 2024 at least 1956 individuals were charged for participating in public assemblies or expressing political opinions across 1302 cases. Of these, 273 individuals in 306 cases have been charged with lese-majeste — insults to the monarchy punishable by up to 15 years in prison. Several high-profile cases highlighted the severity of lese-majeste. Activist Netiporn Saneesankhom died in detention after a prolonged hunger strike. Lawyer Anon Nampa was sentenced to 16 years in prison, with additional charges pending. Move Forward Party MP Chonticha Jaengraew was sentenced to two years, though she remains on bail and is appealing. In a politically motivated move, ex-prime minister Thaksin Shinawatra was indicted on lese-majeste charges, with his trial set to begin in July 2025 — relating to comments made in 2015. Thai security officials were reportedly responsible for the arbitrary arrest, detention, extortion and forced return of Myanmar refugees — including 650 individuals deported in a single day on 24 April 2024. Reports also emerged of three Thai soldiers allegedly torturing and killing a Burmese national along the border. Another Burmese was quickly arrested and imprisoned for the crime though evidence clearly pointed to Thai security forces, a troubling example of institutional impunity. The continuing counterinsurgency in Thailand’s Deep South has involved multiple human rights violations by the Thai security forces. In October 2024, Thailand’s judiciary dismissed charges against security officials implicated in the deaths of 78 Muslim protestors during the notorious 25 October 2004 Tak Bai incident, citing the expiration of the 20-year statute of limitations and failure to arrest suspects. Democratic institutions also faced significant erosion. A quasi-election for Senators — where only candidates could vote — resulted in a chamber dominated by a Pheu Thai rival, the Bhumjai Thai party. Bhumjai Thai’s victory derived from a masterful use of clientelism and election irregularities. This process effectively guaranteed that the Senate would vote against any progressive legislation from the Lower House. On 7 August 2024, the arch-royalist Constitutional Court disbanded the progressive Move Forward party (MFP), which had won the 2023 election, finding it guilty of treason for advocating reform of lese-majeste. The ruling banned the party’s leadership from politics for ten years. The National Anti-Corruption Commission also ordered an investigation into 44 ex-MFP MPs who had signed an agreement to amend the lese majeste law, potentially leading to a lifelong ban from politics. Political volatility peaked in mid-August 2024. On 9 August, ex-Move Forward MPs regrouped under the new People’s Party. But this party was smaller and its leadership was not as charismatic. The People’s Party began losing by-elections in two-party MP contests and provincial-level elections against Pheu Thai. Suddenly, on 14 August, the Constitutional Court dismissed prime minister Srettha Thavisin for malfeasance. He was replaced two days later by Paetongtarn Shinawatra — Thaksin’s daughter and the fourth member of the Shinawatra family to serve as prime minister. This move possibly signalled the palace and wider elites’ dissatisfaction regarding Thaksin’s political ambitions. Royals may later force Paetongtarn to step down if they think Thaksin is overreaching into politics through his daughter. The annual 1 October military reshuffle produced a new line-up favoured by the palace. Incoming army commander Pana Klaewblaudtuk secured his role until 2027 — positioning him to potentially lead a future putsch, though this is unlikely in early 2025. Attempts to amend the constitution failed in November. The People’s Party and Pheu Thai party could not replace the 2017 junta-created constitution with a more progressive charter that would, among other things, allow an elected Senate,with Senate opposition blocking efforts to simplify the amendment process. Diplomatic tensions emerged in December when the Royal Thai Navy broke with the government over a maritime border dispute with Cambodia, declaring that it would adhere to royal commands rather than prime ministerial orders. Throughout 2024, Thailand remained a defective democracy dominated by two levels of elites — the palace-controlled security apparatus and the Shinawatra political dynasty. This asymmetrical relationship between the palace and Thaksin seems based upon mutual interests — but also Thaksin not overstepping what royals perceive should be his limits. The Shinawatras may face political trouble in 2025. Any Thai–Cambodian resolution to the boundary dispute might set off nationalist opposition to Paetongtarn’s government. Thaksin could also easily be forced from Thailand if he angers the palace and is found guilty of lese-majeste. Similarly, the arch-royalist Constitutional Court could rapidly find Paetongtarn guilty of malfeasance. If so, Bhumjai Thai party leader Anutin Charnvirakul could easily become the next prime minister. Though less likely, a military coup against Paetongtarn is also always possible. Thailand in 2024 was first under the control of the palace, and under lesser domination by Thaksin. This political status looks set to persevere for the immediate future.

Japan And India: 20 Years Of Strategic Partnership – Analysis	By Pratnashree Basu and Tripti Neb Over the past two decades, Japan-India ties have evolved into one of the most prominent and pivotal partnerships in the Indo-Pacific region. While Shinzo Abe is often regarded as the one who succeeded in cementing mutual trust between the countries, the foundations for this relationship were established much before, during the administrations of Yukio Hatoyama, Naoto Kan, and Yoshihiko Noda, all of whom served before Abe's return to office in 2012. Despite their relatively short tenures, these leaders played an essential role in advancing political, economic and strategic cooperation with India, recognising its significance in promoting regional stability and balancing China’s growing influence. This trend of deepening bilateral ties has been sustained under subsequent leaders, such as Fumio Kishida, and is expected to continue evolving under the current Ishiba administration. The era of strategic reset Starting with Yukio Hatoyama’s tenure as Prime Minister in 2009, Japan began the process of recalibrating its foreign policy in the wake of a global economic slowdown and shifting regional dynamics. Hatoyama’s administration centred its foreign policy around the idea of an 'East Asian Community', a vision that sought closer regional integration while also creating stronger economic multilateral relations. According to experts in Tokyo, India, as a rising power and the world’s largest democracy, proved a natural fit for this framework. The Hatoyama government placed significant emphasis on strengthening economic ties with India, choosing to begin projects such as the Delhi-Mumbai Industrial Corridor to boost India’s manufacturing industries collaboratively. Japan’s role in the corridor, which symbolised the intersection of economic collaboration and strategic connectivity, emphasised its acknowledgement of India’s potential as a vital partner in the Indo-Pacific. Japanese investments through the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) began flowing in to aid Indian infrastructure and industrial development. However, Hatoyama’s cautious approach to defence cooperation reflected a greater hesitation to counteract China, even as the economic partnership with India deepened. The era of strategic consolidation Naoto Kan’s administration, succeeding Hatoyama in 2010, faced significant challenges due to the Great East Japan Earthquake and the Fukushima nuclear disaster of 2011. Despite these calamities, Kan worked towards solidifying Japan’s relationship with India in the footsteps of his predecessor. His administration oversaw the commencement of the Japan-India Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement, a landmark deal that aimed to reduce trade barriers and boost bilateral commerce to reach bilateral trade worth US$25 billion by 2014. Kan’s administration recognised the strategic importance of diversifying Japan’s energy partnerships in the wake of its nuclear energy scepticism, leading to continued discussions on a civil nuclear cooperation agreement with India. Although a formal civil nuclear deal would not be signed until 2017, these negotiations reflected Japan’s growing trust in India’s role as a prominent nuclear state. On the maritime front, Kan’s administration took part in several series of the Malabar joint naval exercises with India, indicating increased interest in maintaining the freedom of navigation and stability in the Indian Ocean. While Kan’s domestic circumstances limited the scope of his foreign policy to an extent, his tenure contributed to the steady institutionalisation of Japan-India ties. Succeeding Kan, Yoshihiko Noda took charge of the administration in 2011, bringing a more focused approach to defence cooperation with India and recognising the need for strategic convergence between the two nations in the Indo-Pacific. During Noda’s tenure, Japan refreshed its engagement with India through the Japan-India Strategic and Global Partnership, highlighting not just economic partnership but also security and defence cooperation. His administration oversaw the initiation of technology transfer talks with India, marking a significant shift in Japan’s traditionally pacifist post-war stance. Noda also encouraged closer collaboration on maritime security, including intelligence sharing and joint exercises in 2012, aimed at ensuring the safety of the Indo-Pacific, given China’s rise to power in the region. These efforts aligned with India’s interest in strengthening its defence relationships and reducing its dependence on traditional partners such as Russia. Economically, Noda’s government accelerated investments in India’s manufacturing and urban infrastructure, particularly through the promotion of Japanese participation in India’s smart city initiatives. The era of strategic elevation By the time Shinzo Abe returned to power in 2012, Japan-India relations were primed for a significant leap forward, leading up to one of the strongest periods in Japan-India bilateral relations. Abe, known for his strategic vision and commitment to counterbalancing China’s growing regional influence, placed India at the cornerstone of his Free and Open Indo-Pacific (FOIP) strategy. Undoubtedly, Abe’s key contribution was this FOIP vision, which continues to play a pivotal role in consolidating Tokyo’s strategic ties with key regional and global partners. FOIP has become the backbone of Japan-India relations, emphasising shared values and interests in the Indo-Pacific. The Abe administration also cemented the annual '2+2' dialogues involving foreign affairs and defence ministers, indicating the strength of strategic alignment ties between the two nations. Defence cooperation reached unprecedented heights, with Japan becoming a permanent participant in the Malabar naval exercises and signing agreements for the transfer of defence equipment and technology to India. Additionally, Abe deepened economic ties with India, pouring heavy investments into India’s infrastructure projects, including US$15 billion in the Mumbai-Ahmedabad High-Speed Rail project. These initiatives, funded in part by JICA, symbolised mutual trust and a long-term vision for collaboration. India and Japan, under Abe’s administration, focused not only on economic and defence fronts but also sufficiently on cultural and soft power diplomacy. This was famously institutionalised with the declaration of 2017 as the 'Year of India-Japan Friendly Exchanges'. The Abe administration expanded the number of scholarships for Indian students to study in Japan, promoted people-to-people ties, and welcomed India’s support regarding the forthcoming Tokyo Olympics in 2020. These efforts successfully enhanced mutual understanding and goodwill, complementing growing strategic alignment. Abe’s tenure marked the flourishing of the Japan-India relationship into a comprehensive partnership, setting a high benchmark for future leaders to follow. The era of pragmatic continuity and enhanced engagement Yoshihide Suga's tenure focused on maintaining Shinzo Abe’s legacy, particularly in advancing the Free and Open Indo-Pacific (FOIP) vision and strengthening collaboration in the Quadrilateral security dialogue—a grouping of Australia, India, Japan, and the United States. He emphasised economic resilience through supply chain partnerships and supported India during the COVID-19 pandemic, consolidating the strategic partnership’s momentum. Fumio Kishida, who assumed the role of Prime Minister in 2021, has heavily built upon this legacy, focusing on emerging areas such as cybersecurity, supply chain resilience, and green energy. Recognising India’s critical role in diversifying global supply chains, Kishida’s administration focused on developing alternatives to China’s dominance in industries such as semiconductors and rare earth elements, pledging US$42 billion worth of investments in India. Additionally, the Japan-India Digital Partnership, launched under Kishida, has fostered collaboration in areas such as artificial intelligence and supply chain technology since 2023. Kishida’s pragmatic approach to bilateral relations has ensured steady growth in both nations’ relationships, with a much-needed emphasis on innovation and sustainability. Looking at the road ahead, the administration of Shigeru Ishiba is likely to bring new dimensions to the Japan-India partnership. Ishiba, a strong advocate of proactive security posture, is likely to prioritise defence cooperation and multilateral engagement with India and the Indo-Pacific. His administration could accelerate joint technology development, expand military exercises, and strengthen intelligence-sharing mechanisms among both nations, owing to the growing need to counteract China. Moreover, Ishiba’s interest in space exploration and advanced technology could open new avenues for bilateral collaboration in cutting-edge fields such as satellite technology. Nonetheless, even as the geopolitical landscape continues to evolve, Japan and India’s partnership will remain a critical pillar of regional stability, underscoring shared democratic values and a commitment to a stable international order.

45 Days In Ukraine, 1,000 Days In War – Essay	By Kaspars Ģērmanis (FPRI) -- The title of this essay would have been a little bit different if I had spent five more days in Odesa as planned. '50 days in Ukraine, 1,005 days in war.' That would be a neat summary of my time in the country, where I visited several cities and experienced everyday life. That’s what this essay is about: personal feelings in a country engulfed in war. However, because of the Russian air attack on Odesa on November 18, I changed my plans. I left Ukraine on November 19 — the 1,000th day since the full-scale war began on February 24, 2022. I left not so much out of fear — I was already used to the sirens warning of air alerts, and I had experienced the attacks of the Iranian Shahed drones. Odesans themselves told me not to stay, and I guess I understand why. They have seen and experienced too much to watch others take unnecessary risks. It’s not about courage anymore; it is about living in permanent stress, where one grows tired of heroism, courage, and killing. Nobody talks about these qualities. There is just a wish to have a normal life. A Brief Introduction About Myself and Ukraine This was my sixth and longest visit to Ukraine, and my second during the full-scale war. My story with Ukraine started when I was around 13 years old. I played ice hockey, and my team participated in the Eastern European Hockey League competitions. Latvian, Belarusian, and Ukrainian teams took part in this tournament once a year, and we went to Kyiv. Back in Latvia, people asked me how it was: 'Did you like Ukraine?' I answered, 'Yes,' and it was an honest answer. Later, as a volunteer in Switzerland, I met other Ukrainians with whom I still have very friendly relationships. When Russia annexed Crimea in 2014 and started a war in Donbas — eastern Ukraine — it seemed unbelievable. A war in Europe? In the same Europe that, after WWII, despite the war in the Balkans in the 1990s, continued to insist on the principle of 'never again'? Sure, it was 'other Europe,' not pacifistic Western Europe, but still. February 24, 2022, was unbelievable for Ukrainians. Some remember thinking that Russia would only attack the eastern part of Ukraine to enlarge territories already ruled by the Kremlin. Despite the Russian army being concentrated on three sides of Ukraine — from Belarus, Crimea, and the border with Russia — most people I spoke to did not believe a full-scale war would occur. First, Ukraine and Russia share close ties. On a personal level, many have relatives in Russia, and vice versa. Now Ukrainians hate this phrase, but for a long time, both nations were referred to as 'brother nations.' As one of my acquaintances in Kyiv said, ironically, 'Our brother — or as they called themselves, ‘the big brother’ — attacked us.' Second, it seemed unbelievable that war had begun. In Russia, Ukraine, the Baltic countries, and Belarus, the generation that experienced WWII used to say that the worst that could ever happen is war — it is a saying well-known to succeeding generations. Thus, the idea of war had become something unthinkable. In 2022, I wanted to help Ukraine but did not know how. Just going to Ukraine without a clear plan and doing something for the sake of doing it would be silly. I had not visited my friends in Ukraine because I did not want to appear as a 'catastrophe tourist.' I didn’t want to be one of those people who observes others’ tragedies and then returns to his safe country, home, job, and comfortable everyday life. If I can do nothing, I have no reason to be in Ukraine. However, in November and December 2023, I visited Lviv for two weeks. This is the largest western Ukrainian city and one of the largest cities in Ukraine, located near the border with Poland. Ukrainians encouraged me to come again because it is nice to see foreigners in Ukraine. Besides, the situation in Lviv is relatively calm. The experience stayed with me, so in the summer I decided again to leave for Ukraine. The Think Tank Approach and Trump Perspective My colleagues at the Center for Geopolitical Studies in Riga supported my most recent trip to the country. They suggested creating a network of Latvian-Ukrainian think tanks — 'LatUkrNet' ('Latvian–Ukrainian Network') — intended to bring Ukraine closer to the West, the European Union, and NATO. My visit began in Kyiv, where I met representatives from eight organizations, most of which are Ukrainian think tanks in various fields: international politics, economics, legal affairs, law, the fight against fake news and disinformation, forensics, social psychology, and political psychology. All of them are eager to bring Ukraine closer to the Western world. The Center for Geopolitical Studies in Riga is happy to implement various research projects, invite Ukrainian experts to Latvia for conferences and to work with Latvian students, and help establish cooperation with other Latvian institutions or NGOs. This is how we at the Center for Geopolitical Studies can support Ukraine during these times. We hope for the best results. Who else can help Ukraine? Europe, the United States, or more specifically, Donald Trump, who recently reclaimed his position as US president-elect? It seems that Ukrainians do not know what to expect from Trump. One woman just shakes her head when she hears his name. 'What’s the difference? This war will never end,' she says, finding solace in religion. 'If there is someone who prays for you, everything will be good, even if you have to stay in Odesa,' she indicates to me. Another perspective heard in Ukraine is that Trump is better than the Democrats. True, he is unpredictable, but both attacks in 2014 and 2022 on Ukraine occurred under Democratic presidents: Barack Obama and Joe Biden, respectively. Opinions that the Democrats are too soft and unable to respond with a 'fist against fist' approach in international politics can sometimes be heard. There is hope that Trump can confront Russian dictator Vladimir Putin in a way that he understands better. In Eastern Europe, discussions and compromises can be viewed as signs of weakness and cowardice. In Lviv, I did not hear a single air raid for about a week before the US presidential election. On November 6, there were three of them. However, this was the exception. I stayed in Lviv until November 16, and the situation was quite calm. The Different Faces of War In regions where war is distant, life seems similar to peacetime, but this is just a mirage. In many cities and towns, there are memorial alleys with photos of fallen soldiers and fields of graves decorated with Ukrainian blue-yellow, Ukrainian Insurgent Army (Ukrainska Povstanska Armiya) red-black, and battalion flags. Pubs, at least officially, are open until 11 pm, and the number of soccer fans attending games is very limited, to avoid giving Russia a reason to launch rockets and kill a large crowd. In Kyiv and Lviv, people go to pubs, performers of popular songs entertain in the squares, and young people enjoy life by drinking beer in parks. Occasionally, stark contrasts in experiences appear: One side is at war, and due to a shortage of soldiers, has few opportunities to return home for a respite or troop rotation, while the other side 'lives as before.' This question particularly concerns men. There are checkpoints on the streets and highways that stop men and check documents to determine why they are not in the military. I was also stopped several times, but when they saw my Latvian passport, their interest disappeared. However, those away from the battlefields also do what they can to support Ukraine. They search for vehicles in Europe for the army, donate money or goods, or build drones. In Uzhhorod, a city on the border with Slovakia, the pastor prays for local men who have gone to war, as well as for cities that have endured further rocket fire: Sumy, Kharkiv, Dnipro, and other locations. However, the chance to go to the pub and watch a soccer match while sitting in a tree or standing behind the stadium fence, due to the attendance limit, is a source of power and strength to keep resisting and fighting. There is also humor — though often it’s dark humor. 'Don’t forget to take a flashlight,' writes one of the leaders of a Kyiv think tank that joined 'LatUkrNet.' When Russians destroy the city’s energy system, the public lighting stops working. In Odesa, after attacks, electricity can go out for hours; however, the internet works autonomously for five hours, explains a resident. Everything Ends Quickly in Odesa In Uzhhorod, where air raids are rare, I visited the shelter for the first time. I witnessed an argument between the train station administrator and a woman from Odesa who did not want to go to the shelter. She says she is used to the anxiety of the air raid siren because it is common in Odesa. The administrator stands firm, and both the Odesa woman and I end up in the shelter. Noticing that I speak very little Ukrainian, she asks if I speak Russian. Yes, I do, but I avoid doing so in Ukraine. The Odesa woman replies in a friendly yet proud manner, saying, 'All Ukrainians know Russian.' Another observation: In Kyiv, especially in Lviv and Uzhhorod, people refuse to speak Russian. Locals tend to be very definite — this is the language of the enemy. Even those who did not know English responded kindly and with a smile … in Ukrainian. I understood this attitude; it was not personal. A few hours before traveling by train to Odesa from Uzhhorod, I found out that there had been a rocket attack on Odesa. Like other Eastern and Southern Ukrainian cities, Odesa is more often targeted by missiles than Western regions. Later, it became known that 10 people were killed and even more were injured. While everything was calm in Lviv and Uzhhorod, and also in Kyiv, except for a couple of distant shootings near my guesthouse with Iranian Shaheds, the attack in Odesa reminded me of a harsher everyday life. The proud but kind woman from Odesa, along with other locals, advised me to leave Odesa immediately. The owner of the Airbnb apartment, with whom I had already made arrangements, also recommended that I go and return when the situation is better. I understood that I had no reason to stay in Odesa. I was in Kyiv for work and to see some friends, and in Lviv to meet friends and attend to some duties. Uzhhorod? My curiosity. But Odesa? I had heard a lot about this great city. In other words, curiosity also played a part. 'You are welcome, but next time,' I heard from the locals. As I already wrote, if I cannot be useful, then there is no point in staying and watching other people’s tragedies. Odesans would like to be in my place because I had a chance to leave. And I left. But I hope to return — both to Odesa and to Ukraine. I truly hope so. About the author: Kaspars Ģērmanis is a researcher at the Center for Geopolitical Studies in Riga.

Inheritance Tax Hikes Threaten Farmers’ Property Rights In The UK...	By Owen Ashworth London was flooded recently with hundreds of farmers, protesting the recent changes made by the Labour government to inheritance tax. Thousands of farmers feel that their generational culture is truly at stake with the changes to inheritance tax. The Labour government claims that the changes to inheritance tax will affect very few farmers. The modus operandi of left-leaning statists is to claim that increases to any form of taxation only harms the most well off within the group it affects because they know the public need to be persuaded that it won’t affect them, only those with the broadest shoulders. These changes in inheritance tax make very little sense for many reasons so it is not difficult to understand why it caused such an uproar. The Changes and Claims Made The government has scoured the country for areas to gather more funds for the National Health Service and in the budget—without mentioning it in the budget statement—set their sights on farmers to provide what they can for our health service. The changes include discarding the full exemption that comes with Agricultural Property Relief (APR), combining it with Business Property Relief (BPR), but capping the relief at £1 million meaning farmers will now pay inheritance tax on all their land and all their business assets over the first £1 million. The government is claiming that only around 500 farms would be affected—the implication reinforcing their narrative that only the wealthiest farmers are paying. However, the figure comes from the total sum of claims for APR currently without considering BPR suggesting the government concluded, wrongly or perhaps purposefully, that an APR claim was the total sum of a farm but it is hard to plead ignorance when APR is known for only applying to land and not machinery. The government has caught itself in a thoroughly questionable position. On the one hand, they are claiming that this will affect very few people—the wealthiest farmers—claiming it will raise around £500 million, yet they are providing all the ways that the people affected can avoid most of the tax. Throughout this strange discourse, the government has not admitted whether they have taken these exemptions into account. Common sense tells us that the government will not raise anywhere near that figure so the question beckons: why are they making these changes? The Origins of the Policy The government has admitted that the theoretical foundation for the changes to inheritance tax come from the Centre for the Analysis of Taxation. The Centre is run by Arun Advani and Andy Summers who happen to be Wealth Tax Commissioners that push for huge increases in taxation. Recently, the think tank published a report on inheritance tax where they suggested that the cap should be set at £500,000 which, even they admit, could cause excessive fragmentation of farm land. To counteract excessive fragmentation, Advani advocates for 'the state taking part-ownership of land and becoming the landlord to tenant farmers.' When it comes to the risks associated with food security, Advani states that state subsidies should be given for 'specific activities desired e.g. farming particular produce' whilst other proposals include removing inheritance tax relief for bequests to charities because it 'redirects tax revenues towards the charitable preferences of a very small number of people.' The government has not announced they will be carrying out any of these proposals but they have admitted this is where they got inspiration for the changes in inheritance tax. Why This Is Important Defenders of the Labour Party claim that the government has not announced anything that mirrors these proposals so critics should not worry, they claim, as good statists often do, that they have merely taken the good ideas from the report instead of the insane ones. The issue arises insofar as that it’s not beyond the realm of possibility that the government is way off the mark in regards to the amount of farms that will be affected by these changes, it could end up affecting thousands of medium-sized farmers who are asset rich but cash poor. Farmer’s wages are notoriously small compared to their assets. So, how do the farmers who get caught up paying inheritance tax come up with the money to pay the tax? They sell off bits of their land to pay for it. If the number is indeed substantially higher, does this not constitute, if not come very close to, 'excessive fragmentation'? Austrians know that government intervention begets government intervention so it is not conspiratorial that the government could take on the more radical proposals in the report if they are, supposedly, shocked by huge sell offs of farmland causing fragmentation. Worldviews Clash The Labour Government worldview is experiencing a mental civil war. They believe that huge corporations are morally repugnant, avaricious, and out of control. It is why they spent much of the election campaign promising that any tax increases would fall solely on big business because they have been allowed to roam free by the previous Conservative Government. However, their inheritance tax changes will cause an outcome that contradicts this worldview. Those who own truly gargantuan farms who do generate a high income will not be forced to sell any of their land since they have the money to pay the tax. The farmers caught in the middle—who make a relatively low income but have land assets in their farms—will be forced to sell part of their land and the participants in the market who will come buying will be those wealthy farmers. This is just a further centralization of the market into the hands of the truly wealthy which Labour purport to wish to prevent. To Austrians, this is an obvious outcome of this policy, yet there should be no underestimating the Labour Government’s ability to be perplexed by this outcome and desire more state intervention to correct this. In this way, it is evident that their worldview cannot, in any sense, claim to act as a restraint on the state. If only the Labour Party could connect the dots, realize that their perplexity at the spawning of incessant issues arises—not out of the ether—but from their own actions, the cycle of self-destruction could be broken. Some Other Arguments for the Change of Policy A quick address to some of the justifications for this policy is warranted. Multiple professors from high-status universities have claimed that the inheritance tax exemption for farmland introduced in the 1980s caused wealthy people to purchase farmland to avoid inheritance tax, thus, farmland values skyrocketed. The land value being higher also causes higher costs for the farmers, the implication being that scrapping the exemption will help the farmers by reducing their costs. If the exemption caused land values to skyrocket by 'a fourfold increase,' then why didn’t it happen until the early 2000s? Farmland values shot up in 2003, coincidentally, when the European Union started handing out subsidies based on land area. It is no wonder that farmland values spiked when this happened. There has been a more blatantly nefarious justification for this policy from a former advisor to Tony Blair. John McTernan suggested doing to the farmers 'what Margaret Thatcher did to the miners' meaning destroying the industry. McTernan added, 'If people are so upset that they want to go on the streets and spread slurry then we don’t need small farmers,' and that, 'It’s an industry we can do without.' This isn’t a fringe member of the party. McTernan is still very influential within the Labour Party and used to be Tony Blair’s political secretary. It is very unlikely that it is only McTernan that holds this view, thus, we can reasonably suppose that there is a group that genuinely hate the farming industry and desire the destruction of British farming. Perhaps they only hate the smaller farms, but this just poses more questions about their motives. There is nothing more spiteful, immoral, or destructive for society than political actors who believe that because they harbor hatred for an industry, that they can destroy it using the levers of the state. These actors feel they are superior, completely unjustifiably, and can simply extinguish livelihoods because they disapprove of it. Where will the Government go from here? The Labour government has a humongous majority in the British parliament so they will most likely hold their ground on this policy. Unless changes are made, it should be suspected that the farming industry will continue its centralization into the hands of the truly wealthy. There will be a huge change in the composition of production with the remaining farms as the government encourages certain activities like 'rewilding.' British farming will change as we know it and we will hear utter confusion from the political elites when reality bites.

Witches, Covid, And Our Dictatorial Democracy – OpEd	On December 1, President Joe Biden announced that he was pardoning his son Hunter for all the crimes he committed from January 1, 2014 through December 1, 2024. Biden’s sweeping pardon of all of his son’s abuses epitomizes how presidents and their families are now above the law. It also illustrates how the 'King James Test for American Democracy' could become the death of the Constitution. The American Revolution was heavily influenced by a political backlash that began across the ocean in the early 1600s. King James I claimed a 'divine right' to unlimited power in England, sparking fierce clashes with Parliament. Since the 9/11 attacks, some of the same moral and legal principles have been advanced in this nation, but few people recognize the historical roots. Before he became king of England in 1604, James was king of Scotland. He cemented his claims to absolute power thereby launching witch panics and burning hundreds of Scottish women alive to sanctify his power. Harsh methods were not a problem because James insisted that God would never allow an innocent person to be accused of witchcraft. 'While James’s assertion of his [Scottish] royal authority is evident in his highly unorthodox act of taking control of the pre-trial examinations, it is his absolutism which is most apparent in his advocating the use of torture to force confessions during the investigations,' according to the University of Texas’s Allegra Geller, author of Daemonologie and Divine Right: The Politics of Witchcraft in Late Sixteenth-Century Scotland. Torture produced 'confessions' that spurred further panic and the destruction of far more victims. England did not have similar witch panics because officials were almost entirely prevented from using torture to generate false confessions. James justified the illicit torture, 'asserting his belief that as an anointed king, he was above the law.' After Queen Elizabeth died and James became king, he vowed that he had no obligation to respect the rights of the English people: 'A good king will frame his actions according to the law, yet he is not bound thereto but of his own goodwill.' And 'law' was whatever James decreed. Nor did he flatter the men elected to the House of Commons: 'In the Parliament (which is nothing else but the head court of the king and his vassals) the laws are but craved by his subjects and only made by him at their rogation.' James proclaimed that God intended for the English to live at his mercy: 'It is certain that patience, earnest prayers to God, and amendment of their lives are the only lawful means to move God to relieve them of their heavy curse' of oppression. And there was no way for Parliament to subpoena God to confirm his blanket endorsement of King James. James reminded his subjects that 'even by God himself [kings] are called Gods.' Seventeenth-century Englishmen recognized the grave peril in the king’s words. A 1621 Parliament report eloquently warned: 'If [the king] founds his authority on arbitrary and dangerous principles, it is requisite to watch him with the same care, and to oppose him with the same vigor, as if he indulged himself in all the excesses of cruelty and tyranny.' Historian Thomas Macaulay observed in 1831, 'The policy of wise tyrants has always been to cover their violent acts with popular forms. James was always obtruding his despotic theories on his subjects without the slightest necessity. His foolish talk exasperated them infinitely more than forced loans would have done.' Macaulay scoffed that James was 'in his own opinion, the greatest master of kingcraft that ever lived, but who was, in truth, one of those kings whom God seems to send for the express purpose of hastening revolutions.' After James’s son, Charles I, relied on the same dogmas and ravaged much of the nation, he was beheaded. Charles I’s son ascended to the English throne in 1660, but his abuses spurred the Glorious Revolution of 1688 and sweeping reforms that sought to forever curb the power of monarchs. A century and a half after King James denigrated Parliament, a similar declaration of absolute power spurred the American Revolution. The Stamp Act of 1765 compelled Americans to purchase British stamps for all legal papers, newspapers, cards, advertisements, and even dice. After violent protests erupted, Parliament rescinded the Stamp Act but passed the Declaratory Act, which decreed that Parliament 'had, hath, and of right ought to have, full power and authority to make laws and statutes of sufficient force and validity to bind the colonies and people of America, subjects of the crown of Great Britain, in all cases whatsoever.' The Declaratory Act canonized Parliament’s right to use and abuse Americans as it pleased. The Declaratory Act ignited an intellectual powder keg among colonists determined not to live under the heel of either monarchs or parliaments. Thomas Paine wrote in 1776 that 'in America, the law is king. For as in absolute governments the King is law, so in free countries the law ought to be King; and there ought to be no other.' The Founding Fathers, having endured oppression, sought to build a 'government of laws, not of men.' That meant that 'government in all its actions is bound by rules fixed and announced beforehand — rules which make it possible to foresee with fair certainty how the authority will use its coercive powers,' as Nobel Laureate Friedrich Hayek noted in 1944. For generations, American politicians spoke reverently of the Constitution as America’s highest law. But in recent years, the Constitution has fallen into disrepute. The rule of law now means little more than the enforcement of the secret memos of the commander-in-chief. We now have the 'King James Test for American Democracy.' As long as the president does not formally proclaim himself a tyrant, we are obliged to pretend he is obeying the Constitution. Government is not lawless regardless of how many laws it violates — unless and until the president formally announces he is above the law. While King James bluntly declared his right to absolute power 400 years ago, recent presidents only make such claims via their lawyers, often in secret documents that citizens are supposed to never see. The most important recent change in American political thinking is nonchalance regarding government criminality. The notion that 'it is not a crime if government does it' is the new conventional wisdom in Washington. It doesn’t matter which agency or official broke the law. Instead, the only prudent response is to pretend nothing is amiss. Nowadays, every act of government is judged in a vacuum, as if every constitutional violation is a fluke. This is the mirror image of how the Founding Fathers viewed government power. In 1768, John Dickinson wrote that colonists fixated on 'not what evil has actually attended particular measures but, what evil, in the nature of things, is likely to attend them.' Dickinson pointed out that because 'nations in general, are not apt to think until they feel…nations have lost their liberty.' The Founding Fathers looked at the liberties they were losing, while modern Americans focus myopically on the rights they supposedly still retain. Law professor John Phillip Reid, in his seminal work The Concept of Liberty in the Age of the American Revolution, observed that liberty in the 18th century was 'largely thought of as freedom from arbitrary government….The less a law restrained the citizen, and the more it restrained government, the better the law.' But government officials now claim unlimited discretion to define the law and their own prerogatives. Jack Goldsmith, who headed the Justice Department’s Office of Legal Counsel in 2003–04, later explained how top Bush officials dealt with 'laws they didn’t like: they blew through them in secret based on flimsy legal opinions that they guarded closely so no one could question the legal basis for the operations.' It is no longer a question of having good laws, including laws that permit officials limited flexibility for contingencies. The rule of law has come to mean nothing more than finding a single lawyer who will say 'Yes, Master!' to his political overlords. But it is folly to make the survival of liberty hinge on some lawyer’s sense of shame. If the Iraq war had not turned into a debacle, most of the media and the political ruling class would have continued deferring to President George W. Bush almost across the board. As long as his popularity ratings were high, he could do little or no wrong. America’s 'best and brightest' were as naive or craven as the courtiers who defended the mass burning of Scottish women 400+ years earlier. The Constitution’s checks and balances failed to deter recent administrations from erecting the legal scaffolding of dictatorship. Instead, implausible denials of seizing excessive power have been followed by 'dictatorial apathy.' Lawless power grabs have become another background noise in Washington. Presidents and their legal teams can claim absolute power — and almost no one inside the government or the Justice Department blows the whistle. President Bush could boast that he was obeying the law because his appointees assured him that he was the law. Legions of government employees safeguarded their careers by going along and enforcing Bush-era absolutist legal doctrines. That settled any doubts about whether Justice Department officials would be willing tools for future presidents who trample the Constitution. Inside the Beltway, a mystical adoration of power is taken as proof of wisdom. In 2007, Bush nominated former federal judge Michael Mukasey as attorney general. Three years earlier, Mukasey had proclaimed that 'the hidden message in the structure of the Constitution' is that the government is entitled to 'the benefit of the doubt.' Mukasey did not reveal where the message was hidden. Mukasey’s 'benefit of the doubt' assertion may have helped him snare the top law-enforcement job in the nation, where he provided all the benefits Bush needed. The more power politicians capture, the more flattery they hear, and the more deluded they usually become. A phalanx of academics is always ready to cheer power-hungry presidents. In 2007, Harvard University government professor Harvey Mansfield exalted 'one-man rule' in a Wall Street Journal op-ed, scoffed at the rule of law, and declared that 'free government should show its respect for freedom even when it has to take it away.' And since the president is entitled to vast power, how would we know it is still a 'free government?' Presumably because it would be a crime to assert otherwise. Mansfield scorned contemporaries who 'forget to consider emergencies when liberties are dangerous and law does not apply.' The previous year, Mansfield wrote in a Weekly Standard article that the 'Office of President' is 'larger than the law' and that 'ordinary power needs to be supplemented or corrected by the extraordinary power of a prince, using wise discretion.' Mansfield also asserted that in emergencies, 'liberties are dangerous and law does not apply.' Such assertions may have swayed the National Endowment for the Humanities to select Mansfield in 2007 to deliver its Jefferson Lecture — 'the highest honor the federal government bestows for distinguished intellectual and public achievement in the humanities.' Mansfield’s cheerleading fits a pattern that goes back millennia. Throughout history, intellectuals downplayed the perils of political power. As long as court intellectuals were treated royally, rulers were indemnified for any and all abuses of the peasantry. As French philosopher Bertrand Jouvenal noted in 1945, 'Authority can never be too despotic for the speculative man, so long as he deludes himself that its arbitrary force will further his plans.' John Maynard Keynes, the most influential economist of the 20th century, exemplified this attitude. Keynes declared in 1944 that 'dangerous acts can be done safely in a community which thinks and feels rightly, which would be the way to hell if they were executed by those who think and feel wrongly.' And who is to judge whether the community 'thinks and feels rightly?' The same politicians seizing boundless power. The same passion for absolving high-level wrongdoers is often expressed in muffled terms by the editorial pages of the Washington Post and other leading papers. From 2008 onwards, the Post inveighed against permitting lawsuits that sought to hold former Attorney General John Ashcroft, former Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld, and other top officials liable for the torture and other abuses that occurred on their watch. One Post editorial fretted: 'Officials should not have to fear personal lawsuits for performing their duties in good faith and in violation of no established legal precedent.' This practically assumed the existence of 'good faith torture' — as if maiming and beating people to death was the moral equivalent of a clerical error. Unfortunately, the same 'absolve everything' mindset often prevails in the federal judiciary. Government officials have become practically untouchable at the same time that they have become far more dangerous. The Supreme Court has expanded sovereign immunity like a toxic legal cloud. As Senator John Taylor warned in 1821, 'There are no rights where there are no remedies, or where the remedies depend upon the will of the aggressor.' Nowadays, lawless government is simply benevolence on amphetamines. Rather than the rule of law, we now have the 'friend of humanity rhetorical test.' As long as politicians profess to be doing good, it is bad taste to quibble about legal technicalities or archaic constitutional clauses. The question is not what the president actually did but whether he 'meant well.' The word 'dictator' applies only to government officials who publicly announce plans to do bad things to good people. The Covid pandemic vivified how easily individual liberty can be obliterated in our time. A virus with a 99+% survival rate spawned a 100% presumption in favor of despotism. Citizens were assured that the biggest danger was that their rulers would have insufficient clout to force everyone else to stop working, stop worshipping, stay inside, and get injected. Zero freedom was the price for zero Covid, except that hundreds of millions of Americans still had Covid infections. Not a single government official has spent one day in jail for all the lies and crimes of the Covid mandates, lockdowns, censorship, and other abuses. There has even been no penalty for the federal officials who used American tax dollars to bankroll gain-of-function research at the Wuhan Institute of Virology, leading to a lab leak and millions of deaths around the world. Sen. Daniel Webster warned in 1837 that 'the Constitution was made to guard the people against the dangers of good intentions. There are men in all ages who mean to govern well, but they mean to govern. They promise to be good masters, but they mean to be masters.' Americans must decide whether they want good leashes or a good master. We can either stop politicians from continuing to abuse their power, or we can spend our time looking for a wise and merciful despot. Either way, democracy cannot survive power worship.

The Beginning Of The End For Iran’s Regime – OpEd	The overthrow of Syria’s dictator signifies not only a profound shift in regional politics but also reveals the structural weaknesses of the religious fascism governing Iran. The regime’s Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei, who considered Syria his strategic depth, now faces the collapse of one of his regime’s most critical barriers to internal disintegration. The structural corruption and military incapacity of the Syrian army had already become evident during the country’s civil war. However, the new development is the psychological collapse and demoralization of the Iranian regime’s proxies, underscoring their strategic defeat, organizational disintegration, and lack of motivation among their forces. Key Implications of Assad’s Overthrow The fall of Assad has consequences that extend beyond Syria’s borders. This event has vividly exposed the true weakness of the Iranian regime and the inability of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) to maintain its regional influence. The IRGC, long serving as Khamenei’s military and security apparatus, can no longer sustain the strategy of supporting proxy groups in the Middle East. The failure of this strategy signals the end of the regime’s expansionist policies and the beginning of its downfall. With the collapse of one of the regime’s primary regional pillars, conditions have been set for the expansion of popular uprisings within Iran and the acceleration of further political changes. Deception by Lobbies and False Narratives One of the Iranian regime’s tools in foreign policy has been extensive lobbying efforts in Western countries. These lobbies were tasked with presenting a false image of the regime’s power and stability while denying the democratic alternative, namely the Iranian Resistance. These efforts sought to obscure the Iranian Resistance’s ability to overthrow the regime and dismiss the widespread activities of Resistance Units in Iranian cities. However, recent developments have thwarted this strategy. The global community can no longer remain indifferent to the will of the Iranian people to achieve freedom and democracy. The bipartisan Resolution 1148 of the U.S. Congress, which recognizes the Iranian people’s right to resist oppression and seek change, reflects the revolutionary diplomacy of the Iranian Resistance. Necessity of Triggering Snapback Sanctions Following its regional defeats, the Iranian regime has rapidly accelerated its nuclear weapons program. The goal of this program is not to provide national security but to create a tool for preserving the regime’s survival. Under these circumstances, triggering the snapback mechanism in United Nations Security Council Resolution 2231 is essential. This move would enable the global community to increase international pressure to curb the Iranian regime’s nuclear threats. The truth is that the only sustainable solution to prevent nuclear threats is the overthrow of the Iranian regime by its people and the Resistance. They are the primary force for change, backed by an organized network of Resistance Units and a Resistance movement that spans across the globe. A Democratic Alternative The National Council of Resistance of Iran (NCRI), recognized as the democratic alternative to the regime, emphasizes that its goal is the transfer of power to the Iranian people. Mrs. Maryam Rajavi, the NCRI’s President-elect for the transitional period, reiterated this in her online message to a U.S. Congress gathering: 'The NCRI seeks not to seize power but to transfer it to its rightful owners, the Iranian people. According to the NCRI’s platform, a provisional government will be established for a maximum of six months after the regime’s overthrow.Its primary task is organizing elections for a Constituent Assembly and transferring sovereignty to the people’s representatives. The Iranian Resistance underscores values such as political freedoms, gender equality, autonomy for ethnicities, separation of religion and state, abolition of the death penalty, and the establishment of a nuclear-free Iran. These principles lay the foundation for building tomorrow’s Iran, transforming it into a peace-loving nation and a defender of regional stability. The Resistance expects Western countries to impose comprehensive sanctions, blocking the Iranian regime’s financial channels. Furthermore, activities of regime operative under cover organizations abroad must be entirely halted. Domino Effect of Defeats Reaching Tehran The fall of Syria’s dictator, one of Iran’s largest allies, signifies not only a defeat for Khamenei’s regional policies but also a warning bell for the survival of the ruling regime in its entirety. This development underscores the reality that the Iranian regime can no longer sustain its regional structures and is rapidly heading towards decline. More important than this regional defeat is the determination of the Iranian people and Resistance to bring about change. Recent developments highlight a historic stage in the Iranian people’s struggle—a stage where freedom and democracy will replace tyranny and oppression. In this journey, the global community must stand with the Iranian people and support their rights, playing a significant role in accelerating these changes. Now is the time for all nations to support the Iranian Resistance and show the regime in Tehran that the era of dictatorship in Iran has come to an end.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWcuP41_xGFrMgcUS7HS2lRa	2024-12-26T16:00:20-08:00	
Lessons From Japan For China: Healthcare Deterioration In An Agin...	By Zhou Chao In 2022, China's National Health Commission released a report indicating that during the '14th Five-Year Plan' period, the aging of the country's population will deepen, with the proportion of people aged 60 and above exceeding 20% of the total population, marking the transition to a moderately aged society. The health of the elderly is concerning, with the aging process leading to declines in cognitive, physical, and sensory functions, as well as increasing health issues related to nutrition and psychology. Over 78% of the elderly suffer from at least one chronic disease, and the number of disabled elderly people will continue to rise. In comparison to the health needs of the elderly, there is insufficient institutional, workforce, service, and policy support related to healthy aging. There is also a lack of specialized institutions for promoting elderly health, as well as efforts in preventing and controlling key diseases in the elderly. Existing studies point out that the aging of the population in China has these characteristics: larger scale, rapid growth, regional imbalances, urban-rural reversal, a higher number of elderly women than men, and a trend of aging before accumulating sufficient wealth. Rapid aging has led to an increase in chronic disease patients, rising social healthcare costs, declining quality of life for patients, and posing severe challenges to China's healthcare system. At the same time, high-quality medical resources in China are heavily concentrated in large and medium-sized cities and large hospitals, with a significant imbalance in resource distribution and insufficient financial security. In recent years, the government has repeatedly pushed for the decentralization of medical resources to adapt to China's '9073' elderly care pattern (90% of elderly care is family-based, 7% community-based, and 3% institutional), investing significant efforts in building community medical resources, which has achieved some progress. However, researchers at ANBOUND believe that aging is a highly complex phenomenon with highly diverse social impacts, and effectively addressing this issue requires consideration of multiple dimensions. The successful resolution of this issue is crucial for maintaining social stability and consolidating social trust, while ineffective responses to it could lead to severe social consequences. In this regard, Japan can serve as a valuable lesson for China. From 1992 to 2002, Japan's healthcare system faced a contraction in medical insurance due to the economic recession, compounded by a surge in patients following the acceleration of aging. This ultimately led to a rise in medical accidents and incidents of doctor-patient conflicts across the country, resulting in a large-scale resignation of the doctors. Between 1992 and 1997, the number of patients aged 65 and above in Japan surged from less than 2 million to 3.6 million. Major hospitals quickly faced a severe shortage of doctors, and even with full workloads, doctors were unable to meet the rapidly increasing demand. The 1994 Public Health White Paper revealed that the gap in the number of doctors reached 94,000 that year, while there were only 230,000 doctors nationwide at the time, causing work pressures to rise rapidly. According to statistics from the Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare, in 1995, 40% of doctors worked more than 80 hours per week, reaching the danger zone for overwork-related deaths, while Japan was only in the early stages of accelerated aging. Existing studies point out that the Japanese government's miscalculations are to blame. It is undeniable that the Japanese government was aware of the aging issue well in advance, as this phenomenon itself was not new. However, the preventive measures taken by the government were far from sufficient. First, when Japan's aging population reached 7% in 1970, the government introduced the strategy aimed at doubling the number of doctors. Over the next 15 years, the total number of doctors gradually increased from 100,000 to 200,000. Thanks to this expansion, Japan's medical resources were quite abundant in the 1980s. However, the government optimistically assumed that the medical reserves were sufficient and even proposed the so-called theory of an oversupply of doctors, calling for a 10% reduction in doctors in the 1990s. In 1995, the Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare reported that elderly patients aged 65 and above consumed four times the medical resources of adults, far exceeding the forecasted numbers of the 1970s. Second, there was insufficient preparation for the disease characteristics of the aging population. In the 1970s, medical care for the elderly was primarily focused on conventional infectious diseases, which only required short-term treatment before patients could be discharged. Chronic diseases, which require long-term care, were still considered rare 'diseases of the rich' and were not fully considered by the government. However, by the 1990s, elderly people in Japan, who had become wealthier, began facing the long-term challenges of chronic diseases. Due to the prolonged hospitalization required for chronic illnesses, 14% of the elderly population occupied 60% of hospital beds, with 20% of elderly patients being hospitalized for more than a year. This severely occupied medical resources and made it difficult for the younger population's medical needs to be effectively met, leading to the rise of 'anti-elderly' sentiments. Faced with this dilemma, the Japanese government had only two available options: strengthen doctor training and increase medical investment. However, training a high-quality doctor takes up to 10 years, making it a 'distant solution to an immediate problem'. After the collapse of the bubble economy, the Japanese government's financial resources were severely limited, making it difficult to effectively meet funding needs. The government estimated that to solve the shortage of medical resources, annual medical investment would need to increase by more than 100%, with healthcare spending accounting for 12% of GDP. In comparison, the economic stimulus plan, which supported millions of jobs, accounted for only 3% of GDP. In 1995, Japan's healthcare fiscal expenditure surpassed JPY 27 trillion, up from JPY 22 trillion in 1992, an increase of nearly JPY 5 trillion over three years. This primarily came from the costs of hospitalization and medications for elderly patients. Under immense expenditure and fiscal pressure, the Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare introduced a medical cost-cutting bill, and Japan's healthcare system shifted to a development model focused on cost control. Starting in 1995, the Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare proposed a new doctor evaluation system centered around controlling costs, with a particular focus on reducing hospitalization and medication expenses. The government hoped to treat more patients without increasing the medical budget by lowering costs. They then linked patient expenses with doctor incomes, forcing doctors to actively reduce patient costs. The government also implemented cost-control reforms in the pharmaceutical industry, initiating large-scale collective procurement and price reductions for over 10,000 drugs, forcing pharmaceutical companies to significantly reduce production costs. This series of measures successfully controlled healthcare fiscal spending and prevented the collapse of the medical fiscal system, but its negative effects were also significant. First, the quality of healthcare rapidly declined. After the reform, doctors were evaluated based on their ability to cure patients at a lower cost. At that time, even the frequent use of expensive drugs for treatment was considered a mistake. Patient treatment was no longer based on the severity of the illness, the patient's health condition, or actual medical needs. Instead, it was strictly based on the principle of minimizing expenses, which led to a rapid decline in the quality of care in public hospitals. Second, pharmaceutical research and development companies faced immense pressure, and medical accidents became more frequent. Faced with the pressure of collective procurement, pharmaceutical companies had to drastically reduce production and research and development spending. Under the new system, cheap drugs were overused, but many of these low-cost drugs did not have effective therapeutic outcomes. In 1997, Japan saw a famous pharmaceutical fraud incident, where the giant pharmaceutical company Tsumura Juntendo, with revenues in the billions, was found guilty of causing aa number of deaths and ultimately declaring bankruptcy. However, even when doctors were aware of the quality issues with certain drugs, they had no choice but to continue using them. Patients became the victims of cost-cutting healthcare, and in 2000, more than 60% of the 620 medical accidents nationwide were related to excessive cost control. Third, doctor-patient relationships became increasingly tense. Under the logic of low-cost healthcare, patients experienced a direct decline in the quality of medical care. However, they often found it difficult to understand the complex policy logic behind these changes, and as a result, patients often directed their frustration at the doctors who implemented the policies. The media failed to play its expected guiding role and instead portrayed doctors as those who 'feed off patients', fueling social animosity. In 1997, medical disputes in Japan began to surge, and by 2000, the number of doctor-patient disputes nationwide had exceeded 3,000, compared to fewer than 300 in 1995, marking a tenfold increase in just five years. Faced with social sentiment and public pressure, the responsible authorities and police did not conduct a thorough review or response. Instead, they continued to put pressure on doctors, and the standards for medical malpractice were repeatedly relaxed. According to statistics, between 1998 and 2003, 120 doctors were sentenced, which was nearly equal to the total number of doctors sentenced over the previous 40 years, highlighting the widespread impact of these criminal penalties. As a result, trust between doctors and patients nearly collapsed. For doctors, those who chose to stay in the system often had to opt for treatment plans with the least legal risk, rather than those with the best medical outcomes, leaving patient health inadequately protected. For doctors who adhered to the principles of patient-centered care, discouragement and resignation became inevitable. Statistics show that in the first five years of the cost-control reform, 11,000 doctors resigned from public healthcare systems, with dissatisfaction with the medical system being the main reason for their departure. In 2003, nearly 3,000 doctors left public hospitals, with the highest proportion being clinical surgeons. The mass resignation of doctors further exacerbated the shortage of medical personnel, and the group most affected by this was still the patients. Final analysis conclusion: Japan's experience with the deterioration of its healthcare system during the later stages of aging is marked by unique characteristics and underlying causes, which should not be generalized. Since 2020, as China's population born in the 1960s and 1970s has begun retiring, the country's healthcare and fiscal challenges have thus become increasingly pronounced, sharing many parallels with Japan's situation in the 1990s. Therefore, it is crucial to carefully examine Japan's experiences and lessons to guide China in addressing similar issues effectively.

A Cleric’s Heroism – OpEd	By Lawrence W. Reed In many homes worldwide, the day after Christmas is nearly as festive as the day before. December 26 is a holiday in the UK and many Commonwealth nations. People everywhere look forward with hope to the New Year just days away. That may not have been true on December 26, 1948, for a Catholic prelate in Hungary named Cardinal József Mindszenty (1892–1975). Arrested that day by communist authorities, he was sentenced to life in prison on concocted charges of 'treason and conspiracy.' Beatings and torture followed. This was not Mindszenty’s first arrest. He was just 27 when, in 1919, he spoke out against the 'socialist policies' of the Hungarian government and found himself behind bars as a result. A few months later, for expressing similar sentiments, he was re-arrested by the next government, a short-lived communist one. Then in 1944, Mindszenty was arrested by the Nazi puppet regime when he opposed the government’s plan to quarter its troops on Church property. When he was grabbed and jailed in the waning days of 1948, 'here we go again' might have sprung to his mind. When the bad guys hate you, you’re probably doing something right. Every time the authorities busted Mindszenty, it was for the same 'crime,' namely, speaking truth to power. His story recalls an inspiring statement, in a slightly different context, from Winston Churchill. During a visit to Harrow School near London in 1941, the Prime Minister declared: Never give in, never give in, never, never, never, never—in nothing, great or small, large or petty—never give in except to convictions of honor and good sense. Never yield to force. Never yield to the apparently overwhelming might of the enemy. Cardinal Mindszenty personified the courage and defiance to which Churchill alluded. As head of the Roman Catholic Church in Hungary, he despised tyranny and believed it his Christian duty to oppose it. He should be remembered, in the words of Claremont Institute scholar Daniel Mahoney in his Introduction to the Cardinal’s Memoirs, 'as one of the antitotalitarian titans of the twentieth century.' In 1947, as the post-war Soviet occupation tightened communism’s grip on Hungary, the Cardinal repeatedly and publicly condemned the oppressors. He issued statements that angered the authorities, such as one in April that warned: The government has assumed complete control of the publication of textbooks to be used in our schools. Thus the ruling political party in this land will now have the power to indoctrinate our youth. Ahead of sham elections that same year, Mindszenty chastised his fellow Hungarians who naively believed that the communists had mellowed and embraced democracy: We trusted those who had taken over the reins of government. We overlooked their abuses of authority, believing such abuses were the inevitable accompaniment of change and hoping they would cease with the passage of time. Now the time has come for elections, we can no longer keep silent. We must publicly declare that no Christian voter can support a party that rules by violence and oppression and tramples underfoot all natural laws and human rights. By December of the following year, the regime viewed the Cardinal as an implacable foe who had to be silenced and discredited. I, for one, am thankful that humanity often produces such remarkable people. Mindszenty’s resolve helped stiffen the spines of others when circumstances called for courage and defiance. That spirit ultimately prevailed and brought down one European communist despotism after another in 1989–91. Two months after his fourth arrest—on the day after Christmas in 1948—Mindszenty was put on trial by Hungary’s Stalinist dictatorship. His conviction and life sentence in early 1949 produced an international uproar. Even the United Nations issued a resolution condemning it. The regime claimed he confessed to his 'crimes,' but the Hungarian people knew better. The Cardinal had warned before his incarceration that any confession should be regarded as fabricated or induced under duress and, therefore, meaningless. When Hungarian patriots briefly liberated Budapest in a 1956 uprising, Mindszenty was set free. He immediately endorsed the movement and spoke to the nation by radio as armed forces from Moscow invaded Hungary to put the communists back in power. 'Let everyone in the country know,' he said, 'that this fight was not a revolution but a fight for freedom.' The Soviet invasion sadly succeeded, prompting Mindszenty to seek asylum in the US embassy in the Hungarian capital. He remained inside for the next 15 years until a diplomatic arrangement allowed him to leave the country safely. He lived in exile in Austria until he died in 1975. For two reasons, we must not forget brave men and women like Cardinal Mindszenty. One is that we must know history as it was lived, not as someone might choose to rewrite it or erase its lessons. Another is that the wisdom and warnings of people like Mindszenty may apply to circumstances yet to be lived. About the author: Lawrence W.

Ukrainian NATO Membership Impasse Resolved – OpEd	In a December 23 segment on Andrew Napolitano's Judging Freedom show, former CIA analyst Ray McGovern envisages a hypothetical US-Russia compromise on the issue of Ukrainian membership for NATO. McGovern sees a discussion possibly leading to a thirty-five year wait before Ukraine could join the Euro Atlantic military alliance. I respectfully differ with him. For openers, there's no need for Russia to compromise on the subject of NATO membership for Ukraine. In an unintended roundabout way, the Jake Sullivans of the world acknowledge a Russian compromise on NATO expansion. After the start of Russia's Special Military Operation, Finland and Sweden joined NATO. These countries had already been working towards closer military contacts with that alliance. Sullivan & Company express glee over these additions. Let them gloat. Having Sweden and Finland in NATO will be an added burden for Brussels and its two newest members. If the choice is Sweden and Finland versus Ukraine in NATO - Russia is more comfortable with the former. When compared to the two Scandinavian countries, Russia and Ukraine have a longer border, in addition to these two former Soviet republics having close historical and cultural ties going back to the pre-Mongol subjugated Rus period. McGovern says a Russian agreed thirty-five-year wait for Ukrainian NATO membership could see the eventual demise of that organization, thereby making the issue irrelevant. He doesn't deny this might not happen. The Russians are perfectly aware of that as well. It's therefore imprudent for Moscow to play Russian roulette with its future, when Russia has the upper hand in the NATO proxy war against it. History isn't clearcut when it comes to old divisions disappearing and periodic conflicts reigniting. This very point brings to mind the comments of Andrey Martyanov on Garland Nixon's December 19 show. Martyanov notes the Napoleonic and Nazi invasions of Russia involved numerous other Europeans besides French (regarding 1812) and Germans (in 1941). He depicts a wide scale anti-Russian sentiment throughout Europe. There's nonetheless reason to believe that better times can ultimately prevail. There're intelligent folks in the West who don't buy into the anti-Russian BS. The past wasn't always so uniformly confrontational. In the Napoleonic instance, Russia was allied with Prussia, Austria and Britain. During WW II, numerous Europeans and the US sided with the USSR. In the EU, the Slovak and Hungarian governments correctly see post-Soviet Russia for what it actually is. The overall public opinion in Bulgaria is favorable to Russia. There're potentially positive signs elsewhere in the EU and the rest of the world. When the USSR broke up, I welcomed the possibility of Russia being positively engaged with NATO and the EU. This view was shared by many, if not most Russians including Vladimir Putin. This didn't happen on account of Western based anti-Russian prejudices getting the upper hand. It has been noted on Napolitano's and Nixon's shows that the incoming Trump administration has expressed some faulty views on Russia's situation, relative to the NATO proxy war against it. (This has also been noted by others, among some of them: The Duran, Deep Dive, and my prior commentary.) The truth can be hidden for only so long. A return of top-level US-Russian interaction will give President elect Donald Trump and hopefully the rest of his cabinet a better idea of Russia's situation and ability to carry on with its objectives. Moscow is understandably unsupportive of any frozen conflict which down the road could very well thaw into a future armed conflict. Within reason, Russia wants a settlement. As I informally proposed to a select group, a way out of the NATO issue would be to formally declare that Ukraine can only join NATO if Russia does so as well. In this hypothetical scenario, should Russia reject a NATO offer to join, Ukraine wouldn't be able to enter as well. This idea jives well with the OSCE Astana and Istanbul declarations (signed respectively in 1999 and 2010), noted in my February 1, 2022 article. These declarations stipulate that an expanded military bloc shouldn't threaten another country. At present, Russia is understandably reluctant and likely uninterested to join an organization dominated by anti-Russian elements. There's also the matter of Russia not wanting to upset its relationship with China. The two countries share a large border and see the wisdom of having a peaceful economic relationship. In recent years, NATO has been negatively posturing towards China. The Russo-Sino relationship kind of reminds me of the Franco-German experience. Unlike the farcical neocon/neolib views of Russia within the German and French political establishments, Berlin and Paris appear to have prudently overcome their violent past. The current Russo-Sino situation has been belittled by some in the West, who recall the post-Stalin differences between the USSR and China. In the 1970s, these likeminded Western prognosticators weren't so pessimistic on the noticeably improved Sino-West relations of that period. During the Korean War, large detachments of Americans and Chinese fought each other. For good reasons, the British imperialist history in China isn't fondly regarded by many Chinese. The Chinese compete via commerce as opposed to stationing military bases all over the world and getting militarily engaged in armed conflicts. I recall incoming US Vice President JD Vance noting China's success in Africa due to Beijing building civilian infrastructure (hospitals, schools and roads). Vance added the US falls short in that regard by comparatively linking such aid with trying to influence how these societies should be governed. US supported governments can expect to have any human rights abuses downplayed by Washington, in exchange for geopolitical subservience. Outside the Collective West, the world at large sees thru the inconsistency of applied standards. Concerning Romania, there was little if any Western mainstream outrage when the NATO/EU friendly Romanian political establishment annulled a recent election because the result wasn't to their liking. On the other hand, there has been considerable Western meddling in Georgia because the elected Georgian government doesn't agree with some core EU/NATO preferences. As suggested in my October 17 article, the Western zero-sum game stance taken against Georgia serves to better position Russian influence in that former Soviet republic. Relative to a Russian-Ukrainian reconciliation at some future point, I haven't received pushback to my stated observation of December 12, 2023, on how well Americans were accepted in Germany and Japan not too long after US forces killed many German and Japanese civilians. Time can heal especially when it becomes clearer that events weren't as good versus evil as depicted.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWcuP41_xGFrMgnOdx4v8B2V	2024-12-26T15:52:49-08:00	
The Syrian Refugees In A Post-Assad Era – OpEd	The Syrian refugee crisis is one of the most harrowing humanitarian catastrophes of the 21st century. Triggered by a civil war that erupted in 2011, the conflict displaced more than 13 million Syrians, half of the country’s pre-war population. Among these, approximately 6.8 million sought refuge abroad, primarily in neighboring countries such as Turkey, Lebanon, and Jordan, as well as in Europe and beyond. Their plight became a symbol of human suffering, resilience, and the challenges of global solidarity. Now, with the fall of Bashar Assad, some Western countries have initiated efforts to repatriate Syrian refugees, citing changing conditions on the ground. However, the complexities of Syria’s devastated economy, crumbled infrastructure, and societal scars warrant a more cautious approach to repatriation. During the civil war, many Syrians risked perilous journeys across the Mediterranean to seek safety in Europe. Images of overcrowded boats and tragic drownings stirred global attention, yet responses varied widely. Some countries opened their doors, while others closed borders or erected barriers to limit the influx. The refugee crisis underscored profound challenges: the strain on host countries’ resources; the difficulty of integrating large refugee populations; and the enduring trauma faced by those who fled. Syrians struggled to find stable employment, access to healthcare, and secure education for their children. Despite these hardships, many often clung to the hope of returning home. While the fall of Assad marks a significant turning point, Syria appears to be far from ready to accommodate the return of millions of its displaced citizens. The war’s toll on the country’s economy and infrastructure is staggering. Entire cities lie in ruins, with essential services like water, electricity, and healthcare severely compromised. According to estimates, rebuilding Syria could take hundreds of billions of dollars and decades of effort. Roads, schools, hospitals and homes must be reconstructed before large-scale returns can be viable. The economic landscape is equally dire. Syria’s GDP has contracted sharply since the war began, and industries that once provided livelihoods for millions have collapsed. Agriculture, a cornerstone of the pre-war economy, has been devastated by conflict and climate change. Many factories and businesses have been destroyed or abandoned, leaving a vacuum of employment opportunities. Inflation and currency devaluation have rendered basic goods unaffordable for much of the population. For those who do return, the challenges are formidable. Housing is one of the most immediate and pressing issues. Many refugees’ homes have been destroyed, seized, or occupied by others. Legal disputes over property rights are likely to be widespread, particularly in a country where documentation was lost or destroyed during the war. Economic reintegration poses another major hurdle. With high unemployment and limited job opportunities, returnees may struggle to support themselves and their families. Skilled workers may find that their professions are no longer viable due to the destruction of infrastructure or shifts in the economy. Farmers returning to rural areas may face land that has been rendered infertile by neglect or conflict. In urban areas, small businesses that once thrived may no longer have a customer base or the resources to restart operations. Access to basic services is another significant concern. Healthcare facilities are scarce and overwhelmed, with shortages of staff, equipment, and medicine. Schools have been destroyed or repurposed. Refugees returning to such conditions may find that their quality of life is no better — and perhaps worse — than in the countries where they sought asylum. In addition, the psychological toll of return cannot be overlooked. Many refugees have endured profound trauma, from witnessing violence to losing loved ones. Returning to a country that still bears the scars of war may exacerbate these mental health challenges. Support systems, such as counseling and community networks, are limited or non-existent in many parts of Syria. Despite these challenges, many Syrians hope that Syria can one day reclaim stability, security, and prosperity. After 13 years of relentless conflict, the prospect of peace may offer a glimmer of possibility for millions of Syrians longing for normalcy. With time, the reconstruction of infrastructure, the revival of the economy, and the healing of societal divisions can hopefully pave the way for a brighter future. The rebuilding of Syria’s infrastructure will be a monumental task, but it is essential for enabling refugees to return and rebuild their lives. Roads, bridges, and public services must be restored to connect communities and facilitate economic activity. Schools and hospitals must be reconstructed to provide education and healthcare, laying the foundation for a healthier and more prosperous society. Investments in renewable energy and modern technology could help Syria leapfrog some development challenges, creating opportunities for innovation and growth. As stability takes hold, the Syrian economy has the potential to recover and even thrive. Agriculture can be revitalized through investment in irrigation and sustainable practices. Industries such as manufacturing and construction can provide jobs and drive economic growth. Tourism, once a major contributor to Syria’s economy, could gradually rebound as historical sites are restored and security improves. The entrepreneurial spirit of the Syrian people, evident in the diaspora, can play a crucial role in rebuilding the nation. Social healing will be equally important. Programs aimed at reconciliation and community building can help bridge divides and foster a sense of unity. Education will be key to equipping the next generation with the skills and knowledge needed to rebuild their country. Cultural and artistic initiatives can celebrate Syria’s rich heritage and inspire a sense of shared identity. While the road ahead is long and fraught with challenges, the resilience of the Syrian people offers hope. For those who have endured unimaginable hardship, the dream of returning to a safe and thriving homeland is a powerful motivator. With patience and perseverance, many Syrians hope that their country can rise from the ashes of war, offering its citizens the security, stability, and opportunities they deserve. The international community will undoubtedly watch as the Syrian people work toward their hope of a brighter future, determined to rebuild their lives and their nation.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWcuP41_xGFrMpE1jK9dNXbn	2024-12-26T15:47:00-08:00	
Ghana’s New President Faces Looming Terrorism Threat – Analysis	Among the most pressing issues that must be addressed by Ghana’s new president, John Dramani Mahama, is devising and deploying a coherent, multifaceted approach to the growing threat of terrorist groups spilling south from the Sahel. Mahama, who held the same position from 2012 to 2017, made the country’s economic crisis his dominant platform, and experts have long called for much more investment in the north to complement Ghana’s military approach to preventing militants from gaining ground. He is originally from Damongo in northern Ghana, which raises hopes that he will restore peace to the region. 'Expectations of Ghanaians are very high, and we cannot afford to disappoint them,' Mahama said in his victory speech. 'Our best days are not behind us. Our best days are ahead of us. Forward ever, backwards never.' Extremist militants from the Sahel already have established themselves inside of Ghana’s porous 600-kilometer border with Burkina Faso and are likely recruiting from marginalized communities in the north. 'The spillover risk is high,' Adam Bonaa, a security analyst with the Accra-based Institute of Security, Safety, Policy and Research, told The Africa Report magazine. Journalist Nosmot Gbadamosi has reported from northern Ghana for the past few years and said she has observed 'an alarming spike in criminality and violence' in remote border communities. 'Yet the young men whom I talked to said they engaged in criminal networks to smuggle gold, wood, weapons and machinery via Burkina Faso and Togo because they were jobless and poor,' she wrote for Foreign Policy magazine on November 20. 'Their motives were financial, not ideological. Indeed, hunger was the overriding factor.' Security experts have warned that the government must increase its presence in the north with services to address widespread poverty and unemployment, which has ballooned to nearly 15% nationwide. According to the World Data Lab, around 3.5 million men and 3.3 million women in Ghana are in extreme poverty, defined at a threshold of living on or below $2.15 a day. While Ghana’s military is well-regarded, it cannot prevent the spread of violent extremist groups on its own. Analyst R. Maxwell Bone has sounded alarms that rural communities are particularly exposed to the expansion of extremist groups. 'In Ghana, groups affiliated with JNIM and the Islamic State have established themselves as key nodes within the illicit gold trade, a major economic activity in the country’s north,' R. Maxwell Bone wrote in a September 2024 analysis for Foreign Policy magazine. 'Unless the militarized approach is replaced with one with an emphasis on mitigating the social exclusion that has rendered communities vulnerable to violent extremist recruitment, the security situation will continue to deteriorate.' The United States in March 2024 announced $100 million in aid to support conflict prevention and stabilization efforts in Ghana, Benin, Côte d’Ivoire, Guinea and Togo — all of which border Sahel terrorism hot spots in Burkina Faso, Mali and Niger. The European Union also provided military assistance in 2024 to bolster Ghana’s defense against radicalization. About 4 kilometers from Ghana’s northern border with Burkina Faso, the town of Bawku starkly embodies the country’s internal challenges. Hospitals, banks and schools have shut down, as deadly attacks between the Kusasi and Mamprusi ethnic groups have intensified. 'Bawku’s lawlessness offers fertile ground for their expansion,' Bonaa said. 'The Sahel’s terrorist networks see any vacuum as an opportunity.' Mahama Ayariga, a local member of parliament, is gravely concerned that Bawku, like so many border communities, urgently needs government and military intervention. 'The violence here is heartbreaking,' he told The Africa Report. 'If this isn’t addressed soon, Bawku will become Ghana’s weak link in the fight against terror.'	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWcuP41_xGFrMqGEg7ObxiL7	2024-12-26T15:44:22-08:00	
Ukraine Recovers After ‘Inhumane’ Christmas Day Attacks; Biden Vo...	(RFE/RL) -- 'Massive' Russian attacks on Ukrainian infrastructure showed no letup as night fell on Christmas Day following what President Volodymyr Zelenskiy called an 'inhumane' assault by the Kremlin’s forces – leaving hundreds of thousands in the bitter cold without heating and causing blackouts in the capital, Kyiv. 'Today, [Russian President Vladimir] Putin deliberately chose Christmas to attack,' Zelenskiy said on December 25, adding that Moscow continues to 'fight for a blackout' throughout the country. 'What could be more inhumane? More than 70 missiles, including ballistic missiles, and more than a hundred attack drones.' The Russian Defense Ministry, meanwhile, claimed its forces had conducted a 'massive strike' on critical energy sites that were supporting Ukraine’s 'military-industrial complex.' 'The aim of the strike was achieved. All facilities have been hit,' the ministry said in a statement. In Washington, U.S. President Joe Biden, who will leave office on January 20, offered new support and further aid for Ukraine in the face of the Christmas Day attacks. 'In the early hours of Christmas, Russia launched waves of missiles and drones against Ukrainian cities and critical energy infrastructure,' Biden said in a statement. 'The purpose of this outrageous attack was to cut off the Ukrainian people’s access to heat and electricity during winter and to jeopardize the safety of its grid.' He added that 'the United States and the international community must continue to stand with Ukraine until it triumphs over Russia’s aggression.' 'I have directed the Department of Defense to continue its surge of weapons deliveries to Ukraine, and the United States will continue to work tirelessly to strengthen Ukraine’s position in its defense against Russian forces,' he said. Regional governors reported that six people were injured in the northeastern city of Kharkiv and one person was killed in the Dnipropetrovsk area, as residents struggled to recover amid the freezing cold. Governor Oleh Syniehubov also reported 'damages to civilian nonresidential infrastructure' in the regional capital of Kharkiv . Kharkiv came 'under a massive missile attack,' Mayor Ihor Terekhov said on the Telegram social media platform. 'A series of explosions was heard in the city and there are still ballistic missiles heading toward the city,' Terekhov wrote early on December 25. Ukrainian authorities reported that there was no letup in drone attacks into the evening of December 25, with areas around Kharkiv, Dnipropetrovsk, and Chernihiv being targeted. In Ukraine, where a majority of Christians identify as Orthodox Christians, this was the second Christmas that was officially designated by the government to be observed not on January 7, but on December 25, in line with Roman Catholic and many Western Christian traditions. In Russia, home to the largest number of Orthodox Christians, believers still celebrate Christmas on January 7. From outside the country, British Prime Minister Keir Starmer also condemned what he called an 'ongoing assault on Ukraine's energy infrastructure.' 'I pay tribute to the resilience of the Ukrainian people, and the leadership of President Zelenskiy, in the face of further drone and missile attacks from Putin's bloody and brutal war machine with no respite even at Christmas,' Starmer said in a statement. Pope Francis, in his Christmas address, made an urgent plea for 'all people, all peoples, and nations [to] silence the weapons and overcome divisions.' 'Let there be silence of the weapons in martyred Ukraine,' Francis said while calling for negotiations to 'achieve a just and lasting peace' in the war-torn country. Ukrainian Energy Minister Herman Halushchenko said that Russia was 'again massively attacking the energy sector' on December 25. 'The transmission system operator is taking the necessary measures to limit consumption to minimize the negative consequences for the energy system,' Halushchenko wrote on Telegram. Dnipropetrovsk Governor Serhiy Lysak reported that the province had been under a 'major attack since the morning,' with Russian forces 'trying to destroy the region's power system.' Air raid sirens rang out across Ukraine in the early morning, while the country’s air force reported that Russian Kalibr cruise missiles had been launched from the Black Sea. Since the start of the war in February 2022, Russia has repeatedly attacked Ukraine’s energy sector, severely damaging the country’s power grid and causing frequent outages. In a similar attack on December 13, more than 90 missiles and more than 200 drones were used -- but 81 of the missiles were shot down, according to Zelenskiy. Inside Russia, authorities said the Ukrainian military attacked the city of Lgov in the Kursk region, hitting a residential building and killing four people. It wasn't immediately clear if the damage was caused by drones or shelling. Russian officials also reported Ukrainian drone attacks in the Belgorod region and Voronezh regions. The reports could not immediately be verified.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWcuP41_xGFrMnQLtH_1CJh_	2024-12-26T15:42:30-08:00	
Russian Air-Defense System Downed Azerbaijan Plane, Sources Say	(EurActiv) -- Russian air defences downed an Azerbaijan Airlines plane that crashed in Kazakhstan, killing 38 people, four sources with knowledge of the preliminary findings of Azerbaijan's investigation into the disaster told Reuters on Thursday (26 December). Flight J2-8243 crashed down on Wednesday in a ball of fire near the city of Aktau in Kazakhstan after diverting from an area of southern Russia where Moscow has repeatedly used air defence systems against Ukrainian drone strikes. The Embraer passenger jet had flown from Azerbaijan's capital Baku to Grozny, in Russia's southern Chechnya region, before veering off hundreds of miles across the Caspian Sea. It crashed on the opposite shore of the Caspian after what Russia's aviation watchdog earlier said was an emergency that may have been caused by a bird strike. Officials did not explain why it had crossed the sea. The nearest Russian airport on the plane's flight path, Makhachkala, was closed on Wednesday morning. One of the Azerbaijani sources familiar with Azerbaijan's investigation into the crash told Reuters that preliminary results showed the plane was struck by a Russian Pantsir-S air defence system. Its communications were paralysed by electronic warfare systems on the approach into Grozny, the source said. 'No one claims that it was done on purpose. However, taking into account the established facts, Baku expects the Russian side to confess to the shooting down of the Azerbaijani aircraft,' the source said. Three other sources confirmed that the Azeri investigation had come to the same preliminary conclusion. Russia's Defence Ministry did not respond to a request for comment. Kazakh Deputy Prime Minister Qanat Bozymbaev said he could neither confirm nor deny the thesis that Russian air defences downed the plane. Asked about the possibility that Russian air defences shot at the plane, the Kazakh transport prosecutor for the region where the plan came down said the investigation had not come to a firm conclusion yet. The Kremlin, asked before the Reuters report about the idea that the aircraft had been shot at by Russian air defences, said that an investigation was ongoing and that it would be improper to comment until the inquiry came to its own conclusions. 'It is wrong to build hypotheses before the conclusions of the investigation,' Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said. Wreckage Footage shot by passengers on the plane before it crashed down showed oxygen masks down and people wearing life vests. Later footage, showed bloodied and bruised passengers climbing out of the plane. There were 29 survivors. Pictures of the plane wreckage showed what appeared to be some sort of shrapnel damage to the tail section of the plane. Aviation security firm Osprey Flight Solutions said in an alert to airlines on Wednesday that footage of the wreckage and the circumstances around the air space in southwest Russia indicated the possibility that the airliner was hit by some form of anti-aircraft fire. Ukrainian military drones have repeatedly targeted Russia's southern regions in recent months, triggering Russian air defences. Russia and Ukraine have been at war since Moscow's invasion of its neighbour in February 2022. Earlier on Wednesday, the Russian Defence Ministry had reported the downing of 59 Ukrainian drones over several regions. Some were reportedly shot down in closed air space over regions bordering Ukraine, including the Sea of Azov. Flight operations were reportedly temporarily suspended at Russia’s Kazan Airport due to the activity. In addition, publicly available ADS-B flight tracking data shows that the Azerbaijani aircraft experienced GPS jamming throughout its flight over southwest Russia, the alert said. Russia uses advanced electronic jamming equipment to confuse Ukrainian drone location and communication systems and a large number of air defence systems have been deployed to shoot down the drones. The US National Security Council referred queries to Azerbaijani and Kazakhstani officials as the investigation continues.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWcuP41_xGFrMjQiPXg-0Q6P	2024-12-26T15:40:41-08:00	
Taiwan Seeks Clarity On Trump Team Policy Amid Chinese Pressure –...	By William Yang As the world prepares for U.S. President-elect Donald Trump’s return to the White House, Taiwan finds itself sandwiched between Washington and Beijing as it grapples with uncertainties about the outlook of U.S.-Taiwan relations and growing military pressure from China. Trump has already picked several politicians known for their hawkish stances on China as potential nominees for his Cabinet, including Marco Rubio and Mike Waltz, but analysts say the president-elect's comments about Taiwan on the campaign trail and in recent interviews have not offered much clarity about how he might handle one of Washington’s most delicate relationships. 'We don't know if [Trump] means it when he wants to return the United States to a more isolationist position,' said J. Michael Cole, a Taipei-based senior fellow with the Global Taiwan Institute. During an interview with Bloomberg Businessweek in July, Trump said Taiwan should pay the United States for defense and compared U.S. military spending on Taiwan to an insurance policy. 'I know the people very well. Respect them greatly. They did take 100% of our chip business. I think Taiwan should pay us for defense,' he said. In October, Trump pledged to impose additional tariffs on China if Beijing were to 'go into Taiwan.' 'I would say: If you go into Taiwan, I'm sorry to do this, I'm going to tax you, at 150% to 200%,' the President-elect said during an interview with The Wall Street Journal. In his first post-election interview with NBC News on Dec. 8, Trump didn’t publicly say whether the U.S. would militarily defend Taiwan in the event of a Chinese invasion. 'I’d prefer that they don’t do it,' Trump said, adding that he has a 'very good relationship' with Chinese President Xi Jinping and that the two have been communicating since last month’s election. During his time in office, U.S. President Joe Biden has on multiple occasions said his administration would defend Taiwan if it was attacked. Not panicking, but concerned Some Taiwanese residents worry about what they describe as a lack of clarity from the Trump administration. 'I’m slightly concerned about how Trump’s return to the White House might affect relations between the U.S. and Taiwan because he always prioritizes U.S. interests, which makes it hard to predict how his administration might form their Taiwan policies,' Angel Chi, a 28-year-old medical worker, told VOA in a recent interview on the streets of Taipei. Others say while Trump’s position on Taiwan seems uncertain, they do not think his administration will reduce support for Taipei. 'I still have faith in the U.S. democratic system because he can’t decide everything by himself,' Christine Chiu, a 42-year-old accountant, told VOA. The strong bipartisan support for Taiwan in Congress and some potential Trump Cabinet members’ track records on foreign policy could prevent U.S.-Taiwan relations from undergoing major changes during Trump’s second term, experts said. 'I don’t think there is panic in Taipei because we dealt with this situation before and we have confidence in our congressional support in the U.S.,' said Lai I-Chung, president of The Prospect Foundation, a Taiwan-based think tank made up of academics and government officials. 'The mood [in Taiwan] is we will be careful and watchful about the development, but we are not panicking,' he told VOA in an interview in Taipei. Taiwan-US relations In recent weeks, Taiwan’s government has been reaching out to Republican congressional leaders and Trump’s transition team. Taiwanese President Lai Ching-te spoke with U.S. House of Representatives Speaker Mike Johnson on the phone during his first overseas trip to the Pacific region in early December. On that trip, Lai had stopovers in Hawaii and the U.S. territory of Guam. Additionally, two senior national security officials from Taiwan traveled to the U.S. last week to meet members of Trump’s transition team, hoping to establish ties before next month’s inauguration, Reuters news agency reported last on Dec. 19. Cole said there should be enough 'institutional resistance' in the U.S. government to prevent longstanding policies toward Taiwan from being abruptly altered. During a regular press conference on Dec. 6, China’s Foreign Ministry responded to a question on Lai’s stopover in Guam and Hawaii and said, 'No one should underestimate the firm resolve, will and ability of the Chinese government and people to safeguard sovereignty and territorial integrity.' China’s military pressure campaign As Taiwan tries to deepen its engagement with U.S. officials and the incoming Trump administration, China has been increasing military pressure on the island throughout 2024. Beijing has conducted two blockade-style military exercises around Taiwan since Lai took office in May. Last week, Taiwan’s Defense Ministry said Beijing deployed the largest number of naval and coast guard vessels to regional waters in almost three decades. Apart from military exercises, China has increased pressure on Taiwan through a range of what are called gray zone operations, measures that involve irregular tactics but stop short of combat. China’s use of its coast guard to intimidate and test Taiwan is one example of those gray zone tactics. Beijing has repeatedly sent coast guard vessels to patrol waters near Taiwan’s outlying Kinmen and Matsu islands since February. Kinmen and Matsu are closer to China than they are to the main island of Taiwan. The Prospect Foundation’s Lai said China has some coast guard vessels that are similar in size to naval destroyers, making it harder for Taiwan’s coast guard to respond proportionately. 'It would be difficult for Taiwan to [deploy] naval vessels against the Chinese coast guard, and when Taiwan responds by deploying its coast guard forces, the vessels are smaller ships [while] the Chinese coast guard vessels are as big as navy ships,' he told VOA. Countering China To counter the growing military pressure and gray zone operations from Beijing, Taiwan has incorporated more unscripted, real-combat drills into its annual military exercises. The island has also increased its defense budget in recent years, which is set to reach a new high of $19.74 billion dollars in 2025. This year, Taiwan’s government also established a committee to help strengthen the island’s civil defense capabilities. Cole said Taiwan still faces challenges in that regard. 'There is still quite a bit of resistance not only within the security apparatus and armed forces, which don’t like the idea of involving citizens in defense, the opposition parties have also sought to derail [relevant] plans and fundings,' he told VOA. What may come next depends on Taiwan’s actions and Beijing’s assessment of Trump’s policies toward the island after he takes office in January.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWcuP41_xGFrMtybhY9v9IG4	2024-12-26T15:38:01-08:00	
Notebook Found On North Korean Soldier Outlines Tactics For Count...	By Sangmin Lee and Jaewoo Park A North Korean soldier’s notebook described tactics for shooting down Ukrainian drones, including diagrams and details on how a three-person team should be used to lure and destroy the unmanned devices, the Ukrainian Special Forces said on Thursday on Telegram. The notebook was found on a dead soldier named Jong Kyong Hong in Russia’s Kursk region, according to the Telegram post. Radio Free Asia was unable to independently verify the information. About 50 North Korean soldiers were killed in Ukrainian drone attacks in Kursk last week, according to South Korea’s spy agency. 'North Korean troops are being ‘consumed’ for front-line assaults in an unfamiliar battlefield environment of open fields, and they lack the ability to respond to drone attacks,' said South Korea’s National Intelligence Service, as cited by lawmaker Lee Seong-kweun, who was briefed by the agency on Dec. 19. The Ukrainian Special Forces posted a photograph of the notebook in its Telegram post. A diagram shows one person standing in front of the drone as the other two team members are positioned behind it, preparing to shoot. 'When a drone is spotted, form a team of three,' writing in the notebook said. One person’s role is to lure in the drone from a forward position while maintaining a distance of about 7 meters (23 feet), the notes said. The other two should be ready to shoot the drone from a distance of 10 to 12 meters (32 to 40 feet), it said. 'When the person luring the drone stands still, the drone will also stop, making it possible for the two to aim and shoot it down,' the writing said. ‘Human bait’ The Ukrainian Special Forces deemed the method as 'living human bait.' The special forces said that it was unclear whether the tactic was unique to the North Korean military or if it was something that the Russian military had taught to them. Russian forces have complained that North Korean soldiers were a 'burden' because of their 'ignorance' of drone warfare, the South Korean spy agency said in its briefing last week. Initial evidence from Ukraine has shown that North Korean soldiers are ill-prepared and lack the skills for modern warfare, said Federico Borsari, a resident fellow at the Washington-based Center for European Policy Analysis. 'They lacked counter-drone equipment, and with little cover they were easy targets for Ukrainian FPV operators,' he said, using the initials for 'first-person view' –- a kind of drone that wirelessly transmits video feed. 'Many were killed while trying to hide among tall, dry grass crops and leafless tree lines,' he said. 'Snow –- and Ukraine’s thermal sensors -– made them easily identifiable as most of those soldiers didn’t wear white camouflage.' American, South Korean and Ukrainian authorities have said there are up to 12,000 North Korean soldiers in Russia, deployed there primarily to help Russia push Ukrainian forces out of positions they captured in Kursk in August. Earlier this week, Ukraine reported that more than 3,000 North Korean soldiers had been killed or wounded in Kursk. South Korea has estimated that the number of casualties among North Korean troops is at least 1,100. The Defence Intelligence of Ukraine, or DIU, noted on Dec. 17 that North Korean forces appeared to have taken additional measures to mitigate the threat of drone strikes. 'After serious losses, North Korean units began setting up additional observation posts to detect drones,' the DIU wrote in a post to its official Telegram channel. On Thursday, DIU said on its website that North Korea has added at least five more observation posts to improve its drone reconnaissance. It also said that Russian drone units have started providing tank and artillery support for North Korean troops during assaults. Recent footage had suggested that the North Koreans were sometimes receiving no assistance from Russian forces during combat.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWcuP41_xGFrMsQprKvkyXGe	2024-12-26T15:35:21-08:00	
WHO Chief Unharmed Following Israeli Airstrike At Yemen Airport	By Conor Lennon Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the head of the World Health Organization, has described the scene in Sana’a, Yemen, on Thursday, after Israeli aircraft bombed the airport, reportedly killing two people. Tedros was in Yemen to negotiation the release of UN staffers who have been held hostage by the Houthi movement for several months, and assess the health and humanitarian situation in the country. With the mission concluded, explained the WHO chief, he and his team were about to board their flight out of the country, when the airport came under attack. As well as two reported deaths, a member of his plane’s crew was injured. The air traffic control tower and the departure lounge were both damaged. Tedros and his team were just metres away but are unharmed. The strike is reportedly one of two that took place in Houthi-led Sana’a on Thursday, with the second hitting the Ras Issa port, killing one person. On behalf of WHO, Tedros sent his condolences to the families whose loved ones lost their lives in the attack.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWcuP41_xGFrMvZ4JDQt8owx	2024-12-26T15:32:01-08:00	
China Should Rethink It’s Myanmar Strategy – OpEd	China's continued support for Myanmar's military junta is not only morally questionable but also strategically short-sighted. By backing an unpopular regime whose grip on power is tenuous at best, against the clear wishes of the Myanmar people, Beijing risks severe long-term consequences for its regional influence and economic interests. Recent developments highlighting the resilience of resistance forces have exposed the flaws in Beijing's approach. Despite superior armaments, a comprehensive investigation by BBC World Service indicates that the military now maintains control over less than a quarter of Myanmar's territory, a clear indication of their waning authority. Meanwhile, the National Unity Government (NUG) enjoys overwhelming popular support, 92% according to a United States Institute of Peace (USIP) survey, with the majority of Myanmar's diverse population viewing it favorably. This groundswell of opposition to military rule is not a fleeting phenomenon but the culmination of 70 years of failed governance and oppression. China's backing of the junta exacerbates an already dire humanitarian crisis. As of early December 2024, approximately 3.4 million people were displaced within Myanmar. Myanmar's stability hangs by a thread. The junta's mismanagement has doubled poverty rates to 40% in 2022, creating an economic quagmire that threatens to engulf the region. The junta's grip on power is rapidly eroding, with resistance forces delivering historic defeats to the military in northern Myanmar. In a stunning turn of events, resistance forces in northern Myanmar delivered a historic defeat to the military in early August, toppling the northeastern command and bringing expansive territories across northern Shan State under their control. Recently the Kachin Independence Army (KIA) gained control of areas rich in rare earth elements (REEs) and the Arakanese Army (AA) has nearly gained control of the entire Rakhine state. On December 20, 2024, the AA claimed to have 'completely captured' the Western Regional Command headquarters in Ann, Rakhine state China's response has been both aggressive and counterproductive: Unleashing punitive measures targeting key resistance groups Cutting off resources to resistance forces Pressuring Ethnic Resistance Organizations (ERO) for ceasefires Tacitly approving military airstrikes with China-provided hardware Showering junta leader Min Aung Hlaing with unprecedented legitimacy Financing and technically assisting sham elections in 2025. The international community views China's support for the junta's proposed elections as endorsing a process designed to exclude genuine opposition. These actions not only exacerbate the humanitarian crisis but also alienate the Myanmar people, who overwhelmingly support the resistance movement. China’s actions have triggered worldwide protest rallies by the Myanmar diaspora which had been joined by Chinese dissidents and covered by their media in Los Angeles and San Francisco. The economic implications of China's misguided policy are becoming increasingly apparent to the Myanmar public. The China-Myanmar Economic Corridor (CMEC), with its oil and gas pipelines estimated at $2.5 billion and the $7.3 billion Kyaukphyu deep-sea port project, promises economic growth but at a severe cost. These projects have led to widespread land confiscation, displacing thousands without adequate compensation and sparking protests. Environmental degradation threatens local ecosystems and the livelihoods of communities dependent on agriculture and fishing. Myanmar's increasing dependence on Chinese investments raises concerns about national sovereignty and potential debt traps, which might limit its ability to negotiate favorable terms for future projects. Myanmar owes $4 billion of its $10 billion national debt to China, with Chinese loans carrying higher interest rates (up to 4.5%) compared to international lenders like the World Bank or the International Monetary Fund (IMF). These loans have been described as burdensome, particularly since they often finance projects of strategic value to China rather than benefiting local communities. The lack of transparency and high costs associated with these projects exacerbate concerns about falling into a debt trap. Resistance forces have shown remarkable resilience to Chinese pressure to stop fighting the junta, defying Beijing by continuing revolutionary activities. In a significant development, the Kachin Independence Army (KIA) on October 18, 2024, took control of Pang War township, bringing billions of dollars’ worth of rare earth mines under its control. This movement challenges China's dominance in the rare earth market and provides significant economic leverage to resistance groups. China announced on December 3, 2024, that it would ban the export of several rare minerals to the United States. Myanmar exported approximately 50,000 metric tons of rare earth oxides to China in 2023, surpassing China's own mining quota. The local Kachin population wants to suspend the production from these rare earth mines due to significant environmental damage which has severely affected the health and livelihoods of the local people. China imposed a trade embargo on the Kachin cutting off electricity and imports of essential goods, including fuel, chemicals, and food. The Kachins have not resumed the production of REEs to date. The embargo of essential goods imports was also imposed on the two members of the Three Brotherhood Alliance, T’ang National Liberation Army (TNLA) and Myanmar National Democratic Alliance Army (MNDAA), an armed resistance group operating in the Kokang region of Myanmar, to stop fighting the junta. While the EROs have not fully complied with China's demands, there are signs of impact: The TNLA and MNDAA have expressed willingness to participate in Chinese-brokered peace talks with the Myanmar junta. The trade restrictions have weakened the resistance groups both militarily and politically, making them more likely to comply with Beijing's demands. The pressure from China on these groups has been described as 'the most formidable in recent times. China's demand for a joint venture security company to protect its investments in Myanmar is particularly alarming. It is perceived by the Myanmar people as a thinly veiled attempt at direct territorial control, echoing neo-colonial practices that have no place in the 21st century. This move, along with China's shielding of the junta at the UN, is rapidly eroding any goodwill among Myanmar's populace. China's international standing, already under scrutiny, will suffer further if it continues to be seen as aligning itself with a regime facing potential war crimes charges. On November 27, 2024, the International Criminal Court (ICC) Prosecutor Karim Khan filed a request for an arrest warrant for Myanmar Junta's Senior General Min Aung Hlaing. The warrant was requested for crimes against humanity. The people of Myanmar are not seeking to become pawns in a geopolitical chess game. They desire a balanced foreign policy, neither pro-West nor pro-China, focused on mutual benefit and respect for sovereignty. By ignoring these aspirations, China risks pushing Myanmar closer to other regional powers, potentially losing influence in this strategically crucial nation. China has already lost the goodwill of the people of Myanmar. China has an opportunity to recalibrate its approach. Engaging with the NUG and ethnic armed organizations to support a peaceful transition to democratic rule would demonstrate true leadership. Prioritizing transparency, environmental protection, and local economic development in future projects would go a long way in rebuilding trust. Leverage China’s influence to encourage genuine political dialogue and reconciliation, rather than supporting the junta's flawed election plans would be very beneficial. Failure to do so not only betray the principles of non-interference that China claims to uphold but also jeopardizes its long-term strategic interests in Southeast Asia. If the people of Myanmar are left with nowhere to turn except to their own determination and hope, they will persevere to the last person. Unlike North Korea, Myanmar can't be easily isolated, thanks to Myanmar’s strategic location which resulted in China's intended use of Myanmar as a BRI hub. China faces a hard choice and needs to rethink.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWcuP41_xGFrMo-1QJZwmBIV	2024-12-26T15:30:19-08:00	
Navigating Power Poles: Kazakhstan’s Multi-Vector Diplomacy And R...	In 1991, the dissolution of the Soviet Union marked a seismic shift in the geopolitical landscape of Central Asia. This transformation, described by President Putin in 2005 as the 'greatest geopolitical catastrophe of the century,' presented Kazakhstan with unprecedented challenges, including economic instability and dependence on Russia. To navigate this turbulent period, Kazakhstan’s first president, Nursultan Nazarbayev, implemented a multi-vector diplomatic approach. This policy aimed to establish balanced and pragmatic relationships with multiple global powers while safeguarding Kazakhstan’s sovereignty and national interests. The essence of the multi-vector policy lies in fostering mutually beneficial cooperation with global powers such as Russia, China, the United States, the European Union, and others without becoming overly dependent on any single actor. By actively engaging with diverse partners, Kazakhstan has sought to assert its regional leadership and economic stability. Historical Context of Kazakhstan’s Multi-Vector Policy Before gaining independence, Kazakhstan and the broader Central Asian region were primarily resource extraction zones for the Soviet Union. Kazakhstan, rich in oil, gas, and minerals, also served as a nuclear testing site. The Soviet strategy of dividing ethnic groups and creating administrative boundaries ensured the region remained dependent and fragmented, preventing unified resistance. The disintegration of the Soviet Union in 1991 thrust Central Asian republics, including Kazakhstan, into uncharted waters. These nations, designed for governance under a centralized Soviet framework, found themselves ill-prepared for independence. In Kazakhstan, the transition to an independent government brought challenges such as hyperinflation following the collapse of the ruble zone, instability linked to neighboring Afghanistan, and issues like drug smuggling and human trafficking. Recognizing the need for a strategic response, President Nazarbayev adopted the multi-vector policy to reduce dependency on Russia and build diversified relationships with other global powers. The Inner Works of Multi-Vector Diplomacy Kazakhstan’s strategic positioning and richness in natural resources such as large reserves of oil and gas have made it more relevant in regional geopolitics. Kazakhstan has upheld delicate balance between the major powers through its multi-vector policy. Russia has also remained a player and influencer of key importance in the whole Central Asia region. Kazakhstan is a member of the Collective Security Treaty Organization (CSTO), meaning its military cooperation is joined with Russia and other former Soviet states. It also collaborates with Russia on regional security matters, especially concerning Afghanistan and Islamic extremism. Kazakhstan which is within the scope of Eurasian Economic Union (EEU), a Russia-led regional bloc that promotes free trade and closer economic relationships. Kazakhstan has treaded carefully in its dealings with Russia, asserting its independence when it matters. For instance, during Russia’s annexation of Crimea in 2014, Kazakhstan did not take sides and has even advocated for regional security that includes cooperation with the West, not just Russia. Kazakhstan's neutral attitude can also be observed through its position on the ongoing Russia-Ukraine war, which is a clear manifestation of its multi-vector policy. Kazakhstan has welcomed projects such as the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) with open arms, using Chinese investments to expand infrastructure and branch out partners. Kazakhstan’s relationship with the EU and the US also reflects its desire to expand partnerships outside of its immediate region, especially in sectors like energy exports and technology. This pragmatic stance has proved critical to maintaining Kazakhstan’s independence and strengthening its role domestically and abroad. Impact of Russia on the other Central Asian states Kazakhstan’s successful maintenance of this policy has established a growing divergence with the other Central Asian states, including Tajikistan, Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan, and Kyrgyzstan, which remain deeply embedded in diverse degrees of dependency on Russia. Tajikistan, for one, depends greatly on remissions from migrant workers in Russia that account for more than 30 percent of its G.D.P. and receives plenty of military assistance by way of a large Russian contingent at its 201st Military. Challenges such as drug smuggling and extremism along the Afghan border further deepen Tajikistan’s reliance on Moscow. However, the Russia-Ukraine conflict has disrupted remittance flows, exposing the vulnerabilities of this dependence. Similarly, Uzbekistan, under President Shavkat Mirziyoyev, has attempted to adopt a balanced foreign policy but remains economically tethered to Russia due to its reliance on Russian energy infrastructure. Despite withdrawing from the Collective Security Treaty Organization (CSTO), Uzbekistan’s limited diversification options and ongoing cooperation with Russia on regional security issues hinder its multi-vector aspirations. Turkmenistan’s dependence on Russia is particularly evident in its natural gas exports, heavily tied to the Gazprom-Turkmenistan partnership, which grants Moscow significant influence over the Turkmen economy. The country’s avoidance of engaging with Western or regional multilateral organizations further restricts its capacity for multi-vector diplomacy. Meanwhile, Kyrgyzstan’s economic and security reliance on Russia is underscored by remittances from workers in Russia and its alignment with Moscow’s defense policies as a CSTO member. Collaborative military initiatives highlight Russia’s sway, preventing Kyrgyzstan from achieving strategic independence. Kazakhstan’s multi-vector diplomacy has established it as a regional leader, enabling it to maintain balanced relations with major powers while safeguarding its sovereignty. This approach leverages Kazakhstan’s geographic and resource advantages effectively. In contrast, the economic and security dependencies of other Central Asian nations on Russia underscore the difficulties of implementing a truly balanced foreign policy. As Kazakhstan continues to navigate the complexities of regional and global geopolitics, its multi-vector strategy serves as a model for other nations aspiring to assert their independence in a multipolar world. By fostering diverse partnerships and maintaining strategic autonomy, Kazakhstan exemplifies the potential of pragmatic diplomacy in securing national interests and achieving regional leadership. Kazakhstan’s Independent Stance in International Relations Kazakhstan’s approach during the Russia-Ukraine war serves as a compelling demonstration of its independent foreign policy, shaped by its multi-vector strategy. This strategy emphasizes maintaining balanced relationships with multiple global powers while safeguarding national sovereignty and adhering to international law. Kazakhstan’s responses to the conflict highlight its nuanced diplomacy and commitment to neutrality, even when dealing with its most influential neighbor, Russia. 1. Refusal to Recognize Russia’s Annexation of Ukrainian Territories Kazakhstan has consistently upheld Ukraine’s territorial integrity. It refused to recognize Russia’s annexation of Crimea in 2014 and reiterated this stance during the 2022 annexation of the Donetsk, Luhansk, Zaporizhzhia, and Kherson regions. President Kassym-Jomart Tokayev publicly declared at the St. Petersburg International Economic Forum in June 2022 that Kazakhstan does not acknowledge 'quasi-state territories.' This explicit statement underscores Kazakhstan’s firm position against violations of international borders. 2. Neutrality in UN Resolutions Kazakhstan’s stance at the United Nations further reflects its independent policy. The country abstained from key votes condemning Russia’s actions in Ukraine, opting instead to call for peaceful negotiations and adherence to international law. In March 2022, Kazakhstan abstained from voting on a resolution to suspend Russia from the UN Human Rights Council. These actions signal its reluctance to align fully with Moscow while maintaining a balanced position internationally. 3. Denial of Support for Russian Military Efforts Despite being a member of the Collective Security Treaty Organization (CSTO), Kazakhstan refused Russia’s request for military support in the Ukraine conflict. Kazakhstan emphasized that its CSTO commitments are strictly defensive, and it did not deploy troops to assist Russia. Additionally, the country declined to help Moscow evade Western sanctions, further highlighting its independent stance. 4. Hosting Russian Draft Dodgers Kazakhstan’s humanitarian response to Russia’s partial mobilization in September 2022 reinforced its neutral position. Thousands of Russian citizens fled to Kazakhstan to escape conscription, and the Kazakh government allowed them entry and residency. President Tokayev affirmed Kazakhstan’s commitment to humanitarian principles, stating that the country would not deport individuals fleeing conscription. 5. Providing Humanitarian Aid to Ukraine In a clear signal of neutrality and support for humanitarian principles, Kazakhstan sent multiple shipments of aid to Ukraine. These shipments included medical supplies, food, and other essential goods, demonstrating Kazakhstan’s concern for the Ukrainian population’s suffering despite its economic ties with Russia. 6. Economic Diversification Amid Sanctions The sanctions imposed on Russia following the invasion of Ukraine pushed Kazakhstan to diversify its trade routes. The country actively pursued alternatives to Russian transit infrastructure by developing the Trans-Caspian International Transport Route (Middle Corridor), connecting Kazakhstan to Europe via the Caspian Sea, Azerbaijan, and Turkey. This move reflects Kazakhstan’s proactive efforts to mitigate risks associated with overreliance on Russian infrastructure. 7. Advocacy for Peace and Dialogue Throughout the conflict, Kazakhstan has consistently called for a peaceful resolution and dialogue between Russia and Ukraine. President Tokayev offered Kazakhstan as a neutral venue for potential peace talks, reinforcing the country’s image as a mediator committed to stability and international law. 8. Reaffirming Domestic Policy Independence Kazakhstan’s independence extends beyond its foreign policy. It resisted Russian pressure to align its domestic policies more closely with Moscow, refusing to implement counter-sanctions against Western countries. President Tokayev emphasized the importance of adhering to international law and safeguarding Kazakhstan’s sovereignty, further distancing the country from Russia’s geopolitical agenda. Kazakhstan’s actions during the Russia-Ukraine war illustrate its ability to maintain an independent and balanced foreign policy under its multi-vector strategy. By refusing to recognize Russia’s territorial claims, abstaining from aligning with Russia at international forums, hosting Russian draft dodgers, and providing humanitarian aid to Ukraine, Kazakhstan reaffirmed its sovereignty and adherence to international norms. These steps showcase the country’s commitment to neutrality, sovereignty, and regional leadership, setting a notable example for other nations navigating complex geopolitical landscapes. Challenges of Kazak’s Policy Kazakhstan’s multi-vector policy has been pivotal in maintaining balanced relations with global powers, but it is not without significant challenges. These challenges stem from geopolitical, economic, and regional factors, as well as internal vulnerabilities. Below is an analysis of the major obstacles Kazakhstan faces in implementing its multi-vector strategy effectively: 1. Geopolitical Pressures from Major Powers Russia's Influence: Kazakhstan shares a long border with Russia and has historical, cultural, and economic ties with Moscow. Russia's assertive foreign policy and dominance in the region, particularly through organizations like the Eurasian Economic Union (EAEU) and the Collective Security Treaty Organization (CSTO), exert considerable pressure on Kazakhstan to align with its interests. China’s Growing Dominance: China's Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) has deepened its economic influence in Kazakhstan, particularly through infrastructure projects and energy investments. This growing dependence risks Kazakhstan being overly influenced by Beijing, limiting its ability to maintain an independent stance. Balancing the West: While Kazakhstan seeks closer ties with the European Union and the United States, these relationships can provoke suspicion and countermeasures from Russia and China. Western emphasis on human rights and governance reforms also poses challenges to Kazakhstan’s domestic policies. 2. Economic Dependencies Reliance on Energy Exports: Kazakhstan's economy heavily depends on oil, gas, and mineral exports, which makes it vulnerable to fluctuations in global commodity prices. Russia and China are significant markets for these exports, creating dependency risks. Sanctions and Regional Isolation: Western sanctions on Russia due to the Ukraine conflict have disrupted regional trade and affected Kazakhstan’s ability to balance its economic partnerships. Limited Economic Diversification: Despite efforts to develop non-resource sectors, Kazakhstan remains heavily reliant on its extractive industries, making it challenging to pivot towards new markets. 3. Regional Stability and Security Proximity to Afghanistan: The instability in Afghanistan, particularly after the U.S. withdrawal and the Taliban's return to power, poses security risks, including drug trafficking, extremism, and cross-border instability. Ethnic Tensions and Border Disputes: Kazakhstan's diverse ethnic composition and long borders with neighboring states can lead to internal and external tensions, complicating its regional relationships. Water and Resource Conflicts: Central Asian nations, including Kazakhstan, face disputes over water resources and energy-sharing agreements, adding stress to regional diplomacy. 4. Domestic Challenges Political Reforms and Stability: Kazakhstan has faced criticism over its slow pace of political reforms and allegations of authoritarian governance. These issues strain its relations with Western nations and hinder the development of a robust multi-vector strategy. Economic Inequality: Despite economic growth, wealth distribution remains uneven, creating social discontent that could undermine national stability. Ethnic and Linguistic Issues: Balancing the interests of the Kazakh majority and Russian-speaking minorities is an ongoing challenge, especially given Russia's interest in protecting Russian-speaking populations abroad. 5. Global Geopolitical Dynamics Russia-Ukraine War: Kazakhstan’s neutral stance during the Russia-Ukraine conflict has strained its relations with Moscow. Refusing to support Russia’s annexation of Ukrainian territories and hosting Russian draft dodgers has created diplomatic friction. U.S.-China Rivalry: The growing strategic competition between the U.S. and China forces Kazakhstan to navigate a highly polarized international environment, complicating its efforts to maintain balanced relations. 6. Institutional and Logistical Constraints Infrastructure Development: Kazakhstan's vast territory and landlocked position require significant investments in infrastructure to access global markets. Dependence on Russian transit routes and Chinese logistics limits its autonomy. Institutional Capacity: Implementing a multi-vector foreign policy requires a well-functioning diplomatic corps and robust institutions, which Kazakhstan is still developing. Kazakhstan’s multi-vector policy has positioned it as a key player in Central Asia, but its success depends on navigating these complex challenges. Addressing economic vulnerabilities, enhancing regional cooperation, and managing external pressures from global powers will be essential for Kazakhstan to maintain its strategic autonomy and continue leveraging its geographic and resource advantages. Benefits of Kazakhstan's Multi-Vector Foreign Policy Kazakhstan’s multi-vector foreign policy has been a cornerstone of its international strategy since gaining independence in 1991. This approach, rooted in pragmatism and neutrality, has enabled the country to balance relations with global powers, leverage its geographical and economic advantages, and maintain stability in a volatile region. Below is a detailed analysis of the key benefits of this policy: · Enhanced Sovereignty and Strategic Autonomy: Kazakhstan has maintained balanced relations with major powers like Russia, China, the United States, and the European Union, safeguarding its sovereignty and avoiding over-dependence on any single partner. Despite historical and economic ties with Russia, it has pursued an independent path, resisting undue influence, as demonstrated by its stance on the Russia-Ukraine war. Similarly, while China’s economic presence is significant, Kazakhstan has actively engaged with other partners to maintain a balanced relationship with Beijing. · Economic Diversification and Connectivity: The multi-vector approach has opened diverse avenues for economic growth and trade, reducing reliance on any single market or partner. The development of the Middle Corridor, connecting Kazakhstan to Europe via the Caspian Sea, Azerbaijan, and Turkey, diversifies export options and reduces dependence on Russian transit routes. By cultivating relations with Western countries, Kazakhstan has attracted investments in energy, infrastructure, and technology, complementing Chinese investments under the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI). These balanced relations allow Kazakhstan to secure competitive deals for its vast reserves of oil, gas, and minerals while ensuring the inflow of advanced technologies for resource extraction. · Regional Leadership and Stability: Kazakhstan’s multi-vector diplomacy positions it as a stabilizing force and leader in Central Asia. Its neutral stance in global conflicts, including offering to mediate the Russia-Ukraine war, enhances its image as a peacebuilder. Active participation in platforms like the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO), Eurasian Economic Union (EAEU), and Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) strengthens Kazakhstan’s influence in shaping regional and global agendas. · Strengthened International Partnerships: Kazakhstan’s foreign policy has enabled it to establish robust ties with diverse partners, ensuring flexibility to pivot to alternative allies if needed. Relations with the EU and the U.S. provide access to markets, technology, and development assistance, while ties with China, Turkey, and South Korea enhance its integration into the Asian economic and political landscape. Kazakhstan exemplifies balanced alliances by collaborating with Russia on security while engaging with the West on economic diversification. · Security and Defense Optimization: Kazakhstan’s multi-vector policy has reinforced its security framework without becoming entangled in conflicts. By abstaining from military alignments that could provoke major powers, it maintains strategic neutrality and minimizes external threats. Membership in the CSTO provides security guarantees from Russia while allowing Kazakhstan to assert its independent defense policies. · Diplomatic Prestige and Global Recognition: Pragmatic and balanced diplomacy has elevated Kazakhstan’s international profile. Hosting significant summits, such as the Astana Peace Talks on Syria and the Congress of Leaders of World and Traditional Religions, underscores its role as a trusted mediator. Chairmanship roles in organizations like the OSCE highlight its commitment to global stability and cooperation. · Promotion of National Development: The economic benefits and global partnerships arising from the multi-vector policy directly contribute to Kazakhstan’s domestic development. Collaborations with China and the EU have modernized infrastructure, enhancing connectivity and trade potential. Partnerships with Western nations have brought investments in education and technology, fostering innovation and creating a knowledge-based economy. · Mitigation of External Risks: Kazakhstan’s balanced foreign relations mitigate risks arising from regional conflicts or global power rivalries. Its neutral stance on the Russia-Ukraine conflict enables peaceful relations with Russia without alienating Western allies. Careful navigation of Western sanctions on Russia ensures Kazakhstan’s economy and trade remain unaffected. · Leverage of Geopolitical Position: Kazakhstan’s strategic location as a bridge between Europe and Asia makes it vital for transcontinental trade and energy transit. Its oil and gas exports to Europe, China, and other regions enhance its strategic importance, while participation in initiatives like the BRI boosts its role in global supply chains. · Cultural and Soft Power Diplomacy: The multi-vector policy enables Kazakhstan to showcase its cultural and historical significance, strengthening its soft power. Cultural exchange programs foster dialogue and mutual understanding with multiple regions. By promoting its Eurasian identity, Kazakhstan highlights its model of coexistence between diverse ethnic, religious, and cultural groups, reinforcing its role as a bridge between East and West. Conclusion Kazakhstan’s multi-vector foreign policy is a pragmatic and forward-thinking strategy that has enabled the country to navigate the complexities of global geopolitics effectively. By balancing relations with major powers, fostering economic growth, and maintaining regional stability, Kazakhstan has not only safeguarded its sovereignty but also emerged as a respected and influential player on the global stage. While challenges persist, the benefits of this approach significantly outweigh the risks, providing a robust framework for sustainable development and strategic autonomy.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWewwuioyKD5HGaXoVfxaADz	2024-12-26T10:07:51-08:00	
Self-Determination Of Tibet: A Contentious Issue – Analysis	Negotiations on self-determination of Tibet has been a contentious matter between the Tibetan ethnic minority and the PRC government. The PRC government has failed to implement in letter and spirit various laws which stipulate the establishment of autonomous regions for the ethnic minorities in China. By Opangmeren Jamir A diplomatic spat between the People’s Republic of China (PRC) and the United States (US) has ensued, following US President Biden signing the ‘Promoting a Resolution to the Tibet-China Dispute Act’ on 12 July 2024 into law.1 Reacting to the Act, China stated that the US is undermining the 'basic norms governing international relations' and should recognise Xizang (Tibet) as part of China. It urged the US not to support 'Tibet independence' which if it fails to do, 'China will take resolute measures to firmly defend its sovereignty, security and development interests'.2 Appraising the Act, along with the affirmation of upholding human rights and direct negotiations 'without preconditions' with the Dalai Lama in order to resolve the differences, are some of the fundamental aspects at stake for the ‘self-determination’ of Tibet. This Brief examines how the principle of self-determination has been contested between the Chinese government and the Tibetan ethnic minority. It begins with a review on how the principles of self-determination have been construed in international law. Self-Determination in International Law The principle of self-determination, which can be traced back to the French revolution in 1789 and the American Declaration of Independence of 1776, refers to the legal right of people to choose their own political destiny. In the contemporary period, it has been closely associated with US President Woodrow Wilson, when after the First World War, several new states were created from the losing powers of Germany, Austria-Hungary and the Ottoman Empire.3 Previously, self-determination was perceived as a ‘political concept’ but later on, it emerged as a 'principle of positive international law' based on the UN Charter as in Article 1(2), it is requisite that one of the purposes of the United Nations is to 'develop friendly relations among nations based on respect for the principle of equal rights and self-determinations of people'.4 The principle of self-determination has been addressed in several UN resolutions, declarations and conventions. However, it is an ‘elusive concept’, mainly due to an unclear definition of ‘people’, i.e., who are actually entitled to self-determination (for example, indigenous groups, religious groups and other minorities), resulting in various interpretations and significant implications in practice.5 One of the foremost legal rights for self-determination is the 'Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and People' adopted by UN General Assembly (GA) Resolution 1514 in 1960, where Para 1 declares, 'the subjugation of people to alien subjugation, domination and exploitation constitutes a denial of fundamental human rights' and is contrary to the UN Charter.6 These legal rights were primarily designed or interpreted to foster the decolonisation process and were upheld by the International Court of Justice in the Namibia case.7 Additionally, the application of self-determination beyond the anti-colonial dimension was adopted in 1970 by the UNGA, ‘Friendly Relations Declarations’ which entail the right of self-determination to all people freely 'without external interference, their political status and to pursue their economic, social and cultural development'.8 However, this legal document demands that self-determination be exercised cautiously, without disturbing the territorial integrity of the existing state. In other words, these legal rights are in line with ‘internal self-determination’, i.e., autonomy.9 In the case of internal self-determination, Article 1 of the two international Covenants of 1966—International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights—provides people the right to 'freely determine their political status and freely pursue their economic, social and cultural development'. Legal expert Antonio Cassese is of the view that all members of an inhabitant state have the right to express self-determination through 'internal-decision making processes', without disturbing the territorial integrity of sovereign states.10 Indeed, such rights have been recognised in the United Nations Declarations on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples, 2007 where Article 4 declares that indigenous people 'have the right to autonomy or self-government in matters relating to their internal and local affairs, as well as ways and means for financing their autonomous functions'.11 Although the core substance of self-determination infers secession or the ability to establish sovereign and independent states, in international laws, unilateral secession is not well received due to the fear of creating instability, when or if the right of self-determination is exercised by all who claim it. Former UN Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali thoughtfully said: 'if every ethnic, religious or linguistic group claimed statehood, there would be no limits to fragmentation and peace and security and economic well-being for all would become even more difficult to achieve.'12 Nonetheless, there are jurists that emphasise the applicability of self-determination to a particular group of people to secure their territorial sovereignty. Such kinds of self-determination are known as ‘remedial secession’ where self-determination is applied as a last resort or secession is justified, if any aggrieved group is severely persecuted by the state.13 Such legal rights are detailed in the UNGA Resolution 2625, which states that the territorial integrity of the state is protected, if the government is represented by 'the whole people belonging to the territory without distinction as to race, creed or color'.14 This clause implies that if any government is unrepresentative or oppressive, it may trigger secession. Meanwhile, some jurists also emphasise, if internal self-determination or say autonomy are flawed in implementation, secession should be seen as a matter of last resort. Negotiations for Tibetan Self-Determination On 13 February 1913, the 13th Dalai Lama formally declared the independence of Tibet, following the overthrow of Manchu Qing dynasty by the Chinese nationalist revolution in 1911.15 The historiography on whether Tibet is a part of China, however, is complicated as both sides have competing narratives.16 But one major historical event in which Tibet formally came under the control of China is when Chinese troops entered Tibet in 1950 and consequently signed the 'Agreement on Measures for the Peaceful Liberation of Tibet' (17 Point Agreement) on 23 May 1951.17 Subsequently, at the UNGA, numerous resolutions were passed calling for the right to self-determination for the Tibetan people but it was met with negligible support from the international community.18 Additionally, the UN Sub-Commission on Prevention of Discrimination and Protection of Minorities adopted a resolution on 23 August 1991 calling on the Government of the People’s Republic of China 'fully to respect the fundamental human rights and freedoms of the Tibetan people'.19 After decades of impasse, dialogue between the two sides commenced with a pre-condition that except for 'total independence' all other issues were open for discussion.20 Without substantial outcome, the talks ended in 1985 with the removal of Chinese representative Hu Yao-bang.21 Dialogue between the Tibetan and Chinese representatives, however, entered a new chapter following the Dalai Lama’s announcement of the 'Middle way approach', implying not seeking separation or independence of Tibet, but instead securing ‘genuine autonomy’ within the scope of the constitution of the People’s Republic of China.22 In order to achieve a genuine autonomy for Tibetan peoples, the Tibetan administration formulated a ‘Five point peace plan’ in 1987, the Strasbourg proposal in 1998 and the Memorandum on Genuine Autonomy in 2008. Dialogue between the two sides continued based on these three core documents, but ended abruptly in 2010 without any substantial outcome. In the negotiations between Tibetan representatives and the Chinese government, securing genuine autonomy for the Tibetan people has been a key issue, and has led to deadlock and pauses in the negotiation process. Hence, it is necessary and worthwhile to look into how the PRC government takes into account autonomy in relation to ethnic minorities. Assessment of ‘Autonomy’ Implementation in China Regional ethnic autonomy is supposed to be the core governance mechanism for ethnic minorities in China.23 Though the ‘Common Program’ and the 1954 Constitution of the People’s Republic of China (PRC) specify the establishment of regional autonomy, Chinese constitutional expert, Gao Quanxi has argued that the 1982 PRC Constitution as amended in 2018 has been infused with a legal attribute, which is aimed at ending incessant revolution, discarding absolute class struggle, substituted by 'dictatorship of the proletariat' with a 'people’s democratic dictatorship'.24 In the 1982 PRC Constitution, the preamble declares, 'China is a unified multi-ethnic state founded by the Chinese people of all ethnic groups' and opposes 'major ethnic group (Han) chauvinism'. Further, Article 4 stipulates the promotion of ethnic equality and unity, where discrimination and oppression of any ethnic groups is prohibited, and allows for the establishment of autonomous regions for self-governance while obliging that 'all ethnic groups shall have the freedom to use and develop their own spoken and written languages and to preserve or reform their own traditions and customs'.25 Additionally, based on the 1982 constitution, the National People’s Congress in 1984 adopted the 'Law on Regional Ethnic Autonomy' which was amended in 2001, strengthening and expanding the existing autonomous rights formulated in the 1982 constitution.26 Assessing implementation of the ethnic minorities’ policy by the PRC government, it is characterised as one of 'gradualism and pluralism' where until the late 1950s, a tolerant and benign attitude was practiced towards ethnic minorities by the PRC government.27 But from the 1960s onwards under the leadership of Mao, especially during the Cultural Revolution (1967–1976), the ethnic minorities experienced the most repressive and assimilative period in the history of PRC.28 Again from the 1970s, under the leadership of Deng Xiaoping, extreme assimilation of minorities ended and they began to make claims to uphold their rights to national autonomy. In the case of the Tibetan ethnic minority, though the demand for genuine autonomy by the Tibetan representative emerged more recently, essentially it was already featured way back in 17 Point Agreement in May 1951, as para 3 underlined that, 'the Tibetan people have the right of exercising national regional autonomy under the unified leadership of the Central People’s Government'.29 The PRC government, however, violated the agreement.30 To achieve the aspiration of autonomy for the Tibetan people, its representatives even submitted a 'Memorandum on Genuine Autonomy for the Tibetan People' in 2008 to the PRC government.31 The demand for autonomy in the memorandum was drafted in consonance with the PRC constitution and the Law on regional ethnic autonomy, which essentially addresses independently managing the internal affairs of Tibetans including language, culture, religion education, environment protection and utilisation of natural resources. The evaluation of autonomy implementation in the Tibet Autonomous Region, however, reveals policy swings between 'more tolerant and more repressive' by the PRC government.32 Ironically, one of the fundamental reasons why the PRC government rejected the Tibetan proposal of autonomy, and instead adopted a repressive policy towards the Tibetan ethnic minority, is due to 'fear of the external forces' of Western countries, especially the United States.33 The US policy on Tibet can be traced back to the 1940s, when the US government entered an agreement with Tibet to build a supply route through Tibet to China against Japanese attack. US policy on Tibet has been termed 'inconsistencies in commitment, interspersed with occasional bursts of sympathy and activism'34 mostly due to the impact of Cold War politics. Until 1970, Tibet was included in the US strategy to counter communist expansion in Asia. But it was weakened following the rapprochement of Sino-US relations in the 1970s.35 And conversely, the Soviet Union, which in the 1950s fully backed the PRC government claim to sovereignty over Tibet, began to condemn Chinese policy in Tibet as a 'colonial power'.36 Contrary to the Cold War period, however, Russia’s policy on Tibet 'seems to view the Tibetan issue in the context of Chechenya, unfortunately'.37 One major reason for the US leveraging of Tibetan separatism is based on the notion of a growing ‘China threat’ both in terms of military and economy, which the PRC government considers as a ‘containment policy’. Yet, US leveraging of Tibetan secession has consequences, especially for Tibetans in Tibet and also for the resolution of the Tibetan question. Sinologist Barry Sautman cautions that backing secession by great powers 'makes it harder for Tibetans in Tibet to seek self-representation without being suspected of pursuing secession' and also 'even makes it harder to resolve the Tibetan question'.38 Way Forward The President of the Central Tibetan Administration Penpa Tsering in September 2024 acknowledged that ‘back-channel’ talks between the two sides have been initiated.39 The PRC government has laid two conditions for resuming negotiations. First, as the Chinese government considers the Central Tibetan Government as an organised political group with an agenda for ‘Tibetan independence’, negotiations will be held 'only with the personal representatives of the 14th Dalai Lama'. And second, any contact or talks will only be about the personal future of the 14th Dalai Lama and the handful of people close to him, and not a ‘high degree of autonomy’.40 Meanwhile, external threat perceptions will significantly determine the outcome of negotiations. To preserve the territorial integrity and maintain amicable relations among the 56 ethnic groups in China, however, one fundamental key is to uphold the PRC constitution and the Law of ethnic regional autonomy in letter and spirit. The fact is Tibetans are not seeking separation from China and this was reiterated recently by the Dalai Lama when he stated 'We want to have full autonomy, as part of the People’s Republic of China.'41 Thus, much of the discontent among the minorities stems from incomplete or flawed implementation of China’s ethnic minority policies.

Keeping Ukraine Out Of NATO Will Not Advance Peace With Russia – ...	By Vladimir Socor The North Atlantic Treaty Organization’s (NATO) 'open door' policy toward membership-seeking countries was never intended as an across-the-board policy. It has been implemented on a case-by-case basis, sometimes contingent on opportunities. The acceptance of new member countries has not necessarily been merit-based by NATO’s declared criteria, and undeclared conditions played their role. The alliance’s open-door policy was not fully insulated from Russia’s nonstatutory blocking power, and NATO-aspirant countries’ path toward membership was not always irreversible. It has been closed when Russia stood forcefully across that path, as in Georgia’s case after 2008 and Ukraine’s after 2014. Considering the multi-dimensional accretion of power the West could have gained from Ukraine in the post-Soviet era, Ukraine is clearly the most convincing aspirant to NATO membership in terms of its added value. Foreclosing that possibility is what motivated, in part, Russia’s attack on Ukraine in 2014 and the ensuing low-intensity warfare against it. The Biden administration officially withdrew US political support for Ukraine’s NATO membership in 2021, joining European naysayers. At NATO’s Vilnius 2023 and Washington 2024 summits, the Biden administration led the way in delaying Ukraine’s membership prospects even further until 'conditions are met'—unspecified and without a timeframe—and replacing the unrequited 'open door' with a 'bridge' metaphor (see EDM, July 17, 18, September23, 25). Already by 2021, contrary to Moscow’s propaganda, Ukraine found itself farther removed from NATO membership than ever before. That and other concessions emboldened Russia to begin its full-scale invasion and set maximalist political objectives for its war, including further annexations of Ukrainian territories. Precluding whatever remains of Ukraine from joining NATO is a central war aim for Russia and the core of Russian political settlement proposals (see EDM, June 20). The incoming Trump administration in the United States and NATO itself face the challenge of overcoming this legacy. The question of post-conflict security guarantees for a territorially reduced Ukraine—whether in NATO or outside of the alliance—figures prominently in numerous unofficial and semi-official proposals. These proliferated during the 2023 military stalemate in Ukraine when inadequate Western support paved the way for the country’s de facto partition. President-elect Donald Trump is determined to end this war quickly, but his team has yet to outline how. The only certainty is that they expect European allies to bear the main burdens of guaranteeing Ukraine’s security (see EDM, July 2). The change of administrations in Washington has, therefore, intensified discussions among European NATO members over post-conflict security guarantees to Kyiv. Within NATO, a lowest-common-denominator consensus holds that Ukraine is not eligible for membership while at war with Russia, lest NATO itself be drawn into the war. A small but growing number of allied governments simply rule out Ukraine’s membership (at least for those serving governments’ remaining time in office). Some allies would postpone the consideration of Ukrainian membership until 'after the war' or pending a 'peace' settlement without defining those notions in any way. Some influential voices suggest that Kyiv should join NATO after 'freezing' the war along a stable armistice line, de facto accepting Ukraine’s partition, with NATO security guarantees applying de jure to the government-controlled territory only. For their part, Kyiv and supportive governments would effectively prejudge a decision by calling on NATO to invite Ukraine to commence accession talks without further delay, with the actual talks to proceed after an eventual ceasefire. These various proposals tend to use the terms 'end of war,' 'peace,' 'negotiated settlement,' 'armistice,' 'ceasefire,' or 'freeze' interchangeably. There are no commonly agreed definitions of these concepts among the allies, let alone between them and Russia. The confusion stems partly from Russia’s hybrid war strategy, which has erased any clear-cut distinctions between peace and war. This can further complicate the attainment of consensus in NATO regarding the prerequisites to Ukraine’s eventual accession. Nor is 'freezing the war' an option to be exercised unilaterally by Ukraine and its NATO partners. A Russia that has prevailed on the battlefield will likely persist with low-intensity warfare against Ukraine even after a 'freeze' is declared. It may prepare for 'unfreezing' it when convenient, as seen between the 2014–2015 Minsk armistice agreements and the 2022 all-out invasion. Absent a political consensus in NATO over Ukrainian membership, certain European allies are holding informal consultations about post-conflict security guarantees to Kyiv by NATO members outside of NATO’s framework. French President Emmanuel Macron initiated this process in February with an informal gathering of European heads of state and governments in Paris, which the Biden administration snubbed by sending an assistant secretary of state. Trump’s election in the United States has helped accelerate those discussions among European allies in various overlapping formats. Britain, France, Germany, and Poland are the most active participants, while Italy and Nordic countries are also expected to contribute to post-conflict security guarantees for Ukraine. Possible forms of military assistance and defense industry cooperation with Ukraine are also being considered below the level of security guarantees (PAP, November 12, 13; Le Monde, November 25; Die Welt, December 5, 13). The allies involved are receptive to some of Kyiv’s inputs. Options currently under discussion—all hypothetical at this stage in these formats—include: A 'coalition of the resolute' to deploy forces to Ukraine as part of a possible armistice package, deterring further Russian attacks; Allied troops to enforce an eventual armistice on the Ukrainian side of a demarcation line; Non-combat boots on the ground, far from the frontlines, performing logistical and technical assistance tasks to free up the corresponding Ukrainian personnel for frontline combat; and Air defenses in allied territory (Poland in this case) to target Russian missiles and drones in certain parts of Ukraine’s air space. These and other proposals had also been discussed in the run-up to NATO’s Washington summit, but have made no headway thus far. Those options presuppose acting outside NATO’s framework. Allies willing to consider those options believe, however, that they need to be covered by NATO’s security guarantees to deter and counter possible Russian retaliation. It seems, in this case, that coalitions of the willing venturing outside NATO’s framework cannot, after all, act without NATO’s collective consent. No viable substitute for NATO membership is discernible at this stage for Ukraine, and no alternative for the alliance itself if it is serious about securing Ukraine. To do so, European NATO allies embarking on that task would need to be covered by US extended nuclear deterrence as well as NATO Article Five coverage. Since 2022, Western allies have understood that any post-conflict security guarantees to Ukraine must be Western only, excluding Russia. Sequencing the process will be crucial. The guarantees would need to be nailed down by NATO and Ukraine in advance of, not as part of, any negotiations with Russia.

No Easy Courses For Chagos Consensus On Sovereignty And Security ...	The Chagos Archipelago dispute is a microcosm of the broader tensions shaping global maritime geopolitics. By Timothy Walker The United Kingdom’s (UK) October agreement to transfer sovereignty of the Chagos Archipelago to Mauritius appeared to address longstanding international legal issues surrounding decolonisation and provide a pathway for the resettlement of the Chagossian community. Yet, beneath the surface, the negotiation process reveals intricate undercurrents. These include the challenges of reconciling Mauritius’s sovereign rights with justice for the Chagossians and accommodating the strategic interests of the UK and United States (US) in maintaining their military foothold in the Indian Ocean. While the agreement was initially lauded, it has faced significant criticism. Many Chagossians have expressed feelings of marginalisation from the negotiation process. In the UK, some politicians denounced the deal despite their role in initiating the discussions, highlighting the domestic political complexity surrounding the issue. The outcomes of the November 2024 elections in Mauritius and the US have further complicated the negotiations’ trajectory. The October agreement, welcomed by the Biden administration, and the governments of the UK, Mauritius, and India, seemed particularly timed to preempt potential disruption from the US election. This strategy, however, has not insulated the deal from political shifts and leaves a fragile consensus amid political uncertainty. The ‘triple delegation’ model risks entrenching US dominance, raising doubts about its long-term viability Mauritius Prime Minister Navin Ramgoolam promptly signalled that his newly elected government would take a more assertive approach. His concerns over the terms and call for an independent review should help him avoid potential domestic backlash, as seen in controversies surrounding India’s construction of military facilities on the island of Agaléga. In the US, Donald Trump’s return to power introduces unpredictability. His transactionaldiplomacy style and willingness to renegotiate agreements based on narrow US interests potentially threaten the sustainability of the current framework. For India, which has supported Mauritius throughout this dispute, the resolution aligns with its broader strategic alignment with the US. Diego Garcia’s pivotal role in US strategy directly supports India’s regional ambitions, with both countries aiming to counter China’s influence in the Indian Ocean. Helping broker the Chagos agreement bolsters India’s regional influence. For Mauritius and India, challenging the US presence would risk straining relations at a time when all countries concerned are looking to benefit from enhanced partnerships. For example, the UK has sought a free trade agreement with India for years, and the October agreement removed a significant political barrier in these negotiations. Trump’s transactional diplomacy could derail the fragile framework underpinning the Chagos agreement The Chagos Archipelago negotiations must clear several intricate sovereignty hurdles. The proposed solution involves a ‘triple delegation’ of authority, with the UK, Mauritius and the US. This model raises significant concerns about its practicality, legality, and long-term viability. From a strategic perspective, it appears the likely arrangement disproportionately benefits the US. It grants Washington operational control over Diego Garcia, while Mauritius leases the territory to the UK, which in turn facilitates US military activities. Agreements governing similar basing arrangements in the past (and which continue in places such as Guantanamo Bay) seldom delineated rights and obligations in a way that safeguarded host country autonomy. Adding to the complexity, the UK has committed to funding resettlement projects for Mauritius and paying a lease fee for continued use of the islands. This multilayered arrangement risks entangling Mauritius in administrative complexities that could undermine its sovereignty. Mauritius will assume responsibility for managing any asylum seekers who attempt to land on the archipelago once the handover is completed. However, in the meantime, the UK plans to transfer any asylum seekers arriving on Diego Garcia to its remote Atlantic Ocean territory of St. Helena. The decision is further mired in controversy due to reports of poor living conditions faced by people already stranded on Diego Garcia. Mauritius leveraged law and African solidarity to frame the Chagos dispute as a win for decolonisation The Exclusive Economic Zone surrounding the Chagos Archipelago adds another layer of complexity. Under the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, Mauritius gains access to valuable maritime resources. However, the coexistence of a major external military base complicates economic activities and vice versa, such as tourism or fishing. These industries often require unobstructed access and freedom from restrictive military zones, and the terms and the extent of the area in which they will apply surrounding Diego Garcia is still to be determined. Mauritius faces enforcement challenges over its increased area of jurisdiction. External assistance will be essential but may introduce further complexities, particularly regarding the Marine Protected Area to be established and managed with UK assistance. The Chagos agreement, supported by the US and India, is framed in a broader narrative of reinforcing the rules-based order (RBO). This reflects a broader effort to counter China’s assertiveness in the South China Sea and Indian Ocean. For the UK, resolving the Chagos dispute lifts some of this pressure. It mitigates accusations of hypocrisy that were undermining the credibility of the RBO in matters concerning its relevance to sovereignty, international law, and multilateral cooperation in the South China Sea. Mauritius’s success in leveraging international legal mechanisms is a crucial reminder of the ever-growing importance of multilateral institutions in resolving disputes. With strong support from the African Union, African states framed the issue as one of decolonisation, applying sustained diplomatic pressure on the UK. This case arguably demonstrates that there is soft power to be tapped from international law for diplomats from small states to achieve equitable outcomes. Despite the promise of the agreement, its implementation remains fraught with challenges. Negotiators must address the competing priorities of sovereign control, economic development, environmental preservation and strategic security. The ultimate success will hinge on the legitimate inclusion of the Chagossian community to ensure justice in the process.

Malaysia Aggressively Closes Informal Border Crossings With Thail...	The Thais are the greatest beneficiaries On December 1, the Royal Malaysian Police (PDRM) swooped onto all of the informal and illegal border crossing points between Kelantan and Thailand. The Malaysian police appear to have taken this action independently of the Thai authorities, although the Thais have supported this move. The Thai 4th Army chief Lt General Paison Nusang said that Thailand respects the Malaysian operation. These operations were forewarned by the Malaysian home minister Saifuddin Nasution Ismail, who last month said that border crossings will only be allowed at the Immigration, Customs, Quarantine, and Security (ICQS) posts at Rantau Panjang, Bukit Bunga, and Pengkalian Kubar, indicating the prime focus is upon interdicting those involved in smuggling and violence from Tak Bai, through Sungai Kolok to Narathiwat and Yala on the Thai side. The operations equally target Malaysian and Thai nations, as many hold dual country documentation. These people have relatives and families on both sides of the border. The Malaysian media reported that a number of people have been caught and detained at the Immigration Detention Centre at Tanah Merah in Kelantan. The operation not only relies on border police, but electronic means such as long-range cameras and drones are also being used. This has been supplemented with Humint operations by the police Special Branch in Ratau Panjang. There have already been some low-key skirmishes with smugglers, where shots have been fired at Malaysian police across the border from Thailand. Thai police managed to capture the perpetrators a day later. So far, there have been no execution style murders of Malaysian police, just like Thai police and security forces have been experiencing for years in the three southern Thai provinces. For over a century, local residents have crossed unheeded across the Sungai Kolok river to visit relatives and families, purchase supplies, do business, attend school, or do shopping. This is the first time in Many years, authorities on either side have enforced immigration regulations. Around five years ago, the Thai army partly built a wall along the border of Sungai Kolok town. Soldiers manned the border wall but never challenged those who crossed the border undocumented there. Crossing the border until now had been part of the daily lives of thousands of people. Even at the official crossing point at Sungai Kolok, nine out of ten locals may not use any documentation to cross the border. There was an unofficial understanding in the area that if you crossed to visit the immediate area on the other side of the river for a short period, authorities won’t bother to inspect documents, unless you were an outsider to the region. Many claim the border is porous through both official and unofficial routes. The Malaysian move can be seen as very positive, which will assist the Thai authorities clamp down on those involved in the deep south violence and are domiciled in Kelantan. If this action works well, then a lower number of violent events will be a windfall for the Thais. The Thais have wanted to clamp down on the border to prevent the movement of suspected insurgents, without much assistance from the Malaysians. There appears to be some change of heart from the Malaysian side. There is very little smuggling of rice, petrol, and cooking oil across the ‘rat trails’, as they are called. Most of this occurs through the official border with little strictness by customs officials on both sides. Petrol is smuggled through pick ups modified with extra fuel tanks. Perhaps the other major benefit will be better control over the trafficking of methamphetamine into Malaysia from Myanmar and Lao border areas in Thailand. The Thai southern provinces are well known for a plentiful supply of illicit drugs and narcotics. What affect will this move have on smuggling and violence in the deep south will only be seen in a few months time, that’s if the Malaysians maintain their operation over the long-term.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWeIFrlOO4j9vNHO0TwJO-yn	2024-12-24T15:42:48-08:00	
The Progressive Authoritarian Tide Retreats – OpEd	Two months ago in the UK, a 17-year old girl with autism took the field in her all-women team for a match in a single-sex soccer league. She noticed that one of the players in the opposing trans-inclusive club was a bearded man in his twenties. She asked: ‘Are you a man?’ The opposing captain’s formal complaint about the remark was taken up for hearing by the Football Association. The girl was charged with two counts of ‘improper conduct,’ pleaded not guilty, and was tried before a three-person tribunal that met for several hours. It found her guilty on both counts and sentenced her to a six-game ban. Just ponder that for a moment. In order to assuage the sensitivities of a grown transgender biological man whose self-ID belies his physical appearance, an autistic teenage girl who had asked an innocuous and not unreasonable question was left distraught after a traumatising trial that could leave a lifelong mark on her. Dare we hope that the forces of reason, common sense, and decency are reoccupying the public square as we come out of what Rod Dreher calls the age of ‘endarkenment?’ That the proliferation of human rights commissions, administrative tribunals, and DEI apparatchiks that celebrate diversity by enforcing conformity can now begin to be dismantled? That, under the growing influence of a new band of political leaders best described as creative disruptors, progressive authoritarians are on the retreat, and minorities-sacralising woke has peaked? Wokism is a cultural malaise yet woke politics is an election loser because voters just don’t prioritise identity in the privacy of the polling booth. Neetu Arnold’s analysis of precinct-level US voting data in selected urban areas shows that exit polls understated the rightward shift between 2020 and 2024: from 17-20 points in Dallas and Fort Bend in Texas to 23 in Chicago and 31 in New York City. The major reasons for the shift that voters cite are the economy, public safety, and obsession with racial equity. That is, of their top three concerns, the first was in response to failing economic policies, the second in relation to woke-influenced policies (e.g. BLM and defund the police) that don’t work in practice, and the third against woke policies in principle. A Revolution in Real Time In July I examined the rise of the new right with the masses in revolt against the political establishment and inner city elites. Yet still Western leaders struggle to grasp their people’s underlying rage against the rotting state of even supposedly stable advanced democracies like the UK, France, and Germany as they defect en masse to populist parties and leaders. The success of centre-right parties led by outsider disruptors will be crowned with the emphatic return of Donald Trump to the White House in January, backed by Republican Party control of the Senate and House and a conservative majority on the Supreme Court. While Trump’s current 54 percent approval rating is among his highest ever, President Joe Biden’s 36 percent is the lowest of his tenure, and this before he pardoned Hunter Biden for any and all crimes committed between 1 January 2014 and 1 December 2024 despite repeated promises to the contrary and the insistence that no one is above the law. Julie Ponesse notes that for millions, the madness of Covid policies marked their last moment of innocence as trust in the major public institutions shrank under inchoate and then conscious worries about a potential civilisational collapse. Progressives, who proved to be no better than astrology aficionados, immediately embraced the most draconian Covid diktats from secular prophets in elective office, silenced and cancelled opposing voices that have been proven right, and demanded that Covid-deniers be rounded up, locked up, shunned, and driven from employment and participation in civic affairs. We may be experiencing a revolution in real time. Authoritarian progressives are frustrated because they seemingly cannot translate cultural power (in schools, universities, Hollywood, and the media) into political power. The edifice of hyper-liberalism constructed by the West’s self-loathing cultural elites over two-three decades, with majority preferences subordinated to the rights of ever-tinier protected minorities, is being pulled down around us one scaffolding at a time. While progressives obsess over gender parity to be achieved through equity quotas, the conservative values of women such as Giorgia Meloni in Italy, Marine Le Pen in France, Beata Szydło in Poland, and Kemi Badenoch in the UK confound identity politics and drive the left nuts. If Badenoch becomes UK prime minister (PM) after the next election, gender will intersect with race and she will become a double traitor. For some, she already is, as in Labour MP Dawn Butler’s offensive reference to her as representing ‘white supremacy in blackface.’ It’s long been clear that the main interest of social justice warriors in ethnic minorities is to use them as a tool to fight the right. The common thread running through the rise of parties and leaders, including Trump, that are centre-right in more than name only, is that they embody not just popular aspirations but also popular fury against the failures and deceptions of political insider parties on either side of the ideological centre to address falling standards of living caused by red and green tape that, backed by aggressive lawfare, kill risk-taking, investment, and innovation; mass immigration; colonisation of the public square by cancel culture’s speech police and two-tier policing and justice; and breakdown of social cohesion and civic virtue. Remarkably, governments have managed simultaneously to be increasingly out of touch with people’s real concerns and meddlesome busybodies interfering in people’s daily lives. The result is that the liberal democratic order is being stress-tested domestically just like the liberal international order. Exit polls confirm that one of Trump’s major attractions for voters is that he says what he thinks and cares not a whit about offended people’s reactions. Contrast this with the already settled belief of British voters that Keir Starmer said whatever he needed to win and has since then moved rapidly to break promise after promise to impose a hard-left suite of economic and social policies. The result is the fastest and steepest fall in post-election popularity and a viral petition with three million signatures demanding fresh elections owing to a false bill of sale that has caused such bitter buyer’s remorse. By contrast, momentum is all with Nigel Farage’s Reform party which has crossed the psychologically important threshold of 100,000 members and jumped into second place in a public opinion poll at 24 percent, behind the Tories at 26 but ahead of Labour at 23. That is, more than half the country is now positioned to the right of centre and less than a quarter is to the left. Reform’s performance in the local council and mayoral elections in May will be closely watched by all political parties and pundits. In addition, though, we have also witnessed disenchantment and buyer’s remorse with climate change alarmism and Net Zero and with institutions of global governance like the World Court, International Criminal Court (ICC), and the World Health Organisation (WHO). True centre-right parties don’t generally apply identitarian loyalty tests to female leaders. Sex and race matter less to a conservative than competence. ‘Can s/he do the job?’ is the typical first question, not a candidate’s sex and race. This might explain why Tories in the UK have had three female PMs and could have a fourth, to zero for Labour. The great betrayal of women by centre-left liberals is to render them less resilient. Progressives frame their appeal in the language of victimhood and grievance, perhaps explaining why conservative women are happier in life than their liberal peers. Labor in Australia, like Labour in the UK and the Democrats in the US, has been reduced to a party of, by, and for les misérables. Trump’s America at Home and Abroad from 20 January 2025 The US still exerts unrivalled geopolitical, economic, and cultural heft in world affairs. Consequently the importance of Trump’s election cannot be overstated for reinfusing people with a sense of hope and optimism by confronting this multifront challenge to everything that brought peace, prosperity, education, good health, equality of citizenship, equality of opportunity, the rule of law, universal human rights, and expanding freedoms to Western societies and also spread them outwards to many other countries. Of course, Trump may yet take us to disaster. But it is also just possible that in time, his return to power could prove historically consequential for setting the direction in which the world travels. When the establishment is bloated, incompetent, and corrupt, only creative disruptors can reset the institutional balance. Trump Administration 2.0 will provide an anchor point for managing change. Successful change management by Team Trump 2.0 will produce new social, cultural, educational, economic, environmental, and political normative settling points for Western civilisation. Internationally, some of the worst features of the equivalent of the world administrative state were created by the powerful Western countries when they controlled the agenda and institutions of the various branches of the UN system. Lawfare targets people based on their identity and not the alleged crime. Charges are framed and evidence is fixed to take out the opponent: show me the man and I will find you the crime. Americans witnessed and rebelled against politically weaponised justice to target Trump; Le Pen is benefitting politically, just like Trump, from the establishment’s lawfare against her, notes the Spectator’s former editor Fraser Nelson; and Starmer is experiencing a similar loss of legitimacy with perceptions of two-tier policing and justice in the UK. The British police experienced a viral backlash against their effort to intimidate the popular Telegraph columnist Allison Pearson. The investigation was quickly cancelled but not before it had forced a public debate on police complicity in enforcing tightening free speech restrictions in the guise of Orwellian non-crime hate incidents. Westerners cheered at the weaponisation of international lawfare against the likes of Chile’s Augusto Pinochet and Serbia’s Slobodan Milosevic and now they reap the whirlwind with blowback. This is the equivalent of breeding deadly snakes in one’s backyard whose venom can be directed at those inside the house. And indeed lawfare was weaponised by the Democrats against Trump only to backfire spectacularly. Now that the US and the West are losing their dominance of the UN system, international legal weapons are being trained on targets that previously were shielded by the West, most notably Israel. The ICC has become entangled in a messy and protracted conflict that’s not reducible to simplistic moralising-by-slogans. Or consider another, more serious international example. Sir Michael Ellis, a former Attorney General for England and Wales, writing in the Telegraph on 30 November, criticised the ICC’s ‘extra-jurisdictional’ investigation of Israel: ‘Any country which is not a member of the court is simply not bound by it.’ He asked rhetorically: ‘What next? The UK being bound by a treaty it too hasn’t signed?’ In the 1990s, the UK was among the leading group of countries trying to compel India to sign the Comprehensive Nuclear Test-Ban Treaty that was adopted by the UN General Assembly directly because India vetoed its coercive clauses at the Conference on Disarmament in Geneva. Because of a uniquely self-sabotaging entry-into-force formula – it must be signed and ratified by all 44 listed countries in Annex 2 of the treaty relevant to achieving the treaty’s goal – the CTBT is yet to legally enter into force even though, for all practical purpose, it is fully operational. Then in 1998, India and Pakistan were censured by the UN Security Council, with the UK being one of its five permanent members, for testing nuclear weapons in defiance of the CTBT-centric ‘global norm’ and in violation of the Nuclear Non-proliferation Treaty (NPT), which both countries had explicitly rejected. I wonder if Sir Michael is even aware of this inconsistency? I would respectfully suggest that my opposition to jurisdictional creep of international treaty regimes to non-signatories is more consistent. Warnings at the time of a global power transition already underway were casually dismissed as Western governments were captured by the progressives. Thus Charles Moore, a former editor of the paper, noted in the Telegraph recently that Starmer’s ideological belief is that human rights should be the UK’s state religion with lawyers as its high priests. PM Justin Trudeau might have stated it most explicitly in an interview with the New York Times nine years ago that Canada is the world’s ‘first postnational state.’ Many others among the West’s governing elites share his belief in that post-national state and prioritise the noble call of global governance over the pursuit of their own national interests. In the process the liberal international order is being corrupted into a rules-violating (Russia’s invasion of Ukraine) and rules-abusing (weaponisation of lawfare against Israel) illiberal international disorder. Time to pause and step off it. We must halt and reverse the march through the international institutions of cute and cuddly authoritarianism camouflaged in the language of compassionate safetyism, from health authoritarianism led by the WHO during Covid and the new pandemic accords, to the ICC and the Net Zero rush to deindustrialise the West owing to hyperbolic climate alarmism according to which we have left global warming behind and are already into global boiling. DEI (diversity, equity, and inclusion) is being cremated and meritocracy is back in vogue. Walmart, Boeing, Microsoft, Meta, and Google are among giants of the corporate sector to have soured on diversity initiatives and are cutting and dismantling DEI departments. Recalcitrant universities are likely to find themselves in the crosshairs of the second Trump administration. Yet, woke is far from dead, the DEI nonsense may be leaving private enterprise but still thrives in public bodies other than in some Republican-controlled US states, and HR tentacles have insinuated themselves into the deepest interstices of the West’s institutional structures. DEI could return in a new guise if we drop our guard. Still, demonstrable progress on Trump’s ambitious economic, social, educational, and foreign policy agendas in the first half of his second term will shift the global Overton window dramatically rightwards. For thirty years I’ve heard predictions of disappearing glaciers, polar bears, reefs, coasts, islands, and rainfall; warnings that the world only has a 3-5 year window to cut emissions before global warming crosses the tipping point; and assurances that energy from renewables will give us plentiful, reliable, and cheap power. The reality is that we are starting to experience more frequent power blackouts, government urgings to reduce energy consumption during peak hours, and continually rising power supply charges and subsidies to green energy (one calculation shows a total £328 billion in subsidies in pursuit of Net Zero in the UK). As in Monty Python’s dead parrot skit, that bird ‘is not pining, it’s passed on! This parrot is no more! It has ceased to be! It’s expired and gone to see its maker! This is a late parrot! It’s a stiff! Bereft of life, it rests in peace! If you hadn’t nailed it to the perch it would be pushing up the daisies! It’s run down the curtain and joined the choir invisible!! THIS IS AN EX-PARROT!!’ As the twin reality of steeply rising costs of non-fossil fuel energy sources and unreliable power supply when most needed hits consumers, public resistance is rapidly building. The Australian columnist Chris Kenny succinctly sums up the current situation here: ‘For decades now, taxpayers have forked out tens of billions of dollars in renewables subsidies designed to drive coal-fired power out of the market, but now so much coal generation has been closed that we do not have enough reliable energy, so taxpayers also are subsidising coal-fired generation in Victoria and NSW to keep it online.’ Similarly, on 3 December the Australian Workers Union demanded that the government put the interests of workers in Tasmania’s fishing industry ahead of the ‘exaggerated concerns of inner-city activists.’ Electric vehicle mandates, under which dealers are set targets for percentage of new car sales to be EVs by benchmarked dates (remind you of centrally planned communist regimes until the 1980s?) under pain of hefty financial penalties, are not just authoritarian. They also reveal science illiteracy in that they focus solely on tailpipes for measuring emission and powerpoint charging for calculating running costs. The life-cycle emissions from EV should also include mining, manufacturing, transportation, transmission, storage, wear and tear on the infrastructure, and final disposal. The costs to the consumer of operating EVs include prorated costs of the public goods in the above list like transmission and storage infrastructure, plus insurance, depreciation, battery, and tire replacements, and life expectancy of vehicles. And there is a cost to national security with the transfer of industrial capacity, wealth, and supply-chain dependency to China. Worker Versus Woke Parties President Trump’s top second-term goal will be ‘to disrupt and dismantle Washington’s inbred status quo,’ says the Wall Street Journal’s Daniel Henninger. Godspeed, say I. His cabinet picks – Pete Hegseth (Defense), Tulsi Gabbard (Director of National Intelligence), Robert F Kennedy, Jr (Health and Human Services), Kash Patel (FBI) – are winding up all the right people in politics, media, and the world of celebrities. For example, not knowing much about him, I was ambivalent about Patel until John Bolton criticised the pick. Bolton’s attack validated the selection for me and, going by the top-ranked of 2,300 comments (e.g. ‘Bolton’s disapproval is a powerful endorsement’, Scott Lorinsky), I am in good company. Democratic Senator John Fetterman called it ‘god tier level trolling.’ Trump has the mandate to rattle and shake DC and tear up the Washington playbook. The Democrats’ biggest fear is not that Trump will fail but that he just might succeed with his out-of-the-box cabinet choices. Meanwhile a Morning Consult poll regarding 25 Trump nominees showed all 25 above water, with Marco Rubio for State the highest on 11 points net favourability. One reason might be that it’s an impressively diverse group of people, in multiple senses of the word: of thought, belief, and ideology in governing economic and foreign policies, the first female White House chief of staff, the highest ranking openly gay person in the order of presidential succession, two Hispanics, and three Hindus. The collection of intelligent, fearless, independent-minded, and articulate aides should reduce the risk of groupthink. Trump’s Republicans are the party of work, in two senses: the party that, compared to the Democrats today, better reflects, represents, and promotes the interests of workers and chooses pragmatic policies that work over ideological pieties and foreign policy naïveté. The entrenched and ever-growing administrative, top-down command-and-control state has become an existential threat to liberal democracy. Existing institutions and leaderships are not fit for purpose. It’s imperative to bring in creative disruptors from the outside. The Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy-led Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) will ‘pursue three major kinds of reform: regulatory rescissions, administrative reductions, and cost savings.’ The peculiar yet growing appeal of populist tribunes around the democratic world is that in addition to their fiercely loyal base, they’ve grown their brand appeal because of who their opponents are. This is because rather than crave recognition from their opponents by tickling their tummies, they punch back harder. This is the secret to Trump’s success in the US, Meloni’s in Italy, Javier Milei’s in Argentina, Pierre Poilievre’s in Canada, and Farage’s in the UK. They too mostly project common sense, mainstream values, and the determination to take on wokeness, without backing off and retreating at the first whiff of the grapeshot. In constructing a cabinet for his second administration, Trump rejected the option of taking the path of least resistance. Instead, he has chosen one of the finest cabinets in modern American history. His second administration will be led from the top by strong-willed, smart, and diverse individuals with demonstrated success in the real world, not career politicians, all striving for a better America with the determination to succeed. The choice of Jay Bhattacharya to lead the National Institutes of Health (NIH), the world’s largest public funder of biomedical research ($48 billion), is a compelling testament to this and also to karmic justice for Anthony Fauci and Francis Collins. In the Brownstone community and, judging by several comments in the online media in particular, also more widely, there’s much respect for his scholarship as a researcher, integrity as a scientist, and courage as a public intellectual, plus affection for his engaging personality, calm demeanour, and affable character. In the last eleven days (26 November–7 December), just the Wall Street Journal has had six feature/opinion articles on his nomination to lead NIH. A rare beacon of sanity during the time of Covid, he is among the best exemplars of the Serenity Prayer (and yes, he is a Christian): Grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change; courage to change the things I can; and wisdom to know the difference. The appointments of multiple lockdown sceptics into positions of power and great impact, including but not limited to Jay, are a game-changer. Australia and Britain embarrassed themselves by holding an unserious and a soap opera-length double hundred million pounds whitewash of an inquiry into their handling of the pandemic. Expect the Trump team to reopen the debate about Covid, shake up the medical and pharmaceutical establishment, expose the manifold and lasting harms inflicted on societies by the Church of Fauci and WHO, improve national preparedness so America can cope with another outbreak without shutting society down, and restore integrity to medical research and trust in public health institutions. Trump is also being urged to reverse Biden’s ‘radical’ electric vehicle policies within the first 100 days of taking office. Chris Wright, Energy Secretary-designate, is a member of the ‘Drill baby drill’ club. He refutes claims of a climate crisis and dismisses Net Zero activists as alarmists. ‘Nut zero’ may be more apt. The Treasury department has been led by a revolving door of Goldman Sachs executives. Energy secretaries have typically been climate change devotees with a bias against traditional sources of energy and no expertise in the sector. No one before Wright, founder and chief executive of the oilfield services company Liberty Energy, had drilled an oil well, mined coal, or built a power plant. Gabbard is an outsider who has railed against the failures of the Washington insiders. The 2003 Iraq war was the worst US foreign policy disaster of all time. Gabbard and Hegseth, if confirmed, will with JD Vance form the triumvirate of Iraq veterans in the new administration disillusioned with the interventionist impulse as the organising principle of US foreign policy whose costliest price is paid by the soldiers. The war’s biggest strategic victor was, you guessed it, Iran. [In history’s rhyming irony, the biggest strategic loser of 7 October 2023 is turning out to be Iran.] The biggest victors of the Ukraine war have been China, North Korea, and Iran; the biggest losers are the people of Ukraine as Russia grinds its way to wresting larger chunks of territory while wiping out a generation of young Ukrainian men and laying waste to its industrial and energy infrastructure. The pullout from Afghanistan was an absolute shambles, Syria’s murderous dictator has been toppled from power with dramatic suddenness but a jihadist regime may replace him and Syria could be trapped in post-Gaddafi Libya-style violent instability, and an amateurish assassin almost felled Trump. But hey, US generals want you to know their preferred pronouns.. Consider Kennedy’s nomination as a parable of the times. The stranglehold of Big Pharma on US lawmakers, health bureaucrats, medical profession, hospital system, and regulators has long been Kennedy’s bête noir, with agribusiness a close second. Far from being solutions, Kennedy insists, both sectors have contributed to America’s acute health crisis. Their financial muscle has enabled capture of the levers of political power. The online rage directed at US healthcare insurers after the murder of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson is another bit of evidence pointing to the deep-seated anger in the populace that the different components of the ruling elites have colluded to rig the system to their own profit at the expense of the battlers doing it tough. If Senators who’ve raked in millions from Big Pharma lobbyists were to be excluded from voting on Kennedy’s nomination, the hearings might well lack a quorum. That, in a nutshell, is the scale of the challenge confronting Trump in implementing his priority agenda come January. The political, corporate, media, and celebrity elites wield cultural power. In response, the deplorables are fighting to take back political power. In Trump, they’ve found a fierce champion. The more he drives the cultural elites crazy, the more his followers cheer him. Consider the firming perceptions of media bias. Post-election polling for the League of American Workers by TIPP Insights at the end of November is quite extraordinary. By a 34-point margin (rising to 41 points among 18–24-year-olds), voters said the media favoured Kamala Harris over Trump during the campaign. Even 45 percent of Harris voters agreed that the media was biased towards her. Remarkably, by a 19-point margin (including 40 percent of Democrats), voters said that the bias backfired and harmed Harris. This helps explain why media frenzy by offence archaeologists on past statements and behaviour by Trump nominees is failing to move the needle of public acceptability of his picks, including Gabbard and Kennedy. Kennedy is a fitness fanatic who has seen the nation’s suffering from illness caused by profiteering agribusiness and pharmaceutical multinationals with armies of lobbyists to capture lawmakers and regulators. He wants to heal the people through healthy living and eating: make Americans healthy again (MAHA, which coincidentally means great in Hindi as in maharajah). The pandemic made everyone realise how powerful a role health agencies play in our lives, how arrogant the health bureaucrats are regarding their own expertise and dismissive of people’s concerns and questions. By contrast, Kennedy points out that millions of Americans suffer from chronic diseases and obesity, despite vast sums spent on healthcare. According to the Petersen and Kaiser Family foundations, US per capita healthcare costs ($12,742) are almost double the average of 13 comparable industrialised countries ($6,850), yet deliver among the worst health outcomes on life expectancy, childbirths, infant mortality, diabetes, and heart attacks. Trusting the experts to be benign and get it right is a feature neither of science nor of democracy. Scientists do need to do more to understand the role of forever chemicals in food and water. Governments must conduct and publish cost-benefit analyses of alternative public health measures and treatment options. They must lift the liability exemption from vaccine manufacturers and require rigorous and transparent trials of new products including vaccines. It’s hard to overstate the impact of made-on-the-fly Covid policies in destroying public trust in the medical profession and health experts and elevating the profile and credibility of Kennedy and Children’s Health Defense (disclosure: I am a director of CHD Australia). In peddling false promises on the need for and benefits of lockdowns, masks, and vaccines, authorities opted for the Goebbels strategy that a big lie repeated often enough becomes the accepted truth. Instead, it turns out that the more relevant story is the boy who cried wolf to hide his own failure on the job and was duly eaten by a real wolf. Former NIH Director Collins conceded last year that, focused solely on ways to stop the disease, they failed to consider how gravely their interventions disrupted peoples’ lives, ruined the economy, and kept kids out of school needlessly and to their lasting detriment. This is a confession we are yet to hear from the even more authoritarian Australian health know-it-all scolds.

Syria’s Ten Post-Assad Challenges – OpEd	By Anwar Abas It took barely ten days for the regime of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad to fall. But his dramatic ousting was not simply down to the surprise military offensive by Islamist group Hayat Tahrir al-Shams (HTS). It was rather the fruit of 14 years of revolution, conflict, destruction and death, and the struggle by media, civil society and human rights groups to keep the dream of freedom alive. Syrians have paid a very heavy price – the country also endured 61 years of single-party and military rule by the Baath Party, and 54 years of one-family rule by the Assads. And amidst their euphoria, Syrians know they now face serious domestic, regional and international challenges to rebuild their country. Syria has been left devastated by the conflict that began with Assad’s brutal response to peaceful demonstrations that began in March 2011. Armed groups soon emerged, with regional and international powers fueling the conflict. While Turkey, the West, and some Arab countries backed the opposition, support from Russia and Iran meant Assad's regime regained much of its power by 2015. The conflict shattered Syria's economy and infrastructure, with the Syrian army and Russian air forces targeting opposition strongholds, schools, hospitals and residential areas. Over 600,000 people died, 12 million fled their homes and many were imprisoned in brutal conditions and tortured to death. Radical Islamist groups also committed atrocities, but most deaths and destruction were caused by Assad and his allies. The country is far from united. In the northeast, Arab-Kurdish tensions, violations committed by the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), Turkish policies, and the presence of the Turkey-backed Syrian National Army, that is known for its own atrocities, complicate the situation. In the northwest, HTS controlled Idlib governorate for years. The country’s west faces the return of thousands of former regime members, as well as a looming unemployment crisis. The midlands and the south, opposed to Assad, are heavily populated and diverse. Big cities like Damascus, Aleppo, Homs, and Hama have always had better economic opportunities but also face rebuilding challenges. Safety and security will remain a challenge across the country. Fundamentalist groups left their mark, with Al Qaeda affiliates radicalising young people. Despite entering a new era without Assad, Syrians have concerns about the future, especially with the emergence of HTS as the potential dominating power. A Complex Landscape Countries that played a significant role in the crisis will continue to do so in post-Assad Syria. Iran wants to maintain its access via Syria to deliver weapons and support to Hezbollah in Lebanon. Russia, which maintains two military bases in western Syria, backed Assad throughout and is likely to play a role in supporting former regime members. Turkey has its own interest in subduing the Kurds, given their aspirations towards sovereignty. Turkey hosts over three million Syrian refugees, with political and public pressure mounting to address this issue. Ankara is likely to support any incoming government in economic and recovery efforts so that Syrians can return. Qatar and other Gulf states support for the various factions reflect their own competition and tensions. The US and Europe, whose main interests are in avoiding another wave of refugees and containing Islamic fundamentalism, will be heavily involved while wary of potential descent into Islamist rule. They will also support the Kurds to maintain their gains and relative independence. Any new administration in Syria will have to deal with these contrasting and competing priorities and demands of powers whose support will be crucial to any stabilisation and recovery efforts. Whether the Islamist HTS, which is still listed as a terrorist group by the West, or any coming government have the strategic vision to understand these complexities is yet to be tested. Corruption and Poor Public Services Before the crisis began in 2011, Syria was ranked 127 out of 178 countries for corruption by Transparency International. By 2023, it had fallen to 177 out of 180 countries. Public services such as health care, energy, transport and communication were always poor. Syria's hybrid model of public and privately owned services, many state-subsidised, has also been severely impacted. The interim government set up by HST, whose mandate expires in March, claims Syria will have a free market economy. However, many doubt its capability to address these issues, and there has been no word yet about a political process to decide who will run the country and how. If HTS plans to remain the default power, recovery will be much harder and perhaps impossible. Building an effective and transparent bureaucracy is a lengthy process, requiring human resources, accountability mechanisms, legal reform and infrastructure rehabilitation. Experts estimate that returning to pre-2011 standards will take about ten years, let alone improving beyond those already poor levels. Depleted Economy and Labour Market Syria's economy contracted by 85 per cent during nearly 14 years of civil war, with GDP falling from 67.5 billion US dollars in 2011 to just 9 billion by 2023. The currency devalued significantly, leading to hyperinflation. Over half of Syrians live in poverty. The war decimated Syria's economic pillars: oil production fell to less than 9,000 barrels per day in regime-controlled areas, and agriculture was severely impacted. Over 4.82 million Syrians fled the country, and an additional 7 million remain internally displaced. Rebuilding Syria's economy and infrastructure was estimated to cost at least 250 billion dollars as of 2021, a figure likely to have since increased. Economic recovery is crucial for Syria's stabilisation. Without this, frustrations over living conditions and services will rise. Economic recovery is also vital for the return of refugees from Lebanon, Jordan and Turkey, which have faced their own challenges due to the crisis. Rebuilding the economy requires a new legislative framework, an environment that attracts investment, infrastructure rebuilding and maintaining peace and public order. These should be top priorities for the future government. National Security and Public Order The Syrian army, heavily involved in Syria’s destruction, has left the country with little trust in military institutions and vulnerable to foreign threats. Regional and international powers have concerns about Syria developing advanced military capabilities; Israel has already acted to destroy what remained of Assad’s depleted army. Syria will likely have a small, incapable army for decades, especially in the absence of a peace deal with Israel. Integrating militias into a new national army is also a challenge, given that some groups are highly ideological and radical. Police services in Syria were already corrupt and brutal, and the spread of arms, powerful militia, a resentful public and the absence of accountability could lead to disorder and crime. National security and public safety are major challenges, requiring utmost seriousness and commitment. This also requires collaboration with local communities, influential figures and religious leaders in the transitional period. Trust will remain the main issue that governments must deal with. Transitional Justice and Accountability The Syrian regime is believed to be behind most of the destruction and deaths that occurred since 2011, with evidence of these atrocities well documented and efforts to hold some people accountable well underway. HTS is itself implicated in grave human rights violations, alongside other militant groups - including the Kurdish-led SDF. How will this work for transitional justice? How can the mechanisms established to investigate and hold perpetrators to account be guaranteed to be transparent? How will this impact national reconciliation, the political process and recovery efforts? Syrians expect to have justice, which will also help restore trust between communities by bringing closure to many grieving families. But the complexity of the conflict means this may not be as attainable as it seemed on December 8. Regional and International Relations A host of countries now aim to maintain or expand their influence, which may not align with the interests of the Syrian people. Syria's future stability depends on navigating these dynamics. Establishing a balanced foreign policy that engages with both regional and global powers will be crucial. This includes fostering positive relations with neighboring countries like Turkey and the Arab states, while also managing the interests of former regime allies like Russia and Iran. The international community's support will be essential in rebuilding Syria's economy and infrastructure. National Reconciliation and Identity Building Historically, Syria has long experienced tensions among its social, ethnic and religious groups, from the legacy of the French mandate to the persecution of religious groups under Muslim rule and the exclusion of the Kurds, Syria’s largest ethnic minority, by the Baath regime. Recent and current grievances are now at play. The Sunni majority has long been oppressed, and their towns and cities saw the most destruction. There is hardly a family that has not lost a loved one in regime bombing or in Assad’s prison system. Other communities that have supported Assad have lost many lives and are grieving too for their own reasons. War has deepened these divides, and suspicion and distrust now exacerbate social fragmentation. Rebuilding efforts must focus on promoting inclusivity, protecting human [AA1] rights, equal citizenship and fostering dialogue among different communities, while ensuring accountability and justice. Additionally, creating a sense of national identity that transcends ethnic and religious lines will be crucial for long-term stability. Democracy and Good Governance These deep philosophical questions need to be discussed at a national level with every shade of the political, religious, social and ethnic spectrum. But governance is at the heart of everything. Having a responsible government that can be held accountable is the key to stability and recovery. How will different ideological groups, some that do not even believe in democracy, be engaged? A long-term plan is needed, but above all, a process to start this conversation is due. The Possibility of New Dictatorship Many Syrians have long dreamt of a democratic Syria where everyone enjoys full rights as equal citizenship and can elect and hold their leaders accountable. The economic, security, social, and political challenges Syrians now face, along with regional and international dynamics, will all influence this journey. Failures to address grievances, contain the armed groups, build an effective, trustworthy bureaucracy and good governance will lead to resentment and frustration. The current default power and its allies do not necessarily believe in democracy and mostly come from fundamental ideologies. Will they be willing to engage in a democratic process or will they try to cling to power? This conversation is playing out in different ways. Some Syrians are unconcerned; others have little or no trust in the intentions of HTS and its allies. The Threat of Violence And if these challenges are not addressed, Syria may descend into another brutal civil war. Lack of security, accountability and economic opportunity will heighten the exclusion of certain groups, and failures to build trust and national unity. We need to promote diversity and guarantee the rights of women, ethnic and religious groups; regional meddling and international pressure to accomplish a transition that appeals to the West without understanding Syria’s complex society cannot work. Above all, this process must focus on Syrians, their hopes, wishes and dreams – and their future. About the author: Anwar Abas is a programme director at IWPR. He grew up in Syria.

Bangladesh’s Tentative Election Timeline And Reform Challenges – ...	By Imran Ahmed In his recent national address, Bangladesh’s interim government leader, Muhammad Yunus, laid out a tentative timeline for the country’s democratic future stating that general elections could occur by late 2025 or early 2026. Yunus’ statement, though cautious, underlines the challenges facing his post-revolution government as it seeks to rebuild Bangladesh’s fractured political landscape. The announcement reflects both the magnitude of the reforms required and the simmering tensions surrounding the nation’s transition from the authoritarian grip of Sheikh Hasina’s 15-year rule to a future anchored in democratic legitimacy. Yunus’ focus on a ‘flawless’ voter list and comprehensive reforms of governing structures and institutions reveals a deeper dilemma: can the interim government balance the urgency for elections with the demand for systemic change? His announcement also comes amidst mounting pressure to set an election roadmap and a specific election date. While acknowledging the statement as progress, Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) leaders, including Amir Khasru Mahmud Chowdhury, criticised it for lacking a structured plan, describing Yunus’ remarks as merely an idea rather than a clear roadmap for credible elections. Nevertheless, Yunus has urged that reforms must precede any polls, framing his government’s agenda as one of restoration rather than political expediency. 'If the political parties agree to hold the election on an earlier date with minimum reforms', Yunus said, 'the election could be held by the end of November.' At the core of Yunus’ electoral reform agenda is an updated voter list, a deceptively simple yet notably complex challenge. After years of politically manipulated elections, voter rolls have become symbols of institutional decay. Purging false names, addressing registration backlogs and enfranchising Bangladesh’s burgeoning youth population remain essential but time-consuming tasks. Yunus’ vision of achieving a ‘100 per cent voter turnout’ is aspirational but it also raises questions about whether the interim administration can mobilise the necessary resources and consensus to achieve such a feat within his proposed timeline. Some analysts fear delays could worsen political divisions. 'The longer the election is delayed, the greater the risk of unrest', said Dr Sayeed Alam, a political scientist at Dhaka University. He added that 'Bangladesh’s history shows that power vacuums often lead to instability.' Earlier, Mirza Fakhrul Islam Alamgir, Secretary-General of the BNP, insisted that only a democratically elected government can address Bangladesh’s deep-rooted issues and rebuild public trust in state institutions. 'The people’s preference for a political party will be determined through elections', Alamgir said. He continued, 'That is why we strongly advocate for elections to be held as soon as possible. Elections will resolve many challenges and debates that persist today. Until then, arguments and debates will continue.' There are also other pressing challenges. The recent White Paper on the State of the Bangladesh Economy reported years of economic mismanagement and significant financial losses under the previous Awami League government. Prepared by a 12-member committee of independent experts led by economist Debapriya Bhattacharya and set up by the interim government, the report outlined rising inequality, crony capitalism and manipulated economic data that masked the true state of the economy. Bhattacharya said, 'The whole system was politicised, and there was a narrative of a high-performing economy. But in reality, it was not that.' While the report offers paths to address Bangladesh’s economic challenges and rebuild public and investor confidence, the findings spotlight the immense challenge of addressing issues of corruption, debt and transparency in public spending. Finally, there is renewed hope in the country as activists and citizens reclaim public spaces and push for change and justice for past wrongs. However, Bangladesh stands at an unusual turning point where growing public freedoms coexist with lingering authoritarian practices such as surveillance and arbitrary detentions. This suggests that transitioning from authoritarian rule not only requires dismantling the entrenched systems of control that have stifled dissent and perpetuated inequality, but it also involves creating an environment where the citizens feel safe to engage in political and social discourse without fear of reprisal. Whether Bangladesh can forge a governance model that prioritises accountability and justice remains the most pertinent longer-term concern. Success will require not just the reform of broken systems but also the cultivation of a political culture where power is shared and contested peacefully.

A Quick Note On Trade And Inequality – OpEd	Oren Cass, the head economist of Compass, had a column in the New York Times touting Donald Trump’s proposed tariffs. The gist of the piece is that 'free trade' has not worked out as economists’ textbooks promised and we should look to take a different path. As someone who was very critical of the major trade deals of the last three decades, I would say that they did work out very much as the economists’ textbooks promised. But they were also not 'free trade' and imposing high tariffs will not help us going forward. First, the economists’ textbooks did not promise that everyone would benefit from opening trade. They show that there would be a redistribution from some types of workers to other types of workers and/or capital. There is a famous article, co-authored by the first American Nobel Prize winner Paul Samuelson, that laid out this theoretical argument more than 80 years ago. Economists pushing NAFTA, China’s entry into in the WTO, and other recent trade deals always waved off the logic of the Stolper-Samuelson model, or alternatively promised government policies to offset the distributional impact of trade openings. As a practical matter, the policies (mostly trade-adjustment assistance) were one or two orders of magnitude too small for the job. We saw millions of workers displaced in manufacturing, as our trade deficit ballooned from 1997 to 2007. Communities across the industrial heartland were devastated as the factories that supported them downsized or shut altogether. We can have lengthy debates about the motives of working-class people who switched from Democrats to Trump voters, but the fact that Democratic presidents pushed trade policies that destroyed millions of good paying jobs for non-college educated workers is not really in dispute. While it is important to recognize the damage caused by trade deals of the last three decades, it is also essential to recognize that these were not 'free trade' deals even though this is what their proponents like to claim. These deals did little or nothing to free up trade in highly paid professional services, like the services of physicians or dentists. As a result, while our manufacturing workers get paid less than their counterparts in Western Europe, our physicians get paid more than twice as much as doctors in countries like Germany and Canada. The trade deals were all about lowering barriers to trade in manufactured goods, with the predictable effect of lost jobs and lower wages for manufacturing workers. But when it came to discussions of lowering the barriers to foreign doctors and foreign-trained professionals working in the U.S., most of the 'free-traders' would suddenly get really dumb, as though they didn’t understand the concept of free trade. And to be clear, the economics textbooks tell us the same thing about free trade in professional services as they say about free trade in cars and shoes. If we paid our doctors the same as doctors in West Europe it would knock more than $100 billion a year ($1,000 per family) off our national health care bill. But we don’t have free trade in physicians’ services. But it gets worse. Even as we were lowering barriers to trade in manufactured goods, we were increasing barriers to trade in intellectual products in the form of longer and stronger patent and copyright protections. These protections are government-granted monopolies, 180 degrees opposite of free trade. Yet somehow every major 'free trade' deal for the last four decades included provisions making these monopolies longer and stronger both in our trading partners and in the United States. The effect of longer and stronger patent and copyright protection is to redistribute income from the rest of us to those in a position to benefit from them. Bill Gates would probably still be working for a living if the government didn’t threaten to arrest people who copied Microsoft software without his permission. And to be clear, there is an enormous amount of money at stake. The higher prices from patent and copyright monopolies almost certainly cost us more than $1 trillion a year. They cost us more than $500 billion ($4,000 per family) in the case pharmaceutical alone. Patent and copyright monopolies do serve a purpose. They provide an incentive for innovation and creative work. But they are not the only way to provide this incentive. For example, we support more than $50 billion a year in biomedical research through the National Institutes of Health and other government agencies. Most importantly for this argument is the recognition that patent and copyright monopolies are government policies that should be treated as such. We can argue whether they are the best policy, but they are certainly not free trade, and it is a lie to call them free trade. Tariffs and the Trump Route Forward Getting the free trade story right is important for what we think is the best route going forward. The fact that reducing trade barriers in manufacturing was bad for non-college educated workers doesn’t mean that raising those barriers now will be good news for these workers. The wage premium that manufacturing workers had enjoyed in years past had largely disappeared. This means that if we get back jobs in the auto industry or textile industry, there is little reason to think these jobs will pay better than alternative jobs in warehouses or health care. High tariffs just mean that all workers will be paying higher prices for a wide range of goods in order to shift a relatively small number of other workers into not especially good-paying jobs in manufacturing. The reason manufacturing jobs were good paying jobs was because these jobs were far more likely to be union jobs than other private sector jobs. In 1980 more than 30 percent of manufacturing jobs were unionized, compared to 15 percent for the rest of the private sector. Today, the gap is just 8.0 percent compared to 6.0 percent. That’s still a difference, but not one that has much impact. If we got back another 1 million manufacturing jobs as a result of tariffs, a very big lift, it would translate into roughly 20,000 more union workers. That’s a pretty small drop in the bucket in a labor force of more than 160 million. If we want to reverse the rise in inequality of the last four decades, we should make use of those economics textbooks rather than ignoring them, as Mr. Cass advocates. We should do everything possible to have freer trade in highly paid professional services, exposing our most highly paid workers to the same sort of competition, both domestically and internationally, that our factory workers have long faced. And we should look to shorten and weaken the patent and copyright monopolies that have shifted so much income upward and made items like prescription drugs incredibly expensive. In the absence of patent monopolies, drugs would almost always be cheap, patent monopolies make them expensive. We also need to pursue other mechanisms for supporting innovation and creative work. This is the conversation that we need to have and one that unfortunately will not take place in the pages of the New York Times or other leading media outlets. In fact, the econ textbooks have much to teach us if we actually pay attention to what they say and don’t use them selectively to push a class agenda.

Pakistan Launches Air Strikes On Militant Hideouts In Afghanistan	(RFE/RL) -- Pakistani military jets on December 24 conducted air strikes inside Afghanistan, targeting suspected hideouts of the Islamist militant group Tehrik-e Taliban Pakistan (TTP). The TTP positions targeted were in the Murgha area of the Bermal district in Afghanistan's Paktika Province, according to sources. The area borders the Angoor Adda town in Pakistan's volatile South Waziristan tribal district. Pakistani jets carried out strikes against one target in the Murgha area and two more areas of the Bermal district. There has been no official comment from Pakistan, but some accounts on X believed to be related to Pakistani intelligence confirmed the strikes and claimed casualties among the TTP militants. An Afghan Taliban leader, speaking to RFE/RL on condition of anonymity, confirmed the strikes but added that it is too early to report on casualties. The Afghan Taliban leader said an Afghan government official confirmed to him that there were strikes in three places in Paktika Province but it was not yet known who was targeted. Pakistani security sources say the hideouts of the TTP were hit and dozens of militants were killed. But a TTP official who spoke with RFE/RL said a camp of Pakistani displaced persons was bombed and civilians killed. Pakistan says that TTP militants are hiding across the border in Afghanistan, and Islamabad has repeatedly asked the Afghan Taliban to take action against them. But the Afghan Taliban say the TTP are in Pakistan. The air strikes on December 24 come just days after TTP militants carried out a raid near the northwestern border with Afghanistan that killed 16 security officers. The attack occurred when militants opened fire at a security checkpoint in South Waziristan in the early hours of December 21. Laddha Police Deputy Superintendent Hidayat Ullah told RFE/RL that, in addition to the 16 killed, eight officers were wounded. The TTP, which seeks to impose Shari'a law in Pakistan, claimed responsibility for the attack and said it killed 35 Pakistani security officers. RFE/RL could not independently confirm the number of dead. Neither side said how many militants were killed during the attack. The year already had been one of the deadliest for the region. There has been a steady increase in TTP attacks in Pakistan’s northwestern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Province since the Taliban regained control of Kabul in August 2021. The Pakistan Center for Conflict and Security Studies said in its most recent report that more than 240 people were killed in 'terrorist incidents' in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa in November. The death toll included 68 security officers, the highest in a single month this year. Meanwhile, the Army Public Relations Directorate (ISPR) claims to have killed dozens of suspected militants in operations in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa this month. The governments of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Pakistan say they are committed to wiping out the TTP.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWeIFrlOO4j9vAxB4abWU-yY	2024-12-24T15:35:44-08:00	
Japanese Automotive Giants Honda And Nissan Announce Merger To Ta...	By Wei Wei According to Nikkei Asia, Japanese automotive giants Honda and Nissan are in talks to establish a holding company that would oversee both automakers, with plans to sign a memorandum of understanding (MOU) for this new entity as soon as possible. At the same time, Honda and Nissan are considering including Mitsubishi Motors in this new holding company. Currently, Nissan holds a 24% stake in Mitsubishi Motors, making it the largest shareholder. Reuters also reports that it remains unclear whether the creation of the new holding company is intended to lead to a full-fledged alliance between the two companies, but they have indeed begun merger negotiations. As of December 2024, Honda has a market value of JPY 5.95 trillion (approximately USD 38.8 billion), while Nissan's market value is JPY 1.17 trillion (approximately USD 7.6 billion). If the merger goes through, it would become the largest deal in the industry since the 2021 merger between Fiat Chrysler and Peugeot-Citroën. In fact, since March of this year, the two automakers have strengthened their cooperation. They have agreed to explore strategic partnerships in electric vehicles (EVs) and other areas, as well as to explore various possibilities for future collaboration, with the aim of sharing more resources in the face of intense global competition. In August, they further deepened their ties, agreeing to collaborate on batteries, axles, and other technologies. Analysts at the time pointed out that their goal is to catch up with Chinese automakers, who have already taken the lead in the EV sector, while Japanese companies have lost their edge by focusing on hybrid vehicles. Honda and Nissan are the second and third-largest automakers in Japan, behind Toyota. However, their market share in key regions has been steadily declining, with stagnant demand in Europe and the United States adding to the pressures they face. Honda's performance report for the 2024 fiscal year (April to September) revealed revenues of JPY 5.4 trillion, an 8.2% year-on-year increase. However, operating profit was JPY 257.9 billion, a 14.6% decline compared to the previous year. Net profit stood at JPY 100 billion (approximately USD 656 million), down 61% year-on-year. More notably, Honda's results exhibited a clear polarization. While its motorcycle business saw continuous profit growth, the automotive division showed significant regional disparities, with a sharp decline in net profit attributable to the parent company. In the Chinese market, sales dropped by 29.3%, totaling 588,018 units. In North America, sales rose by 35.5%, reaching 1,358,000 units, but net profit attributable to the parent company still fell by 19.7%. Nissan has been deep in a financial crisis for some time. According to multiple media reports, the company is actively seeking new investors, or it could face bankruptcy within about a year. While rumors about Nissan's potential bankruptcy are circulating, the real situation is that the company's performance has worsened further in 2023-2024. According to Nissan's financial report, its net revenue for the first half of the 2024 fiscal year (April to September) declined by 1.3% year-on-year to JPY 5.9842 trillion (approximately USD 38.9 billion), operating profit fell by 90.2% to JPY 32.9 billion (approximately USD 210 million), and net profit was JPY 19.2 billion (approximately USD 125 million), a 93.5% year-on-year decline. During the same period, global new car sales dropped by 1.6% to 1.596 million units. More importantly, one of the key reasons for Nissan's financial losses is the poor performance of its overseas markets. In North America, sales of EVs continued to decline. North America is Nissan's most important overseas market, and according to 2023 data, U.S. sales accounted for 26.6% of Nissan's total global sales. If Honda, Nissan, and Mitsubishi successfully merge, their annual car sales are expected to exceed 8 million units. This would place the new company among the largest automakers in the world, just behind Toyota (11.2 million units in 2023 sales) and the German automaker Volkswagen (9.2 million units in 2023 sales). This would undoubtedly significantly enhance the global competitiveness of the new Honda-Nissan holding company. In the past two years, global automakers have faced increasing challenges from EV manufacturers. The price war initiated by Tesla and BYD has put even more pressure on multinational automotive giants, whose profits have been dwindling and are on the verge of losses. In September of this year, General Motors (GM) announced that it was exploring ways to collaborate with South Korea's Hyundai Motor to reduce costs, including joint vehicle development. The European automotive sector has also been thrown into chaos, with Volkswagen threatening to close its German factories for the first time in its 87-year history, lay off workers, and cut wages in an effort to reduce costs and boost profits. However, this was immediately met with a strike from 100,000 workers, and intense negotiations are currently underway with labor unions over cost-cutting measures. Volkswagen's predicament has prompted Germany's Ministry of Labor and Social Affairs to step in to help the company navigate its current crisis. Meanwhile, the global automotive industry may also face the threat of newly-elected U.S. President Donald Trump retracting EV-friendly policies. Trump has vowed to take a tough stance on imported cars, including threatening a 25% tariff on vehicles imported from Canada and Mexico. He may also seek concessions from Honda and Nissan in exchange for approving any merger or deal. The potential merger between Honda and Nissan may also involve the future relationship between Japan's two major conglomerates behind them, the Mitsubishi Group and the Fuyo Group. In Japan, conglomerates maintain close ties through methods such as identity qualifications, capital alliances, and cross-shareholding. This structure allows member companies to support each other in the face of market risks, enhancing their overall competitiveness. Honda is a member of the Mitsubishi Group's Kinyo-kai, an informal organization composed of senior executives from major Mitsubishi Group companies, primarily established to strengthen internal connections and coordination within the group. Nissan, on the other hand, is one of the core companies of the Fuyo Group, with its development closely linked to its financial and industrial capital. Nissan, along with well-known brands such as Hitachi and Canon, forms a tight-knit cooperative relationship within the framework of the group. Although Renault, Nissan's major shareholder, has yet to comment, ANBOUND’s founder Mr. Kung Chan believes that the merger between Honda and Nissan could also involve Renault. For Renault, this likely means the divestiture of its stake in Nissan. In 1999, Renault acquired more than one-third of Nissan's shares, which later increased to 43%. For a long time, Nissan has been the larger and more profitable of the two partners, which led to dissatisfaction within Nissan regarding the Japan-France alliance. However, last year, Renault reduced its stake in Nissan to 15%. Given that this merger between Nissan and Honda is taking place within the framework of Japanese conglomerates, it is estimated that it will be difficult for Renault to maintain any shares in the new entity. The merger of these two Japanese automotive giants has attracted widespread attention. Mr. Kung Chan believes that the merger of automotive giants is a trend. The competitiveness of manufacturing industries should sometimes be viewed from the perspective of the entire industry. Internal integration is a form of integrating core competitiveness. It is sustained and upward, aiming at leading enterprises. Only in this way can the manufacturing industry achieve self-reinforcement, overall improvement, and ultimately reflect on global competitiveness. The merger between Honda and Nissan is expected to achieve a combined production and sales volume of 8 million units in the future. If the strategic vision is solely focused on a single company, that entity will be too small, and its ceiling will be too low. Amid the intense global market competition, this could lead to a wave of failures. Chinese automotive manufacturers are already facing such a trend. Recently, after companies like Hozon Auto, HiPhi, WM Motor, and JIDU, news has also emerged of a potential crisis at FAW Jilin Automobile. If, as Mr. Chan predicted, a 'wave of failures' occurs, with widespread bankruptcies and layoffs, it would indicate flaws within the automotive industry itself, i.e., flaws that can no longer be digested or remedied within the industry. Therefore, he suggests that government industrial policies should focus more on the overall industry, rather than just individual sectors. Since there is now an emphasis on a 'unified national market' in China, if industrial policies do not keep up or fail to understand this aspect, the problem will be significant, and a 'wave of failures' will still occur. Final analysis conclusion: To respond to the global competition in the automotive industry, Japanese automotive giants Honda and Nissan plan to establish a holding company. If the merger is successful, they will be able to achieve a production and sales volume of 8 million units, ranking just behind Toyota and Volkswagen globally. Mr. Kung Chan believes that the merger of automotive giants is a trend, and China's automotive industry policies should focus on the industry as a whole, rather than on individual sectors.

How The Third Reich Remade German Christmas In The Nazi Image – O...	By Ryan McMaken Revolutionary totalitarian regimes have long attempted to make Christmas disappear, or to at least make Christmas into something more to the state’s liking. The earliest example of this can found with the French revolutionaries. Shortly after the First French Republic was established in 1792, the state imposed a new calendar which established a year of twelve 30-day months divided into three 10-day weeks. This new calendar, which was explicitly anti-Christian, abolished all Christian holidays and saint days and replaced them with days commemorating agricultural tools, trees, grains, and minerals. In revolutionary France, especially during the years of the Terror, from 1793 to 1794, 'most of the clergy [was] in hiding, and all of the churches [were] closed.'1 Needless to say, during this period, few celebrated Christmas openly, and Christmas generally disappeared from public view until Bonaparte’s coup in 1799. In the twentieth century, the Soviet Union carried out similar efforts to rid the people of their attachment to Christmas. Like the French revolutionaries, the Soviets were explicitly anti-Christian, and attempted to get rid of Sundays, in a way, by abolishing the weekend. Religious holidays were also out. In their place, the Soviets implemented a continuous work week designed to maximize industrial output and to prevent a common 'day of rest' which might encourage religious observance or closer ties to family members. Christmas, of course, was in the crosshairs also. The state replaced Christmas with a winter holiday. Father Christmas became 'Father Frost' and the Christmas Tree became the 'Winter Tree.' German National Socialists—also known as the 'Nazis'—tried a different tactic. Rather than abolish the observance of Christmas altogether, they attempted to redefine Christmas by making it into a day celebrating the German nation and National Socialist values. This was done by a variety of propaganda efforts designed to blur the line between Christianity and German nationalism while superimposing Nazi iconography on traditional Christmas symbols and images. While it might appear that National Socialists were more tolerant of the Christian holiday than the French revolutionaries or the Soviets, all three regimes shared the same goal. All three sought to rein in or destroy Christmas because it endured as a reminder of a world view and a historical narrative that was in conflict with the regime’s preferred ideology and version of history. In other words, Christmas—and the international Christian religion it helped perpetuate—presented a competing world view that was outside the direct control of the state. This made Christianity a rival that no totalitarian was inclined to tolerate. Nazi Neo-Paganism and 'Positive Christianity' From the earliest years of National Socialism and the Nazi party (the NSDAP), the party had professed what it called 'Positive Christianity' which was a religious movement that mixed together Nazi racial ideology with elements of Christianity. The Nazis who professed to believe in Positive Christianity nonetheless were hostile to established churches in Germany such as the Catholic and Lutheran churches. Most Christian groups, whether Catholic, Protestant, or Orthodox, did not regard Positive Christianity as Christian at all. For their part, the Positive Christians denied a variety of basic Christian doctrines so as to facilitate a belief system that prioritized racial theories and viewed Adolf Hitler as a type of savior figure. It remains a matter of debate as to whether the adherents of Positive Christianity had any sincere interest in Christianity, or if Positive Christianity was simply a cynical invention designed to trick German Christians into believing that National Socialism was somehow compatible with Nicene Christianity. In any case, it is clear that many in the Nazi leadership were more interested in German paganism. Indeed, Samuel Koehne notes that 'neither paganism nor the esoteric was excluded from the NSDAP in its early years, despite its nominal advocacy of 'positive Christianity.'2 In fact, Koehne concludes that '’positive Christianity’ meant little to the Nazi Party at the very same time it was proclaimed to be a part of their Program.'3 The view of many National Socialists was no doubt reflected in the words of Joseph Goebbels when he concluded there is 'an insoluble opposition between the Christian and a heroic-German world view.' This reflects beliefs that were common among many German intellectuals at the time. Following trends that date back to the early years of German Romanticism, many Germans, by the late nineteenth century had turned to fanciful new narratives about German racial origins and paganism. Two architects of this movement were Guido von List and Jörg Lanz von Liebenfels, both advocates of the German ethnic nationalist Völkisch movement. List is known for inventing the Armanen runes that were later popular among Nazi occultists. Liebenfels, according to Koehne, supported the notion of Christianity as a 'racial cult religion,' interpreting the Bible through a bizarre exegesis that argued the Old Testament taught the dangers of racial admixture, supported Moses as a 'Darwinist' and preacher of 'racial morality'– rewriting the Ten Commandments as laws for racial purity––and advocated 'a dualistic heresy which describes the battling forces of Good and Evil, typified by the Aryan ace men and their savior Frauja, a Gothic name for Jesus, who calls for the sacrificial extermination of the sub-men, the 'apelings' and all other racial inferiors.4 It was partly under the influence of religious doctrines such as these that the National Socialists come into being in Germany while professing their new version of Christianity. It is not surprising, then, that from the mid-1930s to the end of the war, the Nazis attempted to inject German neopaganism and Nazi ideology into the Christian religious practices of ordinary Germans. Christmas specifically became a target for these pagan nationalists who sought to turn the Christian holiday into a specifically German festival. This was helped along by ongoing efforts to discover or invent connections between German Christmas traditions and German paganism. As historian Joe Perry puts it, articles on the 'Germanic legacy' in popular Christmas customs appeared regularly in scholarly publications throughout the Nazi years. Many of these writers 'recovered or invented any number of ‘Nordic’ Christmas customs and clarified the links between pagan solstice festivities and the ‘return to light’ rituals favored by the Nazis.'5 Indeed, many Nazi intellectuals went to great pains to obfuscate orthodox Christian Christmas traditions with new definitions of Christmas as a festival for the winter solstice and sun worship. Some local German traditions, of course, may have partly originated in some earlier German pagan rituals, although these were hardly foundational to any actual Christian doctrines which had developed in the Mediterranean more than a thousand years before. Naturally, the National Socialists sought to downplay the Middle Eastern and Jewish origins of Christianity and instead re-invent Christianity as a product of the German volk. From the Nazi perspective, the celebration of Christmas was to be transformed into a celebration of the German nation and not of Christianity which, of course, predated all European states and was hardly founded on ideals that buttressed modern notions of German nationalism. Christmas, Redefined What this meant in practice became gradually apparent once the Nazis came to power in the mid 1930s. Perry describes what these new celebrations of 'the nation' looked like: From outdoor decoration to annual Christmas markets … nazification transformed conventional uses of public holiday space and display into unavoidable celebrations of the national community. Official messages of national harmony dominated public decorations in the holiday season. Swastikas adorned the 'people’s Christmas trees' and electric light displays set up across Germany. In larger cities, the Nazi obsession with public decoration reached spectacular proportions. In Dresden in 1933, a thirty-foot-high 'Christmas nativity scene' was installed on the street outside the main train station. Christian and Nazi iconography merged in three tiers of electric lights. At the bottom, a domestic family scene represented the German people, the foundation of the state. The middle tier featured the holy family around the baby Jesus, and a choir of angels in the top tier recycled a generic holiday motif. A giant swastika and eagle capped the entire display. The conflicted combination of Christian and Nazi motifs was typical of early holiday propaganda and revealed some confusion among party leaders over the correct relationship between church and state; at the same time, the display limned official conceptions of social hierarchy that placed the German folk as well as the Holy Family under the protection—or subordination—of the regime.6 As the Nazi years wore on through the thirties and in to the forties, the hierarchy became clear: the blood and soil ideology of the German Reich must be regarded as superior to the universalism of Christianity. The new savior, the German Fuhrer, would replace the old one. The orthodox Christians, after all, viewed the incarnation and birth of a non-German Christ in a non-German land as the central event of the Christmas celebration. The Christian savior applied his saving mission to all humanity, much unlike the Fuhrer and his Thousand Year Reich. The National Socialists therefore presented Christmas as a festival of German national unity above all else. This plan met with some success, in part because participation in the new German unity cult was essentially mandatory. Although the Christian churches regarded the new German syncretism as heretical and anti-Christian, it was also known that those who complained too much about the regime’s treatment of the Churches met with unfortunate ends. Dissenting clergy saw their church building seized by the state, and vocal dissenters were arrested. Even mild complaints about the 'festivities' were not exactly appreciated by the authorities. As one policeman in Essen put it, Germans who were insufficiently enthusiastic about the state’s Christmas programs were 'ripe for the concentration camp.'7 In spite of the standing threats and the endless propaganda, the Nazi grip on Christmas eventually began to fade. By late 1943, as the war situation looked increasingly dour, many Germans lost interest in going through the motions of the 'people’s Christmas.' In a sense, the National Socialists had, like the French and the Soviets before them, succeeded in making Christmas—at least the real version of Christmas—largely disappear from public life. This, of course, was what the Nazi state had wanted all along: to subsume all independent Christianity under the new pagan nationalistic doctrines of the German state. Many Germans didn’t see what was happening until it was much too late.

Syrians Welcome New Rulers’ Pledge Of Moderation But Concerned Ab...	By Sirwan Kajjo With the militant group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) consolidating power in Syria following the ouster of President Bashar al-Assad, many Syrians fear the influence of extremist factions within the Islamist organization. HTS, a U.S.-designated terrorist group, emerged as the de facto ruler of Syria after Assad’s fall on December 8, following an 11-day rebel offensive. Formerly known as al-Nusra Front, the HTS was the main affiliate of al-Qaida in Syria until 2017, when it formally severed ties with the global terror group. Since seizing control of Damascus, HTS leader Ahmad al-Sharaa -- formerly known by his nom de guerre, Abu Mohammed al-Jolani, has adopted a more moderate stance, pledging to establish a state founded on tolerance and coexistence among the country’s diverse ethnic and religious groups. Despite such overtures, many Syrians remain skeptical about the new rulers’ ability to rein in the more radical elements within HTS. Al-Masri, a resident of Damascus who provided only his last name, acknowledged that the new authorities have largely maintained order in the capital and elsewhere but expressed concerns that this stability could be short-lived. 'We know that Hayat Tahir al-Sham is trying to change, and we welcome that,' he told VOA via a messaging app. 'But there are two things that people in my circle are really concerned about. One is how genuine al-Sharaa is, and the other is how much control he really has over the more radical people in his group,' said al-Masri, who is a Sunni Muslim.His fears were echoed by another resident of Damascus who spoke to VOA on the condition of anonymity. 'Syrians in general, including the conservative ones, are not inclined to extremism,' the resident said. 'If al-Jolani keeps his promises and controls his men, then Syrians will support him. But if extremists dominate, Syrians will rise against them just as they rose against Bashar al-Assad,' the resident added, referring to the popular uprising against the former regime that began in 2011. Aymenn Jawad al-Tamimi, an expert on Islamist groups in Syria, says one of the main tensions he sees is 'between the HTS leadership under al-Jolani and the action of individual members who for years were fed propaganda' about other religions and sects. 'They may collectively impute guilt to Alawites and others like Christians and engage in attacks and insults,' he told VOA. On Monday, armed gunmen burned down a Christmas tree in the Christian-majority town of Suqaylabiya in Hama province in central Syria. Shortly after that, the HTS issued a statement saying the perpetrators, whom it described as foreign fighters, will be punished. While their exact numbers are unknown, fighters from several countries have joined HTS over the years, with Uighurs from China’s Muslim-majority region of Xinjiang being most notable. Aaron Zelin, a senior fellow at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy, said there have not been any indications of opposition within the main ranks of HTS toward al-Jolani’s current moderate approach. 'Even if there are people on their farther right flank that might be upset with them, it is plausible that if they then act out, the HTS and the caretaker government will arrest them,' he told VOA. 'I’m sure there are a lot of internal discussions and debates about how far they can go,' Zelin added. 'There are also the questions for some of them like ‘We will wait and see what this is like until the transition is over,’ and if this is just a public relations campaign, then maybe we will see some differences and changes and more reactions,' Zelin added. HTS has appointed a caretaker government, composed of loyalists, to manage affairs until March 1, 2025, the new government’s own deadline for initiating a transitional process. Caroline Rose, director of the Strategic Blind Spots Portfolio at the Washington-based New Lines Institute, believes 'that ultimately al-Sharaa will sideline the more extremist factions within HTS, the caretaker government, and the new government post-March 1.' She told VOA that this approach could particularly work if foreign governments 'keep normalization, sectoral sanctions relief, and delisting [from lists of designated terrorist groups] as an opportunity and a ‘carrot’ to incentivize behavioral change.'	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWeIFrlOO4j9vFjgQyIZ2Mny	2024-12-24T15:29:41-08:00	
Robert Reich: We The People Will Prevail – OpEd	The holidays provide an apt time to pause and assess where we are. You have every reason to be worried about what happens after January 20. Many people could be harmed. Yet I continue to have an abiding faith in the common sense and good-heartedness of most Americans, despite the outcome of the election. Many traditional Democratic voters did not vote — either because they were upset about the Biden administration’s support for Benjamin Netanyahu or they were unmoved by Kamala Harris. Others chose Trump because their incomes have gone nowhere for years and they thought the system needed to be 'shaken up.' An explanation is not a justification. There have been times when I doubted America. I think the worst was 1968, with the assassinations of Martin Luther King Jr. and then Bobby Kennedy, the riots and fires that consumed our cities, the horrific Democratic convention in Chicago along with protests and violent police response, the election of the dreadful Nixon, and the escalating carnage of Vietnam. It seemed to me then that we had utterly lost our moral compass and purpose. But the Watergate hearings demonstrated to me that we had not lost it. Democrats and Republicans worked together to discover what Nixon had done. I had much the same feeling about the brilliant work done by the House’s special committee to investigate January 6, 2021 including the work of chair Bennie Thompson and vice chair Liz Cheney. I think it important not to overlook the many good things that happened under the Biden-Harris administration — the most aggressive use of antitrust and most pro-union labor board I remember, along with extraordinary legislative accomplishments. When I think about what’s good about America, I also think about the jurors, prosecutors, and the judge in Trump’s trial in Manhattan, who took extraordinary abuse. Their lives and the lives of their families were threatened. But they didn’t flinch. They did their duty. I think about our armed services men and women. Our firefighters and police officers. Our teachers and social workers. Our nurses who acted with such courage and dedication during the pandemic. I think about all the other people who are putting in countless hours in our cities and towns and states to make our lives better. A few days ago, I ran into an old friend who’s spending the holidays running a food kitchen for the unhoused. 'How are you?' she asked, with a big smile. 'Been better,' I said. 'Oh, you’re still in a funk over the election,' she said. 'Don’t worry! We’ll do fine. There’s so much work to do.' 'Yes, but Trump is …' She stopped me, her face turning into a frown. 'Nothing we can do about him now, except get ready for his regime. Protect the people who’ll be hurt.' 'You’re right.' After a pause she said, 'we had to come to this point, you know.' 'What do you mean?' 'Biden couldn’t get done nearly enough. The reactionary forces have been building for years. They’re like the puss in an ugly boil.' 'That’s the worst metaphor I’ve heard!' I laughed. 'The boil is on our collective ass,' she continued, laughing along with me. 'And the only way we get up enough courage to lance the boil it is for it to get so big and so ugly and so mean that no one can sit down!' 'I don’t know whether you’re an optimist or a pessimist,' I said, still laughing. 'Neither,' she explained, turning serious. 'A realist. I’ve had it with wishy-washy Democratic ‘centrists.’ A few years of the miserable Trump administration and we can get back to the real work of the country.' 'I hope you’re right.' 'And now I have to get back to work. Lots of people to feed! Merry Christmas, Happy Hanukah, Happy New Year!' With that, she was gone.

Bangladesh After Hasina: An Ideological Rebranding? – OpEd	Since Bangladesh’s interim regime removed the portraits of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman (Mujib, Bangabandhu/father of the nation) from the Bangladesh president’s office, Dr. Mohammad Yunus faced one question across the spectrum: Did such incidents feature a historic rebranding of the Awami League (AL)-sponsored and Mujib-focused Bengali national identity fostered since the country’s 1971 independence? We are yet to fully grasp the diverse actors and the ideological proclivities behind the July-August uprising that ejected Hasina out of power and the volatile political calculus that has emerged since then. When the furious mobs rampaged Hasina’s residence, Mujib’s statues in public places, his old house and their pictures in government offices, the protesters’ footprints were no longer hard to discern. And then the campaigners rolled against the centuries-old Sufi shrines in Dhaka and other such places—the enraged mob cursed the shrinegoers as Islam forbids 'grave-worshipping.' Much to the liberal dismay, those events stretched as an extraordinary political comeback of the Jamaat-e-Islami (Jamaat), Chatra Shibir (Shibir), its student wing and their allies ---somewhat reminiscent of the Islamic parties’ regrouping after the BKSAL’s single party dictatorship violently ended on August 15, 1975. Jamaat, of course, has a record of coming alive after lying low under pressure except that its recent ubiquity seems more convincing now than its past encounters. But in 2024, the so-called rightwing parties filled the void caused by the rising distrust and unpopularity of liberal/secular parties and their leaders. With their allies, Jamaat leaders are more determined to restore their political legitimacy severed by Hasina’s sledgehammer administration. The July-August revolt upheld the rightwing Islamist parties’ survival as a movement under unprecedented coercion. It is that resilience which will define those parties’ future role and survival in Bangladesh. Mostly aimed at the decapitation of the Islamist parties and their cohorts, the intolerant waves of the post-1971 revenges rained down like a xenophobic nationalism dividing Bangladesh between 'us' against 'them!' The 1971 specter still preoccupies Bangladesh in 2024! In post-Hasina Bangladesh, the non-secular Muslim groups and their leaders dared the dripping contempt of their liberal antagonists. Jamaat’s return to mainstream politics in post-Hasina Bangladesh implied a de facto acquiescence to the ascending Islamic parties although they are yet to prove their legitimacy through their electoral gains. The Islamic parties’ diplomatic outreach augmented in Dhaka since Hasina’s downfall. A delegation of Jamaat and the Islamic parties recently received an invitation to visit China. The major parties (except AL and its allies) pledged for national unity is the country’s new imperative. During the rise and fall of parties in the country’s power void, the Islamist parties have quietly attracted diplomatic attention. AL, an institutional inheritance from East Pakistan, carried the center-left party label. Under Hasina, however, AL became an intolerant political apparatus desperate to win an election with or without a partnership, and, when convenient, through widespread civil rights violation, and by rampant vote rigging too. Major Bangladeshi parties assembled around their respective charismatic leaders since 1971, not so much around a firm ideology or on steady institutional foundation. Pakistan’s 'two-nation theory' had a Muslim gist, but the 1956 constitution did not create a dogmatic Islamic state. As a contrast, India, with a secular constitution became a virtual Hindu Raj under Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s BJP rule. Hasina’s ideological ambivalence searched for a 'Secularism Lite' to bring her party back to power. And it was not the party’s exclusionary secularism that eventually brought AL back to power after a 22-year hiatus in 1997. The Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP), a believer in Bangladesh nationalism (a blend of Muslim identity and Bengali nationalism) is also a nationalist and a not-so-ideological party that wants to win election with or without coalitions. Neither AL nor BNP had an ideological sweep in the parliamentary elections from 1991 to 2008. With 30.8 votes in 1991, the BNP leader Begum Khaleda Zia (Khaleda) forged a coalition government with like-minded groups, Jamaat backing and independents. Later, the party had a mixed performance with 33.5 (1996), 42.7% (2001) and 32.74 (2008) of votes in three respective voting. But the BNP’s alliance with Jamaat caused the AL allegation that Khaleda’s rule carried the 'right-wing, violent and anti-patriotic' partners. More earnestly, the AL and BNP fought over who first declared Bangladesh independence on 25th March 1971—Mujib or Ziaur Rahman, then a young Major in Pakistan army. Was it an ideological struggle? Faced with Indian disapproval of the post-Hasina interim regime, Bangladeshis feared that New Delhi was a threat to their national sovereignty. Whether a party is pro-Indian is more worrying to Bangladeshis than the outfit’s right or leftwing inclinations. Jamaat got 12.1% of the popular votes in 1991---it was the party’s highest voting accomplishment in the first four parliamentary elections since 1991. And then it received 8.61% (1996), 4.62% (2001) and 4.55 (2008) votes in three elections. One of the reasons for the less popular votes for Jamaat was its hesitation to seriously contest for three hundred legislative seats. The Islamic Oikya Jote (IOJ), allied with the BNP got only 0.79% votes and one seat in 1991. And in 1996, the IOJ received 1.09 % votes and won one elected seat; later in 2001—the IOJ got less than 1% votes but won two legislative seats when they allied with BNP. Those voting figures did not signify any predominance of the Islamist parties, but the secular liberal establishments and the international media raised an alarm about Islamic orthodoxy seizing Bangladesh. Except for a limited electoral participation in 'safe' constituencies with AL blessings, the leftist parties have not shown any upper hand. Social media reported their presence in the July-August protests. BNP also claimed that hundreds if its cohorts died, jailed, or injured in the July-August-Street roil. But the Islamist groups’ proven street power in the summer of 2024 surged their political standing in Bangladesh. On its own, Jamaat was a movement-leaning party with its cadre and the known Islamic creed while it is also keen on election as touched earlier in this essay. In 2001, Jamaat, the largest Islamist party, got 4.7 percent popular votes with seventeen seats when it joined the BNP-led coalition government. That was, of course, the dawn of intense rivalry between AL and its allies, on the one hand, and the BNP and the Jamaat on the other. Was it an ideological confrontation or a power struggle, a routine issue between parties? The July-August protests stood for a populist wave ---not a clear ideological surge. More importantly, Bangladesh now fits into a post-secular trend where secular liberalism suffers from misgiving as a cover for authoritarian and dynastic rule backed by India as recently revealed by Hasina’s long and repressive tenure. Both in pre-partition Bengal and in East Pakistan, assorted and personalistic coalitions rose and fell—they were not landmark ideological turmoil. James J. Novak, a visiting writer once observed in his book Bangladesh: Reflections on the Water, 1993 (Indiana University Press), that Bangladeshis had a 'split-level' psyche—partly because of their multi-layered cultural and religious traditions. It is also a Sufi ritual to adapt to diverse elements. Secular liberalism was never the unchallenged political ideology in Bangladesh, and socialism was not the 'frenzied obsession' except as an urban elite preference. Even when the secular Bengali nationalists held their sway in the earlier post-1971 years, the bulk of the Bangladeshi civil society clasped its Muslimness in private life as well as in public display. The revival of political Islam by the Jamaat and its allies and the widely felt rejuvenation of Muslim sensibilities in Bangladesh are, however, not identical. Overwhelming Muslim identity, not a strictly defined ideology or a storm of zealotry, has, of course, its political credence and a national security weight, which are hard to jettison in Bangladesh now. M. Rashiduzzaman, a retired academic in the United States, writes on Bangladesh politics and history. Parts of this essay come from his forthcoming book:Parties and Politics in East Pakistan 1947-71: The Political Inheritances of Bangladesh, Peter Lang. 2024.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWeIFrlOO4j9vMOSEwoK9OdG	2024-12-24T15:26:54-08:00	
US Missile Deployment In The Philippines Is Legitimate: Manila	The deployment of a U.S. mid-range missile system in the Philippines and plans by Manila to acquire it are 'completely legitimate, legal, and beyond reproach,' its defense chief said. China protested against the plan by the Philippines to acquire a Typhon mid-range missile system from the United States to boost its maritime capabilities amid rising tensions in the disputed South China Sea. Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Mao Ning called the plan 'provocative and dangerous,' and said on Monday it was an 'extremely irresponsible choice' not only for the Philippine people and people of all Southeast Asian countries, but also 'to history and to regional security.' Philippine Secretary of National Defense Gilberto Teodoro Jr. said any deployment for the security of the Philippines was its affair. 'The Philippines is a sovereign state, not any country’s ‘doorstep’,' Teodoro said in a statement on Tuesday. He did not refer to the Chinese comment on the missile system but reiterated that the enhancement of Philippine defense capabilities was intended to serve its national interest and 'not targeted against specific countries.' 'Any deployment and procurement of assets related to the Philippines’ security and defense fall within its own sovereign prerogative and are not subject to any foreign veto,' Teodoro said. China and the Philippines have been trading accusations of provocation and intimidation over escalating tensions in parts of the South China Sea that they both claim, especially near reefs that lie within Manila’s exclusive economic zone (EEZ), but are also claimed by Beijing. 'If the Chinese Communist Party is truly intent on reducing tensions and instability in the region, they should … stop their provocative actions … withdraw their illegal presence from the Philippines’ EEZ, and adhere to International Law,' said Teodoro, who also accused Beijing of building up a nuclear arsenal and ballistic missile capability. Typhon system On Monday, Philippine army chief Lt. Gen. Roy Galido – while delivering his year-end report to an audience of domestic and foreign journalists in Manila – confirmed that the army has endorsed a plan to acquire a mid-range missile system 'to boost the country’s capability in protecting its territory.' The mobile system, called Typhon, was deployed to the Philippines early this year as part of a joint military exercise with the U.S. military. Chinese defense minister Dong Jun said in June the deployment was 'severely damaging regional security and stability.' The missile system, developed by U.S. firm Lockheed Martin, has a range of 480 kilometers (300 miles), and is capable of reaching the disputed Scarborough Shoal as well as targets around Taiwan. Galido said that the Typhon would 'protect our floating assets,' referring to Philippine navy and coastguard vessels. The acquisition is taking place as the army is 'tasked to come up with plans to contribute to the comprehensive archipelagic defense,' according to Galido, who added that 'one of our inputs is to be able to defend this land through this type of platform.' Chinese spokeswoman Mao Ning criticized the plan, saying that the Philippines, 'by bringing in this strategic offensive weapon, is enabling a country outside the region to fuel tensions and antagonism in this region, and incite geopolitical confrontation and arms race.'	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWeIFrlOO4j9vKPl-AGDhMag	2024-12-24T15:25:23-08:00	
The Controversy Over Cannibalism – OpEd	A recent investigation of human remains found in the UK's Cheddar Gorge has once again brought a particularly unsavory aspect of our human story into the light: human consumption of other humans. The surprising discovery of cannibalism in the Early Bronze Age comes from the re-examination of the remains of 37 men, women, and children that were found in pieces at the site of Charterhouse Warren, down a disused shaft cut into the Mendip Hills. This is the first instance of cannibalism of humans, or anthropophagy, to be discovered in British prehistory on such a large scale, and the reported findings force a reconsideration of what role cannibalism may have played in the life of humans in the past. Reckoning with such an emotive and sensational topic has never been easy for scientists, however, and there is still quite a lot of controversy about exactly how much cannibalism ever really happened in the past. In the fairly recent past, accusations of cannibalism in a society or group were often considered to be a propaganda move on the part of the accusers. William Arens argued in his 1979 book The Man-Eating Myth that accusations of anthropophagy were never based on observation, only second-hand reports, and reflected deeply held prejudices by racist and colonial commentators. Whether it was the dog-headed Cynocephali, a tribe of barbarian cannibals described by Ancient Greeks that somehow made it down to medieval times or the Carib people who were described as cannibals to the newly arrived Christopher Columbus by the neighboring Arawak group, what most accusations of cannibalism have in common is that they are used to denigrate the humanity of the accused. Columbus's description of the 'Caniba' in his 1490s journal tells of the people he encountered describing their rivals as 'dog-nosed' cannibals. What is left to prove the truth of these accusations then, and what Columbus himself used to bolster his arguments for a dangerous and evil people that had to be subjugated, is the physical evidence left behind by the consumption of human flesh: the bones themselves. While Columbus was, of course, not a biological anthropologist—a scientist who studies bones and teeth from people in the past—it is within the study of human remains of the past that we can start to see the reality of cannibalism. Anthropologists borrow techniques from forensic medicine to identify the traces of trauma left on human bones to quite literally piece together evidence of what has happened to a human body. Knives, axes, teeth, hammers, and other tools leave cuts, furrows, scrapes, and other marks on the bones they touch. These will differ depending on whether they are made in living flesh or dry bone, and what kind of tool was used for what kind of purpose. We know that humans have a long history of butchering animals for food, and we can recognize the characteristic patterns that they use to acquire specific cuts of meat or extract nutritious marrow from bones. Sometimes, this pattern appears on human bones as well. Anthropologists have recognized the characteristic patterns of butchery on human remains in archaeological sites from around the world, across huge swathes of time. There are cups made from skulls from Gough's Cave in the same Cheddar Gorge that date back almost 15,000 years. Bones found in the cave systems of Spain's Atapuerca mountains show that about 800,000 years ago individuals from an ancient hominin species, Homo antecessor, were butchered and eaten by tool-wielding hominins far before the evolution of modern Homo sapiens. Perhaps the best-known examples of large-scale cannibalism come from the south-west of North America, where the remains of people from the Ancestral Puebloan culture were identified as having been cannibalized in the best-selling book Man Corn by anthropologists Christy G. Turner II and Jacqueline A. Turner. The broken-open bones, with distinct cut marks from being severed by tools, characteristic polish where they were stirred in a boiling pot—and later even a human coprolite that showed its owner had eaten another human—were a direct riposte to the anthropologists who insisted cannibalism was only something people accused other people of. It was in fact a disease in living people that forced a reconsideration of whether or not our species was a habitual cannibal—and why. The discovery of a prion disease, kuru, in the Fore people of Papua New Guinea that was transmitted by consuming contaminated human brain tissue of family members during funeral rites demonstrated that cannibalism exists in living cultures. It further showed that the practice is not necessarily the bloodthirsty act of a warlike people, as those with vested interests in making another group 'less' than human, like Columbus, reported. Many instances of what looks like butchery on human remains may reflect a cultural type of cannibalism; a particular society's death rituals. In other cases, ecological pressures such as a natural disaster may prompt eating other humans, as has been proposed for the Ancestral Puebloans who may have been cannibalized during a period of intense drought, or for cases of known anthropophagy such as the Andes Flight Disaster. These far more functional explanations for why humans would eat other humans are a far cry from the violence and inhumanity suggested by Columbus and his classical Western European idea of cannibalism, which is precisely why the Bronze Age remains from Cheddar Gorge come as such a surprise. The remains from Charterhouse Warren show signs that they were attacked and killed en masse as well as signs of being butchered, processed for meat, and even possible scrape marks from human teeth. This suggests that, on top of the cultural and ecological cannibalism we have slowly begun to accept as part of our story, we must also contend with cannibalism as a part of extreme violence that is also part of our species's history.

The End Is Near For Armed Militias In Iraq – OpEd	By Dalia Al-Aqidi Amid shifting regional power dynamics, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken made a notable visit to Baghdad to engage with the Iraqi leadership on the growing influence of armed militias. This visit underscores the Biden administration’s final attempt to stabilize the region while addressing security concerns that directly affect American forces and allies.During his meeting with Iraqi Prime Minister Mohammed Shia Al-Sudani, the American official emphasized the importance of curbing the activities of armed militias. Since their formation, these groups have been responsible for a series of attacks on US military personnel stationed in Iraq. The militias have been instrumental in transferring weapons to militants in Syria, which Washington views as a direct threat not only to regional security but also to Iraq’s sovereignty.The timing of Blinken’s appeal is significant. With Bashar Assad gone and Hezbollah’s recent military defeat, Washington sees an opportunity for Iraq to assert itself. The outgoing administration believes Iraq could act as a stabilizing force in a volatile region, provided its government distances itself from external pressures.While Blinken refrained from publicly naming Iran during his remarks, his focus on militias and weapons smuggling sent a clear message. The US wants Iraq to step up its efforts in preventing those activities and work toward dismantling networks that threaten further regional stability.For its part, Baghdad finds itself in a precarious position. Al-Sudani has expressed a desire to prioritize Iraq’s national sovereignty and avoid entanglement in broader geopolitical conflicts. However, balancing this vision with the reality of Iranian influence within Iraq — politically, economically, and militarily — remains a formidable challenge. This diplomatic mission comes as Washington seeks to capitalize on the weakening position of the so-called 'axis of resistance' in the region. The collapse of Assad’s hold over Syria and Hezbollah’s significant struggles in its conflict with Israel have disrupted Tehran’s regional strategy. Therefore, Blinken’s visit signals an attempt to consolidate these shifts and prevent Tehran from regaining its footing.The influence of foreign-funded armed militias in Iraq was not the only issue on the table. The American diplomat also pressed the Iraqi government to shut down the Houthi office in Baghdad, which operates under the leadership of Ahmed Al-Sharafi, known as Abu Idris. This office functions as a hub for dozens of Houthi military leaders who collaborate closely with the Iraqi Hezbollah Brigades, one of the prominent armed groups supported and funded by Tehran.Although Iraq officially recognizes Yemen’s internationally recognized government, headquartered in Aden, it has never formally acknowledged the Houthis as legitimate representatives of the Yemeni state. Yet, the Houthi presence in Baghdad extends far beyond any standard diplomatic activity. Their operations, led by Abu Idris, remain focused on security coordination, and strategic alliances with Iran-backed groups, including armed militias and certain social organizations. This cooperation allows the Houthis to maintain a level of influence in Iraq despite their unrecognized status, further embedding themselves in the regional network of nonstate actors. In contrast, Osama Mahdi Ghanem, the Yemeni ambassador representing the internationally recognized government, operates through formal diplomatic channels, primarily liaising with Iraq’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs.However, the Houthi activities, conducted in parallel to these formal diplomatic efforts, complicate Iraq’s position and raise questions about its ability — or willingness — to control such groups operating within its borders. The rarely noticed existence of the Houthi office in Baghdad serves as a symbolic and practical extension of Tehran’s regional agenda. It provides the Houthis a platform for coordinating military and political strategies, deepening their ties with Iraqi factions, and sustaining their broader influence in the Middle East. The recent events in Syria bring to mind Iraq’s not-so-distant past as if history is repeating itself. Statues have been torn down, and symbols of authoritarian rule have crumbled under the weight of sweeping change. The fall of Syria’s 61-year Baath regime — built on force, fear, and foreign backing — mirrors what unfolded in Iraq. However, this time, the difference lies in a growing regional consensus to reject armed militias, who have long inflicted suffering and turmoil on the people of the region.With Donald Trump’s inauguration on Jan. 20, his new administration will ramp up pressure on the Iraqi government to dismantle the Popular Mobilization Forces and to sideline armed militias operating outside state control. That type of pressure was not merely rhetorical; during Trump’s first presidential term, Washington took concrete steps to weaken the influence of militias, like targeting their weapons depots and dismantling their military headquarters. The message was clear: Armed groups should not have a place in a sovereign Iraq.Recognizing the gravity of the situation, Iraq’s Shiite Coordination Framework quickly convened a series of meetings centered on concerns that Syria’s scenario might soon play out in Iraq. Key militia leaders participated in these meetings, alarmed by what they perceived as a coordinated plan to dismantle the 'axis of resistance.'Iraq urgently needs genuine reforms within its political system, particularly to address the influence of 'non-state actors,' groups that exploit state resources while undermining the rule of law and legitimate authority. Reform must begin with one critical step — ensuring all weapons are under the state’s exclusive control. Equally important is holding accountable those responsible for the deaths of thousands of Iraqis, including the young protesters of the October Revolution.To truly move forward, Iraq must root out financial, administrative, and political corruption once and for all, which requires bold and decisive actions that prioritize transparency and enforce accountability at every level of governance.The US, regardless of who occupies the White House, will remain committed to a dual mission — supporting Iraq’s stability and sovereignty while working to curb the disruptive influence of armed militias. However, the real challenge lies in whether Iraq can strike this fragile balance — rebuilding its institutions, regaining control, and meeting both domestic and international expectations.The road ahead is difficult, but the need for reform is clear and pressing.

Brazil: Two Arrested In São Paulo On Suspicion Of Trafficking Afg...	By Letycia Bond The Brazilian Federal Police on Monday (Dec. 23) launched an operation to dismantle a criminal organization specializing in human trafficking. The main victims are Afghan families who were sheltering at Guarulhos International Airport. The terminal contains a number of makeshift camps, as it is the only point of entry into Brazil for an Afghan. In all, four search and seizure warrants and two pre-trial detention warrants have been served. The criminals lured victims with false promises of trips to the US, the police reported. The probes are still ongoing. Agents are attempting to find out if other people were involved in the crimes. Human trafficking is often linked to organ trafficking, present-day slave labor, sexual exploitation, and illegal adoption. The most recent crisis in Afghanistan occurred in 2021, when the Taliban fundamentalist group regained power, generating a wave of violence and forced displacement. According to the United Nations Refugee Agency, over 11 thousand refugees from Afghanistan arrived in Brazil from January 2022 to July 2024. A report produced by the Brazilian government and the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime says that hotlines Ligue 180 and Disque 100 received 537 reports of human trafficking from 2021 to 2023. The majority were adult women (59%) and girls (18%). Earlier this year, Brazil’s Ministry of Justice and Public Security launched the Fourth National Plan to Combat Trafficking in Persons, which should run until 2028. The proposal updated the previous plan, which covered 2018 to 2022 and was based on six pillars and 58 goals. In Brazil, the National Policy to Combat Trafficking in Persons was not defined until 2006. In 2016, the Human Trafficking Law was passed, establishing four to eight years in jail and a fine for offenders. Jail time can be increased from one third to a half if the offense is committed by a civil servant while performing their duties. The increase also applies in other circumstances, such as if the victims are children, adolescents, elderly people, or people with disabilities, or if they are taken out of the country.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWeIFrlOO4j9vO-PSKLsMD7N	2024-12-24T15:21:46-08:00	
Armenia Clarifies Hasn’t Recognized Kosovo, Despite Passport Deal	Armenia has not formally recognized Kosovo as an independent state despite agreeing to accept its passports, the Armenian Foreign Ministry clarified on Monday, December 23. The former Serbian province’s deputy foreign minister, Kreshnik Ahmeti, announced on Friday that Yerevan has 'officially recognized Kosovo passports, including regular, diplomatic, and official ones.' 'This is a significant step toward strengthening ties and relations between the citizens and institutions of both countries,' Ahmeti wrote on X. The Foreign Ministry in Yerevan essentially confirmed this. In a statement to RFE/RL’s Armenian Service, it said Armenia and Kosovo have agreed to issue visas to holders of each other’s passports. 'The existing dialogue between Armenia and Kosovo is maintained on various platforms through bilateral meetings and discussions. Steps are being taken to invigorate tourism ties and people-to-people contacts, which does not mean recognition [of Kosovo’s independence,]' the statement said, adding that many other countries have adopted the same policy. Serbia lost control over Kosovo in 1999 after a NATO bombing campaign to stop Serbian forces killing and expelling ethnic Albanians making up the vast majority of the territory’s population. Kosovo declared independence in 2008 and has since been recognized by more than 100 states. Armenia’s former government reacted positively to a 2010 ruling by the International Court of Justice (ICJ) that upheld the legality of Kosovo’s secession from Serbia. It said the UN court thereby backed the principle of peoples’ right to self-determination. Yerevan stopped championing that principle in the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict under Prime Minister Nikol Pashinian in 2022. In 2018, then Kosovo President Hashim Thaci visited Yerevan to attend a summit of the Francophonie organization. Thaci, who is currently standing trial in The Hague for war crimes, was received by his Armenian counterpart Armen Sarkissian at the time.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWeIFrlOO4j9vOGHaCvqFrNh	2024-12-24T15:20:42-08:00	
Hanukah Oil: A Mythic Reality Plus A Messianic Hope – OpEd	Sr. Dawn Mills points out that in ancient days, the most common lamp oil in the Mediterranean was olive oil. The olive branch has from ancient times been a symbol of peace. Today, more than ever, our world needs people who have stored up the oil of peace in order that God's light of peace may burn bright. The oil that fuels our own light is the holy oil of joy that God pours out on us as long as we keep using it. We must pour it out for others; we must open it to burn within us to help others. Proverbs 11:25 states: 'A generous person will prosper; whoever refreshes others will be refreshed.' Counting our blessings leads to generosity, which results in personal and communal growth. As we express gratitude, God uses us to bless others, creating a cycle of mutual enrichment. Psalm 100:4 says: 'Enter his (God's) gates with thanksgiving and his courts with praise; give thanks to him and praise his name.' And Ecclesiastes 3:12-13 responds: 'I know that there is nothing better for people than to be happy and to do good while they live. That each of them may eat and drink, and find satisfaction in all their work—this is a gift of God.' A daily counting of our blessings is an age-old religious advice that actually does help improve our mood and mindset. Hanukah (Hebrew for Dedication) refers both to: The rededication of the ancient Temple in Jerusalem after it was profaned in 168 BCE by an idol installed in it by the Syrian Greek king Antiochus IV; and The dedication and valor of the Makabees and all those who joined them in their Jihad resistance to the attempt by the ruling powers to force the Jews to abandon their God given religion, and conform to Greek forms of worship and culture. Abandoning circumcision was one example. Those who resisted, and their 25 year long dedication to the Jihad struggle, eventually led to religious freedom and national independence for the Jews living in the Land of Israel. The oppression of Judaism by Antiochus IV, the Syrian Greek king, was the first known attempt at suppressing a minority religion, but unfortunately not the last. Other well known attempts were the three century long Roman persecution of Christianity, and the persecution of Muhammad and his followers by the majority of the pagan Arabs in Makkah. All three religions emerged from their varying periods of persecution stronger than ever, and this is the ongoing spiritual lesson of the Hanukah lamp. An oil lamp, once lit by faithful believers, filled with hope and trust in God, can last longer than all the realists and negativists thought was possible. The history: In 200 BCE, King Antiochus III of Syria defeated Egypt and made the Land of Israel a part of the Seleucid Empire. King Antiochus III wanting to conciliate his new Jewish subjects guaranteed their right to 'live according to their ancestral customs' and to continue to practice their religion in the Temple of Jerusalem. However in 175 BCE, his son Antiochus IV invaded Judea to put in power a pro Syrian high Priest. As the first century Jewish historian Josephus relates: 'The king came upon the Jews with a great army, took their city by force, slew a great multitude of those that favored Egypt, and sent out his soldiers to plunder them without mercy. He also spoiled the temple (erecting an idol in it that looked like himself, and thus) put a stop to the daily offerings (to God) for three years and six months.' The tradition: When the Temple in Jerusalem was looted and services stopped, Judaism was outlawed. In 167 BCE Antiochus IV (who named himself 'Manifest God') ordered an altar to Zeus be erected in the Temple. He banned circumcision and ordered pigs to be sacrificed at the altar of the Temple. This provoked a large-scale revolt. Mattityahu, a small town Jewish priest, and his five sons Jochanan Simeon, Eleazar, Jonathan, and Judah led a rebellion against Antiochus. They became known as HaMakabim (the Hammers). In 166 BCE Mattathias died, and Judah Makabee took his place as leader. By 165 BCE the Jewish revolt against the Seleucid monarchy was largely successful. The Temple was liberated and (Hanukah) rededicated. The festival of Hanukah was instituted to celebrate this event. The oil: Judah Makabee ordered the Temple to be purified, and a new altar to be built in place of the one polluted by pig's blood. According to the Torah, pure olive oil was needed for the two six branched menorahs in the Temple, which were required to burn day and night throughout the year. However, there was only enough pure oil found to burn for one or two days, and it would take a week to prepare a fresh supply of pure oil for the two menorahs. Some said to delay the Hanukah of the Temple for a week. Others said to kindle the Temple Menorahs and pray for the oil to last until new pure oil could be made. The two six branched menorahs were lit; and they did not go out prior to the arrival of the new pure oil. An eight-day festival was declared to commemorate this miracle. The eight days: In Biblical days the two most widely celebrated Jewish Holy days were the week-long pilgrimage festivals of the Passover Exodus from Egypt; and Sukkot—the fall harvest festival. Each lasted seven days, but in the Torah, Sukkot had an extra day attached to it making it a combined eight day festival. When Solomon dedicated the First Temple in Jerusalem the celebration lasted seven days and on the eighth day the people went back home. For three years, while the Temple was polluted by the Syrian Greek statue of the king, Jews boycotted the Temple. When the Makabees recaptured Jerusalem and the Temple Mount just eight weeks after the end of Sukkot, they purified the Temple and called its eight day (like Solomon) rededication 'Sukkot in December'. The lights: These can be candles or oil lamps. Most Jewish homes have a special eight branched candelabrum referred to as a hanukiah, or an oil lamp holder for Hanukah, which holds eight lights plus the additional light used to light the others each day. The reason for the Hanukkah lights is not to 'light the house within', but rather to 'illuminate the house without,' so passersby should see it and be reminded of the holiday's miracle. Thus, lamps are set up at a prominent window or near the door leading to the street. Some Ashkenazim (Jews from European Lands) have a separate menorah for each family member (customs vary), whereas most Sephardim (Jews from Muslim Lands) light one for the whole household. The spiritual politics: In the generation after the massive failure of the Bar Kochbah rebellion against the Roman Empire, the sages of Israel carried out a sustained campaign against Hanukah with the intent of demilitarizing and emasculating Hanukah and turning it from a celebration of Jihadi military victories and political successes, into a spiritual Jihad tribute to the ability of faith and trust in God to deliver Israel from danger.The rabbis eliminated the feast of Nikanor´s Day, which celebrated Judah Makabee´s killing of a Syrian Greek general named Nikanor, in direct hand to hand combat. The Rabbis decided that the Fast of Queen Esther mentioned in book of Esther took place on the same day as Judah Makabee's victory, and since it is impossible to observe both a feast and a fast on the same day Queen Esther´s piety squelched Judah Maccabees´s military prowess. For the Jews of Babylonia, Hanukah and the story of the victorious military struggle presented a problem. They feared their young people would be influenced by the model of the Makabees and become 'militant activist' opponents of authority. When the majority of Jews lived in the Land of Israel a revolt might succeed; but when the majority of Jews lived as small minorities throughout the Roman and Persian Empires a revolt would lead to catastrophe. It was not possible to eliminate Hanukkah; it had become firmly entrenched in the hearts and minds of the people. But the Hanukah miracle could be, 4-5 centuries later, enhanced and changed from one celebrating a miraculous military Jihad victory against overwhelming odds, into a miraculous spiritual Jihad story of faith and hope symbolized by a 'little jar of oil.' The jar of oil story is first told in the Babylonian Talmud (Shabbat 21b): 'Our rabbis taught: On the 25th day of Kislev begin the eight days of Hanukkah on which fasting is forbidden. When the (Syrian) Greeks entered the Temple, they defiled all the holy oil; and when the Makabees prevailed and defeated them, they searched and found only one jar of oil with the official seal of the High Priest, but it had only enough for one day's lighting; yet a miracle occurred, they lit the (always burning) lamp with it and it (burned) for eight days. The following year these days were decreed a festival.' The rededicated Jerusalem Temple was destroyed by the Romans 235 years later in the year 70 CE. Exactly 500 years later Prophet Muhammad was born and shortly after after his death Arab armies conquered Jerusalem. About 60-70 years afterwards the Muslim government minted coins in Jerusalem, and on these coins the seven branched Temple menorah appears in the center of one side, with the Shahada in Arabic stating 'There is no god but Allah.' The other side bears the inscription: 'Muhammed (is the) Messenger of God.' Thus the light of Abrahamic monotheism still shines. May these coins and Hanukah also bring Jews and Muslims closer together in our day. Then as Prophet Isaiah predicted (19:23-25): 'On that day there will be a highway from Egypt to Assyria. The Assyrians will go to Egypt and the Egyptians to Assyria. The Egyptians and Assyrians will worship together. On that day Israel will be the third, along with Egypt and Assyria, a blessing on the earth. The Lord Almighty will bless them, saying, 'Blessed be Egypt my people, Assyria my handiwork, and Israel my inheritance.'	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWeIFrlOO4j9vDFYJ05qC5UZ	2024-12-24T15:19:20-08:00	
China-India Border Détente: An Uneasy Peace In Asia – Analysis	In October 2024, after nearly four years of fraught diplomatic negotiations, India and China reached an agreement to disengage troops from key friction points along the line-of-actual control (LAC). The accord, focussing on the long-disputed areas of Depsang and Demchok in eastern Ladakh, is a rare breakthrough in an otherwise acrimonious relationship. It entails coordinated patrolling and the creation of temporary buffer zones aimed at preventing future clashes. For two nations locked in a cycle of mistrust and competition, the agreement offers a much-needed pause, but it does little to address the root causes of their enduring rivalry. The LAC, which serves as the de facto boundary between India and China, has been a source of contention since the 1962 Sino-Indian War. This latest détente comes after the most serious military confrontation in decades—the 2020 Galwan Valley clash, which left casualties on both sides for the first time in 45 years and fundamentally altered the trajectory of bilateral relations. Despite the recent de-escalation, the structural drivers of conflict remain unresolved, raising doubts about whether this agreement represents a turning point or is merely a lull before the next crisis. A History Marred by Conflict The Sino-Indian border dispute dates back to colonial-era boundary demarcations that both nations inherited at the time of their independence. The 1962 War left scars that continue to shape the perceptions of policymakers in New Delhi and Beijing. While numerous agreements in the late-20thCentury sought to maintain peace along the LAC, including the 1993 Border Peace and Tranquility Agreement and the 2005 Protocol on Modalities for the Implementation of Confidence-Building Measures, the lack of a clearly delineated border has perpetuated tensions. The situation deteriorated dramatically in 2020, when Chinese troops advanced into several areas claimed by India, including Pangong Tso and Galwan Valley. These incursions coincided with India's infrastructural build-up along the LAC, including roads, bridges and airstrips designed to improve military logistics in high-altitude terrain. The violent clash in Galwan marked a turning point, leading to the deployment of tens of thousands of troops and advanced weaponry on both sides of the border. Diplomatic talks since then have largely failed to yield substantive progress—until now. Motivations Behind the Accord Several factors appear to have influenced the October 2024 agreement. From Beijing's perspective, disengagement may be part of a broader strategy to manage its deteriorating geopolitical environment. China faces increasing pressure on multiple fronts, including an economic slowdown, tensions in the Taiwan Strait and strained relations with the United States and the European Union. A prolonged standoff with India risks diverting resources and attention from these critical challenges. For India, the agreement allows a temporary stabilization of its northern frontier, enabling policymakers to focus on broader strategic priorities, such as countering China's influence in the Indian Ocean Region (IOR) and strengthening ties with allies, such as the US, Japan and Australia through the Quad. The détente may also reflect domestic political calculations, as the Indian government under Prime Minister Narendra Modi had sought to demonstrate its ability to manage India's security challenges before the 2024 General Elections. The Economic & Strategic Angle The economic dimension of Sino-Indian relations adds another layer of complexity. Despite political tensions, bilateral trade between the two nations reached $135 billion in 2023, making China India's largest trading partner. India relies heavily on Chinese imports for critical industries, such as electronics, pharmaceuticals and renewable energy. At the same time, China sees India's growing economy as an attractive market, especially as Beijing grapples with slowing growth and increasing economic isolation due to its deteriorating relations with the West. However, economic interdependence has not translated into strategic trust. India's emphasis on reducing its reliance on Chinese imports through such initiatives as 'Aatmanirbhar Bharat' (Self-Reliant India) signals a long-term effort to decouple its economy from Beijing. Similarly, China's 'Belt and Road Initiative' (BRI), particularly its projects in South Asia, is viewed in New Delhi as an attempt to encircle India strategically. Persistent Risks Along the LAC While the October 2024 accord marks progress, it is unlikely to resolve the underlying tensions along the LAC. Both nations continue to station tens of thousands of troops in forward areas, supported by advanced surveillance systems, drones and missile platforms. The infrastructure race along the border shows no signs of slowing, with both sides constructing roads, airfields and fortified outposts to improve their strategic positions. This arms race creates a security dilemma, where defensive measures are perceived as offensive preparations by the other side, further fuelling mistrust. Additionally, the absence of robust confidence-building measures (CBMs) exacerbates the risks of unintended escalation. Many of the CBMs established in the 1990s and early-2000s, such as protocols for troop movements and mechanisms for resolving disputes, were disregarded during the 2020 crisis. Rebuilding these measures will require a level of trust and political will that is currently lacking. Role of Technology in Escalation The increasing reliance on advanced military technologies adds another layer of complexity to the Sino-Indian rivalry. Both nations have invested heavily in drones, standoff missiles and cyber capabilities, raising the stakes of any future conflict. For instance, the use of drones for reconnaissance missions along the LAC could be misinterpreted as preparation for an offensive, prompting a disproportionate response. The lack of clear protocols for the deployment of such technologies increases the risk of miscalculation and unintended escalation. Cyber security is another emerging domain of competition. Both nations have accused each other of cyber attacks targeting critical infrastructure, raising concerns about the potential for cyber warfare to exacerbate tensions. Developing mechanisms to manage these technological risks will be crucial for maintaining stability along the LAC. Maritime Conflict in Indian Ocean The Sino-Indian rivalry is not confined to the Himalayan heights; it extends into the maritime domain, where India holds a significant strategic advantage. The Indian Ocean is a critical artery for global trade, and India's geographical position gives it the ability to disrupt Chinese shipping during a conflict. Conversely, China's efforts to establish a naval presence in the Indian Ocean, including dual-use port facilities in Pakistan, Sri Lanka and Djibouti, are viewed by New Delhi as part of a broader strategy to encircle India. This maritime competition highlights the interconnectedness of the land and sea domains in Sino-Indian relations. A border crisis along the LAC could easily spill over into the Indian Ocean, with significant implications for regional and global stability. The Challenges and Opportunities Achieving a sustainable peace between India and China will require a multi-faceted approach. High-level political dialogue is essential to rebuild trust and establish mechanisms for managing disputes. Regular summits between Indian and Chinese leaders could provide a platform for addressing contentious issues and exploring avenues for cooperation. Revisiting CBMs is another critical step. Joint monitoring mechanisms for sensitive border areas, agreements on the non-deployment of certain weapon systems and protocols for managing the use of drones and cyber capabilities could reduce the risk of inadvertent clashes. Economic cooperation also offers a potential pathway for improving relations. Joint ventures in such sectors as renewable energy, technology and infrastructure could create mutual dependencies that discourage conflict. However, such initiatives will require a significant shift in both nations' strategic priorities. Uneasy Peace in Bilateral Relations The October 2024 agreement is a welcome development in an otherwise fraught relationship, but is far from a resolution. The structural drivers of conflict—territorial disputes, strategic competition and mutual distrust—remain firmly in place. Without sustained efforts to address these underlying issues, the Sino-Indian rivalry will continue to cast a long shadow over regional stability. As New Delhi has repeatedly emphasised, the state of the border will determine the overall state of bilateral relations. For now, the détente provides a necessary pause, but it does not eliminate the risk of future crises. The challenge for both nations is to transform this fragile peace into a durable framework for co-existence—an endeavour that will require vision, pragmatism and an unwavering commitment to dialogue.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWc2dholqQ-44xTLGxm2h2nz	2024-12-23T16:08:43-08:00	
Righty Tighty: A Simple Way Donald Trump Can End The Ukraine And ...	Upon his inauguration as president, Donald Trump will become the leader of a United States executive branch mired in two major wars via its continuing pumping of money, weapons, and intelligence into support of the Ukraine and Israel governments. Trump has declared his opposition to the continuation of these wars. But, how can he end them? The means by which Trump can end the wars is simpler than many Americans think. This means just does not come to mind for many Americans because it is far removed from the course US presidents have tended to pursue over the last few decades. Righty tighty. That’s it. Taking the US out of these wars is as simple as turning off a standard outdoor water faucet. President Joe Biden has turned the handle all the way lefty loosey. Trump should just turn it back all the way. Shut off the money flow. Shut off the weapons flow. Shut off the intelligence flow. And there is no good reason for Trump to take his time about it. He should turn off the flow of aid in all forms promptly in his presidency. Doing so would comport with Trump’s stated objectives regarding the Ukraine War and the Israel War during his campaign and since. Trump has repeated his promise to end the Ukraine War in a day. He has also commented on multiple occasions that he wants the Israel War over before he is even sworn in as president. Without US support, Ukraine and Israel lack the means to continue their wars. Deprived of the means to continue fighting in anywhere near the strength they have, both governments will immediately find themselves in a new situation where their best option is to seek peace. Without critical US support, the Ukraine government will negotiate what it will give up in its loss to Russia. Meanwhile, Israel, also deprived of critical US support, will have to pare its ambition in its multifront war. Their only other option is suicidal fighting on in a lost cause. Sober military members would probably put a stop to that. No matter, it was never the cause — lost or otherwise — of America anyway. What about negative political repercussions for Trump from his ending US participation in the wars? Such participation lacks popular support, so ending it would seem a plus for Trump’s popularity. Further, since Trump won the presidential election portraying himself as the 'peace candidate,' even people who dislike his extraction of the US from the wars would not be very convincing complaining of Trump acting inconsistently or hypocritically. Indeed, Trump could proclaim that his action is a promise kept. There is even a political urgency for Trump to turn the faucet handle righty tighty. If he continues supporting the wars for weeks or, worse, months or even years, the wars will become Trump wars as they have been Biden wars. Americans would feel relief when Trump after significant delay terminates US involvement, but any effort then to praise him as a man of peace will be met with justified skepticism. There would be blood on his hands. If President Trump quickly turns off the faucet for the Ukraine War, the defeat of Ukraine will be accelerated. Trump can portray such as the much-needed termination of Biden’s deadly folly, reminding Americans as Trump has over the past couple years that the entire conflict would have been avoided had Trump been president. Trump can also claim victory in stopping the killing of people — Ukrainian and Russian — something he has pointed to as his primary objective. In turning off the war support for the Israel government, Trump is in a different position as he has expressed his particularly strong support for this government. But, Trump, as with the Ukraine war, has also expressed his strong desire for the carnage in the Israel War to end. Trump, when shutting off the faucet, can declare victory for Israel. He can claim the defeat by Israel of Hamas in Gaza and Hezbollah in Lebanon. He can claim also Israel’s elimination of threat posed to it from Syria. The war is over and won can be his message. Trump will surely face difficult challenges as president, but on the major issues of the Ukraine War and Israel War, the solution is simple: righty tighty.

The ‘King-Makers’ Pull The Rug From Syria, Yet Again: A ‘Greek Tr...	James Jeffrey, former U.S. Ambassador to Iraq and Turkey, in a March 2021 interview with PBS Frontline, laid out very plainly the template for what has just happened in Syria this month: 'Syria, given its size, its strategic location, its historical importance, is the pivot point for whether [there can be] an American-managed security system in the region … And so you’ve got this general alliance that is locked in with us. But …the stress point is greatest in Syria'. Jeffrey explained (in the 2021 interview) why the U.S. shifted its to support to Jolani and Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS): 'We got Mike Pompeo to issue a waiver to allow us to give aid to HTS – I received and sent messages to HTS' -The messages coming back from HTS were: 'We [HTS] want to be your friend. We’re not terrorists. We’re just fighting Assad''. The PBS Frontline interviewer asks: The U.S. was 'supporting indirectly the armed opposition'? To which Jeffrey responds: 'It was important to us that HTS not disintegrate … our policy was … was to leave HTS alone … And the fact that we haven’t targeted [HTS] ever, the fact that we have never raised our voice to the Turks about their cohabitation with them — in fact, I used this example the last time I was talking to very senior Turks – when they started bitching about this relationship we [the U.S.] have with the SDF [in eastern Syria]'. 'I said to them, 'Look, Turkey has always maintained that you want us in northeast Syria, which they do. But you don’t understand. We can’t be in northeast Syria without the platform, because we only have hundreds of troops there'; … I said: 'It’s just like you in Idlib …'. 'We want you to be in Idlib, but you can’t be in Idlib without having a platform, and that platform is largely HTS. Now, unlike the SDF, HTS is a UN-designated official terrorist organisation. Have I ever, or has any American official ever, complained to you about what you’re doing there with HTS? No …'. David Miller, a British academic, has noted that in 2015, prominent Syrian Sunni Muslim scholar, Shaykh al-Yaqoubi (who is anti-Assad), was unconvinced by Jolani’s efforts to rebrand Al Qa’ida as Jabhat al-Nusra. Jolani, in his al-2013 Al-Jazeera interview twice confirmed his allegiance to al-Qa’ida, saying that he received orders from its leader, Dr Ayman [al-Zawahiri] … and those were to not target the West. He confirmed his own position as being that of hardline intolerance toward those who practiced a ‘heretical’ Islam. Miller comments: 'While ISIS put on suits; allowed Syria to be carved up by the U.S.; preach peace with the Zionist state; want free markets; and cut gas deals with their regional patrons – their ‘true-believers’… in the Sunni identitarian diaspora haven’t yet clocked that they’ve been sold out – as was always the plan'. 'In private, the planners of this war in NATO states laugh about sending young Salafi cannon fodder from around the world into a meat grinder. The $2000 salaries are a mere speck of sand compared to the gas and construction wealth that is expected to be returned to Turkish, Qatari, Israeli and American coffers. They killed Palestine for this, and they’ll spend the next 30 years justifying it, based on whatever line the very expensive PR firms hired by the NATO and Gulf states shill to them…The Syrian regime change operation is the rug pull of the century'. Of course, James Jeffrey’s account was nothing new. Between 1979 and 1992, the CIA spent billions of dollars funding, arming, and training Afghan Mujahideen militia (like Osama bin Laden) in an attempt to bleed the USSR dry by pulling it into a quagmire. It was from the ranks of the Mujahideen that al-Qa’eda emerged. 'And yet, by the 2010s, even as the U.S. was ostensibly at war with al-Qaeda in Iraq and Afghanistan – it was secretly working with it – in Syria on a plan to overthrow Assad. The CIA spent around $1 billion per year training and arming a wide network of rebel groups to this end. As Jake Sullivan, told Secretary of State Hillary Clinton in a leaked 2012 email, 'AQ [al-Qaeda] is on our side in Syria', as Alan Macleod observes in Consortium News. Turkish press accounts largely confirm this Jeffrey scenario was the current gameplan: Ömer Önhon, former senior Ambassador and Deputy Under-Secretary in charge of Middle East and Asia at the Turkish Ministry of Foreign Affairs, writesthat: 'the operation to overthrow Assad’s regime in Syria was meticulously planned for over a year, with coordinated involvement from Turkey, the United States, and several other nations. Through various statements it has become clear that Assad’s departure resulted from an intricate web of agreements between virtually all stakeholders. Whilst HTS is actively working to rebrand itself – this transformation remains to be proven.' This HTS story has a precedent: In the summer following Israel’s 2006 (unsuccessful) war on Hizbullah, Dick Cheney sat in his office loudly bemoaning Hizbullah’s continuing strength; and worse still, that it seemed to him that Iran had been the primary beneficiary from the U.S. 2003 Iraq war. Cheney’s guest – the then Saudi Intelligence Chief, Prince Bandar – vigorously concurred (as chronicled by John Hannah, who participated in the meeting) and, to general surprise, Prince Bandar proclaimed that Iran yet could be cut to size: Syria was the ‘weak’ link that could be collapsed via an Islamist insurgency. Cheney’s initial scepticism turned to elation as Bandar said that U.S. involvement might be unnecessary. He – Bandar – would orchestrate and manage the project: ‘Leave it to me’, he said. Bandar separately told John Hannah: 'The King knows that other than the collapse of the Islamic Republic itself, nothing would weaken Iran more than losing Syria'. Well … that first effort did not succeed. It led to bloody civil war, but ultimately President Assad’s government survived. So, Jeffrey was simply reiterating in 202 its sequel: the original Wahabbi-led ‘rug pull’ on Syria by the Gulf was simply to be reverse engineered into a HTS hit by a rebranded amalgam of various militia made up primarily of former fighters (many not Syrian) from al-Qaeda/al-Nusra and ISIS, directed – in this second iteration – by Turkish Intelligence and financed by Qatar. Syria thus has been disintegrated and pillaged in the name of ‘liberating’ Syrians from the threat of ISIS, which they – Washington – had installed in the first place, and which the U.S. then used to justify the north-east of Syria’s occupation by U.S. forces. In the same mode, the unspoken part of this plan is to make secular Syria – with its legal system taken from France – ‘Islamic’ ('we will implement Islamic law') to justify the Israeli attacks and land grabs, which are being presented as ‘defensive measures against jihadists’. Of course, it is correct that there is likely money to be made from these events. It was never proven, but seismic surveys before the first Syria war began in 2011, seemed to show that there may well be substrata deposits of oil or gas in Syria, beyond the relatively small fields in the north-east. And yes, re-construction will be a bonanza for Turkey’s languishing construction sector. Syria’s ailing military was no direct military threat to Israel per se. So you may wonder, why are they tearing the place apart? 'Israel’s goal here is to basically wreck Syria', Professor Mearsheimer opines. 'It’s not in large part because of Israel, by the way. I think the Americans and the Turks played a much more important role than Israel did – in wrecking Syria'. 'The country is wrecked and I don’t know anybody who thinks that the rebels who are now in control in Damascus are going to be able to restore order in that country … From Israel’s point of view, this is a perfectly fine situation', Mearsheimer adds. U.S. anti-Russia hawks also hoped that Russia might take the bait of a wrecked Syria to get enmired into a widening Middle East quagmire. All of which takes us directly back to Jeffrey’s statement: 'Syria, given its size, its strategic location, its historical importance, is the pivot point for whether [there can be] an American-managed security system in the region …'. Syria has been from the outset – from 1949 – ‘the balancer’ to Israel in the region. That is now over, leaving only Iran to balance the Israeli thrust to a ‘Greater Israel’. It is no surprise then that the Israelis are agitating for the Americans to join with them in another orgy of destruction – this time to be visited on Iran. Did Russia have foreknowledge of what was afoot in Idlib, and the orchestration of a transition of power? Of course! The very effective Russian services must have known, as this Syria project has been ongoing since the mid 1970s (through the Hudson Institute and Senator Scoop Jackson). Assad had been signalling over the last four years, his desperate plan with Saudi, UAE and Egypt to a move towards a more pro-Israeli/pro-Western stance, in the hope of normalising with Washington and thereby gaining some sanctions relief. Assad’s ploy failed – and Syria likely will emerge as ‘Greek tragedy’ whereby tragedy evolves as actors play out their own natures. Quiescent ethnic and sectarian tensions likely will re-kindle; wildfires will catch. The lid is off. And Russia was never going to take the bait of plunging in. The U.S.-Israeli alliance has long wanted Syria. And now, they have got it. Any concomitant mayhem is down to them. Yes, the U.S. – in theory – may applaud itself for achieving more of 'an American managed security [and energy dominant flow] system'. But the U.S. ruling strata, however, were never going to let Europe be energy independent. The U.S. needs West Asia’s energy assets for itself – to collateralise its debt-overload. European states are left to tumble, as the fiscal crunch bites and European growth tails away. Others may see a collateral scenario – that a conflicted and possibly re-radicalised Middle East will inflict further strain onto the already ‘livid’ domestic social tensions in Europe. Israel nonetheless is relishing its ‘win’. Winning what? Former IDF Chief of Staff and Defence Minister ‘Bogie’ Ya’alon puts it this way: 'The current Israeli government’s path is to conquer, annex, commit ethnic cleansing … and to establish Jewish settlements. Polls show some 70% of Israelis, sometimes more, support this – AND for Israel to be a liberal democracy'. 'This [contradictory] path will lead us to destruction', he concludes. What other can be the final end to this Zionist project? There are more than seven million Palestinians between the ‘River and the Sea’. Are they all to vanish from the map?	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfPpWQ_RNuejtrToPrwuvDQ	2024-12-23T08:57:35-08:00	
What If The Baby Jesus Had Been Born Into The American Police Sta...	The Christmas story of a baby born in a manger is a familiar one. The Roman Empire, a police state in its own right, had ordered that a census be conducted. Joseph and his pregnant wife Mary traveled to the little town of Bethlehem so that they could be counted. There being no room for the couple at any of the inns, they stayed in a stable (a barn), where Mary gave birth to a baby boy, Jesus. Warned that the government planned to kill the baby, Jesus’ family fled with him to Egypt until it was safe to return to their native land. Yet what if Jesus had been born 2,000 years later? What if, instead of being born into the Roman police state, Jesus had been born at this moment in time? What kind of reception would Jesus and his family be given? Would we recognize the Christ child’s humanity, let alone his divinity? Would we treat him any differently than he was treated by the Roman Empire? If his family were forced to flee violence in their native country and sought refuge and asylum within our borders, what sanctuary would we offer them? A singular number of churches across the country have asked those very questions in recent years, and their conclusions were depicted with unnerving accuracy by nativity scenes in which Jesus and his family are separated, segregated and caged in individual chain-link pens, topped by barbed wire fencing. Those nativity scenes were a pointed attempt to remind the modern world that the narrative about the birth of Jesus is one that speaks on multiple fronts to a world that has allowed the life, teachings and crucifixion of Jesus to be drowned out by partisan politics, secularism, materialism and war, all driven by a manipulative shadow government called the Deep State. The modern-day church has largely shied away from applying Jesus’ teachings to modern problems such as war, poverty, immigration, etc., but thankfully there have been individuals throughout history who ask themselves and the world: what would Jesus do? What would Jesus—the baby born in Bethlehem who grew into an itinerant preacher and revolutionary activist, who not only died challenging the police state of his day (namely, the Roman Empire) but spent his adult life speaking truth to power, challenging the status quo of his day, and pushing back against the abuses of the Roman Empire—do about the injustices of our modern age? Dietrich Bonhoeffer asked himself what Jesus would have done about the horrors perpetrated by Hitler and his assassins. The answer: Bonhoeffer was executed by Hitler for attempting to undermine the tyranny at the heart of Nazi Germany. Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn asked himself what Jesus would have done about the soul-destroying gulags and labor camps of the Soviet Union. The answer: Solzhenitsyn found his voice and used it to speak out about government oppression and brutality. Martin Luther King Jr. asked himself what Jesus would have done about America’s warmongering. The answer: declaring 'my conscience leaves me no other choice,' King risked widespread condemnation as well as his life when he publicly opposed the Vietnam War on moral and economic grounds. Even now, despite the popularity of the phrase 'What Would Jesus Do?' (WWJD) in Christian circles, there remains a disconnect in the modern church between the teachings of Christ and the suffering of what Jesus in Matthew 25 refers to as the 'least of these.' Yet this is not a theological gray area: Jesus was unequivocal about his views on many things, not the least of which was charity, compassion, war, tyranny and love. After all, Jesus—the revered preacher, teacher, radical and prophet—was born into a police state not unlike the growing menace of the American police state. When he grew up, he had powerful, profound things to say, things that would change how we view people, alter government policies and change the world. 'Blessed are the merciful,' 'Blessed are the peacemakers,' and 'Love your enemies' are just a few examples of his most profound and revolutionary teachings. When confronted by those in authority, Jesus did not shy away from speaking truth to power. Indeed, his teachings undermined the political and religious establishment of his day. It cost him his life. He was eventually crucified as a warning to others not to challenge the powers-that-be. Can you imagine what Jesus’ life would have been like if, instead of being born into the Roman police state, he had been born and raised in the American police state? Consider the following if you will. Had Jesus been born in the era of the America police state, rather than traveling to Bethlehem for a census, Jesus’ parents would have been mailed a 28-page American Community Survey, a mandatory government questionnaire documenting their habits, household inhabitants, work schedule, how many toilets are in your home, etc. The penalty for not responding to this invasive survey can go as high as $5,000. Instead of being born in a manger, Jesus might have been born at home. Rather than wise men and shepherds bringing gifts, however, the baby’s parents might have been forced to ward off visits from state social workers intent on prosecuting them for the home birth. One couple in Washington had all three of their children removed after social services objected to the two youngest being birthed in an unassisted home delivery. Had Jesus been born in a hospital, his blood and DNA would have been taken without his parents’ knowledge or consent and entered into a government biobank. While most states require newborn screening, a growing number are holding onto that genetic material long-term for research, analysis and purposes yet to be disclosed. Then again, had Jesus’ parents been undocumented immigrants, they and the newborn baby might have been shuffled to a profit-driven, private prison for illegals where they first would have been separated from each other, the children detained in make-shift cages, and the parents eventually turned into cheap, forced laborers for corporations such as Starbucks, Microsoft, Walmart, and Victoria’s Secret. There’s quite a lot of money to be made from imprisoning immigrants, especially when taxpayers are footing the bill. From the time he was old enough to attend school, Jesus would have been drilled in lessons of compliance and obedience to government authorities, while learning little about his own rights. Had he been daring enough to speak out against injustice while still in school, he might have found himself tasered or beaten by a school resource officer, or at the very least suspended under a school zero tolerance policy that punishes minor infractions as harshly as more serious offenses. Had Jesus disappeared for a few hours let alone days as a 12-year-old, his parents would have been handcuffed, arrested and jailed for parental negligence. Parents across the country have been arrested for far less 'offenses' such as allowing their children to walk to the park unaccompanied and play in their front yard alone. Rather than disappearing from the history books from his early teenaged years to adulthood, Jesus’ movements and personal data—including his biometrics—would have been documented, tracked, monitored and filed by governmental agencies and corporations such as Google and Microsoft. Incredibly, 95 percent of school districts share their student records with outside companies that are contracted to manage data, which they then use to market products to us. From the moment Jesus made contact with an 'extremist' such as John the Baptist, he would have been flagged for surveillance because of his association with a prominent activist, peaceful or otherwise. Since 9/11, the FBI has actively carried out surveillance and intelligence-gathering operations on a broad range of activist groups, from animal rights groups to poverty relief, anti-war groups and other such 'extremist' organizations. Jesus’ anti-government views would certainly have resulted in him being labeled a domestic extremist. Law enforcement agencies are being trained to recognize signs of anti-government extremism during interactions with potential extremists who share a 'belief in the approaching collapse of government and the economy.' While traveling from community to community, Jesus might have been reported to government officials as 'suspicious' under the Department of Homeland Security’s 'See Something, Say Something' programs. Many states, including New York, are providing individuals with phone apps that allow them to take photos of suspicious activity and report them to their state Intelligence Center, where they are reviewed and forwarded to law-enforcement agencies. Rather than being permitted to live as an itinerant preacher, Jesus might have found himself threatened with arrest for daring to live off the grid or sleeping outside. In fact, the number of cities that have resorted to criminalizing homelessness by enacting bans on camping, sleeping in vehicles, loitering and begging in public has doubled. Viewed by the government as a dissident and a potential threat to its power, Jesus might have had government spies planted among his followers to monitor his activities, report on his movements, and entrap him into breaking the law. Such Judases today—called informants—often receive hefty paychecks from the government for their treachery. Had Jesus used the internet to spread his radical message of peace and love, he might have found his blog posts infiltrated by government spies attempting to undermine his integrity, discredit him or plant incriminating information online about him. At the very least, he would have had his website hacked and his email monitored. Had Jesus attempted to feed large crowds of people, he would have been threatened with arrest for violating various ordinances prohibiting the distribution of food without a permit. Florida officials arrested a 90-year-old man for feeding the homeless on a public beach. Had Jesus spoken publicly about his 40 days in the desert and his conversations with the devil, he might have been labeled mentally ill and detained in a psych ward against his will for a mandatory involuntary psychiatric hold with no access to family or friends. One Virginia man was arrested, strip searched, handcuffed to a table, diagnosed as having 'mental health issues,' and locked up for five days in a mental health facility against his will apparently because of his slurred speech and unsteady gait. Without a doubt, had Jesus attempted to overturn tables in a Jewish temple and rage against the materialism of religious institutions, he would have been charged with a hate crime. More than 45 states and the federal government have hate crime laws on the books. Had anyone reported Jesus to the police as being potentially dangerous, he might have found himself confronted—and killed—by police officers for whom any perceived act of non-compliance (a twitch, a question, a frown) can result in them shooting first and asking questions later. Rather than having armed guards capture Jesus in a public place, government officials would have ordered that a SWAT team carry out a raid on Jesus and his followers, complete with flash-bang grenades and military equipment. There are upwards of 80,000 such SWAT team raids carried out every year, many on unsuspecting Americans who have no defense against such government invaders, even when such raids are done in error. Instead of being detained by Roman guards, Jesus might have been made to 'disappear' into a secret government detention center where he would have been interrogated, tortured and subjected to all manner of abuses. Chicago police have 'disappeared' more than 7,000 people into a secret, off-the-books interrogation warehouse at Homan Square. Charged with treason and labeled a domestic terrorist, Jesus might have been sentenced to a life-term in a private prison where he would have been forced to provide slave labor for corporations or put to death by way of the electric chair or a lethal mixture of drugs. Indeed, as I make clear in my book Battlefield America: The War on the American People and in its fictional counterpart The Erik Blair Diaries, given the nature of government then and now, it is painfully evident that whether Jesus had been born in our modern age or his own, he still would have died at the hands of a police state. Thus, as we draw near to Christmas with its celebration of miracles and promise of salvation, we would do well to remember that what happened in that manger on that starry night in Bethlehem is only the beginning of the story. That baby born in a police state grew up to be a man who did not turn away from the evils of his age but rather spoke out against it. We must do no less.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfPpWQ_RNuejquoJLcaSLm0	2024-12-23T08:54:35-08:00	
The Horn Of Africa States: The Emerging Somalia Foreign Policy – ...	Somalia is a founding member of the African Union (the 'AU'), Intergovernmental Authority on Development ('IGAD'), and the Organization of Islamic Council (the 'OIC'). It is also a member of many other international organizations including among others the United Nations Organization (the 'UN'), the Arab League, the African Development Bank, the International Civil Aviation Organization ('ICAO'), International Finance Corporation (the 'IFC'), World Federation of Trade Unions (WFTO), International Bank for Reconstruction and Development ('IBRD'), World Meteorological Organization ('WMO'), Regional Center for Renewable Energy and Energy Efficiency (RCREEE), and many others. The country is currently constituted as a federal republic consisting of federal member states, with a population exceeding some thirty-two million people and growing, although some fake statistics are given putting the population at some 19 to 20 million people. North Somalia which represents ex-British Somaliland, proclaims independence from the rest of Somalia but no country has recognized it so far. North Somalia or Somaliland breaks down into three distinct sub-regions which may result, in due course, in three federal member states. These possible states will consist of the Golis State in the center, the Awdal State on the west and the Solsanaag State on the east. The other federal member states of the country include Puntland State, Galmudug State, Southwest State, Hirshabelle State and Jubaland State. The eight states will be crowned by the Banadir Capital region as the sixth state to complete the nine administrative states of the country in the future. This is expected to end up reducing the eighteen original regions of the country into nine new states which is expected to ease the administration of the country under elected gubernatorial administrations. The country’s constitution remains provisional, although the current administration appears to be working on changing it, without consulting the people and the many regions, existing or potential, of the country. The amendments under process are not expected to be accepted and will no doubt change and be amended when the constitution is finally completed. A new political class, which appears to prefer personal agendas rather than a national agenda, currently manages the country and they are expected to be funneled out in the coming few years. The terror groups who have settled in the country and filled a major vacuum of a normal governance infrastructure will also be removed as the internationally approved governance infrastructure and new nationalist political class emerges from the silent majority. Somalia is geostrategically located with the longest coast in mainland Africa (some 3,333 km long) and borders Ethiopia to the west, Kenya to the southwest, the Indian ocean to the east, the Gulf of Aden to the north and Djibouti to the northwest. The people of Somalia speak Somali but the official languages of the country are Somali and Arabic. It is the only non-Arabic speaking country in the Arabic League, a clear and manifest demonstration of Somalia’s successful foreign diplomacy of the past, although many Somalis still question the rationale behind it. Its diplomacy has also put it recently as a member of the East African Community, another region with which Somalis share little. The EAC is the Swahili speaking belt of Africa. According to the Foreign Ministry of Somalia, the foreign policy is designed to 'to protect and promote the nation’s interests and values. In a wider context, these interests and values include peace, unity and prosperity throughout the world.' It is a product of long struggles involving the liberation from colonialism, creation of the country through the merger of two different colonial administrations and forging a new Somali-rooted nation, and the long civil war and conflicts, many engineered from outside the country to serve foreign interests, from which the country is slowly recovering. Somalia of the civil war and even currently is marked by a partisan media, which adds to the woes of the country. Many regurgitate often fake news, which others have already reported but color it with their own political and ethnic biases. A more solid and national media is slowly emerging and this is expected to play a part in the nation-building process. Somalia, despite being in the front pages all the time, remains a mysterious country and many of the world’s nations appear to have exhausted understanding the country and the behavior of its people, who seem to be all brothers and sisters and live together but also fight with each other as mortal enemies, switching sides with ease and without remorse. The international community or those interested in the Somali country, which basically is the Somali Peninsula or the Horn of Africa itself, including Djibouti, the eastern part of Ethiopia and northeastern Kenya, have surface understanding of the history of the region and look at it with the prism of the arrival of Islam in the region only. They fail to see that it is much older and that its roots and culture, including its traditional laws, date back to pre-history. Its traditional legal systems, which all Somalis respect, have no foreign words or terminologies. It is this background which determines how a Somali thinks and acts with others and hence is the basis of its foreign policy. A close look at the formation of Somaliland in north Somalia through a normal Somali process without foreign intervention evidences it. It was processed through a serious of internal Somali meetings, which culminated in the long almost six-month Borama Conference, resulting in the formation of the solid Somaliland administration, which has made it shine, out of all the other attempts organized and financed by the so-called international community, but which only represents the countries that have interest in the country and region. Those who discuss Somalia in international forums fail to see that unlike many other countries of the African continent, Somalia is a country which was formed by Somalis, despite being colonized by Europeans for circa eighty years. On departure from the region by Europeans, basically the British and the Italians, Somalia formed itself through the merger of the two regions vacated by these two European countries to form current Somalia. Its foreign policy, therefore, remains Somali sensitive and is only determined by its ability both in terms of economic and hence financial strength and its military prowess. At present, it is a weak country financially and militarily, and many of the neighboring countries and others from further afield seem to be feasting on this weakness. However, one forgets that Somali’s strength is its people and not its assets only. It is how it has survived from pre-pharaonic times to the present. Foreign policy is one of the main components of a national policy. It is how a nation communicates with other nations of the world. Somalia’s foreign policy, for a long while now, was almost dormant as its internal composition remained weak and disturbed. As it recovers, Somalia’s foreign policy is rearing its head again to choose its place in the international table of nations. The recent activities of its foreign policy, including its coming membership of the non-permanent members of the UN Security Council, evidences once again the re-awakening foreign policy of the country. Somalia is still recovering from a long civil war which devasted not only the country’s emerging economy but also its governance infrastructure. Its relations with other countries of the world dropped from a popular nation-state to almost warring warlord fiefdoms but it has over the years and with the helping hand of some countries, it is emerging once again as a country. Its geostrategic location helps it in the process. The world currently seems to be relationally based on financial and economic interests and Should it strike its oil and gas potential, Somalia is expected to gain some foothold in the world’s major forums and tables in the not-too-distant future. Somalia owns vast untapped oil and gas reserves both onshore and offshore. This makes it, along with its major geostrategic location, a future competitor in the energy sector and especially with the traditional dominant forces in that sector, such as the Arab Gulf region. No wonder so much energy and finances are being spent on disrupting Somalia ever emerging as such, especially by some countries of the Gulf, who are using Ethiopia and Kenya, which they consider the traditional archenemies of the country. They fail to see that both countries have large Somali territories within, and populations, which are part of the governing systems of those countries. Despite the many spiking strips thrown in front of Somalia’s reemergence as a normal functioning country, its foreign policy remains guided by 'Promotion of national, regional and international peace and security, promotion of commercial and economic activities for sustainable development, effective participation in multilateral diplomacy and implementation of obligations regarding international treaties and conventions.'	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfPpWQ_RNuejsA8jRYXoEsq	2024-12-23T08:48:32-08:00	
EV Wars: Japan Is Now In – OpEd	If there are no trade barriers established, they [Chinese EV manufacturers] will pretty much demolish most other car companies in the world. They're extremely good.' -- Elon Musk, CEO of Tesla Motors Another key page is being written in the battle over car and related vehicular manufacturing. The importance of automotive manufacturing in the world industrial system cannot be underestimated. Car manufacturing in the United States, United Kingdom, some European Union countries, Japan and South Korea have contributed substantially to the economic growth and prosperity of these countries. In addition to the tens of millions directly employed, a larger number work in the supply chain and related services. The industry is an important component of the taxable base of countries as well as a key indicator of the standard of living of the citizenry. Ever since its origin, the industry has been dominated by the use of internal combustion engines (ICEs). However, in an unanticipated and extraordinarily rapid development which has caught nations monopolizing ICE vehicle production with their pants down, electric vehicles (EV) have transformed the automotive industry. Since their early market introduction after 2010, the growth of the EV component of the car industry has been spectacular. Today, EV sales are growing even more rapidly. They are now expected to overtake ICE sales sooner than expected for several reasons. Advantages of EVs over ICEs Firstly the price gap between EVs and ICEs has closed and is at parity in some markets already. Secondly, car manufacturers are now compelled by the latest fuel efficiency standards to offer more fuel-efficient vehicles of which EVs have a tremendous advantage. It is estimated that EVs convert up to 91% of energy into power, while ICEs only convert about 12% to 30%. Perhaps the most important factor for car buyers is the lower total cost of EV ownership with the savings from lower fuel and maintenance costs outweighing any higher upfront cost. Today, we are witnessing a scramble amongst previously dominant ICE manufacturing countries to adjust to this. This adjustment development has become one of the most important battlefields in geopolitics. It is taking place simply because the world's leader in EVs is China. Over the past decade, China has become the world's largest EV market, commanding half of the global sales of electric passenger cars and over 90% of the sales of electric buses and trucks. What's unacceptable to the West and other major ICE manufacturing countries is that China produces two thirds of the world’s EVs, accounts for just as much of global sales and is also the world's leader in EV batteries which make up a significant component of EV cost. The marketability of Chinese EVs is further reinforced by their innovations in software, design and increasingly, in overall quality. Perhaps the most telling and worrying statistical evidence of the prominence of China in the global automotive industry - worrying, that is, for anti China politicians and policy makers in Japan, the West and its allies - is China's displacement of Japan as the world's leading car exporter. In 2023, Japan exported 4.42 million vehicles according to data released by the Japan Automobile Manufacturers Association.This compared with the 4.91 million vehicles shipped from China, according to the China Association of Automobile Manufacturers (CAAM). Regional Battlefield Strategies The offensive to take down this Chinese ‘threat’ in fact began several years ago. Today it has morphed into a no holds barred politics plus economics plus media propaganda war to ensure that the dominance of ICEs in the world's automotive industry remains intact; and China's EVs, whatever their advantages and clear superiority over fossil based ICEs on their environmental impact, are pulled down. What we are seeing is the emergence of three distinct regional strategies - all showing the inseparability of politics and economics. The first adopted initially by the US saw the Biden administration attempt to slow down the rate of change by US based auto manufacturers by lowering pollutant standards.This was followed by the ramping up of tariffs on China EVs and batteries despite the knowledge that it would slow down the nation’s clean air and zero emissions targets. Trump's election will see a further use of the high tariff wall strategy on Chinese EV and other exports to the US. In Europe, the policy strategy, while claiming to want to avoid a trade war with China, has followed a similar high tariff wall approach although this has been complicated by the highly profitable position that European car manufacturers such as Mercedes Benz, BMW, Porsche and Audi have enjoyed in China for over 20 years, and are still reliant on to stay afloat and support their bottom line. The EUs tariffs are currently on hold as European ICE manufacturers negotiate with their own governments not to follow the US example. They are reminding that an anti China EV policy is a zero sum game that will hurt Europe more than China. The last of the regional players to emerge is Japan where according to Carlos Ghosn, the ex-chairman of Nissan, the two giants of the car industry - Honda and Nissan - recently announced consolidation, and possibly merger, plans to meet the challenges of a transformed automotive industry at the behest of the country’s powerful Ministry of International Trade The discussion, while not specifying China, clearly aims at bringing together the formidable technological expertise and financial resources of the two companies, to survive the turbulence generated by China's EV progress.v What the regional and global battles will mean for car buyers in Asia outside China is not fully clear yet in view of the historic and current dominance of legacy car manufacturers in this part of the world. But if this battle results in cheaper, cleaner, higher quality, and less costly to maintain vehicles, then many, possibly most consumers, in Asia and other parts of the world, regardless of politics, will welcome it	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfPpWQ_RNuejvOu8ib1xK-I	2024-12-23T08:45:28-08:00	
Vietnam GDP To Be Top 12th Asian Economy With $506 Billion In 202...	Việtnam will be among the top 15 economies in Asia, with projected economic output reaching some US$506 billion in 2025, the statistical visualisation platform Seasia Stats reported. According to the Vietnam News newspaper, Seasia Stats highlighted Việtnam’s rapid development driven by explosive manufacturing growth and foreign investment. While China remains the continent's largest economy, followed by Japan and India, Việtnam has distinguished itself as a rising economic force in Southeast Asia. The country, positioned 12th in the regional ranking, is projected to achieve 7 percent economic growth in 2024, a remarkable rate that makes it among the fastest-growing economies in the region and the world. Indonesia, according to Vietnam News, leads the Southeast Asian region with an anticipated economic size of $1.5 trillion in 2025, buoyed by rich natural resources and a rapidly expanding middle class. Singapore, at the ninth place, has been renowned for its financial services sector and strategic geographical position. The country’s economic output is projected in 2025 Thailand and the Philippines came next, with projected economic sizes of $545 billion and $508 billion, respectively. These nations benefit from diverse economic drivers, including tourism, manufacturing and a dynamic young workforce. Other regional peers in the top 15, standing behind Việtnam, are Malaysia, Bangladesh and Iran. According to the VnExpress newspaper, Vietnam's imports and exports totaled US$745 billion, up 15.3 percent from a year earlier, according to the General Department of Vietnam Customs. As of Dec. 14, exports amounted to $384 billion, a nearly 14.5 percent year-on-year increase, while imports rose by 16.3 percent to nearly $361 billion. Agri-products like durian, fruits, vegetabls, shrimp and coffee have contributed to exports with high prices. China is the largest importer of agri-products from Vietnam. Manufacturing has also contributed a lot to Vietnam’s exports. Vietnam has achieved remarkable trade performance in 2024, recording a 16 percent year-on-year increase in trade turnover for the first 10 months, reaching $647.87 billion, according to the General Department of Customs. Export activities contributed nearly $335.59 billion, rising 15 percent, while imports surged by 17 percent to reach $312.28 billion. In October alone, import-export revenue climbed to $69.19 billion, a 5 percent increase year-on-year, demonstrating sustained momentum. The Ministry of Industry and Trade (MoIT) plays an active role in expanding market access for Vietnamese products and supporting businesses in navigating international trade. MoIT’s efforts in facilitating border trade include implementing promotion programs and alerting businesses to potential trade defense cases. This proactive approach has shielded Vietnamese goods from unnecessary export risks. Trade surplus stood at $23.4 billion, down from $25.71 billion during the same period last year. Le Nhu Quynh, director of the Import-Export Tax Department, reported that by Dec. 10, state revenue from import-export activities reached VND397.86 trillion ($15.6 billion), surpassing the annual target by 6.1 percent and up 13.8 percent from the same period last year. The figure is expected to hit VND420 trillion for the year, equal to 112 percent of the target and a 13.9 percent increase from 2023. Import-export turnover and taxable trade values saw respective increases of 15.4 percent and 15.3 percent. A notable rise in imports of high-revenue goods significantly boosted overall tax collection. For 2025, the National Assembly has set a state budget revenue target of VND411 trillion, based on projected GDP growth of 6.5–7 percent and crude oil prices of $75-80 per barrel. According to the Vietnam News newspaper, Prime Minister Phạm Minh Chính has issued Official Dispatch No 137/CĐ-TTg to achieve a gross domestic product (GDP) expansion rate of 8 percent or higher. Stressing that 2025 is a milestone year for Việtnam to embark on a new era of development – the era of the nation’s rise, the PM asked for drastic efforts by relevant ministries, agencies, provinces and cities to promote socio-economic development. The focus will be on strengthening economic growth in line with stabilising the macroeconomy, controlling inflation, ensuring major balances to achieve a GDP growth rate of more than 8 percent in 2025, higher than the National Assembly’s target at 6.5-7 percent. Specifically, Hà Nội and Ho Chi Minh City must strive to achieve a growth rate of around 8-10 percent. The PM also asked for efforts to renew traditional growth drivers, including investment, consumption and exports. With regard to investment, the PM asked the disbursement and efficient of public investment to be increased. The Minister of Planning and Investment will be in charge to develop mechanism to attract foreign investment, focusing on large-scale and high – technology projects. A sandbox for circular economy will be submitted to the Government in the first quarter of next year. Việtnam will also issue green taxonomy to promote green transition. Another important focus is to strengthen the development of the strategic infrastructure system including high-speed railway, urban railway in Hà Nội and Ho Chi Minh City, railways connected with China and Long Thành International Airport. Efforts are also needed to speed up the resumption of nuclear power plants, the construction of international financial centres in Ho Chi Minh City and Đà Nẵng and the foundation of free trade zones in several localities. Vietnam’s economy is booming with foreign investments, high economic growth, tourism, manufacturing, increase in prices of agri-products.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfPpWQ_RNuejuBAvog9GEFm	2024-12-23T07:44:50-08:00	
Generation Hope: Kashmir’s Youth Forging Paths To Peace Amidst Ch...	Viewing Kashmiri society through the lens of peace and conflict studies, it can be argued that conflict management though has been an ongoing process for an extended period now; the region is currently in a state of stable transition, characterized by neither active/intense conflict nor a complete stability. This ‘stable transition’ environment presents unique challenges to all stake holders, particularly for youth grappling with a plethora of unseen struggles and some major visible challenges. On one hand they are struggling with their own psychologies, mental health concerns and drug addiction while on the other they face hurdles in their pursuit of careers and livelihoods amidst the high unemployment scenario. Kashmiri Youth forging paths to Positive Peace Amid Kashmir’s transitioning from active gun violence to a phase of apparent normalcy (deceptive peace and uncertain calm), these young individuals yearn for a meaningful conflict transformation and their functional engagement that embodies the ideals of positive peace. Youth in Kashmir represent a generation caught in limbo that is striving to navigate the complexities of social, psychological, cultural, and political and identity crises. The profound struggles faced by Kashmiri youth, who are caught in a state of uncertainty due to the region’s prolonged uncertainty. They got deeply affected by the turmoil that has plagued the region for decades. Their unresolved issues led to their alienation and to a pervasive sense of instability, leaving many of them without clear prospects for the future. Socially and economically, Kashmiri youth faced stereotyping and labelling and joblessness. Psychological impacts, including anxiety, trauma, and depression, are widespread due to experiences of violence, loss, and displacement. Cultural identity is also a source of tension, as youth grapple with competing narratives. Politically, many Kashmiri youth felt marginalized with little voice in the decisions that affected their lives. This state of uncertainty and the complex web of challenges they face contribute to a sense of hopelessness, making it difficult for them to envision a future beyond Kashmir while some of them opted for jobs in the gulf countries. The prevalence of contractual positions within higher education institutions underscores the pervasive underemployment of highly educated young individuals. This entrenched culture of adhocism and contractualism perpetuates an atmosphere of job insecurity among youth, culminating in a crisis of confidence. Alarmingly, even doctoral degree holders, disillusioned by the scarcity of stable employment opportunities, are compelled to resort to menial occupations, such as vending dry fruits or juices on the streets, highlighting the stark disparity between their academic credentials and professional realities. Their struggles represent a generation profoundly shaped by crisis. Their resilience, potential and aspirations need to be addressed and the problem of Kashmir’s youth bulge is crucial for fostering a sustainable peace, as they seek to redefine their futures in a landscape still marked by the shadows of past violence, suffering and uncertainty. Kashmir’s youth bulge must be the prime focus of region’s long term planning and policy making and without reaching out to them and addressing their disillusionment and sense of uncertainty, achieving the goals of Viksit Bharat 2047 will be a difficult task. Are Kashmiri Youth a Homogeneous Group? A significant proportion of Jammu and Kashmir's population resides in the Kashmir Valley, with a substantial portion of this population being young, particularly those under the age of 35. The term ‘Kashmiri youth’ generally refers to young people living in Kashmir Valley however, it is important to note that this category of youth is not a monolith. Because Kashmiri youth come from diverse ethnic and religious backgrounds, including Koshur (Kashmiri origin), Gujjar, Bakerwal, Sikh, Pashto, Kohistani, Dard, Pahadi, Sippi, Baltis, Shina, and other smaller linguistic and ethnic groups, as well as Tibetan Muslims (often called refugees) who have been living in Srinagar since their exodus from Lhasa during the Chinese Communist oppression followed by a failed uprising against Chinese rule by Tibetans in 1959. The Kashmiri youth as a category is further differentiated by religious identities, encompassing Muslim, Hindu (Pandit), Sikh, and even a small Christian community (about 700) in Srinagar. Sociologically, it is noteworthy that discussions about Kashmiri youth often overlook female youth, which is a grave oversight. Consequently, the diverse identities within these demographics face unique challenges based on their local contexts and local issues and their exposure to modernity through new technologies, peer pressure, moral policing, community control, and economic pressures. Growing up in the Shadows of Conflict: Scars of Suffering and Resilience The prolonged conflict situation profoundly shaped the social and psychological landscape of youth in Kashmir. Their constant exposure to violence, militarization, uncertainty and instability fostered significant mental health challenges, including anxiety, depression, and PTSD besides affecting their educational and career prospects. The prolonged suffering hindered their personal development and community engagement. However, amidst this adversity, many young individuals demonstrated remarkable resilience, finding ways to cope and assert their identities. Youth kept looking for community support networks, did grassroots activism and worked for cultural expressions that could serve as vital outlets for healing and empowerment. This duality—struggling with trauma while fostering resilience—highlights the complex interplay between conflict and the agency of Kashmiri youth in navigating their lived realities. The decades of the turmoil shaped a plethora of social conflicts and a system collapse besides trauma, torture, labelling, security concerns and lastly a huge conflict fatigue that led to alienation of youth. Youth faced it to their worst and paid a huge cost of it in terms of the detrimental impact on their education, career and job prospects, financial progress and most importantly health and mental health aspects. Also stereotyping of Kashmiri youth and its associated stigma further exacerbated feelings of vulnerability in terms of isolation, marginalization and biases (exclusion) against them when studying or working outside Kashmir, leading to a cycle of mistrust and fear within them (a situation of Us versus them). They faced hardships due to security concerns and weakened community support systems, while conflict fatigue left them with a feeling of worthlessness thereby reducing their active engagement in peace building efforts. Such an ecosystem also got shaped due to lack of activism or any campus politics since there were hardly any student unions or elections in educational campuses that left youth choked and socially suffocated since there was hardly any scope for politics. The atmosphere of active politics and fearless political participation has now gained momentum in Kashmir and youth have significantly and positively responded to this change which can be seen by their overwhelming participation in the recently held assembly elections in Jammu and Kashmir and reflects their yearning for change and peaceful life. Kashmir’s Young Voices for Harmony and Peace While a lot has changed in Kashmir valley, youth today are utilizing their agency to promote peace and harmony. They are fostering inter-community dialogue, conflict resolution, and justice at their levels. Youth are also playing a vital role in community service like digital crowd funding appeals for poor and medically ill poor patients; they are also playing an active role in cleanup drives to healthcare awareness and education on social media platforms. Kashmiri youth want to rebuild a sense of community ethos to recreate the social and cultural harmony of the past. Youth artists, too, are contributing to the peace process, using craft,music, poetry, and visual arts to advocate for social justice, raise awareness about the human cost of conflict, and express their unique identity. Digital activism has also gained momentum, with youth leveraging social media platforms to challenge stereotypes and promote understanding about the society in Kashmir. Kashmiri youth want to achieve peace at all costs and their efforts are a testament to their resilience and determination. In spite of the challenges they face, they are building a future rooted in positive peace, normalcy, and mutual respect. Pressing Issues of Youth in Kashmir Today Amidst rising unemployment and diminishing opportunities, many youths face a mental health crisis, with issues such as drug addiction becoming increasingly prevalent. This mounting challenge reflects not only personal struggles but also a broader societal malaise. The emerging youth voices in Kashmir now are unlocking the potential solutions and trying to shape the aspirations for a more hopeful future. To address the challenges at hand, it is essential to create platforms for dialogue, enabling youth to articulate their experiences, hopes, and aspirations, ultimately fostering a sense of agency and promoting pathways to healing and constructive engagement in the peace building process. The holding of elections after 10 years gap was much needed for the centre needed to demonstrate that normalcy has returned to the region after the 2019 changes. Even when the scale of attacks by armed groups has reduced, they have not stopped in total. Therefore to claim that terrorism has been completely wiped out is wrong given the fresh wave of attacks in central and north Kashmir. The youth of Kashmir aspire to move toward peace, prosperity, and development while seeking redress for their basic issues. They voted overwhelmingly just to choose the leaders who really can advocate for their voices, dignity, and the creation of employment opportunities. On one hand they don’t feel it a challenge to navigate through digital landscapes and are ready to chart new career paths like their rising interest for civil services, research and teaching degrees but simultaneously feel demoralised due to lack of jobs in the region. A larger chunk of youth is trying for gulf countries for jobs too. They are worried for their free voices too since many of them still lie in jails, who need a second chance to shape their lives. Kashmiri youth are trying their best to amplify their voices, they are entering police and civil services, doing direct politics through active participation in politics, thus navigating the complexities of their political landscape, they voted as silent voters yet resolute participants, channelling their anger into a demand for democracy and free voices. Youth want the government to focus first on unemployment and then on the identity issues and then take deteriorating mental health situation seriously. Last Word The youth of Kashmir are yearning for change. Their hunger for youth-led activism and the youth driven solutions has the potential to unlock sustainable peace. They are speaking for peace, condemning violence and advocating for a transformative and peaceful future. They are rising and making conscious choices amid challenges that can be seen in their shift in voting behaviour from traditional political affiliations to rational choice voting. They are articulate on their issues and challenges and future conscious too and that is why, as young voters they increasingly prioritized their rational choices and youth leaders, unemployment and regional identity as their issues over familial loyalty to political parties in the recently held assembly elections in the union territory. Therefore addressing Kashmiri youths challenges requires a holistic approach that fosters economic opportunities, promotes mental health awareness, works on drug de-addiction, promotes clinical psychology and counselling to address their mental trauma besides engaging them meaningfully to address their alienation. Youth need a constructive engagement in social, economic and political spheres, ultimately empowering them to navigate their circumstances and contribute positively to the society. The resilience and agency of Kashmiri youth today represents a significant shift towards fostering a culture of peace, suggesting that their involvement could play a transformative role in the broader socio-political landscape of Kashmir. fThis article originally appeared in the prestigious Mainstream Weekly	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWc-sFHajH-XNkMiEAHD5Qpt	2024-12-23T07:39:53-08:00	
A Taliban In Syria? Recognition Or Marginalization For Hayat Tahr...	By László Csicsmann and Scott N. Romaniuk The Arab Spring has significantly altered the power landscape of the Middle East, and the recent fall of Assad—toppled by Syria’s Hay’at Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) rebels—is just one more in a long line of power shifts that have occurred since 2011. Anti-government protests have taken place in more than a dozen Middle East and North Africa (MENA) countries, with Syria being the most recent to oust its long-standing regime. Here we consider the extent to which HTS has undergone moderation and de-radicalization, along with its aspirations for an inclusive political transition that seeks to uphold a diverse society. Alongside this assessment, we observe the complexities surrounding international recognition and the potential lifting of sanctions. HTS’ public campaign HTS, the Salafist organization that governed the 4–4.5 million residents of the Idlib Governorate in northwest Syria, executed an unexpected military maneuver in 11 days, resulting in the swift collapse of the Assad regime, which had ruled Syria since 1970. The United States (US), European Union (EU), and Türkiye, as well as international organizations, including the UN Security Council (UNSC), have designated HTS as a terrorist organization. This label has sparked heated debates among global stakeholders about its potential recognition as an interim government in Syria. Source: Authors HTS emerged from al-Qaeda’s local faction, Jabhat al-Nusra, also known as the Nusra Front. It engaged in combat against the Assad regime and other rebel factions while pursuing a broader jihadist agenda that centered on the establishment of a global caliphate. Since the start of the Syrian civil war, the Nusra Front has shown animosity toward the Islamic State, which was increasingly enlisting foreigners into its ranks. Abu Mohammad al-Jolani, the current leader of the movement, fought for years in Iraq as a global jihadist within the broader al-Qaeda network, earning him a $10 million USD reward from the US in 2013. After a six-year spell of US imprisonment in Iraq, he severed links with al-Qaeda in 2016 and created HTS as a unifying body, shifting focus away from its global aims and embracing a Syria-centered approach. HTS became the dominant political and armed entity in Idlib after Russia, Iran, and Türkiye initiated the Astana process. Jolani effectively presented himself as a representative of a moderate Salafist movement within political Islam, seeking to destabilize the Assad regime through violent means. HTS, by its very nature, is a radical entity, and while it moderated its rhetoric on global jihadism, it remained committed to violently overthrowing the Assad regime. Recent events should be considered in the context of a civil war in which HTS was fighting for its own survival. HTS has established the ‘Syrian Salvation Government (SSG)’ that includes a technocrat prime minister and appointed members. The primary focus was on providing sustenance and essential public services to the local populace, particularly in light of the Assad regime’s effective isolation of the rebels in Idlib from external access. Jolani advocated for the safeguarding of minority groups in accordance with Islamic principles, encompassing the Christian communities that continue to exist within the nation. Jolani and his associates initiated a political campaign to portray HTS as a moderate Islamist movement capable of upholding the diverse fabric of contemporary Syria as it began its military advance toward the South along the route to Damascus. HTS and its members extended communications to both internal and external stakeholders. HTS challenges the Assad regime’s narrative by presenting itself as the ‘protector of minorities’ with the objective of advancing ‘moderate’ Islam. HTS promotes the protection of Christian minorities, as well as the Alawite minority along the Mediterranean coast, in addition to the Druze. HTS governance appears to have been well-received at first; however, minority groups in Syria continue to harbor reservations. The question of whether HTS moderation is genuine or a foreign recognition-seeking tactic is of enormous importance. Projecting ‘moderation’: A Taliban-type regime in Syria? Historical experiences with the moderation and de-radicalization of previous radical Islamist groups reveal a complicated and varied landscape. The situation of the Muslim Brotherhood (Al-Ikhwan Al-Muslimeen) in Egypt, for example, exemplifies a stance of moderation, as the organization has opted against violently toppling the regime. Instead, they advocated for hizbiyyah (partisanship), engaging in the political arena rather than resorting to conflict. Shaykh Rabee ibn Hadee Al Madkhali, a Salafi Muslim and Saudi scholar, asserts that ‘Everyone who opposes the Salafi methodology is from among the partisan groups of misguidance, Hizbiyah has no conditions’. According to al-Madkhali, hizb is the adoption of a ‘deviant ideology’ on which people are gathered, irrespective of it being organized or not. He sees hizb as aiding ‘falsehood’ and an act of ‘war against the truth.’ The Muslim Brotherhood’s brief period in power during Muhammed Morsi’s presidency exposed governmental shortcomings, leading the Egyptian military to stage a ‘soft coup’ in 2013. Because Egypt prohibits the movement, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) actively promote the marginalization of moderate Islamists in the Middle East. The Saudi Kingdom, the UAE, and Egypt consider the Muslim Brotherhood a dangerous movement because of its ability to mobilize liberal and secular movements, its sway over large populations, its anti-Islamic stance, and its influential political voice in the Middle East. However, its ideological influence over the parties it formerly backed has drastically diminished. Saudi Arabia, the UAE, and Egypt have all taken strong action against the Muslim Brotherhood. On the other hand, Qatar and Türkiye back the organization. In addition to the Muslim Brotherhood, the Taliban’s return to power in August 2021 is another important event to consider in relation to HTS. ‘We’re working to establish an inclusive government that represents all the people of Afghanistan,’ asserted Mullah Baradar, the deputy prime minister of the Taliban administration, in September of 2021. Expectations were high for the moderation of the movement, known as ‘Taliban 2.0,’ to establish an inclusive government and initiate a national dialogue with all societal stakeholders. However, in practice, Taliban 2.0 has remained committed to jihad, prioritizing fundamentalist ideals over democratic ones and refusing to participate in a national dialogue. More recently, it has begun to return to its origins with respect to the rights of women and minorities. The Taliban serves as an example of how words are used as weapons during the power transitions to achieve political and economic goals, solidifying power and bolstering efforts to garner global support and recognition. HTS, however, does not align with the characteristics of a Muslim Brotherhood-type movement, nor does it resemble the Taliban, which exhibits a certain hostility toward Salafism. Further, the geopolitical context of Syria and its internal social structure present distinct differences from those of other regions. An important question now is the extent to which a Salafist movement can take part in practical political initiatives while adhering to the Quranic tradition and Shari’a principles. Compared to a Salafist movement such as HTS, a group of the Muslim Brotherhood type typically demonstrates a greater capacity to adapt to local circumstances. The future of Syrian politics hinges not only on HTS’s objectives but also on other rebel groups’ willingness to recognize the legitimacy of the authority in power and the international community’s position. Regarding the latter, all external parties will need to consider a pragmatic approach to HTS. HTS will most likely merge with the Syrian military, which could result in the dissolution of its original form. Eliminating a group from their ‘terrorist list’ would address a moral quandary for Western governments. However, simply deleting a group’s name will not adequately address Syria’s underlying difficulties, as the next step would be to remove various sanctions that have previously prohibited Assad’s Syria from fully integrating with the international system. Türkiye’s position: Goals, opportunities, and risks The ousting of Assad is a positive development for Ankara, often cited as one of the greatest beneficiaries of the recent developments. Ankara’s main goal is the establishment of a stable Syria. Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan has stated that Ankara fully supports Syrian rebel forces following the overthrow of the Assad administration, amid the emergence of unexpected coalitions of disparate groups. This includes military support. Fidan urged support from countries around the world and emphasized the importance of maintaining factional cohesion in Syria. A major concern for Ankara is the SDF’s ties to two groups that are staunch enemies of Türkiye: the Kurdistan Workers’ Party (PKK) and the People’s Defense Units (YPG). These groups are not only terrorist organizations in Türkiye’s eyes but also a unified entity that Ankara regards as an existential threat to the Turkish state. For Ankara, the YPG’s control of northern Syria directly challenges Turkish sovereignty. Its ‘elimination’ remains one of Türkiye’s ‘strategic goals,’ stated Fidan. Despite the US and EU classifying the PKK as a terrorist organization, the US’s relationship with the YPG complicates US-Türkiye relations. Notwithstanding the persistent challenges in Syria, including Kurdish autonomy in the Autonomous Administration of North and East Syria (AANES, also called Rojava), Ankara has reason to expect positive relations with the emerging Damascus government. Even so, Ankara’s military actions against the PKK in the area are certain to continue, and even though HTS has connections to the YPG, both groups will continue to pursue their own political objectives. The Erdoğan government maintains positive relations with Islamic groups in Syria, including HTS and the Syrian National Army (SNA). As a member of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), Türkiye is well-positioned to influence the formation of the Syrian government and thus contribute meaningfully to the state-building process, which would benefit Ankara in terms of politics, economics, and security. The aftermath of Assad’s ousting and the subsequent changes in Syria pose several risks for Türkiye. First, the potential for territorial disintegration and renewed conflict due to power competitions and groups vying for autonomy in a post-Assad Syria could result in internal displacement and new surges of refugees. Despite Ankara’s emphasis on the return of millions of refugees who fled the Assad regime over the previous years, there is a possibility that additional waves of refugees will cross the Turkish-Syrian border, which spans over 900 kilometers. Secondly, Türkiye’s longer-term strategic interests and objectives could be hampered if Syria experiences a ‘Balkanisation’—the breakup of the state into ethnically cohesive pieces—which would make it more difficult for the country to transition into a stable state. Thirdly, the political upheavals in Syria have resulted in significant losses and concerns for both Russia and Iran. Türkiye will have to balance its strategic goals, its external relations with other states and non-state actors, a new Syria, and countries that backed the old regime, especially Russia and Iran. In a two-day period, the Israeli military conducted approximately 480 airstrikes in Syria, while the Israeli Navy reportedly attacked and destroyed the Syrian Navy. ‘The collapse of the Syrian regime is a direct result of the severe blows with which we have struck Hamas, Hezbollah and Iran,’ said Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. He then declared, ‘The axis has not yet disappeared, but as I promised, we are changing the face of the Middle East,’ during a press conference in Hebrew held in Jerusalem on December 9. He made nearly a dozen references to the so-called ‘axis of evil’ during the event. Nevertheless, the recent occurrences present Türkiye with the opportunity to ‘normalize’ its relations with Syria, secure its lengthy border, and play an integral part in the country’s development—all of which are top priorities for Ankara. The next phase of the Syrian transition European and US entities impose sanctions to hold the Assad regime accountable for its failure to adhere to UN Security Council (UNSC) Resolution 2254, a 2015 Geneva process advocating for a genuine political transition in Syria. With the rapid disintegration of the Assad regime and the impending onset of a transitional phase, the rationale for sustaining the sanctions appears increasingly tenuous. To do this, the Syrian Interim Government (SIG) may need to distance itself from HTS, allowing it to evolve into a political body rather than a militant outfit that opposes the previous administration through violent means. Syria currently operates under a presidential system, in which the presidential role remains, from a legal standpoint, unfulfilled. Nonetheless, Jolani, the leader of HTS, effectively exercises presidential authority in Syria by appointing Muhammed al-Bashir’s interim government. The alteration of his war name to Ahmad al-Sharaa indicates a discernment of the lessons derived from prior unsuccessful transitions within the Middle East. It remains to be seen if the international community has absorbed the lesson as well. Should the sanctions remain in place, the emerging political authority in Syria may face the risk of either disintegration or a regression into captagon smuggling activities. By lifting the sanctions, Western nations would jeopardize their support for a Salafist group, which cannot inherently contest its own doctrinal tenets.

Tackling The Air Pollution Crisis In Delhi – Analysis	By Rumi Aijaz Air pollution in Delhi and the surrounding region has become a common phenomenon. With some variations, it is experienced annually. During the monsoon season from June to September, for example, air pollution is minimal, as the frequent rainfall does not allow it to spread or rise. However, its intensity increases by many times during the remaining months. The worst air quality is experienced during the winter months from October to February. The occurrence of extreme air pollution in the Delhi region is a matter of great concern. It is affecting living beings and nature in various ways. The most common indications of this problem are poor visibility, difficulty in breathing, respiratory ailments in a large population, the deteriorating quality of surface water, and a disruption in city activities. Media houses, political parties, and interest groups discuss and highlight this issue every year during peak periods. To control the problem, the Supreme Court, national government and city administration have intervened in various ways and applied numerous solutions based on sources of air pollution. It has been learnt that the air pollution phenomenon occurs due to a combination of human and natural factors. The Delhi region is India’s most populous, and its large population is engaged in various activities—travel, construction and manufacturing, agriculture, electricity generation and consumption, sanitation, and the celebration of festivals. Many of these activities are carried out in an environmentally unfriendly manner, which results in the generation of dust and the release of pollutants in the air. The transport, construction, and agriculture sectors are the most significant sources of air pollution in the region. Large numbers of motor vehicles run on fossil fuels, and there are inefficiencies in vehicle maintenance as well as traffic management. In construction activity, enormous dust is generated because the development agencies do not cover newly developing structures properly. With regards to agriculture, it is noted that there is a practice of paddy and wheat residue (stubble) burning by farmers in the surrounding states of Haryana, Punjab, and Uttar Pradesh. While the farmers find this method quick and convenient for clearing the fields for sowing new crops, it is a major source of air pollution in Delhi. Additionally, there is the practice of municipal solid waste burning for its convenient disposal. Further, poor people and security guards, who spend their nights outside in the open, burn leaves and dry wood to protect themselves from the cold during winter months, which emits pollutants. Yet another source is firecrackers. Their relentless bursting at night time for a week during the Diwali festival causes toxic smog every year in the winter season. Air quality index (AQI) values increase phenomenally during this period since polluted air gets trapped in a lower layer of the atmosphere during winter. The other human factor is related to deficiencies in urban planning and development. At many places, sand is loose on vacant lands as the Delhi region generally remains dry, and gusty surface winds blow dust in all directions. This dust settles on the road corridors and is spread by passing motor vehicles. This problem is further aggravated by dust coming to the region from far-off places, including deserts in the Arabian Peninsula and Rajasthan. These prevailing conditions create problems for both the motorists and the walking population. Over the years, government agencies have done a lot of work, both on paper and on the ground, to address the problem. A review of available information shows that laws and policies have been formulated for various pollution-emitting sources. Actions on the ground include the relocation of polluting industrial units away from Delhi, phasing out the use of old motor vehicles, a switchover of all public transport vehicles from diesel to compressed natural gas (CNG), the switchover of private and commercial vehicles to cleaner fuels, the introduction of electric vehicles, the mechanised sweeping of roadsides, the installation of solar power systems, and the installation of air quality monitoring stations. Previous and ongoing interventions have helped in addressing the issue to some extent, but the magnitude of the problem is enormous due to the improper conduct of human activities. Hence, a significant improvement on the ground is not visible. Over the last few years, the graded response action plan (GRAP) has been applied whenever air quality deteriorates in the NCR region. In this plan, the concerned government and private agencies (i.e. pollution control boards, construction agencies, the transport department, traffic police, municipalities and power distribution companies), resident welfare associations, plot owners, and individuals are directed to conduct (or discontinue) certain actions and activities as per GRAP guidelines, to help combat pollution. Thus, when AQI values rise beyond 200, or the ‘moderate’ level, a series of measures are applied. These measures are grouped under four stages, depending on the intensity of pollution. For example, when pollution is less, concerned agencies are required to ensure greater work efficiency in activities related to construction and demolition (C&D), cleaning of roads, and traffic management. With a further increase in pollution, additional measures are invoked, such as an increase in parking fees in public areas, a ban on C&D activities, the discontinuation of physical classes in educational institutions, a ban on the entry of trucks and inter-state buses running on inferior fuels in Delhi, a shift to work from home, and the introduction of an odd-even motor vehicle scheme. The citizens are also informed about the do’s and don’ts through a citizen charter. Accordingly, when the fourth stage of GRAP was applied in Delhi in November 2024, students were asked to shift to online modes of education, people’s travel in motor vehicles was restricted, the entry of polluting goods vehicles (carrying non-essential products) was stopped, road/building construction activities came to a standstill, and parking fees in public areas was hiked. In other words, many activities could not function properly, which impacted the lives of people in various ways. Yet again, on 17 December 2024, the fourth stage of GRAP was applied because AQI values increased to over 400 in many crowded areas of Delhi, including Anand Vihar and Rohini. In the prevailing conditions, the city agencies must demonstrate greater efficiency in addressing the issue of air pollution. This achievement is dependent on sufficient support received from the national government, as well as the citizens who have to abide by the rules. To reduce air pollution in the Delhi region, the following work is required: The regional public transportation system must be improved. Bus services are not available within walking distance in Gurugram, and people have to fend for themselves. Moreover, integration of public transport modes is lacking at many metro rail stations. The quality, frequency and safety of bus services need improvement. The fare system in auto rickshaws requires regulation. Such deficiencies have led to a phenomenal growth in private motor vehicles. The road and building construction agencies must comply with dust control measures. During construction, building structures should be properly covered with green barriers, and water sprinkling should be used to prevent dust from spreading. The practice of stubble burning in agriculture fields must be stopped. Just like the solid waste collection in urban areas, a system for the collection of agricultural waste needs to be developed. The cultivators and agricultural workers can be asked to cut and collect waste, which can be deposited by them in collection centres for disposal in an environmentally friendly manner. In return, some incentives can be offered to the farming community. Illegally operating polluting economic activities in the region, including small industrial units, must be identified, and the owners must receive support to switch over to cleaner forms of energy.

Addressing East Asia’s Demographic Crisis: The Promise Of Four-Da...	East Asia has been currently grappling with an unprecedented demographic crisis marked by plunging birth rates and aging populations. The East Asian countries such as Japan, South Korea, China, and Singapore have reported fertility rates far below the replacement rate of 2.1 children per woman. South Korea, for example, reached a record low of 0.72 in 2023, while Japan's fertility rate has stagnated at 1.2. This demographic shift presents severe economic and social challenges, including shrinking workforces and rising welfare costs to support aging populations. Against this backdrop, the Tokyo Metropolitan Government has announced a four-day workweek initiative as a potential solution to address the declining birth rates by fostering better work-life balance and supporting families. The declining birth rates in East Asia are driven by several interconnected factors. Economically, the high cost of living, particularly in urban areas, discourages many couples from starting/expanding families. In Japan, the financial burden of childcare and education, combined with stagnant wages and housing affordability issues, makes parenthood a daunting and challengeable issue/s. Job insecurity further exacerbates this reluctance, with many young people prioritizing economic stability over family expansion. Culturally, urban lifestyles often emphasize individualism and career ambitions, leading to delayed marriages and fewer births. Gender inequality also plays a significant role, with women disproportionately shouldering domestic responsibilities, discouraging them from having multiple children or even entering motherhood. Work culture in East Asia is another critical factor. The intense pressure to perform long hours leaving little time or energy for family life. In Japan, where overwork-related health issues are prevalent, such pressures severely impact individuals' ability to focus on personal relationships and family planning. The implications of these declining birth rates are far-reaching. Economically, a shrinking workforce undermines productivity and growth, with Japan’s GDP growth slowing considerably in recent years due to its aging population. The respective governments have been facing increasing fiscal pressure as they struggle to provide welfare and healthcare for a growing elderly population while experiencing reduced tax revenues from fewer working-age citizens. Socially, an aging population creates a generational imbalance, leading to fewer caregivers for the elderly and a diminished sense of community. Globally, this demographic decline threatens East Asia's competitive edge in innovation and markets, further complicating economic challenges. To address these issues, governments in East Asia have been introducing a variety of measures, primarily focused on financial incentives and policy reforms. Singapore’s Baby Bonus scheme offers up to SGD 13,000 for families with multiple children, while Japan and South Korea provide comparable monetary benefits. Despite their generosity, these measures have had limited success, as they fail to address the deeper institutional and cultural barriers to parenthood. Policies aimed at reducing childcare costs and improving parental leave have also been implemented. South Korea offers generous parental allowances, while Japan has introduced monthly childcare subsidies. However, these efforts have not been sufficient to reverse the trend. Singapore, on the other hand, has managed to maintain a relatively stable population through liberal immigration policies, but this approach may not be feasible for culturally homogenous nations like Japan and South Korea. Amid these challenges, the four-day workweek presents a promising new approach by Japan. The rationale behind this initiative is to address the root causes of low fertility by tackling work culture and improving work-life balance. By providing employees with an additional day off each week, the policy aims to reduce stress and fatigue, giving individuals more energy to focus on personal relationships and family life. It also encourages parents to spend quality time with their children, engage in caregiving, or plan for family expansion. Importantly, the four-day workweek can help promote gender equality by enabling women to better balance their careers and motherhood while redistributing caregiving responsibilities. The Tokyo Metropolitan Government plans to implement the four-day workweek for its employees starting in April 2025. This policy includes provisions for parents of young children to clock out early in exchange for a partial salary cut, targeting over 160,000 workers. The initiative aims to set a precedent for private sector adoption, fostering a broader cultural shift toward prioritizing family well-being. Evidence from global trials supports the potential benefits of this approach. A 2022 pilot in Japan revealed that over 90% of participants reported improved happiness and work-life balance. Similar studies in other countries have demonstrated reductions in stress, burnout, and fatigue, coupled with increased productivity. The four-day workweek also offers broader societal benefits. Economically, it has the potential to increase productivity as well-rested employees tend to be more efficient and creative. With more free time, individuals may spend more on leisure activities, stimulating consumer spending and economic growth. Socially, the policy strengthens family bonds by allowing parents to be more actively involved in their children’s lives. It also enhances gender equity by normalizing flexible work arrangements and encouraging a more equitable sharing of domestic responsibilities. Additionally, reduced work hours can lead to increased community participation and social cohesion, fostering a healthier and more balanced society. Despite its promise, the four-day workweek faces several challenges. Resistance from employers is a significant obstacle, as many businesses are concerned about potential reductions in output and profitability. Implementation costs, including investments in training and operational restructuring, may also deter organizations from adopting the policy. Certain industries, such as healthcare and manufacturing, may find it challenging to implement reduced work hours without compromising service quality. Cultural barriers, particularly in East Asia, where long hours are often equated with commitment and success, may further hinder acceptance of the policy. In conclusion, East Asia’s birth rate crisis is a complex and multifaceted issue that demands innovative and holistic solutions. While monetary incentives and policy initiatives have made some progress, they fall short of addressing the deeper cultural and structural barriers that discourage parenthood. The Tokyo Metropolitan Government’s four-day workweek initiative represents a bold and forward-thinking approach, targeting the root causes of low fertility by promoting work-life balance, reducing stress, and supporting families. While challenges remain, the potential benefits of this policy—from enhanced productivity to stronger family bonds—make it a promising strategy for addressing demographic decline. By pioneering such initiatives, Tokyo could set a precedent for other regions, fostering a more sustainable and family-friendly society. Ultimately, addressing the birth rate crisis will require collective efforts from governments, businesses, and communities, with the four-day workweek serving as a critical step toward a brighter demographic future.

Putin Weighs In On The Syrian Situation – OpEd	Russian President Vladimir Putin, during his Results of the Year annual marathon yearender interactive televised discussion with the Russian public and the media in Moscow on December 19, spoke at some length on the recent developments in Syria. These were Putin’s first public remarks on the topic and, coming 12 days after armed opposition forces seized Damascus and the exile of former president Bashar al-Assad and his family in Moscow, they signified that the Kremlin is recalibrating its compass of West Asian strategies. Putin disclosed that he will soon have a meeting with Assad, signalling a level of transparency that is very rare in international diplomacy in comparable volatile circumstances. We still do not know, for instance, what happened to Afghan president Ashraf Ghani after the Taliban takeover four years ago, or whether President Joe Biden even showed the courtesy to receive America’s fallen ally — and an erstwhile proxy at that. Putin sees no reason to feel ashamed or petrified over the regime change in Syria. Russia’s mission in Syria was to decimate the US-sponsored extremist groups destabilising that country and the region as part of a regime change project. And that enterprise has been hugely successful as Russia inflicted a crushing defeat to the American project. The Russian mission in Syria never had a hidden agenda to prop up the Syrian regime. As Putin explained, Russian ground forces were never deployed or involved in the fighting in Syria. The speed with which Assad was given asylum in Moscow and the peaceful transfer of power in Damascus hinted that the Kremlin was not taken by surprise. Again, compare the chaotic and desperate US evacuation on August 16, 2021 from Kabul airport with Afghans falling from the sky as American military planes took off. Yet, western propaganda is painting the town red that Russia has been 'defeated' in Syria! The narrative by Turkish foreign minister Hakan Fidan seems entirely plausible when he claimed that at Ankara’s urging, Moscow and Tehran counselled Assad to peacefully transfer power. Fidan disclosed to NTV broadcaster on Dec. 13, 'We spoke with the Russians and Iranians and told them that the man they had invested in was no longer someone worth investing in. They made one phone call, and that evening Assad was gone.' Putin openly acknowledged that Russia keeps contacts with the HTS and their conversation will have a bearing on the fate of the bases in Latakia. Russia is offering that the international community may use the bases to handle humanitarian assistance to Syria. Conceivably, Turkey, Russia and Iran synchronised their watches. Tehran disclosed in the weekend that it is reopening the embassy in Damascus and that the HTS has offered to provide security for the mission’s functioning. Through the entire three-and-a-half hour event in Moscow last Thursday, Putin never once voiced any criticism of Turkey’s backing for HTS or questioned the legitimacy of Ankara’s stated concerns in the Syrian situation — although he remains sceptical whether the Kurdish nationality question involving 30-35 million ethnic Kurdish population spread over Turkey, Syria, Iraq and Iran lends itself to a solution. Putin asserted that Moscow has already conveyed to the HTS as well as the regional states that the Russian bases are 'capable of offering assistance… (and) this was met with understanding and a willingness to collaborate.' Putin stressed: 'An overwhelming majority of them have expressed interest in retaining our military bases in Syria.' Putin ridiculed the Biden administration’s prognosis that Russia faces 'defeat' in Syria. His broad message was that 'there will be plenty to discuss' with Trump when they meet, implying that Biden Administration is no longer consequential to Syria’s future. The Biden Administration’s efforts to rally the Arab states have failed to gain traction as the trust deficit is formidable. Arabs suspect that the US’ continued illegal occupation has ulterior motives. Indeed, a new matrix is appearing, as Biden administration’s obsession shifts to creating a quagmire in the Middle East for the incoming Trump administration. In a somersault on Sunday, the US state department’s Assistant Secretary Barbara Leaf landed in Damascus to personally convey the US decision to scrap the $10 million reward for the arrest of HTS leader (Syria’s de facto leader) Abu Mohammed al-Jolani, following what she claimed to be 'very productive' meetings with the group’s representatives. This abject surrender will now enable Washington to lift the sanctions against Syria per the infamous Caesar Syria Civilian Protection Act of 2019. However, Russia has outmanoeuvred the Biden administration in Syria. Putin implied that a working relationship with the new leadership in Damascus is steadily developing. He said, 'I do not know, we must reflect on how our relations will evolve with the political forces currently in control (in Damascus) and those that will govern this country in the future –- our interests must align. Should we remain, we must act in the interests of the host nation.' Putin noted: 'What will those interests entail? What can we do for them? These questions demand careful consideration on both sides. We are already capable of offering assistance, including utilising our bases… while challenges remain, our position firmly aligns with international law and the sovereignty of all nations, including respect for Syria’s territorial integrity. This extends to supporting the stance of the current authorities governing the territory of the Syrian Arab Republic. In this regard, we stand with them.' This is a big statement and it will resonate across the Arab world. Make no mistake, Russia’s transition from the Assad era is well under way. The contours of a pragmatic policy approach are emerging. Russian intelligence would have done the spade work in this transition. Putin remarked tauntingly that 'the groups that were fighting against the Assad regime and the government forces back then have undergone internal changes. It is not surprising that many European countries and the United States are trying to develop relations with them now. Would they be doing this if they were terrorist organisations? This means that they have changed, doesn’t it? So, our goal (Russia’s intervention in Syria in 2015) has been achieved, to a certain degree.' From behind the scene, Turkey is tacitly encouraging Russia’s partnership with HTS. Significantly, Putin dwelt on the ramifications of the Kurdish problem where Turkey may need Russia’s cooperation to navigate the tricky pathway going forward. Turkey’s concerns have four main templates: one, ensure Turkey’s border security with Syria; two, create conditions for the return of Syrian refugees from Turkey; three, push Syrian Kurdish forces away from the border regions; and, four, counter the covert European and US-Israeli support for an independent Kurdish state. Putin underscored 'the gravity of the Kurdish issue.' There is no conflict of interests here between Turkey and Russia. While Putin spoke with understanding and some sympathy for Turkey’s legitimate concerns, he did not mince words to condemn Israel’s naked land grab in Syria. In his words, 'I believe that the main beneficiary of the developments in Syria is Israel… In the Golan Heights, Israel has advanced along the front by 62–63 kilometres and to a depth of 20–25 kilometres. They have occupied fortifications originally built for Syria by the Soviet Union, strong defensive structures comparable to the Maginot Line. 'It seems there are already several thousand (Israeli) personnel stationed there. It appears not only that they have no intention of leaving, but they may also be planning to further reinforce their presence.' Putin warned that 'further complications down the line' are to be expected, as the Israeli occupation could 'ultimately result in the fragmentation of Syria.' In this regard, Russia shares the same perception as Turkey, Iran and the Arab states. Interestingly, Putin exuded confidence that Russia is on the right side of history with a policy reset that aims to harmonise with Turkey and Iran as well as the Arab states. Indeed, this diplomatic feat enhances Russia’s standing in West Asia. Conversely, to retrench or not in Syria — that’s the question that will haunt the Trump presidency. The Pentagon is already pushing back against Trump’s statement 'we have nothing to do (in Syria).' Pentagon spokesperson Pat Ryder has revealed that US troop numbers in Syria have reached 2,000 –- more than double the previously reported nine hundred. These troops remain actively deployed with no plans for withdrawal.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWc-sFHajH-XNinuBJxanUmg	2024-12-22T17:27:15-08:00	
Syrian Hardships While Transitioning In The Post-Assad Phase – An...	The despotic rule of Bashar al-Assad came to an unexpected end on December 8 this year with the Sunni rebel group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) displacing the regime through a sweeping and blistering rebellion and assuming the role of the central governing authority in the transitional period up to March first of the coming year. The Assad regime in Syria has fallen like cascades with the weakening of its external patrons and supporting partners- Russia and Iran along with its regional proxies. The fate of Assad was tied to the wars in the Middle East and Europe that kept bleeding the resources and military capabilities of Iran and its regional proxies and Russia respectively which buttressed the regime since 2011. While any fledgling democratic form of governance is much better than the brutal regime of Assad, the transitional phase may bring more socio-economic and political instabilities and invite more external interferences than before. Hence, while Syria during this period would need the support of major international actors to get sanction reliefs and humanitarian aid, more assistance would be needed to reconstruct the already plagued socio-economic institutions. Neutrality must be maintained to avert meddling of neighbors. While Turkey has called for Syria for Syrians, it has already been privileged by lending its support for HTS whereas other major powers such as Israel and US maintain their spheres of influence in Syria in different geographical zones through different domestic clients. On the other side, Russia and Iran would use divergent strategies to offset their loss with the debacle of the Assad regime. China which until the uprooting of the Assad regime refrained from direct military involvement in the country is likely to enhance its footprint because of its rising security concerns emanating from the Uyghur separatists who fought against the regime alongside HTS and are now part of the umbrella group. While HTS would find it difficult to fetch the necessary assistance from international community as it has been outlawed as a legitimate actor by the UN Security Council and not all the factions of it have been viewed positively by major actors of the international community. Much in a similar vein, neutrality, in true sense of the term, is almost impossible to be implemented in the Syrian context. End of the Dynastic Rule While the Assad regime was standing on the carnage of a protracted civil war since 2011, it was nonetheless providing a modicum of enforced stability to a fractured and economically ruined society amid a plethora of rebel groups vying for influence in different pockets of the country in collaboration with their external patrons. Freedom House, which conducts annual survey on the availability of freedom in countries described in its 2023 report, Syria under Assad as 'one of the world's most oppressive regimes' which 'harshly suppresses freedom of speech and assembly' with 'enforced disappearances, military trials and torture'. However, role of external players in Syria along with attention of international community plunged after Assad was assumed to have won the civil war and a phase of authoritarian stability ensued. Protests against the despotic and despicable Assad regime began peacefully in 2011 under the rubric of Arab Spring to which the Syrian forces responded with bullets and imprisonment. The peaceful protest then turned violent and protracted pitting the Assad regime against the anti-regime forces which changed configurations and character with the passage of time. The conflict witnessed decisive shifts and became internationalized in 2015 when Russian President Vladimir Putin dispatched special forces and aircraft to bombard resistance groups in towns like Aleppo. Much in a similar vein, Iran also bolstered the regime in the face of rising rebellion against it. Without caring for restructuring and reforming the governance structure, the Assad regime resorted to strategies such as use of force, brutal killings, imprisonment and suppression of dissenting voices in Syria to hold onto power. His intransigence to come to negotiating table with rebel groups and discuss the future of Syria finally ended with disastrous collapse of the regime. HTS capitalizing on people's suppressed anger and grievances ended Assad's and his family's brutal 53-year rule through unexpectedly swift and sweeping military offensive. However, with the dramatic fall of Assad regime, while security stakes for a host of external powers in West Asia has climbed for a few others it provides necessary power vacuum and chaos to spread influence for a few others. External Influences In the face of declining influence of Iran and Russia in Syria, Israel and Turkey are set to expand their sway and power deep into the country. While Turkey reportedly took steps to bring Assad, Iran and Russia to the negotiation table in a bid to find out certain balance in the Syrian governance system and address the problem of influx of Syrian refugees in Turkey, Assad's defiance led Ankara to change the tack and assist HTS to launch the lightening offensive. Turkey's assistance to HTS is quite palpable in its immediate reopening of its embassy in Damascus after Assad's fall and offering of assistance to the group in shaping the country's new Islamist order. Israel in order to spread its own sphere of influence and push back against the rising Sunni Islamic influence under HTS has unleashed territorial incursion into the Golan Heights in Syria with its resettlement strategies perceiving the danger to Jew population from the rise of Sunni Islamic groups and has launched military operations to destroy the country's military assets. Turkey under the leadership of President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan Turkey views Israeli actions in Syria destroying its military infrastructure and occupation of Golan Heights including its resettlement plans as clear violation of international laws. Much in a similar vein, Israel's actions have also been condemned by Arab countries as these impinge on Syria's sovereignty and territorial integrity. The Russian President Putin received fleeing Assad amid Moscow's influence taking a nosedive that was a predominant player with its naval and air bases in and around Syria before the blistering ouster of Assad. The US led a military campaign against the Islamic State group and fellow radical group al-Nusra Front inside Syria. Following the airstrikes, American troops entered northeast Syria to back the Syrian Kurdish force known as the People's Protection Units, or YPG, and later the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), an umbrella group that consists of majority Kurdish and other ethnic and rebel groups. The American sphere of influence in Syria was maintained and sustained through the group. However, the US military support for Kurdish groups in Syria badgered its NATO ally Turkey, which views the YPG as an offshoot of the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), a designated terrorist organization. Despite the end the dynastic rule in Syria with deposition of Assad, the United Nations special envoy for Syria warned that the war 'has not ended yet' as the clashes between Turkish-backed armed groups and Kurdish fighters in the north of the country continued. Turkey seeks to ensure a pro-Turkey bulwark against the Kurdish Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) in eastern Syria. Meanwhile, HTS leader Ahmad al-Sharaa who is also known as Abu Mohammad al-Jolani in a bid to prevent external intervention in the country has expressed in categorical terms that Syria will not allow any group to stage attacks against any other country including Israel whereas the leader has called for the withdrawal of Israel from Syrian territory according to a 1974 agreement that followed the 1973 Yom Kippur war. Even while China did not send any troops or directly sold arms to bolster the Assad regime since 2011 until Assad's ouster in December 2024, Chinese security concerns and stakes have climbed with the rise of HTS and other Islamic rebel groups in Syria. Members of the Turkistan Islamic Party (TIP) released a video from Syria calling for militant jihad against China. Many foreign fighters within HTS are Uyghurs from China's Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region who militantly pursue the political objective of carving out a Uyghur state from China. The TIP took up arms alongside other Syrian rebel groups against the Assad regime and its SDF ally. Domestic Predicaments HTS is an umbrella group that includes disparate rebel groups into its fold which have different external patrons. This apart, the group does not have control over several other militant groups active in Syria. Hence, while it has begun to govern a state, it cannot claim monopoly over power which a state needs for effective governance. Such an anarchic order could provide leeway to groups such as ISIS to reorganize. HTS itself has been labelled as a terrorist organisation by the UN Security Council which poses significant challenges for the group to gain international legitimacy to govern. The group had only prior experience of governing Idlib- only small part of Syria with the use of brute force on several occasions so to govern the entire country in the face of economic collapse and meddling of external actors with their domestic clients will be an uphill task. Decades of economic sanctions, isolation and destruction of critical infrastructure have earned the state a pariah status with rickety economic, social and political institutions which make it susceptible to further external pressures. Syria's GDP has not only contracted by 80 percent since 2011, around 90 percent of its people live below poverty line. Under such grim conditions, the refugee crisis may further get deteriorated with people fleeing the country to fetch minimum basic needs.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWc-sFHajH-XNpz-NZWV9yh7	2024-12-22T17:22:28-08:00	
How The Nanny Campus Will Fight To Keep Taxpayers Hostage – OpEd	By Kevin Van Elswyk The student loan crisis will end, 'not with a bang but with a whimper.' After the presidential election, student debt will remain an embarrassing and thorny issue. Both parties have DNA at this crime scene. Neither party is in control. The prime mover in all of this is the 'Nanny Campus' and a captured Education Department. Universities are the engine room of this education industrial-complex. Once accepted to university, FAFSA makes few assessments of the student’s ability to carry the loan forward all the way to paying it off. Most students do not comprehend the costs of signing up for a $30,000 debt to complete a degree in four to six years. Students cannot comprehend how long twenty to twenty-five years this debt plus interest will take. Loan payment terms may exceed the borrower’s age. The interaction of the ED, banks, and students was parodied in an earlierMises article. The Biden-Harris administration pushed student loan forgiveness to a SAVE program. New payment plans provide transfer of unpaid loans to this new plan to cure the receivable. Curing uses the federal fresh start program restarts the delinquency clock, suspends reporting to credit agencies, and makes ED statistics on default loans shrink. SAVE would limit the amount a debtor will pay depending on income. The Supreme Court blocked this. The score on passing forgiveness (write-off) plans is: Biden-Harris: 0; Scotus: 3. The taxpayer-as-benefactor does not approve or underwrite the student loans for risk. In finance, the benefactor (taxpayer) relies on contracts and the authority of the trustee to protect the money reserved for a specific loan use. Application of the contract’s provision and collection is the responsibility of the trustee (ED) loan holder. The student loan crisis will not end in the near term. Many loans do not reach maturity for 20 years. No new plan from the current administration or legislation from Congress will address loans due or the wasted dollars. Society’s expected payback of funds will not happen. The measurable return from improvement in the quality of human capital, as promised, is unlikely. ED is willingly co-opted with the university system, the energy source of the educational industrial-complex. The complex expresses shock that education can have its value monetized and made a commodity. Their goal is catering to the student, not having responsibility to the state or taxpayer. The educational industrial-complex is neither a fiduciary nor an underwriter of loans. It is free to focus on gathering more students as ATMs. Aided in part by state policies, universities accept 10 percent of every high school’s seniors. When a simple AI question was asked of Bing, 'What is the value of a college education?' there were seven benefits listed. Leading the benefits gained were the opportunity to earn higher wages, job security, and advancement. These benefits corresponded to the public’s expectation. The remaining six benefits are not related to wages. The benefits offered are like a syllabus of a program to help college students become adults. These Nanny Campus improvement promises are repeated often: Learn skills like communication, presentation, problem-solving, and teamwork; Learn to manage your time and money (?), and gain confidence; Gain Independence: University can help you become more independent as you learn to manage your learningand finances. (italics mine); Personal achievement, a life-changing experience giving a sense of achievement; Extracurricular activities that can help you try new things, meet new people, and further your interests; Exposure to diversity, building empathy and tolerance for people from diverse cultures; Work experience or placement opportunities as part of your course These benefits are termed 'social ROI'—a fuzzy attempt to justify soft, possible individual gains as society’s good. There is no acceptable exchange of currency from private 'social ROI' that translates to a dollar benefit to satisfy a loan expressed in dollars. (Ironically, while some scoff at the notion that the 'college experience' cannot be commodified and reduced to a dollar amount, students, parents, and taxpayers certainly pay a high dollar amount for these supposed intangible benefits). The ED function was calved from the iceberg of Health Education and Welfare in 1980. The newly-formed department had the staff, leadership, and DNA of its parent—a human services function. HHS goals were assisting individual clients with their needs for service, not making loans, underwriting applicants, or collecting payments. The goal of universities is increased enrollment. Meritocratic standards such as SAT/ACT scores or high school GPAs are obstacles to increased college admissions. Courses of study and capital projects may yield to student wishes, not future needs of society. The underlying credo sees all degrees as equally valuable. Considering college as an engine to develop human capital is criticized as materialistic. Mismanaged as a socio-political—not a financial—function, politics influences the ED’s every activity. Specialty loan amendments are catnip to Congress. Most occupational write-offs—such as teachers in urban areas or lawyers in remote Ohio—directly intrudes into reservation wages offered by the job market. This is the use of educational revenue as an off-the-book wage supplement. Universities soften technical courses and offer summer camp experiences such as waterparks, with indoor river tours, and multi-story water slides. Hungry? Seventy percent of college students use food delivery services, the average being fourtimes a week. Speech free zones and campus petting zoos relieve stress, even milk and cookies served after the Trump presidential win. Facing the enrollment cliff of fewer students leaving high school, smaller private universities are closing. Mid-sized colleges are adopting collaborative degrees and increasing marketing campaigns. Large universities are eliminating low attendance classes or granting credit hours for life experience. Student Loan Portfolio: A True 'Junk' Bond An August 2024 WalletHub survey reported 61 percent of students regret taking out student loan dollars. Seven in ten college students in this survey said they were financially overwhelmed. Two in 10 said they have no plan to pay their student loan debt after college. Statista reported in August that forty percent of graduates with a BA, aged 22 to 27, are working in jobs that did not require a degree. In a 2023 Wall Street Journal poll, 42 percent of college graduates said that getting a degree wasn’t worth the cost. The Venn diagram of these statistics presents a picture of a very ugly baby. Education Department data shows that, as of 2023, a total of 6.8 million federal student loan borrowers had loans in default. This represents 15 percent of the total number of borrowers. These borrowers are teased by the administration’s reporting of new forgiveness plans. Monthly press releases announce write-offs loans for small borrower segments. Covid suspension gave this group a taste of freedom when payments were suspended for 42 months. Forty-six percent are not currently paying their loans due to forbearance, default, or they are past due. Another fourteen percent, who were on an income-dependent plan did not even earn enough wages to pay the loans. All loans also allow wage garnishment. Was the Nanny Campus’ promotion of a college degree a contract offer accepted by students? The bill for student loans and escalating costs belongs to the state university system. Governed by regents with staggered terms and appointed by the governor, there is added distance between the taxpayer’s expectation and the deliverable. The legislators may control the budget, but not the university’s direction. A collision is imminent when the ED, the Nanny Campus, and students are held responsible for this $1.7 trillion dollar bill of their making.

Laos Must Appease China Or Embrace Austerity To Reduce Staggering...	By David Hutt The communist apparatchiks who run Laos must appease China if they are to stop their national debt crisis from worsening and avoid an outright default. The IMF’s latest report on Laos, released last month, was particularly damning about the country’s future. Real GDP growth likely peaked this year, at around 4.1 percent, and will slide from 3.5 percent next year down to 2.5 percent by 2029. In other words, Laos isn’t going to be able to grow itself out of debt anytime soon. Moreover, debt servicing costs, spending that is not actually paying off the principal on its monumental debt, will rise from around $1.1 billion this year to $1.5 billion next year and peak at $1.8 billion in 2026, the equivalent of a fifth of exports. Laos cannot even start to comprehend paying off its debt, which because of the country’s inflation crisis fluctuates as a percentage of GDP ratio. It was 131 percent of GDP in 2022, down to 108 percent this year but potentially up to 118 percent in 2025. The IMF politely suggested that 'alternative options to bring debt toward a sustainable level could also be considered,' yet noted that 'the authorities’ financing plan…critically relies on the continued extension of debt relief from China.' Debt deferrals All that matters for Vientiane, at least for the short term, is that Beijing continues offering debt deferrals. In 2023, these amounted to $770 million, about 5 percent of Laos’s GDP, according to the IMF. They were worth $222 million in 2020, $454 million in 2021, and $608 million in 2022. What other options has Laos got? It won’t turn to the IMF for a bailout, since that will come with political conditions – and half of national debt is owed to China, which doesn’t do debt write-offs. The money Vientiane owes Beijing is vast for Laos, but peanuts for Beijing. Laos’s debts could be completely forgiven tomorrow and nobody in Beijing would notice. But Chinese lenders don’t like having their pockets pinched and no superpower wants to be seen as a dog being wagged by its tail. Some people think Vientiane could offer more debt-for-equity swaps, whereby China reduces the debt in exchange for land or mineral rights or a stake in a state company. However, for all the cries of 'debt traps,' it is noticeable that there hasn’t been any major debt-for-equity swap since a Chinese state-owned firm was given majority control of a joint venture (EDL-T) with Electricite du Laos, which effectively handed Beijing Laos’ power grid, including its electricity exports. But that was in 2021! Few desirable assets Beijing has presumably browsed and doesn’t fancy anything it sees. As one source told me, 'there aren’t enough saleable assets' in Laos for equity swaps to touch the sides of the country’s debt. Even for natural resources or land, usually a Chinese company will get a multi-decade concession for very low rent. So it makes little sense for Chinese state firms to buy, in the form of a debt swap, what they essentially get for free, since the revenue the Lao government collects will eventually be paid back to the Chinese state. Nor are swaps all too appealing when it comes to state-run companies. There’s one reason why Laos’s nationalized companies are so indebted and it isn’t because they’re so well run. Électricité du Laos, the state utility, accounts for perhaps a third of all the state’s debts, for instance. That leaves only debt deferrals, which allow Vientiane to pay back other private creditors and facilitate future loans, all the while avoiding what it must eventually do: massively increase state revenue. According to the IMF, Laos needs a primary surplus of around 17 percent each year to bring its debt-to-GDP ratio down to a sustainable threshold (35 percent) by 2029. Next year, Laos will likely run a primary surplus of around 3 percent, per the IMF report. In other words, Vientiane needs to boost revenue or cut expenditure (or both) by more than five-fold. Austerity is unpopular But the ruling Lao People’s Revolutionary Party (LPRP) clearly doesn’t think now is the time to dig deeper into the pockets of ordinary people and businesses, especially as economic growth is set to slow in the coming years and the inflation crisis won’t be curbed anytime soon. It would be politically suicidal for Vientiane to considerably raise taxes while the ordinary Loatian has seen his wealth decimated in recent years. In fact, the party has recently committed to higher state spending. At first blush, Vientiane’s immobility might appear problematic for the current rulers of the communist party whose jobs are in the line ahead of a reshuffle at the National Congress in early 2026. That’s especially the case for Prime Minister Sonexay Siphandone, who naturally gets the most flak. Party grandees will retreat into conclaves most of next year to make these decisions, and appeasing China will be a key consideration. Yet, while the Lao public is incensed by just how appallingly their rulers have managed the economy, the powers that be understand no-one has any real idea of how to get out of this mess other than austerity during a devastating economic crisis. This isn’t something to be admitted publicly in a one-party state. Neither is admitting that the task of austerity is essentially being kicked to the next generation of party apparatchiks, who will have to suffer the consequences. George Orwell once remarked that 'it is a feeling of relief, almost of pleasure, at knowing yourself at last genuinely down and out…It takes off a lot of anxiety.' Likewise, the current LPRP leadership must feel a certain freedom from knowing that there’s only one way out of its predicament: Keep appeasing Beijing and keep up the debt deferrals.

Concentrated Markets And Iceless Fokkers – OpEd	He looked like a young, freshly sprouting Henry Kissinger, before complicity in war crimes coarsened him, and plagiarism became commonplace in allegedly relevant academic texts. The heavy-set flight attendant, his flabby covered jaw ever threatening to passengers, was apologetic, but firm in opinion. There would be no ice for anybody on this flight between the Queensland cities of Brisbane and Townsville. Tea, coffee, water, yes – ditchwater necessities for most who care nothing for them. And no, there was not even an option to purchase anything on this Fokker flight, thereby giving the passenger a thrilling chance to be fleeced. It was an odd sort of day in a country with one of the most concentrated and shabby of aviation markets. Flight cancellations have become standard practice. Delays are the order of the day. There being no scheme of mandatory compensation in Australia, airlines such as Qantas and Virgin can subject the disappointed customer to trench warfare and dragging attrition. Get on the phone and stay there for days. We might eventually hear your complaint, but don’t expect us to be addressing it, let alone providing you compensation. This betrays a broader, withering disease in markets of thick, undifferentiated concentration. Monopolies, duopolies, oligopolies, clot the marketplace and stifle any genuine notion of business engagement, let alone the provision of good, accountable service. A study by the e61 Institute found that all but one in 17 industry divisions in Australia as identified by the Australian Bureau of Statistics was more concentrated than their US counterparts. Between 2006 and 2020, Australia’s average CR4 measure of concentration – the share of the market controlled by the top four firms – rose by 3 percentage points. The trends are not encouraging for believers in the competitive ideal. In highly concentrated industries, the top four firms were rarely knocked off their perch between 2007 and 2021. As authors affiliated with the e61 Institute go on to note in The Conversation, industries seeing a rise in market concentration in seven years to 2014 saw a decline in the entry of new firms. 'This might mean we have as many as 6,300 fewer employing firms than we would have, giving Australian workers fewer employment options and suppressing real wage growth.' The idea of competition in this closed, claustrophobic system is feeble and disingenuous, though it is one happily trumpeted by those who benefit from it. From banking to the supermarkets, from insurance to journalism and aviation, we see the same patterns. This is a nation that specialises in a cohering nightmare of mergers, agglomeration, and amalgamation, consolidating the establishment rather than permitting fresh blood. When challenged about dominant market share, we can expect the response given to the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) by Woolworths chief executive Amanda Bardwell in November. When asked about the state of competition in the Australian supermarket sector, she suggested it was 'fiercely competitive.' While it was true to say that Woolworths had 'a substantial part of the market overall', it was 'dramatically changing and we compete every single day for customers to shop with us.' Such fantasists really ought to stay at home. The Australian market is also under policed and under supervised when it comes to trends in concentration, a matter aided by the tardiness of companies to notify the ACCC that mergers are taking place. And who can blame them, given that the regulatory body has a less than stern guideline, rather than enforceable undertaking, that merging entities notify the regulator when substitutes or complements are made. Even then, the soft measure only applies to instances when the merged corporation comes out with more than 20% of the market share. Companies have also found fiendish methods of limiting avenues of complaint regarding the quality of service. Consider, for instance, the liquor company Dan Murphy’s, a sharp outfit which claims to provide a wonderful service (when it does), and baulk at any suggestion that you contact personnel directly at the local outlet. In fact, phone numbers have been centralised to kill off any calls to a local branch, thereby eliminating any sense of what is actually happening at the store. Intimacy and access are shunned like bubonic plague, while customers are forced to an online service, steered by an infuriating, smug chat bot. 'We do not provide our customers with the direct contact numbers of any of our stores,' the company explains. 'If you want to check product prices and stock availability – they are all available on the website.' Another central tactic to mitigate or avoid nagging responsibility is to outsource it. Give it to someone else. To outsource is to cut off the chain of accountability – or at least mangle and knot it. It’s a scheme that has become the central strategy of governments, administrative and corporate entities the world over. The idea is certainly not a new one. The Catholic Church did this during the Inquisition with audacity, keeping the hands of their priests pure and physically clean while soiling the hands of their auxiliary torturers. The modern variation is much in the same vein. Pick couriers, agents, third parties and let them deliver advice or any product ranging from liquor and groceries to any assortment of mail. Blame them for being the pirates and privateers that they are. All the while, the main company can just keep raising prices. What a charming state of affairs to reflect upon this Christmas.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWc-sFHajH-XNtkJpq8uIFgM	2024-12-22T17:15:55-08:00	
Fresh Rohingya Influx Puts Bangladesh Under Pressure Amid Myanmar...	In the midst of intensifying clashes between Myanmar's junta government and Arakan Army rebels, Bangladesh has faced a new wave of Rohingya refugees, with around 60,000 crossing its borders over the past two months, according to a Bangladeshi official's statement on December 23, 2024. This influx has added further strain to the southeastern Cox's Bazar district, already sheltering over 1.2 million Rohingya who fled Myanmar, primarily during the military's brutal crackdown in August 2017. Growing Crisis at the Border The latest surge in Rohingya arrivals has brought to light the vulnerabilities and complexities of the Bangladesh-Myanmar border. Corruption has played a significant role, with reports indicating that individuals on both sides of the border facilitate illegal crossings in exchange for money. The porous nature of the border and the escalating violence in Myanmar's Rakhine state have created a humanitarian and political dilemma for Bangladesh. A Delicate Balancing Act Md. Touhid Hossain, the foreign affairs adviser for Bangladesh, shed light on the situation during a press briefing in Dhaka. Speaking after attending an informal consultation meeting in Bangkok on December 19, 2024, involving six countries—Laos, Thailand, India, China, Myanmar, and Bangladesh—Hossain described the country's stance on the ongoing influx. 'Our position in principle is not to allow any more Rohingya to enter. However, sometimes the situation becomes such that we have nothing more to do. In such a situation, we allowed 60,000 Rohingya to enter. It's not that we officially let them in; they entered through different routes,' he clarified. Regional Dynamics and Challenges The Bangkok meeting, chaired by Thai Foreign Minister Maris Sangiampongsa and attended by Myanmar's Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister U Than Swe, emphasized the necessity for Myanmar to address its internal conflicts. Hossain highlighted the collective appeal made by neighboring countries, urging Myanmar to resolve its issues through dialogue with all parties involved. Despite these calls, the reality on the ground presents significant hurdles. The Arakan Army has expanded its control over several regions in Myanmar's Rakhine state, including areas near the Bangladesh border. This development complicates the situation further, as formal negotiations with these non-state actors remain unlikely. A Border Beyond Control Hossain expressed concern over the deteriorating security conditions along the border. 'I told him (Than Swe) that the Myanmar border is not under your control. The border has come under the control of non-state actors. As a state, we cannot get involved with non-state actors. So, they (Myanmar government) have to see in what way to solve the border and Rohingya problems,' he recounted. The instability has left Bangladesh in a precarious position. While its official policy is to prevent further refugee influxes, the practicalities of managing an uncontrolled border amid ongoing violence make enforcement challenging. International Cooperation Needed Hossain underscored the importance of collaboration with the international community to prevent future waves of refugees. While he expressed hope that no further influxes would occur, he acknowledged the necessity of proactive measures. 'But we have to make arrangements to stop that wave, along with the international community,' he stated. The Bangkok meeting also revealed a grim consensus among regional stakeholders: Myanmar shows little sign of returning to stability under its current regime. Neighboring countries, including Bangladesh, are grappling with the ripple effects of Myanmar's internal conflicts, which extend beyond refugee crises to broader regional instability. A Prolonged Crisis with No Easy Solutions For Bangladesh, the ongoing Rohingya crisis represents not only a humanitarian challenge but also a significant strain on resources and diplomatic relations. The 2017 influx saw the arrival of nearly a million refugees, overwhelming local infrastructure and sparking international outcry. Efforts to repatriate the Rohingya to Myanmar have repeatedly stalled, with refugees expressing fears for their safety and a lack of guarantees for basic rights. The recent wave of arrivals, driven by escalating violence in Myanmar's Rakhine state, adds a new layer of urgency to the crisis. As the Arakan Army consolidates power in the region, the prospects for a peaceful resolution appear increasingly remote. Moving Forward Bangladesh finds itself at a crossroads, caught between its humanitarian obligations and the practicalities of managing a protracted refugee crisis. The government's stance, as articulated by Hossain, reflects this delicate balancing act. While the country cannot formally open its borders, it also cannot ignore the realities of those fleeing violence. The international community's role will be pivotal in addressing the root causes of the crisis. Pressure on Myanmar to engage in meaningful dialogue and resolve its internal conflicts is essential. Equally, support for Bangladesh in managing the immediate and long-term challenges posed by the Rohingya influx will be critical. As the situation unfolds, the resilience of both the Rohingya community and the host nation will be tested. With no clear resolution in sight, the need for a concerted, multi-faceted approach to the crisis has never been more apparent.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWc-sFHajH-XNjEwD5elZvzT	2024-12-22T17:12:44-08:00	
Russian Disinformation Machine In CAR Exposed	Central African journalist Ephrem Yalike-Ngonzo recalls the first time he was approached by a Russian man named Micha who offered him 200,000 CFA francs (about $320) per month to spread disinformation and propaganda for the Kremlin. The year was 2019, and the money was more than twice his salary as editor-in-chief of a local pro-government news website called Le Potentiel Centrafricain. 'In the Central African media, few people earn more than 150,000 CFA francs (about $240),' Yalike told Radio France Internationale. Yalike exposed Russia’s sprawling disinformation operation in the Central African Republic (CAR) as part of a two-year investigation by Forbidden Stories, a group of investigative journalists who teamed with 10 media partners, including French newspaper Le Monde and RFI. 'It is important for me to share this story so that justice can be done,' he told The Associated Press for a November 21 article. 'To denounce the disrespect of human rights, and to expose the disinformation system which can be replicated in other countries.' Forbidden Stories identified 'Micha' as Mikhail Mikhailovitch Prudnikov, a Russian agent with close ties to the infamous Wagner Group mercenaries. For three years Yalike wrote stories praising the Russian mercenaries and the CAR military government. He quit working at Le Potentiel in early 2020 when Prudnikov hired him to lead Wagner’s relations with the local media for 500,000 CFA francs (more than $800) a month. He was given 30 smartphones, which he distributed to young people who were chosen as influencers on social media platforms to share, comment on and 'like' Wagner’s fake news. Yalike and Prudnikov met regularly at the Roux military camp, Wagner’s headquarters in the capital, Bangui, to coordinate an extensive, systematic disinformation machine. Prudnikov paid him at different places: the base, a hotel in the city or at Radio Lengo Songo, a radio station created and funded by Wagner. Yalike said Prudnikov also gave him money to distribute to other local writers whose assignments he coordinated. He paid editors to place the fake news stories and paid radio station managers to feature 'experts' who also were paid to share their pro-Russian opinions. Yalike organized demonstrations meant to appear as though the Central African people were opposed to France, the United Nations and the West. At Wagner’s base he saw Russians use a printing press to make posters and banners for demonstrations that they financed. 'These demonstrations have never emanated from the will of the people,' he told RFI. 'They are always orchestrated. I gave the money to one of the leaders so that he could redistribute it. It’s 2,000 francs per young person, normally. During these demonstrations, I am also supposed to invite local media to come and cover this and relay it. To each media, I give 10,000 francs.' Among his responsibilities, Yalike also worked to suppress criticism of the government. In time, he became disillusioned with the work and had a change of heart. 'I realized it was against my conscience,' he told the AP. 'This was not journalism. … They were pushing me: You should do this, you should write about this.' Hired in 2018 to protect and prop up the regime of Faustin-Archange Touadéra, Wagner mercenaries have faced credible accusations of war crimes, atrocities and human rights abuses against Central African civilians. Wagner has taken advantage of CAR’s fragile institutions and army to develop 'a blueprint for state capture,' according to a report by investigative watchdog The Sentry. Wagner mercenaries train the army on torture tactics, including cutting off hands, removing fingernails and burning people alive, according to the report. Yalike was told to cover up abuses and atrocities committed by Wagner fighters. By then, he wanted to quit but was afraid of his Russian handlers. 'It all started with the tragic fate reserved for five Wagner tanker truck drivers accused of fuel theft and violently tortured in Ndachima before being transferred and incarcerated in the Roux camp prison for almost a year,' publisher Alain Nzilo wrote in an article on his website, Corbeau News, on March 5, 2024. Military sources told Corbeau that Wagner suspected Yalike had committed treason by leaking details of the Ndachima story. 'They accused me of writing it,' he told the AP. 'There were a lot of hidden threats. … I was scared for my life.' Yalike decided to flee his homeland after Prudnikov took him outside of Bangui, questioned him at gunpoint and threatened his life. In early 2024, Yalike managed to get his wife and child out before crossing into a neighboring country and leaving the continent for good. 'When you get into this system, it’s hard to get out,' he told RFI. Other journalists in the CAR continue to work for the Russians, but Nzilo emphasizes Yalike’s story as a cautionary tale. 'This series of tragedies highlights the dangers that await those who venture to work for Wagner,' he wrote. Now safely abroad, Yalike said he feels shame and regret but is heartened by his belief that Russian propaganda has failed in its most basic objective. 'People do not have a positive view of the Russians,' he told the AP. 'But everyone is afraid to say so.'	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWc-sFHajH-XNmCV0R3T3VfU	2024-12-22T17:10:32-08:00	
Trump’s Game, China’s Move – OpEd	The Trump White House is likely to ignite another round of inflation in new trade and tech wars. And that could drive US-China ties to the edge. Who do I call when I want to talk to Europe? Kissinger once quipped highlighting the internal divides of the old continent. Today, he’d have a similar problem calling America. In recent weeks, President Biden has yielded spotlight to Trump who has talked with foreign leaders like President Macron and Ukraine's Zelensky, while commenting on Syrian turmoil before Biden. After Trump's meetings with Canadian PM Justin Trudeau and Mexico’s president, Claudia Sheinbaum, trade and immigration policy are already out of Biden's hands. Since 2021 Biden has missed the opportunity to reset Trump's policies. Now he could have used the transition period to warn Americans of the impending Trump’s revolution, whick risks disrupting domestic politics and US-China ties. Trump’s triple inflation risks If the 2021-23 inflation surge in America killed Biden's second term by instigating widespread voter frustration, Trump’s economic agenda is likely to pose a triple threat to U.S. price stability. The expected broad tax cuts will compound the already-huge federal deficits and debt, thereby exacerbating inflation. The possible effort to reduce the independence of the Federal Reserve would further foster inflation. The second likely source of inflation would be the Trump’s pledge to initiate the 'massive' deportation process, alongside other restrictive immigration policies. Not only would that effort divide Americans, reinforce xenophobia and white nationalism, it would likely disrupt U.S. labor markets, which rely on foreign-born workers, particularly in construction, agriculture and hospitality. Additionally, such policies would encourage another ugly wave of anti-Asian sentiment that America witnessed in the Trump era and Biden’s protectionism has continued to inflame. It would undermine Chinese immigrant talent in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM). Darkly reminiscent of the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882, America First translates to deporting the Chinese first. The Trump White House needs to scapegoat an 'enemy' for its policy failures. Third, Trump seeks to integrate the barely-regulated cryptocurrencies into America’s financial and fiscal systems thus opening the henhouse to crypto-foxes. It is a self-interested policy of the Trump oligarchs. The unregulated crypto-sphere, if fully executed, could cause high volatility in the financial markets. By potentially facilitating illicit activities such as money laundering, dark financing and diminishing the Fed’s influence over the economy, it could disrupt the dollar hegemony in the world economy. Hence, too, the president-elect’s recent threat of 100% tariff on BRICS countries if they pursue creating new currency. In reality, the 34-country bloc is more interested in trading with their own local currencies than a bloc-wide currency. But Trump's economic coercion is a taste of things to come. Trade and technology wars Since American hegemony can no longer rely on US dominance in the increasingly multipolar world economy, Washington relies increasingly on trade wars, sanctions and geopolitics to retain that supremacy. If the triple inflation threat associated with the Trump White House will materialize, the Fed will slow its rate cuts or return to tightening. That will push up the dollar, which could destabilize international currencies, including the Chinese yuan. When trade tensions take off, economic uncertainty and market volatility will increase worldwide, including Chinese stock market. As investors’ risk appetite decreases, markets face downward pressures. The Trump administration will exploit sanctions to decouple bilateral high-tech ties with China, especially by targeting semiconductors, artificial intelligence, quantum technology, possibly advanced manufacturing and biotech. Such measures increase costs in high-tech over time but won’t immediately affect daily living costs in the US. Hence the attractiveness of such measures to Trump’s trade authorities, including the new trade representative Jamieson Greer, a protégé of ex-trade czar Robert Lighthizer. Greer used to represent US Steel in a lawsuit against China. Rewarded for his loyalty in the Capitol attack four years ago, the Sinophobic Peter Navarro will be Trump's new senior counselor for trade and manufacturing. Although the tough-and-rough Lighthizer managed to sell tariffs to Wall Street during the Trump’s first administration, he has now been played out. Treasury Secretary pick Scott Bessent, Commerce Secretary selection Howard Lutnick and Kevin Hassett, the new head of the National Economic Council, are all seen as business-friendly establishment figures. But each supports tariff and tech wars as well. Unlike Lighthizer who saw tariffs as across-the-board duties to resolve America's chronic trade deficits, the Wall Streeters are more likely to use tariffs 'strategically' on certain products and as a cudgel to coerce other nations to accede to Trump’s demands. China’s counter-measures As demonstrated by the just concluded Central Economic Work Conference, China has been preparing for Trump’s trade wars. Among priorities for economic policy in 2025, policymakers emphasize the need to maintain stable growth, employment and commodity prices, through steps like higher deficit-to-GDP ratios, rate cuts and the issuance of ultra-long-term special treasury bonds. During the first Trump administration, China was the primary tariff target. Now Trump says he will enact a 25% tariff on all imports from Canada and Mexico on his first day in office, and raise tariffs on goods from China by 10%. He has advocated 60-100% tariffs on imports from China and 10-20% tariffs on imports from all other countries, including allies. The 'spread effect' could dilute some of the adverse impact on China. Moreover, like seven years ago, US importers have been busy trying to frontload their China purchases to reduce the impact of the impending tariffs. The proposed tariff effect is thus more likely to materialize in 2025-26. Second, Chinese economy has changed. In 2017, it was more reliant on US as an export destination. For two decades, China was the top exporter of goods into the US and even in 2022 bilateral trade was still at a record high. Now Mexico has overtaken China’s role. Today, the US attracts less than 15% of Chinese exports, whereas ASEAN and the EU account over 16% and less than 15%, respectively. The EU will seek to emulate the US tariffs, but prefers targeted rather than across-the-board tariffs. Third, China was more dependent on exports in 2017. Today, China is world-class science leader and benefits from more diversified innovation. I am currently touring in Guangdong's Greater Bay Area. In the 'Chinese Silicon Valley,' research and development (R&D) as of GDP is over 2.4%; higher than in France. In Shenzhen, it is over 6.5%; more than in any country. True, China is still developing manufacturing processes for advanced semiconductors; a key target of US export controls. But now it is leading in electric vehicles, automotive software and lithium battery technology. Moreover, China’s LNG shipbuilding and high-speed rail industries are on track to hit targets. It produces the world’s most efficient and lowest-cost solar panels, along with innovative drugs. Hardball or dialogue Recently, the Politburo, China’s top decision-making body, opted to respond more actively to economic downturns, boost demand and stabilize the housing market. Fiscal easing is augmented by 'moderately loose' monetary policy next year. The decision to foster 'unconventional' counter-cyclical adjustments is the greatest policy shift since 2008. However, China too can play the tit-for-tat trade games, even if reluctantly. On Dec. 2, Washington added more than 100 Chinese companies to a restricted trade list and banned the sale to China of some of the fastest semiconductors and the equipment to make them. China responded by banning US exports of rare minerals - gallium, germanium, and antimony - and other items. It was the first time China included a broad ban on so-called transshipment in a government regulation on exports. US sources estimate the likely total cost from disruptions to supplies of gallium and germanium alone at over $3 billion. Moreover, Beijing has begun an antimonopoly investigation into Nvidia, the US giant dominating the world market for the advanced chips needed for AI. Does this mean China has opted for those geopolitical divides in the global economy that Trump and Biden have supported in the past seven years? No. It is a signal to the incoming Trump administration that unilateralism has no future in a multipolar global economy. It is still a move to begin dialogue - unless the Trump White House chooses otherwise.

China’s Chance To Step Up, With The Void On Climate Change That’s...	By EAF editors Achieving net zero carbon emissions globally was never going to be easy. It’s been made that much harder and more costly by US President-elect Donald Trump’s promises to withdraw from the Paris Agreement, ramp up US production of carbon fuels and cut American access to low-cost renewable goods and inputs to renewable energy production even further through imposts on foreign trade. The task of cutting emissions requires reducing the carbon footprint in consumption (for example, via increased use of electric vehicles) as well as in inputs into production (via the sourcing of electricity, the processing of metals and materials manufacture). Improving energy efficiency is a high priority in reducing the costs of decarbonisation and is best achieved through international trade in the whole range of consumer and producer goods and inputs (such as electric vehicles, solar panels, wind turbines, processed lithium, iron and other minerals) that are necessary to achieve it. Using the strong complementarity in the new energy goods production and supply chains between China and other economies around the world is thus crucial to reducing the costs of the global energy transition. The energy transition requires a massive transformation in production and consumption around the world over the next few decades. At the heart of that is the electrification of industrial economies with renewable power. This industrial transformation will need vastly improved access to climate finance, ensuring both that existing funds are properly allocated and that they are utilised in a way that does not undermine climate goals. The global climate finance landscape is growing rapidly, with large amounts of financing now coming from China, but funding amounts are still insufficient to fulfil the Paris Agreement objectives. There’s a huge gap estimated at US$5 trillion annually in both public and private sustainable financing over the coming decades. Investment incentives need to align with climate goals. The efficacy of financial markets can be strengthened by harmonising sustainable finance taxonomies across jurisdictions and improving corporate disclosures and data sharing. China and the European Union have worked together on green finance definitions, publishing the Common Ground Taxonomy Table. Singapore has now signed on to an extension of this arrangement, the Multi-Jurisdiction Common Ground Taxonomy. In this week’s lead article, noting the failure of COP29 to fill the public sustainable finance gap, Yiping Huang proposes that China initiate a Green Marshall Plan to step into the breach, elevating its contribution to investment in a zero carbon future and creating a facility for delivering its new energy technologies to the developing world. ‘China has emerged as an industry leader in the green energy sector over the past few decades, especially in the production of electric vehicles, lithium batteries, wind turbines and solar panels,’ Huang notes. China is also an acknowledged leader in green development. Its vast supplies and low cost of green energy products are valuable resources for the world’s energy transition. ‘Just like the United States’ Marshall Plan after the Second World War, China can help green development in the Global South by providing both technological assistance and financial support’, he suggests. The proposed Green Marshall Plan is designed to achieve two immediate goals. The first is to facilitate the developing world’s energy transition, says Huang. While developed nations currently lack both the willingness and capability to lead global green development, China has advanced technology and vast production capacity that can help. The second is to stabilise China’s domestic economy. The United States and European Union are raising barriers against Chinese green energy products entering their markets. This could exacerbate China’s domestic overcapacity problem and weaken economic growth if China does not find new markets for its green energy products. A Chinese Green Marshall Plan initiative could be helpful on two counts: it would add to the pool of funds for green investment in the developing world; properly conceived and carefully executed, it would also help to push back against the intensification of American protectionism and additional costs it imposes upon energy transition, at least beyond those to the United States itself. To succeed, in the latter purpose in particular however, it would have to be grounded in a multilateral endeavour with sign-on from other partners, like Europe, in its execution, and be facilitated with the help of multilateral financial institutions such as the International Monetary Fund. Funding under a program of the kind that Huang envisions would be a hybrid package consisting of commercial investment, policy lending and government aid. It would also have to be commercially viable — the increasingly low-cost green energy products produced by China make this a goal that is achievable. In addition to aid provided by governments, especially those of developed nations, national policy banks and multinational institutions would provide low-interest long-term lending to countries in the developing world. It would need to facilitate market-based investment to support the energy transition. All this requires a framework of international arrangements and agreed-upon standards that the multilateral institutions are best placed to facilitate. A China-backed Green Marshall Plan could play a valuable role not only in supporting global green development and stabilising Chinese economic growth. It could also serve as a pillar around which to re-group the multilateral trade and investment regime.

Iceland Fets New Government Under Social Democrat Frostadottir	Iceland's president presented a new government on Saturday under Social Democratic Prime Minister Kristrun Frostadottir that aims to cut inflation and interest rates and hold a referendum on European Union membership by 2027, public broadcaster RUV said. Frostadottir's centre-left Social Democratic Alliance became the biggest party in a snap election on 30 November, and has agreed to form a coalition government with the centrist People's Party and the left-leaning, pro-European Reform Party, RUV said. Thorgerdur Katrin Gunnarsdottir, leader of the Reform Party, will be minister of foreign affairs, it added. It will be the first time in Iceland that the leaders of all the governing parties will be women, and the first time that the country will have a female prime minister and a female president - Halla Tomasdottir - simultaneously, the broadcaster said. A live stream from RUV showed the leaders of the three coalition parties hugging after they signed an agreement on forming a government. Frostadottir, 36, will be the youngest prime minister in Icelandic history, RUV said. The new coalition replaces a government by Bjarni Benediktsson's conservative Independence Party which came second in the election, called after coalition disagreements and public discontent over migration and energy and housing issues. The new government plans to focus on bringing down inflation and interest rates, and aims to reduce the number of ministries by one in order to cut administrative costs, RUV reported, opens new tab on Saturday, citing Frostadottir. It also plans to formulate a parliamentary resolution to put the question of EU membership to a referendum, which the governing parties said they hope will take place no later than 2027, according to RUV. The new government also intends to set up a panel of independent experts to assess the advantages and disadvantages of retaining the Icelandic crown compared to adopting the Euro currency.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWc-sFHajH-XNvGq557nSkSv	2024-12-22T16:59:57-08:00	
Iran’s Supreme Leader Calls On Syrians To Resist Rebel Government	(RFE/RL) -- The supreme leader of Iran, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, has called on Syrians to resist the emerging rebel-led government after the ouster of former President Bashar al-Assad, saying the uprising was orchestrated by the West. Speaking in an address on December 22, Khamenei said Syrians, especially the country's youth, 'should stand with strong will against those who designed and those who implemented the insecurity.' Assad left the country in the late hours of December 8 after the U.S.-designated terrorist organization Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) and its allies -- some of whom are linked with Turkey -- overran government forces in a blitz offensive. While Assad was granted political asylum in Russia by President Vladimir Putin after more than five decades of iron-fisted rule by his family, the HTS has since moved quickly to establish an interim government, and its leader, Riad al-Asaad, has said he is confident the factions that helped topple Assad will unite as one force.HTS and the transitional government have insisted the rights of all Syrians will be protected, but Khamenei said he believes a group aligned with the Islamic republic's government would end up prevailing in Syria. However, Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan met with Syria's de facto leader Ahmed al-Sharaa in Damascus on December 22. Details of the meeting were not immediately released, but Turkey has long been seen as a backer of HTS as it looked to remove Assad. The toppling of Assad was seen by many as another blow to Tehran, which has seen regional groups aligned with it -- parts of the so-called axis of resistance -- suffer major setbacks in the past 14 months.Hamas, designated a terrorist organization by the United States and the European Union, has been decimated by Israel, which launched a war against the group in the Gaza Strip and Hamas fighters in October 2023 crossed into Israel and killed 1,200 people while taking another 250 hostage.That conflict spread to Lebanon, home of the Tehran-backed Hezbollah, a militant group and political party that controls much of southern Lebanon. Hezbollah is designated as a terrorist organization by the United States, while the EU blacklists its armed wing but not its political party. Hezbollah’s political party has seats in the Lebanese parliament.Israel has severely weakened Hezbollah -- killing its longtime leader and many of its top officials -- after the group launched attacks on Israel that it said was in support of Hamas. A U.S.-brokered deal to end hostilities in Lebanon took effect last month.Khamenei downplayed the links to Iran, saying they have fought against Israel on their own beliefs.'They keep saying that the Islamic republic lost its proxy forces in the region. This is another mistake. The Islamic republic does not have a proxy forces,' he said.'If one day we plan to take action, we do not need proxy force,' he added.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWc-sFHajH-XNki0K6ZcnzXi	2024-12-22T16:56:55-08:00	
Lebanon Should Not Be A Security Threat For The New Syria – OpEd	By Dr. Dania Koleilat Khatib Lebanese social media was busy last week discussing the presence of figures from the former Syrian regime in Lebanon. While the Lebanese authorities deny any such connections, the corrupt Lebanese system had strong relations with the Assad regime for decades. The two security apparatuses were intertwined.However, Lebanon needs a clear break from Assad’s regime to build healthy and fruitful relations with the new Syria.Ali Mamlouk, the notorious Assad chief spy, is known to have reached Iraq via Beirut — he left Lebanon from Beirut airport.The Lebanese government could have been excused from responsibility for his presence in Lebanon. His arrival in Lebanon could have been explained due to an illegal crossing, hence without the knowledge or approval of the Lebanese state.Nevertheless, he left the country via the airport. The Lebanese state cannot claim it did not know. It did know. Lebanese Interior Minister Bassam Mawlawi denied that Mamlouk had entered the country. However, several witnesses spotted Mamlouk in a five-star hotel in Beirut.The story gets even darker. Aside from the many crimes he committed in Syria, Mamlouk was under a death sentence in Lebanon. He was found guilty by the Lebanese judiciary of blowing up two mosques in the northern part of the country: the Taqwa Mosque and the Al-Salam Mosque. How was he able to leave the country and pass through passport control? The answer is simple — he could not have left the country unless he had connections with the Lebanese state.Syrian media has said that several figures close to the ousted regime entered Lebanon on the day Assad fled the country. They also reported that the former security chief, Abbas Ibrahim, facilitated this by replacing an officer at the Lebanese-Syrian crossing.The day that Assad left the country, all the important regime figures also disappeared. This is a big problem for the new system in Syria. They know that officers of the former regime will create problems. Those who have the blood of the Syrian people on their hands know that if they are caught, they will be prosecuted. Chances are they will go underground and conduct operations to destabilize the new Syria. They do not want to see a stable and prosperous Syria. To conduct destructive operations, they need support from their friends. Already they have started such activities. A group of men vandalized a church in Mahardah, a Christian town in Hama. They pretended to belong to the new authorities, but when caught it turned out that they belonged to the former regime and were seeking to create sectarian tensions.The Assad regime has no better friend than the corrupt configuration in Lebanon. After the Taif agreement, the Assad regime was able to exert influence in Lebanon. This is the period that the Lebanese despise and call the period of Syrian 'tutelage.' Prime Minister Rafik Hariri tried to break the control of the Assad regime — he was quietly working to secure the withdrawal of Assad forces from Lebanon. It did not end well for him; he was assassinated on Feb. 14, 2005. Afterwards, due to international pressure and mass protests, Assad forces left the country. But though the soldiers and the tanks left, the Lebanese security apparatus remained hostage to the criminal regime.The Assad regime also has political allies in Lebanon — Hezbollah, Amal and the Free Patriotic Movement — as well as several less significant political personalities such as the Druze politicians Wiam Wahhab and Talal Arslan. Figures in the Hezbollah circle, such as the infamous journalist Hussein Murtada, who filmed himself with the Assad airforce as they dropped barrel bombs on civilians, has said that Syria will experience problems and fighting. Is that an analysis, wishful thinking, or a threat?The Lebanese state and Lebanese people should make sure that Hezbollah or other figures do not offer any help to the remnants of the regime. Strict laws and enforcement should be applied. This is imperative if Lebanon is to have a good start with the new free Syria. Lebanon should support Syria’s transition to a free, democratic, and prosperous system. It should not create a security threat to the new Syria.The new Syrian authorities face massive challenges. Assad left behind a decimated country that has no source of income. Assad relied on extortion, the Captagon trade, and donations from Iran. Israel has destroyed the capabilities of the army and Syria has little ability to secure its borders. In addition to the current challenges, the last thing the country needs is interference from remnants of the former regime.The Lebanese complained about the coercive relations with Syria during Assad’s rule. Now they are hoping to have friendly relations based on mutual respect and common interests. They expect the new regime in Syria to treat Lebanon like a sovereign, not vassal, state. If they want this type of relationship, they need to make sure that Lebanon does not constitute a security threat to Syria. They have to make sure that Lebanon and Lebanese figures do not offer any help to the remnants of the regime. If they do not, they will be inviting the new regime in Syria to interfere in their affairs. Dr. Dania Koleilat Khatib is a specialist in US-Arab relations with a focus on lobbying.

Gaza: Ground Zero Of Hunger In the Age Of Weaponized War – OpEd	In Gaza, the silence of desperation rivals the thunder of conflict. The siege gripping this small strip of land has turned starvation into a precise weapon, wielded to crush not just resistance but the human spirit. This isn’t mere collateral damage; it’s a deliberate strategy in the evolving playbook of modern warfare. As conflicts from Gaza to Sudan and Ukraine reveal, the use of starvation as a tool of war has become a grim hallmark of contemporary violence, leaving a legacy of devastation that challenges our collective humanity. The numbers are staggering: by the start of 2022, the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) estimated that over 377,000 deaths had occurred across these war-torn regions. The stark reality? Sixty percent of these were due not to direct violence but to hunger, lack of healthcare, and unsafe water. The Lancet journal corroborates this, highlighting the catastrophic toll that deliberate deprivation has taken in Gaza, Sudan, and Ukraine. It’s a death toll born of systemic neglect, orchestrated blockades, and the silent weaponization of basic human needs. Starvation as Strategy In Gaza, the ravages of war are etched in the barren landscapes where orchards once thrived and irrigation systems once flowed. The deliberate destruction of agricultural assets and water reservoirs is not an accident of war but its strategy. Citrus groves that once nourished families now lie in heaps of dust, their lifelines severed by calculated bulldozers and airstrikes. Satellite imagery confirms the decimation: fields razed, reservoirs emptied, and a once-vibrant agrarian economy rendered lifeless. This is not a localized tragedy; it’s part of a global pattern. In Sudan, entire communities are cut off from food supplies as warring factions weaponize starvation to subjugate populations. In Ukraine, targeted attacks on food systems and infrastructure threaten millions with hunger, as blockades and strikes choke the flow of sustenance. The use of starvation as a tool of war undermines not just the lives of individuals but the very foundations of civilization. The Legal and Moral Abyss Starvation as a weapon is outlawed under international humanitarian law, enshrined in the Geneva Conventions and reinforced by customary international norms. Article 54 of the First Additional Protocol and Article 14 of the Second Additional Protocol explicitly forbid depriving civilians of food and water. Yet, these principles falter when met with the realities of geopolitics. In Gaza, the situation underscores the legal void that emerges when enforcement mechanisms fail. Statements like Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant’s chilling declaration—'No electricity, no food, no water, no fuel'—lay bare the intent behind the siege. National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir and Energy Minister Israel Katz have echoed similar sentiments, revealing an unflinching strategy to deprive Gaza’s population of basic necessities. These pronouncements, paired with systematic destruction and the obstruction of aid, expose the stark violation of international norms. In Sudan, blockades have transformed humanitarian corridors into battlegrounds, while in Ukraine, strikes on grain silos disrupt the global food supply, rippling through economies far beyond the frontlines. Accountability mechanisms, however robust on paper, are only meaningful when enforced. The international community’s inertia in holding violators accountable has created a vacuum where the rule of law collapses into the abyss of impunity. The Human Cost Behind the statistics lies a harrowing human toll. In Gaza, families huddle in the ruins of their homes, their empty cupboards echoing their despair. A father watches helplessly as his child withers from malnutrition, while a mother scours rubble for morsels of food. These stories are mirrored in Sudan, where famine casts its long shadow over displaced populations, and in Ukraine, where the deliberate targeting of infrastructure leaves millions vulnerable to hunger and disease. The psychological scars of starvation are equally profound. It is a weapon that erodes not just the body but the spirit, leaving entire generations stunted, both physically and cognitively. For children, the impact is especially acute: malnutrition robs them of their future, embedding a legacy of poverty and despair that transcends the immediate crisis. The haunting question remains: how can the world allow this silent genocide to persist? Lessons from History Starvation as a tactic is not new. The siege of Leningrad during World War II, the deliberate famines in Biafra, and the devastating blockades in Yemen all underscore the enduring cruelty of this method. Each instance left an indelible scar on human history, a reminder of the depths to which conflict can sink. Yet the resurgence of this tactic in Gaza, Sudan, and Ukraine signals an alarming normalization. The consequences extend far beyond these regions. Allowing starvation warfare to proceed unchecked risks creating a dangerous precedent, signalling to the world that such tactics can be employed with impunity. It’s a slippery slope that threatens to unravel the fragile fabric of international humanitarian norms. The Politics of Aid In Gaza, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s conditional acceptance of limited aid under external pressure reveals the calculated politicking behind humanitarian relief. Selectively allowing aid serves as a pressure valve to temper international criticism while maintaining the stranglehold on Gaza’s population. Aid agencies face monumental challenges, their convoys delayed or denied, their supplies woefully insufficient to meet the overwhelming need. This dynamic is mirrored in Sudan, where warring factions manipulate aid for leverage, and in Ukraine, where disrupted supply chains leave millions dependent on sporadic relief. The politicization of aid transforms humanitarian assistance into a weapon, trapping vulnerable populations in a cycle of deprivation and dependency. A Call to Action The world cannot afford to look away. Independent investigations into the deliberate destruction of food systems and the obstruction of aid are urgently needed. Accountability must be more than a buzzword; it must translate into action that holds perpetrators responsible. The international community must bolster mechanisms to enforce humanitarian law, ensuring that those who weaponize starvation face justice. But beyond legal frameworks, there is a moral imperative to act. The stories emerging from Gaza, Sudan, and Ukraine are not just tragedies; they are a call to arms for humanity. The global community must prioritize the human cost of conflict over political calculations. Behind every policy decision, every airstrike, and every blockade lies a human life irrevocably altered. The first step on the road to meaningful change lies in acknowledging this fundamental truth. A Test of Conscience The use of starvation as a weapon is not just a humanitarian crisis; it’s a moral litmus test for our time. Allowing it to persist undermines the very principles that bind nations together: the universality of human rights and the rule of law. If the international community fails to act, it risks eroding its own credibility, allowing the world’s conscience to wither alongside those it fails to protect. The numbers speak of devastation, but they cannot convey the full measure of suffering. For every statistic, there is a story—a mother, a child, a community—that demands justice. The global response must be resolute, not just to address the immediate crisis but to reaffirm the principles of humanity itself. In the face of such darkness, action is the only antidote. The stories of Gaza, Sudan, and Ukraine are harrowing, but they are also a plea—a reminder that the world’s capacity for compassion and justice must not be starved. For in responding to their plight, we do not just save lives; we save the soul of humanity itself.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWc-sFHajH-XNiYLRV9rXSzy	2024-12-22T16:38:04-08:00	
Religious Calendars And New Year Traditions In Turkey – OpEd	Orthodox Christians traditionally exchange gifts on St. Nicholas Day (19 December) or during the New Year celebrations. While they use the Gregorian calendar in daily life, their religious observances follow the Julian calendar. Throughout history, the timing of New Year celebrations has varied across cultures. Ancient Armenians marked the New Year on 21 March, during the spring equinox, in the month of Areg—the first month of the Armenian calendar. Today, New Year's Day is celebrated on 1 January. In contrast, the Jewish calendar observes Rosh Hashanah, which begins at sunset and falls on the evening of 29 September. In the Christian world, calendar differences influence the dates of religious holidays. Christians who follow the Gregorian calendar celebrate Epiphany on 6 January, whereas those adhering to the Julian calendar observe it on 19 January. On Büyükada, Prince islands in Turkey, Christmas celebrations are limited to the San Pasifico Latin Church. Protestants and members of other denominations often avoid entering Catholic churches, possibly due to a fear of being influenced by the grandeur of the interiors. However, as secular Turks, we have no such concerns. We light candles, open our hands in prayer, and wish for the well-being of our loved ones according to our own beliefs. Christmas in the Shadow of Lights Last night's pre-Christmas service at St. Anthony's Church in Beyoğlu was captivating. Arabic Christmas hymns played inside, and just last week, İstiklal Avenue was vibrant with colourful festive lights, creating an uplifting atmosphere. However, this week, for reasons dictated by an unknown political decision, the street decorations were abruptly removed, dampening the festive mood. In contrast, areas like Kadıköy Market, Bahariye, Caddebostan, Bağdat Avenue, Kartal, and Pendik remain adorned with sparkling street decorations.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWc-sFHajH-XNj7gsD9-0jB4	2024-12-22T16:35:55-08:00	
Counting 100 Blessings Daily Enriches Your Life – OpEd	Psalm 100:4 says: 'Enter his gates with thanksgiving and his courts with praise; give thanks to him and praise his name.' And Ecclesiastes 3:12-13 says: 'I know that there is nothing better for people than to be happy and to do good while they live. That each of them may eat and drink, and find satisfaction in all their work—this is the gift of God.' A daily counting our blessings is an age-old religious advice that actually does help improve our mood and mindset. One reason that the blessings strategy works is because it begins to counter the hard-wired tendency we have as humans to notice and remember the negative rather than the positive. There's a strong evolutionary reason why we think this way: it's vital for our survival. So, we hardly notice if a cat is following us up the street, but if it was a lion we certainly would. Our brains are primed for danger in order to keep us safe. Which is good, except that in a world of constant news of war, suffering, hatred and division – all of which we can instantly access on our phones – this negativity bias can overwhelm us with unneeded negative worries and anxiety. One way of influencing people to think positively about their lives is to teach them the importance of saying blessings for the many things they experience, both in their ordinary daily and weekly life, and at occasional extraordinary times. It is a Mitsvah (Jewish religious duty) to say blessings at every meal over food and drink. Every morning when we awake it is a Mitsvah to say several blessings because various parts of our mind and body still work. During daily prayer there are 18 blessings, and there are blessings for the weekly celebration of the Sabbath. There are also blessings to say for special occasions for our sages who urged us to thank God for as many blessings as we can, since the more blessings you can say, the more blessed you are. Indeed, Jewish tradition maintains that everyone who is able to say 100 blessings a day is truly blessed. Among the special occasion blessings there is a blessing for seeing a non-Jewish sage and another one for seeing a Jewish sage. There is a blessing for hearing good news and another one for hearing bad news in accordance with Rabbi Huna's view that we need both joy and suffering to experience 'very good'. Here are a few examples of blessings for special occasions: On beholding fragrant trees:Praised be Adonai our God, Ruler of space and time, creator of fragrant trees. On seeing trees in blossom:Praised be Adonai our God, Ruler of space and time, whose world lacks nothing we need, who has fashioned good creatures and lovely trees that enchant the heart. On seeing an unusual looking person:Praised be Adonai our God, Ruler of space and time, who makes every person unique. On the Divine value of pluralism and human variety when seeing a large number of people:Praised be Adonai our God, Ruler of space and time, the Sage of esoterica, for just as no person's opinion is like that of another, so their faces are different from one another. On seeing evidence of charitable efforts:Praised be Adonai our God, ruler of space and time, who clothes the naked. On seeing people who overcome adversity:Praised be Adonai our God, ruler of space and time, who gives strength to the weary. Understanding that suffering, sorrow and even death do not nullify the basic goodness of the world God has created, and training oneself to see all the blessings that surround us, are two of the many ways the Torah tradition in Judaism teaches Jews to have a positive and optimistic view of both the natural world and the human world we live in. But although individuals can train themselves to make their lives joyful and holy, some would say that civilization has corrupted the world of nature with sin, lust, greed, violence and immorality. It is true that prior to the creation of self conscious moral creatures the world was free of evil. However, the world also lacked good for there were no creatures who could choose to do good and not evil. (Angels in Jewish thought have no free will and are thus inferior to humans.) It is possible to think of nature as always pure and modern civilization as always a corrupting influence. Indeed, this seems to be a popular view among many western ecology activists. An important Jewish teaching concerns the outcome of human history. Most ancient philosophies saw human history as cyclical. Others saw the cycle as a declining one, with each age followed by a more degenerate one. The present age was often dire and getting worse. The Prophets of Israel (from the 10th century to the 5th century B.C.E.), especially Isaiah, introduced God's assurance of a Messianic Age to come when all nations will achieve international peace, prosperity and justice. How can people, especially Jews, believe in a Messianic Age after all the world went through in the 20th century? It is true that human society changed more rapidly, violently and fundamentally in the last century than ever before in history. Doctors saved the lives of millions. Dictators sacrificed the lives of millions. Populations exploded and birthrates declined. Technology produced both worldwide prosperity and pollution at the same time. Knowing all this, how can we look upon the future with optimistic hope? Are the world and our society heading towards a wonder-filled new age, or toward a doomsday; or are both occurring concurrently because breakdown is always a prelude to breakthrough? Many who believe in the Biblical vision of a Messianic Age use the insights of the Prophets of Israel to provide guidance in understanding the social, economic, scientific and cultural upheavals sweeping society. Usually it is the dramatic dangers of the pre-Messianic tribulation that are emphasized. I will focus on some positive signs developing throughout the world that accord with a positive messianic vision of the Jewish Prophets.In most religious traditions, redemption is defined in terms of individual enlightenment or personal salvation. However, the Prophets of Israel conceived redemption as a transformation of human society that would occur through the catalyst of the transformation of the Jewish community. This transformation, which will take place in this world at some future time, is called the Messianic Age.The transition to the Messianic Age is called the birth pangs of the Messiah. The birth of a redeemed messianic world may be the result of an easy or difficult labor. If everyone would simply live according to the moral teachings of his or her religious tradition, we would ourselves bring about the Messianic Age. But, if we will not do it voluntarily, it will come through social and political upheavals, worldwide conflicts and generation gaps. The Messiah refers to an agent of God who helps bring about this transformation. The Jewish tradition teaches that this agent of God (and there may be two or three such agents) will be a human being, a descendant of King David, with great leadership qualities similar to Moses or Muhammed. The arrival of the Messianic Age is what's really important, not the personality of the agents who bring it about, since they are simply the instruments of God, who ultimately is the real Redeemer. The Messianic Age is usually seen as the solution to all of humanity's basic problems. This may be true in the long run but the vast changes the transition to the Messianic Age entails will provide challenges to society for many generations to come. For 25 centuries Jews have prayed for the day when Isaiah's vision of a radically new world in which Jerusalem would be fulfilled with joy for 'no more shall there be in it an infant that lives only a few days.'(65:20) Before the mid 19th century the annual death rate for humans fluctuated from year to year but always remained high, between 30 and over 50 deaths per 1,000 individuals. Infectious and parasitic diseases primarily caused those elevated unstable rates. The toll from disease among the young was especially high. Almost 1/3 of the children born in any year died before their first birthday; in some subgroups, half died. Because childbirth was hazardous, mortality among pregnant women was also high. A century ago, the infant mortality rate in Jerusalem (as in most of the world) was 25-30%. Now it is less than 1%. For thousands of years almost every family in the world suffered the loss of at least one or two infants; now it happens to less than one out of a hundred. If this radical improvement had occurred over a few years, it would have greatly impressed people. But since it occurred gradually over several generations, people take it for granted. Also, it seems to be part of human nature that most people focus on complaining about the less than 1% that still die (an individual family tragedy heightened by the fact that it is unexpected because it is so rare) rather than be grateful that the infant mortality rate has been reduced by over 95%. Improvements in human health are unprecedented in human history. Truly we will be coming close to Isaiah's prophecy, 'One who dies at 100 years shall be reckoned a youth, and one who fails to reach 100 shall be reckoned accursed.'(65:20) Such radical change will necessitate major changes in the way we think and act when faced with decisions about life and death. Yet who among us would want to return to the high mortality rates and early deaths of previous centuries? The challenges we now face are not those of survival, but of opportunity. Where does a Messiah fit in with all of this? He will still have lots to do when he arrives. Most Orthodox Jews would not commit themselves to any individual as a Messiah unless he successfully rebuilds the ancient Temple in Jerusalem, fulfilling the prophecy of Zachariah, 'He shall build the Temple of the Lord, and he shall bear the glory, he shall sit on the throne and rule, there shall be a priest before the throne, and peaceful counsel will exist between both of them.' (6:13) Now that a large part of the Jewish people have returned to the Land of Israel, and resurrected a Jewish State, one might think that rebuilding a temple of the site where Solomon originally built one almost 3,000 years ago, would be relatively simple. But a Muslim Shrine, the Dome of the Rock, presently occupies the site. Often erroneously called the Mosque of Omar, it is not a mosque and it was not built by Omar. It was built in 691 by Abd-Al-Malik and it is regarded by Muslims as the third holiest site in the world. Any attempt to replace the Dome of the Rock would provoke a Muslim Holy War of cataclysmic proportions. There is, however, open land on the Temple Mount, and a broadcast Jewish house of worship could be built 600 feet north of the Dome of the Rock provided the Muslims would cooperate. Most observers agree that anyone who could arrange such Jewish-Muslim cooperation would really be the Messianic Ruler of Peace (Isaiah 9:5). Christian support for such a cooperative venture would also be important. Anyone who can bring Jews, Christians and Muslims together in mutual respect and cooperation would surely fulfill the greatest of all Messianic predictions, 'They shall beat their swords into plowshares and their spears into pruning knives; nation shall not take up sword against nation, they shall never again teach war.' (Isaiah 2:4) Indeed, such Jewish/Christian/Muslim cooperation would not be possible without great spiritual leadership in all three communities. Thus, each community could consider its leadership to be the Messiah and this would fulfill the culminating verses of Isaiah's Messianic prophecy as enlarged upon by Micah (4:3-5), 'They shall beat their swords into plowshares and their spears into pruning knives. Nation shall not take up sword against nation, they shall never again teach war, but every man shall sit under his grapevine or fig tree with no one to disturb him. For it is the Lord of Hosts who spoke. Though all peoples walk each in the name of its God, we will walk in the name of the Lord our God for ever and ever.' If each people truly follows the best of its own religious teachings the Messiah will surely have arrived, and God's Kingdom will be established. This is the most optimistic and positive vision one can have and one that we can all work for together. As Prophet Isaiah 41:10 says: 'So do not fear, for I am with you; do not be dismayed, for I am your God. I will strengthen you and help you; I will uphold you with my righteous right hand.' And best of all Proverbs 11:25 states: 'A generous person will prosper; whoever refreshes others will be refreshed.' Counting blessings leads to generosity, which results in personal and communal growth. As we express gratitude, God uses us to bless others, creating a cycle of mutual enrichment.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWc-sFHajH-XNgh7izzti-E3	2024-12-22T16:29:30-08:00	
Pakistan: 2024 Good Year For IPOs – OpEd	The Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX) recorded an increase in offerings in 2024, with the bourse witnessing 7 IPOs (including 2 GEM Board offerings), compared to just one IPO in the previous year. The total amount raised from investors through the 7 offerings in 2024 amounted PKR8.4 billion, marking the highest level since 2021, when there were 8 offerings that raised a total of PKR19.9 billion. The market saw immense enthusiasm in these offerings during the year as all of these were oversubscribed. Topline Securities terms this as a good year for IPOs, driven by macroeconomic stability under the IMF program, coupled with positive market sentiment, high liquidity, falling interest rates and political stability, which encouraged equity investment. The benchmark KSE-100 Index surged significantly by 83% in PKR terms and 85% in US$ terms in 2024 to date, reflecting overall positive sentiment and renewed investor interest.

Al-Jolani: The Transformed Jihadist? – Analysis	By Adil Rasheed Ahmad Al Sharaa, the new leader of Syria and chief of the jihadist group Hayat Tahrir Al Sham (HTS),1 was earlier known as Abu Mohammad Al-Jolani, a second-in-command of Al-Qaeda in Iraq and a deputy chief of ISIS in 2013.2 Perhaps inspired by the story of Paul, who spiritually transformed from a bounty hunter into an apostle on the road to Damascus, Ahmad Al Sharaa now claims to have changed from being a merciless mercenary into a purveyor of peace towards 'all religious groups'.3 Thus, he has pledged to protect Christians and other minorities in Syria and not to wage wars with the West. He even speaks of alleviating the humanitarian crisis in his country, including the repatriation of Syrian refugees now living abroad, which has strained ties between Turkey and Europe. This blade-running Salafi replicant, we are told, has finally found his humanity, and is thus longing for a longer lifespan.4 Although still sceptical, the US administration seems to be liking what it hears. For one, it is impressed that the terrorist with a US$ 10 million bounty on his head has dropped the word ‘al-Jolani’ from his new name—a transliteration derived from the Golan Heights (Arabic transliteration ‘Al Murtafatul Jolan’), from where his family was supposedly displaced by the Israelis.5 More importantly, the Jolani-led Hayat Tahrir Al Sham (HTS) group has been able to draw a wedge in a growing Sunni–Shia convergence, by breaking Iran’s land bridge to the Mediterranean—passing through Iraq and Syria to Hezbollah in Lebanon—which has collapsed at a critical time in the ongoing regional war. With the removal of the Shia Alawite Al-Assad regime and its replacement with Al-Jolani’s Sunni ‘takfiri’ ideology in Syria, the US may feel relieved from being dragged into a widening West Asian conflict. Israel is now fully capable of defeating Hezbollah on its own, with the latter’s logistical and military supplies being largely cut off from Iran.6 The Disingenuous Media There is a raging debate in the West whether the HTS group (earlier known as Jabhat Al Nusra) should still be deemed a terrorist organisation, as some officials believe it can be an excellent counterfoil to Iranian expansionist designs in the Arab world. In fact, many leaders in the US and UK are calling for a reassessment of the HTS as a force for good, although much of the debate has reportedly been behind closed doors.7 The Western media is also trying to project Al-Jolani in a more favourable light. Thus, The Times headline reads: 'Who is Abu Mohammad Al Jolani? ‘Polite’ Syrian Leader Heads Home',8 while the CNN tells us 'How Syria’s rebel leader went from a radical jihadist to a blazer wearing ‘revolutionary’'.9 For its part, The Telegraph informs, 'Moderate jihadist leader storms Syria—but tells troops not to frighten children',10 while The Washington Institute for Near East Policy carries the headline 'How Syria’s ‘Diversity-Friendly’ Jihadists Plan on Building a State'.11 This is certainly a far cry from the position taken earlier by the Western media agencies. In 2013, the CNN had called Al-Jolani one of 'the world’s 10 most dangerous terrorists', involved in abducting, torturing and slaughtering racial and religious minorities.12 This apparent naïveté of Western media may prove dangerous as the HTS still remains close to several radical Islamist groups in Syria in spite of its tactical differences with them. These groups include Ansar Al-Tawhid, Ahrar al-Sham, Harras al-Din, Nour al-Din al-Zenki Movement, The Turkistan Islamic Party in Syria, among others.13 In a scathing criticism, Alan McLeod states that the Western media has gone too far in justifying the change of regime in Syria and is thus re-branding Jolani from the erstwhile ‘terrorist’ to a ‘freedom fighter’, even as Syria’s new ‘Woke’ leader.14 This naivete of the West seems inexplicable as after taking control of Damascus, HTS fighters posted a video on Facebook, declaring that just as they have entered the Umayyad Mosque in Damascus, they will enter the Al-Aqsa Mosque in Jerusalem, the Prophet’s Mosque in Medina, and the Kaaba in Mecca.15 It is truly remarkable that Al-Jolani is viewed as dubious a leader as Bashar Al-Assad,16 who betrayed even his jihadist mentors for political gain, and is capable of swapping sides in rapidly changing times. Writing for Rolling Stone, Mac William Bishop goes to the extent of characterising Jolani as a 'ruthlessly pragmatic, astute politician who has renounced ‘global jihad’'.17 During his administration of Idlib, Jolani faced large public protests over several allegations of brutality, with reports of thousands of critics held in prisons, and economic grievances related to high taxes.18 Syria: A Russian Trap for the West? On coming to power, there would be more reasons for Jolani to shape-shift back to his jihadist mould than continue with his pro-Western makeover. As the Israeli-Palestinian conflict in Gaza and West Bank continues, there would be greater pressure on the new Syrian leader to intervene in that conflict. In fact, Israel’s large incursion into south Syria and its massive aerial bombardment of its military infrastructure is already weighing on the mind of the new Syrian potentate. With Al-Assad out of the way, it would not be long before HTS joins its patron Turkey and Iran to fight the Kurdish resistance groups in northeastern Syria, and with the help of Russia take on the looming Israeli threat. There are conspiracy theories swirling around that Russia, along with Iran and Turkey, planned the early collapse of a rapidly unravelling Al-Assad regime to lure Israel and the West into the Syrian quagmire.19 This would explain the rapid collapse of the Syrian regime and the fact that neither Russia, Iran nor Hezbollah came to the rescue of Bashar Al-Assad in his hour of crisis. There is no denying that Israel and the US are already trapped in Syria and Trump might have a hard time to salvage US prestige in any deal with Russia after assuming presidency.20 The Secret Connect of Al-Qaeda and Iran If this scenario unfolds as posited, Al-Jolani would only be following Al-Qaeda’s well-established, though secretive, association with Shia Iran, which the US claims to have continued for nearly three decades. According to the 9/11 Commission report,21 Al-Qaeda operatives reportedly travelled to Iran and the Bekaa Valley of Lebanon in the early 1990s—the heartland of Hezbollah—for explosives training. It is also reported that Osama bin Laden’s son, Hamza bin Laden, along with other Al-Qaeda members got refuge in Iran for several years after the 9/11 attacks.22 In addition, a letter from Bin Laden, found by the Navy SEALS during the Abbottabad raid, sheds light on the Iran–Al-Qaeda relationship since 9/11 very well. 'Iran is our main artery for funds, personnel, and communication…There is no need to fight with Iran unless you are forced to', writes the founder of Al-Qaeda just before his death.23 Thus, the belief that Al-Qaeda elements can have no truck with Shia radical groups or with Iran because of the Sunni–Shia differences cannot be considered an incontrovertible fact. Unlike the more divisive Salafi ISIS, the HTS follows a more inclusive and pan-Islamist agenda, which makes even Shia Houthis of Yemen send out a positive message on its coming to power,24 along with the Taliban regime in Afghanistan.25 Certainly, the implications of the rise of this rebranded Al-Qaeda 2.0 is a potentially disturbing development and may further worsen the ongoing Israel conflict with its Muslim neighbours. Undoubtedly, the victory of HTS is a major triumph for Salafi-jihadist groups around the world, just as the fall of the Al-Assad regime is a major blow for the secular socialist regimes in Central Asia, as well as for countries like Egypt in the wider Middle East. In fact, the Syrian coup has the potential to reduce Russia’s global influence and further enhance Turkey’s Islamist clout in the Muslim world. This raises the prospect of a larger pan-jihadist spectre on India’s western front, and necessitates a carefully calibrated and proactive approach.

Why Latin America Needs Lower Deficits And Stronger Fiscal Rules ...	Public debt in Latin America’s major economies is on pace to average 55 percent of gross domestic product this year, up significantly from 34 percent in 2013 (when the region’s commodity boom ended) and reversing the improvements achieved in the earlier part of this century. The regional figure reflects the seven economies that account for about three quarters of economic output: Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Mexico, Paraguay, Peru, and Uruguay. That level is below the 93 percent global level shown in the October Fiscal Monitor, but it is still high by Latin America’s historical standards and the region’s capacity to borrow. Financing costs average 3.8 percent of GDP, well above the 1.7 percent in advanced economies and the 2.5 percent in other emerging markets. The region is vulnerable to domestic and global shocks, including from commodity prices. And while it has increased much-needed social spending, fiscal policy is not helping to boost productivity and accelerate growth as much as it could. A recent study included in our October 2024 Regional Economic Outlook shows that the progress in reducing debt that Latin America made at the beginning of the century had essentially reversed in the years preceding the pandemic. During the commodity boom of 2004-13, debt fell from 50 percent to 34 percent of GDP, supported by strong economic growth, government budget surpluses, and appreciating domestic currencies. However, once the boom ended, primary surpluses turned into deficits, currencies weakened, and growth slowed. Public finances weakened despite the growing use of fiscal rules. Although countries went a long way in setting targets for spending, and budget balances, such targets were frequently modified and relaxed over time—in effect postponing the necessary adjustment. For example, one year ago, the IMF forecast assumed an average structural primary deficit (meaning excluding interest payments) of 0.1 percent of potential GDP for 2025. That has now widened to 0.8 percent even as economic growth projections in the region are little changed. Lackluster growth prospects—reflecting low productivity and investment, and shifting demographics—and persistently high financing costs pose important challenges, given the high levels of debt. The study finds that high financing costs largely reflect domestic factors, including low government effectiveness, an unfavorable history of stress and defaults, and lower foreign exchange reserves. The combination of low growth and high interest rates means higher debt burdens in coming years for Latin America. During the pandemic, public debt jumped globally for good reason—emergency spending helped protect the most vulnerable and avoid an even worse collapse in economic activity. While still higher than before the lockdowns, debt has declined since 2022 as economies recovered and crisis support was withdrawn. To stabilize debt, the seven largest countries in the region have announced ambitious fiscal consolidation plans, aiming to revert an average deficit of 0.8 percent of GDP in 2024 to a surplus of around 0.6 percent by 2029. However, these plans have suffered delays, and lack political support. In many countries, they rely on raising additional revenue and spending cuts that have yet to be identified. Stabilizing debt is an important first step, but not enough. Truly reducing debt over the next five years is necessary for countries to rebuild their capacity to address future shocks, as it happened during the pandemic. Debt Rise As documented in the study, turmoil in global financial markets could affect economic growth, raise debt financing costs, and weaken exchange rates. If this happened, debt could increase by about 8.5 percentage points of GDP by 2029, compared to current projections. Similarly, the study documents that a commodity price shock or a natural disaster could increase public debt by about 6 to 9 percentage points of GDP, respectively, over that horizon. The deterioration of public finances and the increase in debt after the end of the commodity price boom in 2013 suggests that existing fiscal frameworks were not strong enough. Effective fiscal frameworks can guide policy choices and offer the resilience and flexibility to deal with unpredictable events. Some countries are strengthening them through the recent introduction of public debt targets, such as Paraguay, Chile, and Colombia. However, in trying to address the problem, some have become overly complex at the expense of transparency and accountability. There are several areas for improvement, including providing more resources to independent fiscal institutions and strengthening accountability mechanisms. And it is critical to avoid reforms that imperil public finances. With lackluster growth prospects, high financing costs, and an uncertain world, now is the moment to reduce deficits and enhance fiscal frameworks, both of which help with reducing borrowing costs. It is urgent for countries to rebuild the space used in the last five years. Fiscal discipline will also help tame inflation, as our October report notes, which would ease the pressure on monetary policy.

In With The Old For Taiwan’s ‘New Era’ Of Values-Based Diplomacy ...	By Hiro Fu Ahead of his inaugural overseas visit to Pacific allies — the Marshall Islands, Tuvalu and Palau — Taiwanese President Lai Ching-te declared that his trip marked the beginning of a ‘new era’ for Taiwan’s values-based diplomacy, centred on shared democratic ideals, mutual prosperity and peace-building. This values-based approach constitutes one of the three pillars of the Lai administration’s comprehensive diplomatic strategy, alongside alliance-based diplomacy and economic and trade diplomacy. Together, these pillars aim to ensure mutual benefits for Taiwan and its global partners while advancing shared values. But a renewed emphasis on shared values emerges at a time when the relevance of values in diplomacy is increasingly uncertain. With Donald Trump’s return to the White House, the United States’ foreign policy is more likely to focus on national interest and security considerations. Even if Taiwan’s diplomatic shift proves largely rhetorical, moving away from what one could argue to be implicit, long-present transactionalism, its promotion could appear at odds with the deprioritisation of shared ideals among US allies and partners, as they direct attention towards the demands of more transactional relationships. In this scenario, Taiwan’s values-based diplomacy might appear out of place. But the values-based approach remains both a pragmatic and strategic choice for Taiwan. Historically, this strategy has broadened Taiwan’s avenues for international engagement. It highlights Taiwan’s strengths, not only as a democracy in contrast to China’s authoritarianism, but also its role as a reliable partner in advancing regional stability, driving economic innovation and contributing to global development. Reliability is firmly rooted in the democratic values Taiwan promotes. Advancing ties based on shared values is not new for Taiwan. In 2000, then president Chen Shui-bian pioneered the approach, branding his inaugural trip to diplomatic allies in Central America and Africa as the ‘tour of democratic diplomacy and friendship’. Similarly, former president Tsai Ing-wen championed the approach from 2016–24, expanding engagements with like-minded partners beyond formal diplomatic allies. Visiting leaders, such as Czech Senate President Milos Vystrcil and US Speaker Emerita Nancy Pelosi, have emphasised their support for Taiwan’s shared commitment to democracy. The emphasis on shared values underlines the dichotomy between democracy and authoritarianism. Whereas respect for the rule of law and the protection of human rights are central to Taiwan’s democracy, China’s authoritarian regime utilises its institutions and legal framework to suppress the rights of its peoples. Each diplomatic engagement with Taiwan presents a choice to align with democratic values over authoritarian control and repression. The antithesis of Taiwan’s values-based approach is one rooted in transactionalism, such as using financial incentives, aid and investments to secure and maintain diplomatic recognition. Under the Chen and Tsai administrations, ‘dollar diplomacy’, among other more pragmatic initiatives, played a complementary role alongside the emphasis on shared values. It was not until 2023, when Honduras severed ties with Taiwan to establish diplomatic relations with China, that Tsai publicly acknowledged the limitations of dollar diplomacy. Taiwan simply cannot outmatch China’s economic statecraft. Though Taiwan may not match the economic resources of the world’s second-largest economy, the partnerships it offers — based on transparency, mutual respect and shared values — are equally beyond China’s reach. These principles set Taiwan apart, offering an alternative focused on equitable, trust-based collaboration rather than the coercion and asymmetrical dependency often associated with China’s approach. Complementing its values-based diplomacy, the Lai administration now aims to leverage Taiwan’s strengths in semiconductors, artificial intelligence and other key sectors through its economic and trade diplomacy. Beyond economic considerations, Taiwan’s diplomatic allies also face the growing challenge of navigating the perils of US–China great power rivalry when deciding whether to maintain ties with Taipei or switch to Beijing. China’s expanding influence over the past decades in the Pacific, Latin America, the Caribbean and Africa — regions where Taiwan’s allies have been concentrated — has become another major factor explaining why many have chosen to cut ties with Taiwan. Values-based diplomacy addresses the challenges of security and geopolitical competition, but not on its own. The Lai administration’s alliance-based diplomacy seeks to build coalitions with democratic allies that share similar security interests, including South Pacific partners, the United States, Japan and Australia. Inspired by the United States’ maritime containment strategy of island chains, the Lai administration proposes to build ‘democratic island chains’, alliances not only grounded in shared democratic values but also commitment to regional security. Despite declaring a ‘new era’ for Taiwan’s values-based diplomacy, the Lai administration has not introduced any fundamentally new concepts. The core elements of its three-pillared comprehensive diplomatic strategy — emphasising shared values, trade and alliance-building — have been a feature of its diplomacy since at least 2000. But Lai’s decision to make shared democratic values the centrepiece of his administration’s diplomatic strategy, despite the opportunity to chart a different course as a newly elected leader, reflects a deliberate and strategic choice. It’s a choice that seeks to leverage Taiwan’s assets and strengths even amid the global uncertainty that a second Trump presidency could entail.

Rothbard’s Theory Of International Relations And The State – OpEd	By Ryan McMaken Murray Rothbard is well known as an opponent of warfare perpetrated by states. This includes acts of war by states against other states, as well as acts of war by states against non-state organizations and individuals. Consequently, Rothbard historical scholarship and his political commentary is characterized by consistent opposition to aggressive warfare and imperialism as practiced by states in general, and by the United States government in particular. Thus, Rothbard’s normative analysis of foreign policy and international relations is quite clear in his many prescriptive statements calling for fewer wars, smaller wars, and more limited warfare in general. In this, Rothbard follows a long tradition of libertarian or radical 'classical liberal' theorists. But did Rothbard provide us with a positive or descriptive analysis of international relations? That is, did Rothbard have a value-free theory of international relations describing the structure of the international system? The answer is yes if we extrapolate from his analysis of the nature of the state and how states interact with each other. The Fundamental Characteristics of Rothbard’s International System Rothbard’s description of international relations is characterized by four key tenets of states and their foreign policy: The international system is anarchic. States are controlled by an oligarchic ruling elite insulated from non-state actors, and a state’s foreign policy is primarily determined by the state’s elites who seek to preserve the system. Above all else, states seek to preserve themselves, and they tend to expand their own power when possible. War can be a tool of domestic policy. In some cases, states tend toward war because wars offer an opportunity for states to expand the state’s power over the domestic population. The Anarchic System In his essay 'War, Peace, and the State,' Rothbard writes: In the modern world, each land area is ruled over by a State organization, but there are a number of States scattered over the earth, each with a monopoly of violence over its own territory. No super-State exists with a monopoly of violence over the entire world; and so a state of 'anarchy' exists between the several States. This observation is hardly unique to Rothbard, and has been employed by international relations scholars from several different schools for many decades. Scholars differ on what they believe to be the implications and outcomes of the anarchic system, however. For Rothbard, the international system is characterized by violence partly because it is dominated by states—which are institutions founded on coercion. Rothbard recognizes, of course, that not all states are equally aggressive all the time. Some states are revisionist states and others are defensive, status quo states. This varies with the state of the international system at various times. Moreover, state violence is often traced back to previous acts of state violence, as in the case of the post-World War I revisionist states which were reacting to the harsh provisions imposed by the victorious allies. Because states are focused on their own interests and preservation, states will only engage in international cooperation when it is of benefit to the state itself. What is of benefit to the ordinary people of each state—i.e., peace, freedom, and free trade—is rarely of primary importance to those who decide foreign policy. States Are Ruled by a Small Minority Central to Rothbard’s view of the state is the fact that '’we’ are not the government; the government is not ‘us.’ The government does not in any accurate sense ‘represent’ the majority of the people.' This view has its origins in classical-liberal exploitation theory, and it is certainly reflected in Rothbard’s view of international relations. For examine, in For a New Liberty, Rothbard writes: the normal and continuing condition of the State is oligarchic rule: rule by a coercive elite which has managed to gain control of the State machinery. There are two basic reasons for this: one is the inequality and division of labor inherent in the nature of man, which gives rise to an 'Iron Law of Oligarchy' in all of man’s activities; and second is the parasitic nature of the State enterprise itself. Overall, Rothbard accepted the main tenets of elitism as he also shows when he writes: for the oligarchic rule of the State is its parasitic nature—the fact that it lives coercively off the production of the citizenry. To be successful to its practitioners, the fruits of parasitic exploitation must be confined to a relative minority, otherwise a meaningless plunder of all by all would result in no gains for anyone. For Rothbard, this holds true whether or not a regime is allegedly a democracy, and the presence of democratic institutions does not fundamentally change a state’s behavior in the international sphere. Rothbard notes that, in evaluating state behavior in war: The theoretical reason why focusing on democracy or dictatorship misses the point is that States—all States—rule their population and decide whether or not to make war. And all States, whether formally a democracy or dictatorship or some other brand of rule, are run by a ruling elite. Whether or not these elites, in any particular case, will make war upon another State is a function of a complex interweaving web of causes, including temperament of the rulers, the strength of their enemies, the inducements for war, public opinion. While public opinion has to be gauged in either case, the only real difference between a democracy and a dictatorship on making war is that in the former more propaganda must be beamed at one’s subjects to engineer their approval. Intensive propaganda is necessary in any case—as we can see by the zealous opinion-moulding behavior of all modern warring States. States Seek Self-Preservation The implications of this are significant for Rothbard’s view of international relations. Because the state is controlled by an exploitative elite, the loss of state power could mean the loss of riches and power for the ruling class. Thus, the ruling class prioritizes preservation of the state as a means of preserving the ruling class’s own power. Moreover, the ruling class goes to pains to exclude public participation in foreign-policy decision making as much as possible. Historian Ralph Raico has noted, for example, that foreign policy institutions are consistently among the least democratic institutions in any state. This is shown in the preponderance of official government secrets in foreign policy activities and by the presence of shadowy anti-democratic institutions like the CIA. Secrecy, which is specifically designed to exclude ordinary taxpayers from the decision-making process, is central to modern states’ war making apparatus. The ruling class’s efforts to keep a tighter grip on foreign policy decisions is due in part to the fact that matters of war and peace are very high stakes for the ruling class. Rothbard writes in 'The Anatomy of the State': What the State fears above all, of course, is any fundamental threat to its own power and its own existence. The death of a State can come about in two major ways: (a) through conquest by another State, or (b) through revolutionary overthrow by its own subjects— in short, by war or revolution. War and revolution, as the two basic threats, invariably arouse in the State rulers their maximum efforts and maximum propaganda among the people. As stated above, any way must always be used to mobilize the people to come to the State’s defense in the belief that they are defending themselves. Fundamentally, states fight to preserve themselves and not to preserve or protect ordinary taxpayers and property owners, although the state’s propagandists work to hide this fact. Rothbard adds: The root myth that enables the State to wax fat off war is the canard that war is a defense by the State of its subjects. The facts, of course, are precisely the reverse. For if war is the health of the State, it is also its greatest danger. A State can only 'die' by defeat in war or by revolution. In war, therefore, the State frantically mobilizes the people to fight for it against another State, under the pretext that it is fighting for them. While revolutionary upheavals are always of concern to the ruling class, on a day-to-day basis, it is generally the war making power of other states that a ruling class fears. Thus, as Rothbard writes: inter-State relations must occupy much of a State’s time and energy. The natural tendency of a State is to expand its power, and externally such expansion takes place by conquest of a territorial area. Unless a territory is stateless or uninhabited, any such expansion involves an inherent conflict of interest between one set of State rulers and another. Only one set of rulers can obtain a monopoly of coercion over any given territorial area at any one time: complete power over a territory by State X can only be obtained by the expulsion of State Y. Given that victory in war is not guaranteed, however, it would therefore be a mistake to assume that states mindlessly pursue new wars and conflicts at all times. While it is true that wars can produce large gains for states in terms of expanding territory and power, wars can also be disastrous for states when wars go badly. Therefore, in many cases, states will opt for the maintenance of the status quo when that is perceived by the ruling class to be the best strategy for preserving the state’s survival. Thus, Rothbard concludes that although warfare 'will be an ever-present tendency of States,' it will nonetheless be 'punctuated by periods of peace and by shifting alliances and coalitions between States' when aggressive warfare is perceived to be too risky. War Is Often a Tool of Domestic Policy States are generally open to expanding their power at the expense of other states. However, Rothbard notes that states also employ wars against foreign states as a means of consolidating power domestically. For example, in his essay 'World War I as Fulfillment,' Rothbard explores how 'the war came to the United States as the 'fulfillment,' the culmination, the veritable apotheosis of progressivism in American life.' Specifically, the war—and its value as a means of expanding pro-state propaganda—offered the American state a chance to greatly expand socialist central planning and federal police powers. As Rothbard also noted many times, a similar relationship between war and the growth of domestic state powers could be similarly found with the Cold War. The potential benefits of growing state through international war is generally, in itself, not sufficient to induce a state to engage in risky warfare with peers. However, if the state has the opportunity to participate in wars against weak or distant states—as with the US’s many wars against small states after the end of the Cold War—this can provide a relatively 'safe'—i.e., safe for the state—means of expanding state power. Conclusion In these writings on the nature of the state, we find what constitutes Rothbard’s view of the international system as it is. States exist and they are each controlled by a self-interested ruling class. Unfortunately, this is the reality we have to work with. For Rothbard, the way things should be is another matter entirely, and in this area Rothbard maintained that the pursuit of peace and human rights requires consistent opposition to international war, arms races, conscription, police states, and all other institutions and strategies and enhance any state’s war making power.

China Counting On Cyber-Psychological Cocktail To Expand Dominanc...	By Jeff Seldin China's push to develop the world's premier fighting force extends beyond conventional and nuclear capabilities, with U.S. officials warning that Beijing is pouring resources into a mix of psychological warfare and cyber operations. The goal in employing what are known in Beijing as cognitive domain operations, or CDO, is to influence the way China's adversaries think and behave, targeting everyone from the average citizen to senior officials. China 'views controlling the information spectrum in the modern battlespace as a critical enabler of information dominance early in a conflict,' according to the Pentagon's China Military Power report, released Wednesday. 'The PLA [People's Liberation Army] probably intends to use CDO as an asymmetric capability to deter U.S. or third-party entry into a future conflict or as an offensive capability to shape perceptions or polarize a society,' it said, adding that for Chinese military officers, 'subduing the enemy without fighting is the highest realm of warfare.' The Pentagon's report does not state how much money Beijing has allocated for these efforts but says that the PLA has spent parts of the past six years looking at how to incorporate cutting-edge technologies, such as artificial intelligence, to produce deepfakes and other material to mislead the U.S. public. It also says China has tasked some of its leading technology companies, including Baidu, Alibaba and Huawei, with using generative AI to produce better audio and video, in addition to more convincing text and images. Successes and failures The results, however, have been uneven. U.S. intelligence officials repeatedly called out China, along with Russia and Iran, for trying to deploy AI-boosted influence operations in the run-up to the U.S. presidential election in November. Some of the efforts, though, were described as clumsy. 'The quality is not as believable as you might expect,' said a U.S. intelligence official at the time. Earlier efforts, identified by tech giant Microsoft, described an improvement in Beijing's ability to produce 'eye-catching content,' though questions remained about the content's reach and impact. U.S. intelligence officials have also said that Beijing's influence efforts have been hampered by what they describe as a struggle by Chinese intelligence to understand the American psyche with the same sophistication as other U.S. adversaries, such as Russia. China has repeatedly denied such allegations, accusing the U.S. of calling out others for its own wrongdoing. 'For quite some time, the U.S. side has patched up all sorts of disinformation about threats of 'Chinese hackers' to serve its own geopolitical purposes,' Liu Pengyu, the spokesperson for the Chinese Embassy in Washington, told VOA in an email earlier this month regarding allegations that a Chinese-linked group known as Salt Typhoon had breached U.S. telecommunications companies. 'The US needs to stop its own cyberattacks against other countries and refrain from using cybersecurity to smear and slander China,' he added. Still, U.S. officials warn that aspects of China's psychological and cyber operations have met with an alarming amount of success, most notably the exploits of the hacking group known as Volt Typhoon. Volt Typhoon has been 'working to embed, burrow into our most sensitive critical infrastructure, not for espionage, but rather for disruption or destruction in the event of a major crisis in the Taiwan Strait,' said Jen Easterly, director of the U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency. 'Induce societal panic' 'This is a world where a war in Asia could see very real impacts … across our nation, with attacks against pipelines, against water facilities, against transportation nodes, against communications, all to induce societal panic and to deter our ability to marshal military might and citizen will,' Easterly added, speaking at a virtual cyber conference earlier this month. The CISA director said U.S. cyber teams have worked with companies in the private sector to evict Volt Typhoon from their systems, but there still is a long way to go. 'We think what we've seen to date is really just the tip of the iceberg,' Easterly said. Pentagon officials echo those concerns. 'I think we're starting to see more emphasis in the cognitive space … not being only focused on our leaders but indeed on populations in a way that can be both corrosive to institutions we have but also is really, really hard to, frankly, prevent, deter,' said Christopher Maier, the assistant defense secretary for special operations and low-intensity conflict. China and other adversaries such as Russia are 'going to be a lot more aggressive. They're going to take a lot more risk,' Maier said in response to a question from VOA during an event in Washington on Wednesday. 'They're going to try to message our population in ways that, frankly, we would find completely inappropriate and threatening,' he said. But Maier questioned whether such tactics will ultimately yield the desired results. 'The information tool is most useful when it's paired with physical actions and done in a more, if you will, tactical way. That's something that China and Russia could do,' he said. 'But those effects don't tend to last for long.' And, he said, now that the U.S. is on the lookout, China and others could have a harder time finding more success. 'I think they'll see opportunities to exploit what they'll perceive as vulnerabilities,' Maier said, adding, 'I'm not sure they're as vulnerable as they might think.'	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWd04GLTLb2d8iEdbDNTlv_q	2024-12-20T16:39:42-08:00	
America First, Alliances Last: The Global Implications Of Trump’s...	By Manoj Joshi The United States (US) is celebrating the arrival of the second Donald Trump Administration, which it hopes will lead the country to a new era of prosperity and global dominance. Some of America’s main allies, on the other hand, appear down and out. They are bracing to deal with their political or economic problems as well as a US administration that has no love lost for alliances. Many countries, such as Germany and France, are facing an economic downturn, and others, like Japan and South Korea, face unexpected political headwinds. Their troubles are deep-rooted and need structural reforms in their economic and political spheres. Meanwhile, many are also experiencing a surge of right-wing support riding on opposition to immigration and protectionism. Since the onset of the Cold War, the strength of the US has rested on its ability to stitch together alliances across the world. Its 51 allies have given the US its global geopolitical heft and proved useful in projecting its military power, facilitating economic interaction, and projecting shared values. But much of this could be damaged by the twin challenges of an America First policy of Donald Trump and the political and economic stagnation afflicting many key alliance countries. America’s neighbour and vital security partner, Canada, is undergoing a political crisis as the popularity of Justin Trudeau, in his ninth year as prime minister, has been steadily fading. Faced with problems with immigration, housing, and climate policies, Trudeau is hoping to hang on till the general elections in October 2025, but there seems to be no silver lining in the cloud for him. Confronted now with the threat of 25 percent US tariffs by Trump, Trudeau hastened to Mar-a-Lago to make peace with the new US president-elect. But instead of succour, he got an insulting response from Trump, who called him 'Governor of the Great State of Canada'. Despite a handsome majority, the new Labour government of UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer seems unable to gather momentum to deal with the economic and diplomatic challenges Britain confronts. On the other hand, the Conservative party appears to be mired in a political swamp, and meanwhile, the right-wing Reform UK, headed by Nigel Farage, is working hard to create greater political space for itself. Supported by Donald Trump and endorsed by Elon Musk, its leader Nigel Farage is being spoken of as a likely successor to Starmer. Germany’s Chancellor Scholz’s coalition has come apart even as the country’s economy remains stuck. This is the second year in a row of negative growth in the country, and though the government projects a return to growth next year onwards, some sceptics say that the export-dependent and manufacturing-heavy German economy will not be out of the woods till it improves its productivity. Earlier this month, the French government collapsed following a no-confidence vote over Prime Minister Michel Barnier’s deficit-cutting budget. This is, in a way, a fallout of President Macron’s loss in a snap election in the middle of the year. The parliamentary election has divided the Parliament into roughly three groups, with no clear majority for any one group. The right-wing and left-wing groups banded together to vote against Barnier in Parliament. Given that President Macron has changed three prime ministers in 2024, it also reflects the political dysfunction that has gripped the country, which is seeing a surge in the support of the right-wing National Rally (RN) party led by Marine Le Pen. Turmoil is also hitting America’s East Asian allies. In South Korea, President Yoon Suk Yeol, who was staunchly pro-American, has been impeached after he attempted to declare martial law. The episode has weakened the South Korean government and could lead to a left-wing government in the near future. Earlier in April, Yoon’s Conservative Party suffered a severe setback in the country’s Parliament elections, making his position shaky. These developments could impact the effort to create a South Korea-Japan-US trilateral security structure initiated by President Biden through a summit in Camp David in 2023. Besides this challenge, there is the incoming Trump Administration, which has not shown much inclination in that direction. Japan, too, has seen a political earthquake in recent times, causing it to turn inward. The long-ruling Liberal Democratic Party lost its parliamentary majority after a new Prime Minister, Shigeru Ishiba, called snap elections, hoping to capitalise 'on a new-leader bounce'. Though the party remains in power, it has had to bring in new coalition partners. This situation could undercut the positive economic environment that the country has had in the last two years. Equally important will be the impact of for Japan to revise its defence policy and make it more outward-looking. The immediate prospect is daunting. Trump’s 25 percent tariffs on Canada and Mexico could be devastating for the US, as well as its two neighbours. High tariffs would also be a major setback for America’s European partners, Germany and France, which will also have to face the challenge of supporting Ukraine against Russia if the US walks away from the task. For Canada, the US and all the European countries, immigration has emerged as a major issue which is powering a virtual insurgency against established governments. The unseemly haste with which countries like Germany have suspended consideration of residency for Syrian refugees is a testament to the current sensitivity of the issue. There could be wider international repercussions of an 'America First' policy, such as encouraging countries like South Korea and even Japan to cross the nuclear threshold. Trump’s handling of both countries during his first Presidency was not very heartening. He demanded increased payments from both to enable US troops to be stationed on their territory. Equally serious could be an American decision to force Ukraine to ceasefire on terms favourable to Russia. Earlier this month, Trump called for an immediate ceasefire in Ukraine and said in an interview that he would be open to reducing military aid to Ukraine and pulling the US out of NATO. Such an eventuality would leave the European security system in shambles and compel France and Germany to completely reorient their security policies. Whether Trump succeeds or fails, there is little doubt that the world order will undergo a churn unlike anything seen since the collapse of the Soviet Union. Unless Trump takes a U-turn, the American-led global alliance system is likely to weaken, if not unravel entirely. In this scenario, India, with its multi-alignment policy, stands to benefit. We could see the emergence of a truly multi-polar world order. About the author: Manoj Joshi is a Distinguished Fellow at the Observer Research Foundation.

Trump Wants EU To Buy More US Oil And Gas Or Face Tariffs	(EurActiv) -- US President-elect Donald Trump said on Friday (20 December) that the European Union may face tariffs if the bloc does not cut its growing deficit with the United States by making large oil and gas trades with the world's largest economy. 'I told the European Union that they must make up their tremendous deficit with the United States by the large scale purchase of our oil and gas,' Trump said in a post on Truth Social. 'Otherwise, it is TARIFFS all the way!!!,' he added. Trump has promised to impose tariffs on most if not all imports, and said Europe would pay a heavy price for having run a large trade surplus with the US for decades. Trump, who takes office on 20 January, has already pledged hefty tariffs on three of the United States' largest trading partners - Canada, Mexico and China. The European refining industry belongs to oil majors and trading houses and the governments have no say on where the purchases are coming from. The owners usually buy their resources based on price and efficiencies. US oil and natural gas exports already flow to Europe when market conditions make those purchases more attractive versus rival producers. US crude oil exports to northwest Europe are likely to slip early next year after hitting a record high in November, as the arbitrage for transatlantic shipments has slammed shut and freight rates have climbed, analysts said this week. European stocks tumble European shares were on course to post their worst week in three months on Friday after Trump's comments about potential tariffs on the EU, which further spooked investors already worried about the rate outlook. The pan-European STOXX 600 index fell 0.8% by 0812 GMT, trading at its lowest in nearly a month and on course for its biggest weekly decline since early September. All the major European subsectors were in the red, with banks and miners leading losses. The German DAX and France's CAC 40 fell about 1% each. Britain's FTSE 100 posted a smaller decline compared with its European peers, down 0.3%. Data showed British retail sales rose by a weaker-than-expected 0.2% in November, adding to signs of slow momentum in the economy. Investors are awaiting US inflation data later in the day for hints on the pace of rate cuts next year. European stocks had tumbled on Thursday after the Federal Reserve projected fewer rate cuts next year and higher inflation. Idorsia tumbled about 41% after the Swiss pharma company announced delays to a rights deal related to its hypertension drug Tryvio, raising funding concerns.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWd04GLTLb2d8tIDDLdLiH_m	2024-12-20T16:30:50-08:00	
India To Surpass China As Top Source Of Global Oil Consumption Gr...	India has emerged as the leading source of growth in global oil consumption in 2024 and 2025, overtaking China this year, according to our December Short-Term Energy Outlook (STEO). China’s oil consumption grew by more than India’s in almost every year from 1998 through 2023, with China’s oil consumption regularly growing more than any other country during those years. Over 2024 and 2025, India accounts for 25% of total oil consumption growth globally. We expect an increase of 0.9 million barrels per day (b/d) in global consumption of liquid fuels in 2024. We expect even more growth next year, with global oil consumption increasing by 1.3 million b/d. Driven by rising demand for transportation fuels and fuels for home cooking, consumption of liquid fuels in India is forecast to increase by 220,000 b/d in 2024 and by 330,000 b/d in 2025. That growth is the most of any country in our forecast in each of the years. We forecast China’s liquid fuels consumption will grow by 90,000 b/d in 2024 before increasing by 250,000 b/d in 2025. In China, rapidly expanding electric vehicle ownership, rising use of liquefied natural gas for trucking goods, a declining population, and decelerating economic growth have limited consumption growth for transportation fuels. Most of the growth in China is the result of increasing oil use for manufacturing petrochemicals. Although India’s growth in percentage and volume terms exceeds China’s growth in our forecast, China still consumes significantly more oil. Total consumption of liquid fuels in India was 5.3 million b/d in 2023, while China consumed more than triple that amount at 16.4 million b/d in 2023, based on estimates in our December STEO.

Our Cities Are Zoned Out – OpEd	By Katrina Gulliver Urban zoning is an issue on which the left and the right often find common ground: they don’t like it. The left often because they want the freedom to build multifamily and affordable housing in areas designated for single-family residences, and the right because of the undue red tape and restrictions on what can be built anywhere. Often held up as a hero in this game is the city of Houston, Texas, famous for not having zoning. However, as Sara Bronin explains in her new book Key to the City, that’s not the full picture. Outsiders picture a regulation-free developer’s paradise: 'But in the unzoned city, private rules fill the regulatory vacuum left by zoning’s absence.' While the city overall may lack zones, individual suburbs created their own rules: The subdivision ordinance, for example, establishes building lines (front setbacks), parking requirements, and minimum lot sizes, all commonly found in zoning codes. The historic preservation ordinance, another example, requires some properties to undergo design review, a process sometimes required by zoning procedures. Technically, these ordinances are not zoning—a fact recently confirmed by the Texas Supreme Court. But they do deploy several zoning-like mechanisms. The phrase 'technically… not zoning' is, as the reader will have guessed, doing a lot of work. The role played by zoning is just filled under the guise of other ordinances or specific covenants. This brings control down to a more local level, and it means that certain neighborhoods are able to restrict what is built in their area. (For example, she highlights affluent suburbs which are able to keep their single-family home character through covenants.) But for the city as a whole, the lack of zoning means a lighter governmental touch, allowing Houston to grow much more rapidly than other cities and address the housing needs of its expanding population. Bronin grew up in Houston, so she knew the situation well. As an adult, living in Hartford, Connecticut, she has also seen the effects of too much zoning: At the beginning of the twentieth century, Hartford had ranked as one of the richest cities in the country. The insurance industry, innovative manufacturers like Elizabeth Colt and Albert Pope, and literary illuminati like Mark Twain and Harriet Beecher Stowe had given the city economic and cultural prominence. Back then, Hartford was renowned both for its commercial and industrial bustle and for its stately elegance. 'Of all the beautiful towns it has been my fortune to see, this is the chief,' Twain enthused upon his first visit. 'You do not know what beauty is if you have not been here.' Nobody would say that about Hartford now. 'Connecticut’s capital is now one of the poorest cities in the country—an island of concentrated poverty in one of America’s wealthiest regions,' writes Bronin. Attempts at renewal in the mid-twentieth century ripped out gracious, historic homes and small apartment houses—while planning laws from the 1950s and 60s meant such houses could not be rebuilt, even if someone wanted to do so: Zoning set onerous parking requirements that resulted in more asphalt, less building and green space, and too many paved-over lots like the one we were sweltering in that July day. Zoning rendered impossible the lovely townhomes and apartment buildings that had graced the avenue in its heyday. It’s a common refrain among urbanists that the most desirable neighborhoods are often those it would be illegal to build today. 'The paradox of zoning—the tragedy of zoning—is that it often starts out in a hopeful attempt to improve our cities and the lives we live in them. Then, all too often, it fails; it even does the opposite.' The existence of zoning and restrictions also creates a culture of rent-seeking at best (and kickbacks at worst). There’s a fee to apply for a construction permit, fees for variances, fees to surveyors, fees to resubmit plans to the town council when they were rejected the first time…and an army of bureaucrats to manage the process. Zoning, in some form, goes back a long way in the history of cities. In Colonial America, zoning started out with the kind of common-sense rules already in place in Europe. Don’t put smelly industries like tanneries in the middle of the town. Use brick for buildings near fire risks, like bakeries and forges. In Williamsburg, Virginia, there were rules in the 1760s on minimum setbacks, appearance from the street, restrictions on livestock in the city, and rigorously planned streets. (Indeed these rules, and their results, helped with the recreation of the city as Colonial Williamsburg in the twentieth century.) Bronin picks up her narrative in the nineteenth century, when industrializing cities meant bigger changes needed to be made: As Boston’s residential density increased, so did complaints about farm animals by residents living in closer quarters. Local leaders acted to mitigate their concerns. Boston was among many cities that passed laws prohibiting the keeping of swine, which had previously roamed streets eating waste. In 1830, the mayor banned cows from the Common, and in 1836 removed its pasture fencing. By the turn of the twentieth century, the city had instituted dispersion requirements for dairies, keeping them 300 yards from marshes and other farm animals. As far as some of these rules go, most of us would have no problem. Much as we may want the freedom to build what we want, the human condition means we tend to want restraints on other people. I think zoning is a gross infliction of the state when it stops me from building a garage close to the road, but a very good thing if it stops my next-door neighbor from setting up an industrial hog farm. Thus I might choose to live in a subdivision with covenants, or a restrictive HOA, just because I can be confident that whatever blocks me from doing what I want will similarly block my neighbor. But more restrictive urban zoning in America emerged out of the Progressive Era. Initially, civic planners wanted to remove slums and improve public health—and 'city beautiful' types also focused on the aesthetics of the built environment. Yet as the automobile became more prevalent, this took over as a major factor: zoning focused on finding ways to allow cars to circulate and—crucially—to have somewhere to be parked. The most toxic result of this has been minimum parking requirements for new construction. Anyone proposing an apartment block had to set aside a paved-over area for the potential residents’ cars. This not only created a pockmarked urban landscape, where infill development couldn’t be built (because there’s no room for parking), but largely priced out of the market the kind of small 4–6-unit buildings that featured in suburbs built before the 1940s—precisely the kind of buildings that once were affordable housing. Meanwhile, city governments have tried to regulate and zone their way to more affordable housing without removing the regulations that made it so expensive to start with. A recent housing regulation fad has been for 'inclusionary' zoning: requirements for developers to include a certain percentage of 'affordable' housing in new developments. Interestingly, Bronin comes down against such impositions, pointing out that: …no research has shown that inclusionary programs actually create new housing. On the contrary, existing research suggests that inclusionary zoning actually increases overall prices, because developers recoup the costs of building their units by charging more for market-rate units. One study found that in California jurisdictions, supply was reduced by 7 percent and prices increased by 20 percent during a ten-year period in which inclusionary zoning was adopted. Opponents believe that for these reasons, inclusionary zoning constitutes a hidden tax on real estate development. (Of course, anyone who has lived in California knows there’s nothing that Sacramento can’t make more expensive by imposing yet another law.) A much greater boost to housing supply, 'affordable' or otherwise, would be the removal of those pesky parking requirements. For instance, Bronin describes a 'Density Bonus' program in San Diego that allows developers to build more units than zoning allows if they offer a proportion of them as affordable housing. This system produced modest results: just 145 units (15 affordable) in 2016. As she explains, lifting parking requirements had a much greater impact: But in 2020, the year after parking mandates were lifted, the program produced 3,283 homes (over 1,500 affordable), many in the transit areas and many in 100 percent–affordable buildings made more financially viable when they did not have to provide parking. Amazingly, when developers aren’t having to buy extra land for parking (or pay to tunnel under the building to create underground parking spaces), they can build housing more cheaply. Bronin recognizes that zoning ruined Hartford, and only by allowing more flexibility in land use can we get back the kind of cities people want. But she still wants to zone our way in: We must rewrite our codes to build more beautiful and more resilient places. Zoning can reposition nature as a vital form of infrastructure necessary to our health, well-being, and survival. She’s still pro-zoning, but in a modified form.

The Annihilation Of A Nation – OpEd	The bombardment of Gaza is relentless, indiscriminate and all encompassing, and whilst weak Western governments refuse to condemn Israel and cut all military aid the IDF (Israeli Defence Force) continues to slaughter Palestinian civilians and obliterate what remains of Gaza. Nobody and nowhere is off limits to Israel, even designated humanitarian zones, camps and informal settlements where displaced Palestinians shelter (75% of the population has been displaced), are targeted. At least 44,502 Palestinians have been killed since 8 October 2023 (70% are women and children), tens of thousands more lie buried under the rubble; over 100,000 are injured in Gaza and a further 5,500 in the West Bank; 152 journalists and media workers have been killed; 333 humanitarian aid workers killed – most were staff members of UNRWA (UN Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East), a compassionate thorn in Israels side for years. Every school in Gaza has been destroyed, the healthcare system has been decimated, with the United Nations relate, more than '500 attacks on health care' facilities recorded in Gaza. The Red Cross warn that, 'Gaza is now at risk of a complete medical shutdown,' and the UN report that, 'all 2.1 million residents [are] in urgent need of food and livelihood assistance.' If it is not officially the case now, widespread famine is, the UN make clear, imminent. Placed against the legal definition of genocide it is clear that this brutal onslaught by Israel on defenceless Palestinians constitutes genocide; genocide that is being facilitated by the US and other western allies of Israel. Whether genocide is being committed, in this case by the rogue state Israel, is not a matter of opinion, it is a question of law. International law administered by the International Court of Justice (ICJ) or the International Criminal Court (ICC) is not something that a State can choose to accept or agree with. When States disregard the ruling or findings of such global institutions and publicly condemn them as the US and others have done over the ICC’s decision to issue arrest warrants for Netanyahu and his chief henchman Yoav Gallant, the underlying global order is weakened. Threatening the ICC with sanctions 'as if it was a terrorist organisation,', said the President of the court, Tomoko Akane, is shocking. US politicians (as well as Israel’s leaders) seem to believe they inhabit a sphere beyond the rest of the world, and can selectively abide by and acknowledge the rulings of the worlds highest courts. The word genocide comes from the Greek genes, meaning tribe or race and the Latin suffix side, which means killing – so killing a race, or members of a race. Genocide was recognised as a crime under international law in 1946. The Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide (1948) is part of international law, which means that even if a country has not ratified the convention (153 countries have, including Israel and the US), it is bound by its articles. Article II lays out the definition: 'genocide means any of the following acts committed with intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnical, racial or religious group. As such: 1. Killing members of the group;2. Causing serious bodily or mental harm to members of the group;3. Deliberately inflicting on the group conditions of life calculated to bring about its physical destruction in whole or in part;4. Imposing measures intended to prevent births within the group;5. Forcibly transferring children of the group to another group; So, if any of these have been committed by Israel against the Palestinians, then Israel is carrying out a genocide, in a addition, the US and Co., are complicit, because without the ongoing supply of US arms Israel could not continue its barbarism. In relation to Palestinians, Israel is guilty on all counts. It is Genocide Amidst the numerous voices condemning Israel the UN Special Rapporteur On The Situation Of Human Rights In The Palestinian Territories, Francesca Albanese stands out as one of the clearest, strongest and most courageous. She is a fearless legal warrior on a mission to reveal the truth of what Israel has done and is still doing in Gaza and the West Bank. In her report ‘Anatomy of a Genocide’, she finds that, 'The overwhelming nature and scale of Israel’s assault on Gaza and the destructive conditions of life it has inflicted reveal an intent to physically destroy Palestinians as a group.' She makes clear that Israel is committing genocide against Palestinians by: 'killing members of the group; causing serious bodily or mental harm to groups’ members; and deliberately inflicting on the group conditions of life calculated to bring about its physical destruction in whole or in part.' The Special Rapporteur goes on to say that, such 'genocidal acts were approved and given effect following statements of genocidal intent issued by senior military and government officials.' Inflammatory statements like those made by Israel’s Defence Minister Yoav Gallant, who on 9 October 2023 said, 'We are fighting human animals, and we are acting accordingly….we will eliminate everything – they will regret it.' Maj. Gen. Ghassan Alian, who heads the Israeli army’s Coordination of Government Activities in the Palestinian Territories (COGAT) threatened Palestinians, 'There will be no electricity and no water (in Gaza), there will only be destruction. You wanted hell, you will get hell.' Israels Prime-Minister, Benjamin Netanyahu has referred to Palestinians as 'wild beasts, predators'. Such comments are not new, Israeli leaders have for decades used insulting language as they sought to dehumanise Palestinians. Among other steps, UN Special Rapporteur Francesca Albanese calls on states to act, firstly to immediately 'implement [of] an arms embargo on Israel' as it has 'failed to comply with the binding measures ordered by the ICJ on 26 January 2024.' As well as economic sanctions against Israel. She is not alone in concluding genocide is being committed, notably, Amnesty International (AI) recently released a detailed report, ‘You Feel Like You Are Subhuman’: Israel’s Genocide Against Palestinians in Gaza’. In the damning text Amnesty states that, 'Israel has unleashed hell and destruction on Palestinians in Gaza brazenly, continuously and with total impunity.' AI Secretary General Agnès Callamard, points out that the report, 'Demonstrates that Israel has carried out acts prohibited under the Genocide Convention, with the specific intent to destroy Palestinians in Gaza. These acts include killings, causing serious bodily or mental harm and deliberately inflicting on Palestinians in Gaza conditions of life calculated to bring about their physical destruction. Month after month, Israel has treated Palestinians in Gaza as a subhuman group unworthy of human rights and dignity, demonstrating its intent to physically destroy them.' Israel is committing genocide in defence of its colonial occupation and apartheid state. is unbelievable what the Israeli men of war have done and are doing, truly horrific. And they are not acting alone of course. Its genocidal campaign is dependent on the unconditional military and political support provided by the US, the US is therefore complicit. Military hardware, provided by US companies that are making millions of US$ out of genocide, is annihilating Palestinians. The report from AI and those produced by the UN Special Rapporteur Francesca Albanese are unequivocal: Israel is carrying out a genocidal campaign in Gaza, and as Agnès Callamard said, 'It must stop now', and those responsible, the Israeli politicians and military chiefs, must face justice.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWd04GLTLb2d8pBoB-mSaVzK	2024-12-20T16:09:25-08:00	
What Would The Russian Capture Of Pokrovsk Mean For The Ukraine W...	By Todd Prince and Oleksiy Prodayvoda (RFE/RL) -- Pokrovsk once buzzed with life, but on this cold, snowy December day, it feels like a ghost town. The streets of the once-60,000-strong community were eerily empty, with barely a soul or a car in sight. The only sound is the occasional crack of gunfire and the thunderous boom of distant artillery. Once a thriving industrial hub in Ukraine's eastern Donetsk region where cafes hummed with chatter and the streets pulsed with energy, Pokrovsk is now the latest Ukrainian city caught in the death grip of Russian forces. Ever since Ukraine's counteroffensive to drive out invading Russian forces culminated with little success in October 2023, Russian troops have slowly pushed westward, capturing the Donetsk city of Avdiyivka and then the town of Vuldehar. Russia currently controls about 60 percent of Donetsk. Now, reportedly just a few kilometers from the edge of town, Russian troops could be on the verge of taking Pokrovsk, a key logistics hub near the current front line. 'It would be a substantial blow to the Ukrainians, and I'm not sure one that they can stop from happening,' David Silbey, a professor of military history at Cornell University in the United States, told RFE/RL. 'If they lose it, they lose that kind of fairly straightforward access to their defensive lines, and that makes it much harder to build up forces there and keep fighting,' he said. Pokrovsk is strategically significant because it serves as a major transportation hub, is close to the front lines, and serves as a supply hub for military operations in the Donbas region. The rate of Russia's territorial gain in Donetsk has been increasing every month since August despite a surge in Western military aid, raising concerns about a potential Russian breakthrough. The loss of Pokrovsk would further open the door to one of Russia's main war aims: capturing the rest of the Donetsk region, one of four that Moscow claims to have annexed in November 2022 following a fabricated election. Russian President Vladimir Putin in June said he would agree to a cease-fire and peace talks only if Ukraine withdrew from the four regions, which also include Luhansk, Zaporizhzhya, and Kherson, and renounced ambitions to join NATO. Marathon Offensive But according to George Barros, a military analyst at the U.S.-based Institute for the Study of War, Russia may not have the resources for the time being to turn a potential tactical victory in Pokrovsk into an operational advance deeper into Ukraine. Russia lost more than 500 tanks and 1,000 fighting vehicles -- enough hardware to equip five mechanized divisions -- as well as tens of thousands of troops during the yearlong, 45-kilometer march westward to the outskirts of Pokrovsk. 'What we're seeing here is the end of a very, very long Russian marathon where the Russians have spent an eye-watering amount of resources to advance over a very objectively small amount of territory,' he said. If the Russians do seize Pokrovsk, the current campaign will likely culminate due to force and resource constraints, Barros says. He says Russian forces have been unable to capture the strategic hilltop town of Chasiv Yar following their victory in nearby Bakhmut, one of the deadliest battles of the war, in part due to exhaustion. Russia's extraordinary losses on the way to Pokrovsk could open up an opportunity for Ukraine, Barros adds. 'If the Ukrainians are properly resourced...and they can get more men to the front that are well-equipped -- this would actually be the ideal time to counterattack into a tired and exhausted adversary and inflict some reverses on the Russians,' Barros said. Ukraine's Problems However, it has been recruitment and training problems perhaps above all else that have allowed Russian forces to cut across eastern Ukraine this year, military experts say. For months, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy's government delayed submitting legislation to boost recruitment amid fears of a popular backlash, even as troop strength at the front lines degraded due to lack of rotation. The eventual bills, which finally passed parliament in April, also lowered the draft eligibility age from 27 to 25. The hesitation over the draft bills coincided with a six-month pause in U.S. military aid that further weakened Ukrainian frontline forces earlier this year. Russia now no longer has a significant advantage in firepower and unmanned aerial vehicles as the U.S. rushes ammunition to the country and Ukraine cranks up its drone production. However, the manpower shortage continues all along the front as new recruits try to avoid the infantry amid high casualty rates. Ukraine has been rushing as many troops into Pokrovsk as they can muster, including from other branches of the armed forces, to prevent its fall. But it comes at the expense of their defense lines elsewhere, Cornell professor Silbey says. Ukraine doesn't have a chance to rebuild its forces because they are under continuous attack, he says. Meanwhile, Ukraine is slowly being pushed back in Russia's Kursk region with the help of North Korean troops. Ukraine seized a slice of the Kursk region in a surprise incursion in August but has given up about half its territorial gains. Kyiv's reported aim in Kursk was to draw Russian troops away from Ukraine and to exchange Russian land for its own when a future peace deal was concluded. Amid the shortage of troops in the east of the country, the Kursk operation has been controversial, with some experts saying it didn't succeed in pulling many Russian troops away from the front lines in Donetsk. Should Russian forces seize Pokrovsk, Silbey says, they will likely pause to consolidate their position before pushing north toward the city of Kramatorsk to seize the next major road network in Donetsk. He says Putin may push Russian forces to the borders of Luhansk and Donetsk -- which make up the Donbas region -- before seeking a deal with Ukraine. Russia can't sustain a push deeper into Ukraine, he says, pointing out that Moscow is pulling Soviet tanks from storage -- some made as early as the 1950s -- because it can't replace its losses. Russia is 'winning, but this is destroying them as a military power. This is the last superpower war they'll ever fight, because they're using up all the stores they had left from when they were the Soviet Union.'

Ukraine Military Drops Leaflets Urging North Korean Troops To Sur...	By Lee Sangmin and Cho Jin Woo The Ukrainian military is dropping Korean-language leaflets urging North Korean troops fighting on Russia’s side of the war to 'Surrender today and join South Korea tomorrow,' Radio Free Asia has learned. The leaflets appear in a video shared on the Telegram social media website by InformNapalm, an organization that has been reporting on the situation in Ukraine. Meanwhile, the Ukrainian website evocation.info also published on Telegram evidence that North Korean soldiers are provided with Russian ID, likely to hide their nationality in the event they are killed. The two social media posts are among many reports of North Korean participation in the war, which Pyongyang and Moscow have not outwardly confirmed. InformNapalm’s leaflet video shows a drone with a camera flying the leaflets over a wooded area. A caption in Ukrainian says, 'Leaflets are dropped into the woods where North Korean soldiers are hiding.' RFA previously reported that a similar type of drone engaged North Korean troops in a battle in the Kursk region, killing 50 of them. But this time it was just leaflets. In addition to the 'surrender' leaflet, there’s another that says 'You’ve been sold!' South Korean intelligence reported that Russia is paying every North Korean soldier about US$2,000 per month, but observers believe that just like North Korea’s dispatched workers, most of the money is likely sent to the cash-strapped North Korean government. RFA has not independently verified the authenticity of the video. According to InformNapalm, once North Korean soldiers surrender or are captured, their identities are protected and they are provided with support to go to South Korea to start a new life, but it acknowledged that it is still too early to tell how effective the leaflet campaign will be. Meanwhile, a Russian military ID with a bullet hole and blood stains on it was found on a dead North Korean soldier in the Kursk region, the photo published by evocation.io purports to show. The ID card is legible in the photo. It says the deceased soldier is Kim Kan-Bolat Albertovich, a native of Russia’s Tuva Republic, in southern Siberia, born on April 13, 1997. RFA cannot independently verify the authenticity of the photo. According to the ID, Pvt. Kim was allegedly born in the village of Bayan-Tala, graduated secondary school in 2016, worked as a roofer, and then entered military service in the Tuvan 55th Mountain Infantry Brigade. But a person with that name and birthdate does not exist in Russian records, the evocation.io reported. The soldier’s Korean signature also appears on the first page, suggesting his real name is Ri Dae Hyok. The document has more inconsistencies. It lacks photos, order numbers and official seals. Additionally, 'Kim' has allegedly been a soldier since 2016, but he first received a weapon on Oct. 10, 2024, and a personal tag (AB-175311) a day later. If legitimate, this photo would confirm what South Korean intelligence revealed in October, that North Korean troops sent to Russia were issued fake Russian identification cards that said they were residents of southern Siberia, which is home to a people who are racially similar to East Asians. It is difficult to tell if the photo is legitimate or if it is propaganda, David Maxwell, vice president at the U.S.-based Center for Asia Pacific Strategy, told RFA. 'If Russia or North Korea is attempting to hide their soldiers’ identities, it makes no sense. They’ll inevitably be exposed,' Maxwell said. 'It’s another foolish move by the Russians and North Koreans because when these soldiers are captured or killed, their identities will be revealed.' He said it is already well known that North Korea is supporting Russia, so efforts to pass North Koreans off as a different Russian ethnic group was pointless. 'Maybe it makes them feel better, but I don’t find this very important or credible.'	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWd04GLTLb2d8hsfXy0ZSQNY	2024-12-20T15:55:17-08:00	
India’s Global South Policy: Solidarity And Collaboration Perspec...	India’s policy regarding the Global South exemplifies its developing position as a leader in international diplomacy. In recent decades, India has progressively established itself as a proponent of developing countries, particularly of Africa, Southeast Asia, and Latin America. India's Global South Policy is conceptualized on a vision of solidarity, mutual cooperation, and the promotion of the interests of low- and middle-income countries. This policy prioritizes economic, technical, and developmental assistance while also addressing global challenges such as climate change, advocating for inclusive governance reforms, and ensuring peace and security. India's diplomatic manoeuvrings between the Global South and the Global North, coupled with its internal developmental challenges, creates both opportunities and complexities in its foreign policy strategy. India's provision of development assistance to Global South nations has emerged as a fundamental aspect of its foreign policy. Initiatives such as the Indian Technical and Economic Cooperation (ITEC) and the Indian Development and Economic Assistance Scheme (IDEAS) illustrate India's commitment to aiding the development of nations in need. These programs emphasize the provision of technical expertise, training, and financial assistance across various sectors, including infrastructure, healthcare, education, and disaster relief. The Indian government's development assistance aims to enhance the capabilities of these countries, allowing them to tackle their developmental challenges more efficiently. This method sharply contrasts with conventional aid from the Global North, frequently perceived as conditional or condescending. India's agenda advocates for self-sufficiency and seeks to establish sustainable collaborations with nations in the Global South. This focus on capacity-building benefits recipient nations and enhances India's position as a responsible global actor. Moreover, India's assistance encompasses more than just financial support. It entails the dissemination of expertise and knowledge in pivotal domains such as agriculture, information technology, and renewable energy. India's extensive experience in large-scale poverty alleviation and economic transformation offers significant insights for nations aiming to tackle comparable challenges. India significantly contributes to empowering developing nations by providing both technical and financial support to facilitate their growth. Alongside development assistance, India has actively sought to improve trade and investment with Global South countries. India, with its burgeoning economic strength and expanding global clout, has increasingly endeavored to forge mutually advantageous economic partnerships, especially with nations in Africa, Southeast Asia, and Latin America. The transition to economic diplomacy is motivated by the necessity to diversify India's trade partners and promote economic growth through collaborations.India has engaged in multiple trade agreements and partnerships aimed at enhancing connectivity, advancing infrastructure, and facilitating trade in goods and services. These agreements facilitate the establishment of a more inclusive global economy, enabling developing countries to access new markets and technologies. India's trade policy aims to foster sustainable growth, emphasizing sectors such as agriculture, manufacturing, and technology. Furthermore, India's foreign direct investment (FDI) in the Global South has been pivotal in facilitating the advancement of essential infrastructure projects, encompassing transportation, energy, and telecommunications. These investments not only generate employment and promote economic expansion but also cultivate stronger relationships between India and its partners. India is bolstering the economic resilience of Global South countries through strategic investments, thereby enhancing regional stability and fostering closer diplomatic relations. India's Global South Policy emphasizes climate change and sustainable development. India, as a nation significantly susceptible to climate change impacts, has established itself as a prominent proponent for equitable solutions to climate challenges affecting developing countries. India's position is unequivocal, as developed nations, having historically been the largest contributors to greenhouse gas emissions, must assume greater accountability for addressing climate change and offering financial support to developing countries. India's leadership in the International Solar Alliance (ISA) exemplifies its dedication to sustainable development and renewable energy initiatives. The ISA, a consortium of solar-abundant nations, seeks to assist Global South countries in transitioning to clean energy and diminishing their reliance on fossil fuels. By advocating for solar energy, India not only mitigates climate change but also enhances energy autonomy and stimulates economic growth in the Global South. The ISA exemplifies robust South-South cooperation, wherein nations facing common challenges and opportunities collaborate to identify sustainable solutions. Moreover, India's adherence to the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) is fundamental to its foreign policy. The Sustainable Development Goals, encompassing objectives pertaining to affordable and clean energy, quality education, gender equality, and climate action, are fundamental priorities for India's Global South initiatives. India's endorsement of these global objectives demonstrates its dedication to promoting a more sustainable, inclusive, and equitable international framework. In this context, India promotes a global climate governance framework that prioritizes both mitigation and adaptation, along with financial assistance for the Global South.India's Global South Policy centers on promoting reforms in global governance institutions. India has consistently contended that global institutions, including the United Nations (UN), the World Trade Organization (WTO), the World Bank, and the International Monetary Fund (IMF), require reform to enhance the representation of developing countries in decision-making processes. India has persistently advocated for the incorporation of emerging economies within these institutions, especially in the UN Security Council and the decision-making bodies of the WTO and IMF.India's advocacy for reform arises from a commitment to guarantee that the needs and interests of the Global South are adequately represented in global governance. The existing frameworks of these institutions frequently benefit the Global North, which has historically prevailed in the global economic and political hierarchy. India's promotion of reforms aims to establish a more equitable and inclusive global governance framework, enabling developing nations to exert greater influence over decisions regarding trade, security, and climate change. This advocacy for reform extends beyond multilateral institutions. India has actively advocated for the interests of the Global South in several international forums, including the G77, BRICS, and the G20. India utilizes these platforms to elevate the voices of developing nations, guaranteeing that their concerns are acknowledged on significant global matters. India's initiatives to reform global institutions and advocate for inclusive decision-making are essential to its overarching foreign policy objective of cultivating a more equitable and just global order. India's diplomatic strategy towards the Global South is marked by both bilateral and multilateral interactions. India has diligently endeavored to fortify its relationships with regional organizations such as the African Union (AU), and the G77. These platforms enable India to foster regional cooperation, peace, and development, while offering a forum for tackling shared challenges such as poverty, inequality, and climate change. India's strategic alliances with nations in Africa, Southeast Asia, and Latin America have been pivotal in augmenting its global influence. India cultivates economic, political, and cultural alliances that enhance trust and promote collaboration on various issues. India's leadership in regional organizations has enabled it to act as a conduit between the Global South and the Global North, utilizing its relationships to foster more inclusive and equitable international relations. India significantly contributes to global peacekeeping missions and humanitarian initiatives. India, as a major contributor to UN peacekeeping operations, is pivotal in sustaining peace and stability in conflict-affected areas, especially in Africa and the Middle East. India's dedication to peace and security exemplifies its overarching principles of non-violence, diplomacy, and global collaboration. A fundamental principle of India's Global South Policy is its dedication to a non-hegemonic leadership approach. In contrast to certain global powers, India refrains from imposing its agenda or asserting leadership over other developing nations. India advocates for a collaborative and consultative methodology, emphasizing consensus-building and collective accountability. India's diplomatic involvement with the Global South is marked by inclusivity and collaboration. Instead of attempting to dominate the discourse, India underscores the significance of reciprocal respect and comprehension. This strategy enables India to cultivate trust with Global South nations, establishing itself as a leader genuinely invested in the collective welfare of all countries, rather than one that seeks to advance limited national interests. India's focus on a cooperative framework promotes unity among Global South nations, motivating them to collaborate in tackling shared challenges. This non-hegemonic strategy also mitigates the influence of other global powers, especially those in the Global North, ensuring that the perspectives of developing nations are acknowledged and valued. Challenges: Managing Complexities in an Evolving World Notwithstanding the achievements of India’s Global South Policy, there exist numerous challenges and criticisms that India must address. A major challenge is maintaining equilibrium in its relationships with both the Global South and the Global North. India is dedicated to championing the interests of developing nations while simultaneously preserving robust relationships with Global North countries, especially in defense, trade, and technology sectors. This balancing act can occasionally complicate India's position as a representative of the Global South, as it must maneuver through the conflicting interests of various global actors. Furthermore, India confronts substantial internal obstacles, encompassing poverty, inequality, and regional disparities. Critics contend that India's international position as a leader of the Global South occasionally conflicts with its domestic priorities. India's persistent developmental challenges, including rural poverty alleviation, enhancement of healthcare and education, and mitigation of income inequality, necessitate substantial focus and resources. As India enhances its international stature, it must concurrently address its domestic challenges in a manner that aligns with its commitments to the Global South. Conclusion India's Global South Policy represents a thorough and adaptive strategy in international diplomacy. India has positioned itself as a pivotal advocate for the interests of developing nations through development assistance, trade and investment, climate change advocacy, and global governance reform. India's dedication to peace, sustainable development, and cooperative diplomacy highlights its leadership within the Global South. Nonetheless, the difficulties of managing relations with the Global North while tackling internal developmental challenges persist as substantial. India's strategy towards the Global South is characterized by solidarity, cooperation, and advocacy, acknowledging that the future necessitates meticulous navigation and a sophisticated diplomatic approach.

Political Economy Contradictions As We Lurch Into 2025 – OpEd	The Republicans (GOP), traditionally the U.S.'s anti-tax party, now promise to use tariffs to wage trade wars, to massively deport immigrants, and to stop drug traffic. But tariffs are simply the name of one kind of tax (on imported goods and services). So the GOP becomes both anti-tax and pro-tax. Likewise, the traditional party of minimal government, today's GOP now favors massive subsidies to industries that big government will select as well as economic sanctions and bans on enterprises and whole countries that big government will select. Beyond the right-wing ideology and financial self-serving, Trump reflects deeper contradictions in the GOP's evolution. The GOP, traditionally the laissez-faire party of private enterprise, now favors increased government control of what private enterprises can and cannot offer in markets for reproductive healthcare, control medications and devices, and also for vaccines and drugs. The GOP, traditionally supporting 'freedom,' now insists on blocking the free movement of people across borders and favors protectionist economic policy over a commitment to 'free trade.' Some of Trump's cabinet nominees voice traditional GOP views while others pronounce the new anti-traditional positions. Some nominees do both. Trump does not resolve the deep contradictions in the GOP's message, thereby confusing both its messengers and its public audiences. In the moment, those contradictions give Trump some power. Amid the confusion, he decides. But soon conflicts among U.S. policies will expose the incoherence of Trump's project and thereby sap his power. The Democratic party was, at least since the Great Depression of the 1930s, the 'progressive' party of working people, unions, and oppressed minorities. Yet the rise of the 'centrists' across recent decades shifted the Democrats rightward. As they became grateful recipients of corporate and billionaires' donations, the Democrats increasingly supported the donor class by fielding 'moderate' candidates, moderating their policies and programs, and publicly marginalizing the party's remaining progressive wing. Privately, the Democrats' centrist leaders pleaded and maneuvered to retain the traditional support of labor unions, oppressed minorities, and educated professionals. Moderation rendered the Democrats' pursuit of gains for their traditional supporters ever less effective. So too did Democrats' hold on those constituencies' electoral commitments and loyalties dissipate. Success with donors contradicted deepening failures with voters, most starkly exposed in the 2024 election. Multiple, intense, and persistent contradictions within both parties suggest that some underlying, historic shifts may be underway. In my view, the first of those shifts is the peaking and subsequent decline in recent decades of the U.S. empire and its allies (especially the G7). This shift reflects and feeds the concurrent rise of the Global South, China, and the BRICS. A second shift is the accumulation of U.S. capitalism's internal economic problems and difficulties. These are inadequately acknowledged, let alone solved. Chief among the problems are the long-term worsening of wealth and income inequalities and the persistent boom-bust or recession-inflation cycles for which no solution has been found. In short, both the GOP and the Democrats have denied both shifts. Indeed, denial has so far been the parties' shared response to the linked declines of global empire and domestic capitalism. Denial rarely solves problems. It usually enables or provokes them to worsen until they explode. The key contradictions roiling political parties and their economic policies work parallel effects among professional economists. Unresolved, stale debates among economists react back upon policies, politicians, and public discourse to render them frustratingly powerless to fix what the public sees increasingly as a broken system. Starting with Adam Smith, David Ricardo, and the doctrine of laissez-faire and, especially since John Maynard Keynes, a huge portion of the profession has centered its work around an ongoing, seemingly endless debate. The question is whether our capitalist system is best served by minimal versus large, ongoing government interventions in its operation. Should we privilege pro-laissez-faire economics (the so-called neoclassical tradition) or governmental interventionist economics (the so-called Keynesian tradition) or some 'synthesis' of both? This debate figured prominently in U.S. university economics classes 20, 40, and 60 years ago much as it does in such classes today. The themes of that debate echoed prominently in the language of politics then and now. Occasionally, a few politicians recognized that the overdrawn oppositions, in theory, did not correspond all that well with actual practical politics. Nixon once said, 'We are all Keynesian now.' Clinton boasted that he had 'ended welfare as we know it.' Trump regularly excoriates Democrats as 'radical left lunatics' and includes 'fascists' among them. All three presidents were proved wrong, albeit quite self-assured, in making such confused and confusing statements. Yet the centrality of the private-versus-government dispute in both economic theory and policy continues. Its social usefulness lies more in what it excludes rather than in anything positive it includes. Putting that debate at the core of economics has helped prevent alternative cores from emerging that would challenge both neoclassical and Keynesian economics. One such alternative core would question whether top-down hierarchical organizations of production (the employer-employee model) better serve societies than horizontally egalitarian, democratic organizations (the worker coop model). Debates might then focus on which organization of production better preserves the natural environment, reduces income and wealth inequalities, overcomes cyclical economic instability, or advances the physical and mental health of people. The contradictions agitating discourses and practices these days may stem from the exhaustion of old economic and political traditions even as a new tradition is not yet clearly emerging. On the one hand, the U.S. and the UK now join Europe in turning clearly toward government-run protectionism instead of free trade. On the other, state-supervised China and India, among others, support free trade. The economic growth records of the USSR in the 20th century and of China in the 21st century undermine preferences for private over state-regulated capitalisms. The old debate yields no new light on such central economic issues these days as the rise of the BRICS bloc in the world economy relative to the declines of an already smaller G7 bloc and the U.S. dollar in world trade. Of course, economists and politicians whose resumes mark them as leading proponents of neoclassical economics and privatization keep trying—like their Keynesian counterparts—to sustain the old debates that made them relevant. If they succeed, it will be because a still prevailing system prefers to rehash the old rather than welcome and explore what is emerging. In any case, however, relentless change will continue to work its ways on a passing U.S. empire and its capitalist system. About the author: Richard D.

The Collapse Of Stability: How Scholz’s Ouster Could Redefine Eur...	Germany has long been viewed as a pillar of stability and progressive politics in Europe. However, the recent ousting of Chancellor Olaf Scholz following a dramatic confidence vote has plunged the country into political turmoil, signifying a potential shift in both Germany’s domestic path and its role within Europe. With a general election on the horizon and the meteoric rise of far-right factions, alongside the looming prospect of Donald Trump’s potential return to power in 2025, Germany's evolving political landscape could profoundly impact Europe’s unity and global standing. This essay argues that Scholz’s fall reflects deep-seated structural challenges within Germany, exacerbating European fragmentation and empowering far-right forces at a precarious time for transatlantic relations. Scholz's tenure was marked by an ambitious yet arduous agenda, including managing the economic fallout from the COVID-19 pandemic, navigating the energy crisis caused by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, and addressing Germany’s structural dependency on fossil fuels. While his government managed to weather immediate crises—such as securing gas supplies through diversification and reducing inflation from over 8% to 3% by late 2024—these achievements were overshadowed by growing public dissatisfaction. Voters criticized Scholz for perceived inertia, bureaucratic inefficiency, and failure to tackle systemic issues like housing shortages and immigrant integration. Meanwhile, escalating geopolitical tensions and a slowing German economy, which narrowly avoided recession in 2024, intensified scrutiny of his leadership. The far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) capitalized on this discontent, achieving unprecedented polling levels. By the end of 2024, the AfD had garnered 22% in polls, making it Germany’s second-strongest party behind the centre-right CDU/CSU. The party’s populist messaging—emphasizing immigration, national sovereignty, and Euroscepticism—resonated strongly in eastern Germany and among disillusioned working-class voters nationwide. Scholz’s failure to counteract this rise or address the growing polarization in Germany's political system ultimately sealed his fate. The confidence vote in the Bundestag revealed the fragility of Scholz’s coalition government, which comprised the Social Democrats (SPD), Greens, and Free Democrats (FDP). Disputes over climate policies, defence spending, and fiscal reforms fractured the coalition, ultimately leading to its collapse. The implications of Scholz’s ousting extend beyond Germany. As Europe’s largest economy and de facto leader, Germany's political stability is essential to the cohesion of the European Union. A weakened Germany risks emboldening illiberal forces within the EU, particularly in Hungary and Poland, while undermining collective efforts to address challenges such as climate change, migration, and economic inequality. A far-right presence in Germany’s next government—whether as a coalition partner or a powerful opposition force—could destabilize European unity. The AfD’s Eurosceptic stance and opposition to EU fiscal transfers might obstruct critical policy initiatives, from eurozone reform to advancing defence integration. Moreover, Scholz's fall underscores the fragility of centrist politics across Europe. As traditional parties grapple with addressing citizens’ concerns about economic precarity and cultural change, far-right and populist movements continue to gain traction. This trend—evident in Italy with Giorgia Meloni, France with Marine Le Pen, and now Germany with the AfD—threatens to erode liberal democratic norms across the continent. The resulting fragmentation could leave Europe vulnerable to external pressures from Russia’s aggression and China’s growing influence. Transatlantic relations further complicate this landscape. With the potential re-election of Donald Trump in 2025 looming large, Germany’s political turmoil raises questions about the future of U.S.-European relations. Trump’s first term was marked by strained ties with Germany—particularly over NATO spending, trade policies, and his perceived ambivalence toward European integration. A second Trump presidency could revive these tensions, especially if Germany’s next government includes far-right elements aligned with Trump’s nationalist agenda. Such a scenario would undermine transatlantic unity at a time when coordinated responses to global challenges—ranging from climate change to authoritarianism—are more critical than ever. The challenges arising from this situation are manifold. Domestically, Germany faces the dual challenge of containing far-right populism while addressing the socio-economic grievances fueling its rise. Scholz’s ousting has highlighted deep divisions within German society, from urban-rural disparities to generational divides on issues like climate action and cultural identity. The incoming government, whatever its composition, will need to balance competing demands for economic reform, energy transition, and social cohesion—all while maintaining Germany’s role as Europe’s anchor of stability. On a European level, Germany’s political crisis exacerbates existing tensions between member states, risking delays in critical reforms and weakening the EU’s global standing. Internationally, the intersection of German instability and a potential Trump return highlights the precarious state of the international liberal order. With authoritarian regimes in Russia and China seeking to exploit Western divisions, the stakes for maintaining a strong and united Europe could not be higher. In conclusion, Olaf Scholz’s fall from power marks a pivotal moment for both Germany and Europe. It reflects the broader challenges facing liberal democracies in an era of populist resurgence and geopolitical uncertainty. As Germany prepares for new elections, the stakes extend beyond the domestic sphere to the global stage. Whether Germany can navigate this political turning point will have lasting implications for the European project and its ability to counter illiberal forces both within and beyond its borders. The outcome will also shape Europe’s relationship with the United States, particularly if Donald Trump’s return to power signals a revival of transatlantic tensions. In this volatile environment, Germany’s choices will be closely monitored, with far-reaching consequences expected. The opinions expressed in this article are the author's own.

Taliban Infighting Adds To Afghanistan’s Woes – Analysis	By Luke Coffey The Taliban’s de facto minister of refugees and repatriation, Khalil Ur-Rahman Haqqani, was killed along with five others in a bomb explosion in Kabul last week. This marked the first time since the Taliban retook Afghanistan in 2021 that a senior member of the group had been assassinated. Haqqani’s assassination is significant not only because of his role in the Taliban, but also due to his family connections. He was the uncle of Sirajuddin Haqqani, the current de facto interior minister and senior leader of the Haqqani Network. During the early days after the Taliban recaptured Kabul in August 2021, Khalil Haqqani was responsible for the city’s security, making him a difficult target. His nephew oversees Afghanistan’s internal security, adding another layer of complexity to targeting the Haqqani family in Kabul. While Daesh immediately claimed responsibility for the attack, the situation may not be so straightforward. In the past, Daesh has been known to claim responsibility for attacks it had no part in to boost its image. A more plausible explanation is that this was an inside job, reflecting the fractured nature of the Taliban. From the outside, the Taliban might appear monolithic, but today’s group is not the same one that first took power during Afghanistan's civil war in the 1990s. After being ousted by international forces in 2001, the Taliban splintered over the next 20 years into competing factions. Now, there is a patchwork of groups vying for influence. The two prominent wings are the Haqqani faction, led by Sirajuddin Haqqani, and the Kandahari faction, led by Hibatullah Akhundzada. However, other factions also play significant roles, including the Baradar and Yaqoob wings of the Kandahari faction and non-Pashtun Taliban groups operating in northern Afghanistan. The most likely faction behind Khalil Haqqani’s assassination is the Kandahari faction. Tensions between Sirajuddin Haqqani and Akhundzada have been mounting, with both vying for greater influence. Sirajuddin Haqqani recently criticized Akhundzada during a madrasa graduation ceremony in Paghman, near Kabul. This public slight is thought to have triggered the assassination of Sirajuddin’s uncle. Such acts underscore the fragile and increasingly volatile dynamics within the Taliban’s leadership structure. These internal divisions make forming an effective Taliban government almost impossible. The assassination of a senior leader by another faction exacerbates an already precarious situation in Afghanistan. Each faction seeks to consolidate power, further destabilizing the country. Beyond Taliban infighting, millions of Afghans struggle daily to survive. According to a report by the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, 'more than half of Afghanistan’s population will require humanitarian assistance' this year. The report describes a dire situation, with widespread displacement, landmine contamination, restricted movement, gender-based violence, child labor, early marriage and increasing mental health needs. Minority ethnic groups such as Uzbeks, Tajiks and Hazaras face severe persecution and women’s rights have eroded to near nonexistence. Aside from limited roles in education and healthcare, women are effectively barred from the workforce and girls are denied education beyond the sixth grade. Under such conditions, the future of millions of Afghans is bleak. While girls are being deprived of education, young boys are being radicalized in Taliban-run schools. Recently, a Taliban official from the Ministry of Education announced a new exam titled 'Ideological War Against the West,' to be administered in schools and madrasas. This reflects the Taliban’s broader effort to indoctrinate a new generation of extremists, particularly against Western countries. Such actions not only rob Afghan children of a future, but they also lay the groundwork for continued cycles of violence and extremism. Meanwhile, the Taliban have done little to stem the growth of terrorist organizations in Afghanistan since their return to power in 2021. Groups such as Al-Qaeda and Daesh have only grown stronger amid the chaos. Daesh, in particular, has expanded its recruitment and conducted high-profile attacks, often targeting the Hazara community. A UN report this summer estimated that Daesh had between 4,000 and 6,000 fighters, despite leadership losses. The group has exploited the Taliban’s internal divisions and lack of governance, positioning itself as an alternative power center in Afghanistan. Al-Qaeda has similarly benefited from the Taliban’s return. The group maintains a close relationship with the Taliban, with cells operating across multiple provinces, primarily in the southeast. Al-Qaeda has also established new training camps, attracting fighters from across the region. In 2022, a US drone strike in Kabul killed Al-Qaeda leader Ayman Al-Zawahiri, underscoring the group’s reemergence in Afghanistan. The Taliban’s inability or unwillingness to rein in such groups raises significant concerns for regional and global security. Despite these alarming developments, the international community remains largely indifferent. Millions of Afghans continue to suffer through a humanitarian crisis and terrorist organizations flourish unchecked. The lack of international engagement leaves Afghanistan’s future in the hands of factions more focused on power struggles than governance. Khalil Haqqani’s assassination could further escalate tensions between the Haqqani and Kandahari factions, potentially leading to open conflict or even an internal civil war if retaliation occurs. Such a scenario would provide groups like Al-Qaeda and Daesh with an opportunity to exploit the ensuing chaos and strengthen their foothold in Afghanistan. Meanwhile, ordinary Afghans will continue to bear the brunt of violence, poverty and international neglect. As 2024 comes to a close, the outlook for Afghanistan remains grim. Unless the international community takes meaningful action, the country’s downward spiral will only accelerate, with devastating consequences for its people and global security.

Teenagers Fight US Militarization Of Palau With UN Complaint Over...	By Harry Pearl School students in Palau are taking on the United States military with a legal complaint to the United Nations over a 'rapid and unprecedented wave of militarization' in their Pacific island nation. They allege that American military activities are destroying ecosystems, disturbing sacred sites, threatening endangered species, and breaking laws that protect the environment and human rights. The American military presence in Palau, an independent state in free association with the U.S., has grown in recent years amid mounting geo-strategic tensions with China over Taiwan and the South China Sea. The archipelago’s location between the Philippines and Hawaii is part of a critical logistical network that allows the U.S. to move through the western Pacific and project power in East Asia. But the military buildup in Palau is stoking unease among some in the country of 20,000 people, who worry their culture and pristine environment could be compromised. Imaim Ngiraboi, 16, said it was a 'bit intimidating' standing up to the world’s most powerful military, but it was important to inform people what was going on. 'As youth, we should be able to have a say in this and think about what we want from our future,' she told BenarNews in the city of Koror. She is one of the seven teenagers, aged between 15 and 18, leading the pushback against U.S. military activity. Over the past year they travelled the length of the country visiting defense sites, interviewing local communities and documenting environmental impacts. Last month the students filed a submission to the U.N. special rapporteur on the rights to a healthy environment and the special rapporteur on the rights of Indigenous peoples. Together with the Ebiil Society, a local nonprofit, and human rights lawyers in Guam, they alleged American military violations of environmental laws and indigenous rights in Palau. The group is among a young generation of Pacific activists using international legal mechanisms to fight for their rights, such as law students from Vanuatu who asked the International Court of Justice to give an opinion on states’ obligations to combat climate change. ‘Bulldozing’ through Palau Palau is one of three Pacific island countries including the Marshall Islands and Federated States of Micronesia that give the U.S. exclusive military authority in their territories in exchange for economic assistance under compacts of free association. The U.S. is now using the 'compact provisions, which have never before been invoked, to justify a rapid and unprecedented wave of militarization throughout Palau,' according to the U.N. submission. The Palauan students’ complaint is focused on six U.S. military sites spread between Palau’s northernmost tip and its southernmost edge, including an over-the-horizon radar facility and a WWII-era airstrip being upgraded by U.S. Marines on the island of Peleliu. In many cases, the U.S. military had not undertaken adequate community consultation or obtained informed consent, said the teenagers, who conducted their research as a part of a social science class organized by the Ebiil Society. 'Most of the people we interviewed didn’t know about what was going on in their communities,' said 16-year-old Kimie-Maki Kelau Singeo. 'They didn’t tell the community. They were asking us questions.' Ann Singeo, the Ebiil Society’s executive director, said environmental and cultural protection laws were being 'violated left and right' across Palau. 'It’s almost like they are bulldozing their way through the islands,' the veteran environmental advocate told BenarNews. U.S. Indo-Pacific Command, which oversees American forces in the region, did not respond to multiple requests for comment for this story. But Palau President Surangel Whipps rejected any accusations that environmental laws had been broken or that local communities had not been adequately informed about military projects. Whipps acknowledged there were concerns about militarization in the community, but argued that for a small nation like Palau, which has been subject to 'unfriendly behavior' by China, having the protection of the U.S. was a good thing. 'We’ve always been a target because of our location, whether we like it or not,' he told BenarNews in an interview. 'During World War II, we were a target and that’s why Japan built all the infrastructure here and used Palau because of our location. 'If you're going to be a target, you need to make sure that you’re protected. Our forefathers decided that the best relationship that we could have with the United States is in free association … but as partners, we have some obligations.' An aerial view of a causeway between islands near Koror in Palau on Dec. 2, 2024. [Rivers Reklai/BenarNews] The U.N. submission is not the only complaint concerning U.S. military activity in Palau. Angaur, the southernmost of Palau’s 16 states, is suing the U.S. and Palau governments and American military contractors for alleged violations of environmental laws and the compact of free association for work on the receiver of a 'Tactical Mobile Over-the-Horizon Radar,' or TACMOR. The TACMOR’s accompanying transmitter facility is being built in the northern state of Ngaraard, which has also accused the Palau government of deficiencies in the environmental permit process and requested approval to be rescinded, local media have reported. Nest Mechaet, a state legislator for Elab hamlet where the transmitter facility is located, said the community of about 23 households was still largely in the dark about the potential environmental impacts. She said there were fears that earthmoving might damage historical sites and affect sediment flows into the marine environment nearby, which is home to endangered dugongs, turtles and saltwater crocodiles. 'Some old people say there are ancient stone platforms here,' she told BenarNews, looking out over the bay below where the radar will be positioned. 'There are mangrove clams, sea cucumbers, fish – you name it. People are out there for food.' It’s unclear what impact the Angaur lawsuit or calls for a review of the permit in Ngaraard will have on the radar, which the U.S. had originally aimed to complete by 2026. The U.S. radar system, which will add to American early-warning capabilities for the western Pacific, is expected to bring economic benefits to the island including higher paying jobs and rental incomes. On the island of Peleliu, where U.S. Marines are revamping the Japanese wartime airfield, some local chiefs and former legislators are seeking an injunction against a proposed constitutional amendment concerning military activity in the state. Peleliu’s constitution currently requires the approval by 75% of residents in a referendum for any permanent military facilities to be built on the island or training to take place – a provision adopted after WWII. Under the amendment, which was put on the ballot of a Dec. 3 state election, the article would be repealed and authority on military matters transferred exclusively to the governor and legislature, according to court documents reviewed by BenarNews. It also proposes reducing the size of the state government from 15 members to 11 and removing five seats reserved for traditional chiefs. Whipps described a lot of the criticism about U.S. military projects in Palau as 'misinformation' and suggested it was possibly 'another Chinese attempt to convince people that things are really worse than they really are.' But Singeo, from the Ebiil Society, said it was important to mobilize young people to fight for the 'survival of a culture and nation.' 'No matter how strong they are, how big they are, this is not their home,' she said. 'For me as an adult, to not support the kids to do this is the same as condemning them to a future of chaos, conflict and keeping their head down not saying anything.'	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWd04GLTLb2d8tORlbs475ok	2024-12-20T15:38:33-08:00	
Srinivasa Ramanujan: A Luminary In The World Of Mathematics – Ana...	Srinivasa Ramanujan was born on 22 December 1887 in Erode, a small town in Tamil Nadu, India, into a Tamil Brahmin Iyengar family. His father, Kuppuswamy Srinivasa Iyengar, worked as a clerk in a sari shop, while his mother, Komalatammal, was a housewife who also sang devotional songs at a local temple. Ramanujan's early years were marked by both familial affection and challenges. As a child, he moved frequently between Erode, his birthplace, and Kumbakonam, where the family eventually settled. Even as a young boy, Ramanujan displayed an exceptional aptitude for mathematics. His mother played a significant role in nurturing his early education, ensuring that he adhered to Brahminical traditions while also fostering his intellectual curiosity. At the age of 10, he excelled in his primary school examinations, showcasing his talent in subjects like arithmetic, English, Tamil, and geography. This early success laid the foundation for a life dedicated to the pursuit of knowledge. Formal Education and Initial Struggles Srinivasa Ramanujan's journey in formal education was marked by a blend of brilliance and challenges that ultimately shaped his unconventional path in mathematics. Born in a modest Brahmin family, Ramanujan demonstrated exceptional intellectual capabilities from an early age. By the time he was 10 years old, he had mastered arithmetic and other basic mathematical concepts, excelling in his studies at Kangayan Primary School and later at Town Higher Secondary School in Kumbakonam. However, the rigid educational structure and limited resources available in his environment often clashed with his unique learning style and profound curiosity for advanced mathematical concepts. In school, Ramanujan's aptitude for mathematics became evident when he began to solve complex problems beyond the scope of his curriculum. His teachers and peers recognized his extraordinary talent, but his focus on mathematics came at the expense of other subjects. By the time he was 16, Ramanujan had independently studied advanced topics such as trigonometry, infinite series, and calculus. He encountered 'A Synopsis of Elementary Results in Pure and Applied Mathematics' by G.S. Carr, a compilation of 5,000 theorems and results. This book profoundly influenced him, serving as his primary resource for learning and experimentation. Yet, it also contributed to his unorthodox approach, as Ramanujan often skipped proofs and focused on deriving results intuitively. Despite his exceptional skills, Ramanujan faced significant struggles in his formal education. His obsession with mathematics led him to neglect other subjects, resulting in poor academic performance. He failed to secure a degree at Government College in Kumbakonam and later at Pachaiyappa's College in Madras, as he could not pass the required exams in non-mathematical subjects. This lack of formal qualifications created barriers to securing stable employment and gaining recognition in academic circles. Ramanujan's financial situation further compounded his struggles. Coming from a humble background, he relied on scholarships and patronage to pursue his education. The loss of his scholarship due to poor performance in non-mathematical subjects left him without a clear path forward. Undeterred, Ramanujan continued his mathematical research independently, filling notebooks with groundbreaking theories, formulas, and results. His work during this period was both prolific and innovative, but he lacked the means to validate or communicate his findings within the established academic community. These initial struggles highlight the systemic challenges faced by individuals with unconventional talents. Ramanujan's journey underscores the importance of flexible educational frameworks that can accommodate diverse learning styles and exceptional abilities. His perseverance during this period laid the foundation for his later achievements and eventual recognition as one of the greatest mathematicians in history. Breakthrough and Correspondence with G.H. Hardy Srinivasa Ramanujan's breakthrough and his subsequent correspondence with G.H. Hardy represent a pivotal chapter in the history of mathematics, underscoring the power of cross-cultural collaboration and intellectual recognition. Despite lacking formal training and working in relative isolation, Ramanujan's genius was evident in his self-taught discoveries. By 1912, his notebooks were brimming with hundreds of original results, many of which were unlike anything seen in the mathematical canon. However, his unorthodox methodologies and lack of academic credentials posed significant barriers to having his work recognized by the established mathematical community. Ramanujan's determination and belief in his work drove him to seek validation from mathematicians who could understand the depth and significance of his findings. In 1913, Ramanujan wrote a historic letter to G.H. Hardy, a renowned mathematician at the University of Cambridge, enclosing a sample of his work. The letter contained around 120 theorems, identities, and conjectures, many of which were groundbreaking. Hardy, upon receiving the letter, initially thought it might be a prank due to the unusual nature of the results. However, as he delved deeper into the theorems, he realized their brilliance. Among the included results were formulas for the partition function, modular equations, and highly efficient series for calculating π. Hardy, along with his colleague J.E. Littlewood, spent hours analyzing Ramanujan's work. Hardy later described the moment as one of the most significant in his mathematical career, likening the discovery of Ramanujan to 'finding a rare exotic bird.' Hardy quickly recognized Ramanujan's potential and extended an invitation for him to come to Cambridge. The invitation marked the beginning of an extraordinary partnership. However, the journey to Cambridge was not straightforward. Ramanujan faced personal and cultural challenges. As a devout Brahmin, he adhered to strict dietary and religious practices, which initially made him hesitant to travel abroad. With the support of friends, family, and mentors, he ultimately decided to accept Hardy's invitation, recognizing the opportunity to advance his mathematical work. Upon arriving in Cambridge in 1914, Ramanujan and Hardy embarked on a collaboration that would redefine mathematics. Hardy provided Ramanujan with the formal structure and rigorous proofs that were often missing from his intuitive findings. In turn, Ramanujan's originality and deep insights challenged Hardy's conventional perspectives. Together, they published several papers on partitions, modular forms, and infinite series. Their collaboration not only solidified Ramanujan's position as one of the greatest mathematicians of his time but also laid the groundwork for several modern mathematical disciplines. The correspondence between Ramanujan and Hardy remains a testament to the transformative power of mentorship, mutual respect, and intellectual curiosity. Hardy's recognition of Ramanujan's talent allowed the latter's genius to flourish on an international stage, leaving a legacy that continues to inspire generations of mathematicians. Key Contributions to Mathematics 1. Number Theory Ramanujan’s work in number theory is monumental. His research on partitions—the ways in which numbers can be expressed as sums of positive integers—led to the development of the partition function p(n). His profound insights into the properties of numbers also led to the discovery of Ramanujan Primes, a unique sequence of prime numbers with intriguing properties. These contributions have laid the groundwork for modern combinatorial mathematics and have inspired generations of mathematicians. 2. Infinite Series and Continued Fractions Ramanujan developed highly efficient series for calculating π, such as: This formula, discovered in 1910, remains one of the fastest-converging series for π. His work on continued fractions also broke new ground, providing valuable tools for approximation theory and mathematical analysis. 3. Modular Forms and Elliptic Functions Ramanujan’s collaboration with Hardy advanced the understanding of modular forms and elliptic functions. One of the most famous anecdotes from this period involves the number 1729, known as the 'Hardy-Ramanujan number.' This number is the smallest integer expressible as the sum of two cubes in two distinct ways: Ramanujan’s Notebooks Ramanujan's notebooks are among the most celebrated artifacts in the history of mathematics. These notebooks, filled with dense and intricate mathematical formulas, have captivated mathematicians for over a century. Comprising three primary volumes and a 'lost notebook' discovered decades later, these manuscripts reveal the depth of Ramanujan’s genius and the sheer breadth of his mathematical explorations. What makes these notebooks particularly extraordinary is the fact that Ramanujan often presented results without detailed proofs, relying instead on his unparalleled intuition and ability to discern complex relationships among numbers. Many of the theorems and equations contained in these pages were far ahead of their time and have since become a focal point for mathematical research. The original three notebooks contain over 3,900 results, including formulas, identities, and conjectures. These results span diverse areas such as number theory, infinite series, continued fractions, and modular forms. Some of these findings were groundbreaking, while others provided elegant solutions to long-standing problems. Despite the lack of formal derivations, the accuracy and originality of these results have been consistently verified by later mathematicians, cementing Ramanujan's place as one of the most innovative thinkers in mathematical history. One of the most remarkable aspects of Ramanujan’s notebooks is their influence on contemporary mathematics. Scholars such as G.N. Watson and B.M. Wilson took up the task of deciphering and proving many of the results after Ramanujan’s death. Their work revealed a treasure trove of mathematical insights that continue to inspire research today. For instance, the modular equations and transformations described in these notebooks have been instrumental in the development of modern number theory and string theory in physics. Additionally, the famous Ramanujan theta function, first noted in these notebooks, has found applications in areas ranging from cryptography to the study of black holes. The discovery of Ramanujan's 'lost notebook' in 1976 added another dimension to his legacy. This document, containing around 600 formulas and results, is believed to have been written during the final year of his life. The contents of the lost notebook are particularly intriguing, as they explore mock theta functions, a concept that remained mysterious for decades. These functions, now an integral part of modern mathematical theory, demonstrate Ramanujan’s ability to intuitively predict the future trajectory of mathematical research. The notebooks also shed light on Ramanujan’s creative process. They reveal a mathematician who was not bound by the traditional methods of formal proof but instead relied on a deep and instinctive understanding of numbers. This unconventional approach, while sometimes baffling to his contemporaries, enabled him to leapfrog over intermediate steps and arrive at results that were both profound and beautiful. The pages of his notebooks are a testament to his relentless curiosity and passion for discovery. Today, Ramanujan’s notebooks are housed at the University of Madras and the Trinity College Library in Cambridge, where they are carefully preserved and studied. They serve as a source of inspiration for mathematicians worldwide, symbolizing the boundless possibilities of human creativity and intellect. The ongoing analysis of these documents continues to yield new insights, proving that Ramanujan’s genius transcends the constraints of time. His notebooks remain a living legacy, reminding us of the extraordinary contributions of a self-taught mathematician whose work reshaped the landscape of mathematics. Later Years and Legacy The later years of Srinivasa Ramanujan’s life, though marked by immense productivity, were also fraught with challenges, particularly concerning his health. After spending nearly five years in England, Ramanujan’s health began to deteriorate, exacerbated by the harsh English climate, dietary restrictions, and the emotional toll of being far from home. By 1919, his condition had worsened to the point where he was compelled to return to India. His illness, now believed to have been hepatic amoebiasis—a severe liver infection stemming from complications of dysentery—left him physically weakened but mentally undeterred. Even in his final months, Ramanujan remained intellectually active, producing groundbreaking work that continued to astonish mathematicians long after his death. Upon his return to India, Ramanujan was warmly received by the academic community, which had begun to recognize the extraordinary depth of his contributions. He was appointed as the first Indian Fellow of the Royal Society in 1918, one of the most prestigious honors in the scientific world, making him only the second Indian to achieve this distinction. Additionally, he was elected as a Fellow of Trinity College, Cambridge, an acknowledgment of his immense contributions to mathematics during his time in England. These accolades, however, could do little to alleviate his declining health. During his last year, Ramanujan worked on what is now famously referred to as his 'lost notebook,' a collection of results and conjectures that he compiled during his final days. Rediscovered decades after his death, this notebook contained insights into mock theta functions, a concept that has since become a cornerstone in the study of modular forms and q-series. These findings, described as ahead of their time, have continued to inspire and challenge mathematicians, offering profound implications in fields ranging from number theory to theoretical physics. Ramanujan passed away on 26 April 1920 at the age of 32, leaving behind a legacy that remains unparalleled. His untimely death was a significant loss to the world of mathematics, yet the body of work he left behind has ensured his immortality in the annals of mathematical history. Over the years, his contributions have been revisited, validated, and expanded upon, cementing his status as one of the greatest mathematical minds of all time. The legacy of Srinivasa Ramanujan extends far beyond his equations and theorems.

Former Israel Defense Minister: The Israel Government Has Been En...	Moshe Ya’alon has been making news for his declarations that the Israel government has been engaging in ethnic cleansing in Gaza. Many people have been making this claim. But, Ya’alon stands out because of his former high level positions in the Israel government and its military — the Israel Defense Force (IDF). Ya’alon was minister of defense for the Israel government from 2013 through 2016. Previous roles of Ya’alon in the Israel government include minister of strategic affairs and vice prime minister. Before that, he had high positions in the IDF, culminating in being chief of staff from 2002-2005. Earlier this month, a Times of Israel article discussed Ya’alon’s comments highly critical of the Israel government’s recent actions in Gaza: Ya’alon, who served as a lawmaker in Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s Likud party and as defense minister under him, resigned in 2016, citing deep distrust in Netanyahu’s leadership, and has since become a staunch critic of the premier.Again doubling down on his comments from the previous evening — after also doing so in an interview with the Kan public broadcaster earlier in the day — he said he believed his assessment to be ‘accurate,’ and that there is ‘no other word for it’ but ethnic cleansing, given that government ministers speak about how ‘the Strip will be cleansed of Arabs.’Asked whether he wanted to take back his use of the phrase, given that it is ‘extremely harsh,’ Ya’alon reiterated that he spoke the way he did ‘on purpose, to sound the alarm.’ This week, an Israel government official responded to Ya’alon’s comments. Diaspora Affairs and Combating Antisemitism Minister Amichai Chikli, as reported in a Monday Jerusalem Post article, 'criticized Ya’alon’s remarks on Sunday, emphasizing their impact, sparking widespread backlash and being amplified by global media outlets.' Instead of complaining about Ya’alon’s comments creating a bunch of bad publicity for the Israel government, Israel leaders could concentrate on reevaluating and redirecting the nation’s military actions so accusations such as those made by Ya’alon no longer ring true to people around the world. And the United States government would do well to tell the Israel government that financial and other support critical for Israel’s war effort is over.

Borders Beyond: The Future Of EU-ASEAN Trade Cooperation In 2025 ...	The European Union (EU) and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) have maintained a strong trade relationship for several decades. As of 2024, the EU is ASEAN's third-largest trading partner, while ASEAN ranks as the EU's fifth-largest partner. This interdependence fosters mutual economic growth, innovation, and geopolitical influence for both regions. However, contemporary challenges such as supply chain disruptions, geopolitical tensions, and the climate crisis necessitate resilience and innovation in future EU-ASEAN trade cooperation. This essay argues that the future of EU-ASEAN trade depends on addressing structural and geopolitical challenges while seizing opportunities for sustainable development, digital transformation, and enhanced multilateralism. The trade relationship between the EU and ASEAN is marked by significant economic interdependence. In 2024, trade in goods between the two blocs reached €262 billion, indicating a steady recovery from disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic and geopolitical tensions. The EU serves as a vital export market for ASEAN's electronics, machinery, and agricultural products, while ASEAN imports high-value goods such as pharmaceuticals, machinery, and luxury items from Europe. Additionally, EU foreign direct investment (FDI) in ASEAN reached €47 billion in 2024, solidifying the EU’s position as one of the largest investors in the region. This economic interdependence is further bolstered by frameworks like the EU-Singapore Free Trade Agreement (FTA) and the EU-Vietnam FTA, along with ongoing discussions about a potential bloc-to-bloc FTA. Despite progress, significant challenges threaten the potential for deeper trade cooperation. A primary obstacle is the divergence in regulatory frameworks and trade standards. While the EU emphasizes stringent environmental and labour product safety standards, ASEAN member states operate within a more varied regulatory landscape. This discrepancy often leads to non-tariff barriers that impede smooth trade. For example, the EU's deforestation regulation, implemented in 2023, has raised concerns among ASEAN nations about its implications for agricultural exports, particularly palm oil. Bridging these regulatory gaps will require deeper dialogue and capacity-building initiatives from both regions, ensuring that ASEAN producers can meet EU standards without compromising economic viability. Geopolitical challenges pose significant obstacles for the European Union (EU) and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN). Both entities function within a multipolar world marked by rising tensions among major powers, particularly the United States and China. ASEAN's strategic location in the Indo-Pacific region positions it as a vital partner for the EU, which seeks to strengthen its Indo-Pacific strategy. However, ASEAN's principle of non-alignment complicates its ability to fully align with the EU's geopolitical priorities. Additionally, issues such as disputes in the South China Sea and the political crisis in Myanmar create internal divisions within ASEAN, impeding its capacity to present a united front in trade negotiations with external partners, including the EU. Despite these challenges, the potential for EU-ASEAN trade cooperation remains promising, especially in the areas of sustainable development and digital transformation. Both regions have committed to ambitious climate goals, with the EU’s European Green Deal and ASEAN’s green initiatives laying a strong foundation for collaboration. The EU's expertise in renewable energy and green technologies could significantly support ASEAN’s transition to a low-carbon economy. Collaborative projects in solar and wind energy, as well as investments in sustainable infrastructure, could drive economic growth while yielding environmental benefits. Digital transformation is another critical area of opportunity. With ASEAN's digital economy projected to surpass $1 trillion by 2030, the region offers substantial prospects for EU technology and innovation-driven enterprises. Collaborative initiatives in e-commerce, cybersecurity, and digital trade standards could open new economic avenues while addressing challenges related to data privacy and digital inequality. Furthermore, the EU-ASEAN Digital Partnership, established in 2023, provides a framework for deeper engagement in the digital sector. To maximize their trade relationship, the EU and ASEAN must prioritize multilateralism and enhance their institutional frameworks. As members of the World Trade Organization (WTO), both regions play a crucial role in advocating for global trade reforms, particularly concerning dispute resolution and e-commerce. Moreover, ASEAN’s goal of deeper economic integration through initiatives like the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) offers the EU an opportunity for more strategic engagement with the region. By leveraging existing bilateral agreements and promoting a comprehensive EU-ASEAN Free Trade Agreement (FTA), both blocs can strengthen their economic ties and enhance resilience against global uncertainties. In conclusion, the future of trade cooperation between the European Union (EU) and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) depends on their ability to tackle significant challenges while seizing shared opportunities. Regulatory discrepancies, geopolitical tensions, and internal divisions within ASEAN present considerable obstacles; however, these challenges can be overcome. By enhancing dialogue, building capacity, and making strategic investments in sustainable and digital economies, the EU and ASEAN can develop a partnership that not only drives economic growth but also promotes global stability and sustainability. As we approach the year 2025, both regions must take urgent and ambitious actions to ensure the ongoing prosperity of their trade relationship in an increasingly complex global landscape.

Africa Transcending Into BRICS+ Orbit – Analysis	After the historic 16th BRICS summit held in October 2024, three African States Algeria, Nigeria and Uganda, among others in Europe (Belarus and Turkey), Asia and Latin America, recognizably became BRICS+ partner states. In total, thirteen countries received BRICS partner status, according to declaration reports by Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs. This category of 'partner states' was primarily designated as part of the distinctive-focused leeway towards acquiring full membership status in determined future. The legitimate implications for being in this category are quite notable and provide colorful heterogeneity to the BRICS+ association. It also encompasses a growing influence, the bubbling upliftment of these countries on another level of global stage. And of course, these cannot be under-estimated in discussing BRICS+ especially in the era of shifting economic architecture and geopolitical situation. Together, the BRICS members encompass nearly a third of the world's land surface and almost half of world population. Reminding that BRICS is an informal association of emerging economies, comprising Brazil, Russia, India, China, South Africa, with the latest addition Ethiopia, Egypt, Iran, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. Argentina declined to join in the last moment. Despite various criticisms raised against a number of countries that ascended into the category of 'partner states' for BRICS+, each has its own strategic dimension. In assessing particularly African countries - Algeria (North Africa), Nigeria (West Africa) and Uganda (East Africa) - BRICS+ now, has, in the first place, a wider geographical representation across Africa. It is important to reiterate here that Ethiopia, Egypt and South Africa are full-fledged BRICS members. Ethiopia, by all standards, is a reputable country in East Africa. The continental organisation African Union (AU) is headquartered in its capital, Addis Ababa. Egypt, considered to be a regional power, also plays invaluable roles within the Arab world, specifically in North Africa and in the Middle-East region. Without much doubts, the new 'partner states' - Algeria, Nigeria and Uganda have indicated their collective commitment to the multifaceted ideals in the declaration adopted in Kazan, Tatarstan Republic. BRICS' numerical expansion and quality transformation in January 2024, and the creation of 'partner states' in October 2024, both under Russia's BRICS+ chairmanship has undoutedly opened doors to new partnerships opportunities for Africa. The strongest question centered on how BRICS' African partnering states, Algeria, Nigeria and Uganda can strategically position itself to benefit from the evolving dynamics within BRICS+ while, in this new geopolitical reality, simultaneously navigating for competing geopolitical interests in Africa. There are emerging challenges, but BRICS’s influence is growing provides an impetus for strengthen relations and work systemacally for economic growth especially in the processes of reshaping economic architecture in this fast-rising multipolar world. Nigeria and Uganda, as potential partners in the BRICS, could engage in several collaborative initiatives to enhance their economic political and social developments, including trade and investment. For instance, Nigeria, with its natural resources and increasingly large market, and Uganda, with its agricultural potential, can collaborate to boost intra-BRICS trade and that of intra-Africa trade. In adition to this, exploring investment opportunities in sectors such as manufacturing, production innovation and technology have a clean basis to add value to the raw materials and transform them into exportable products. Closing related to above, are pertinent questions of ensuring energy seurity and infrastructure (transport logistics). Nearly all African countries are griffing for support in technology transfer, fintech - these largely depend on sustainable energy supply. Consequently, joint initiatives could harness the capabilities of BRICS members, particularly China, India and Russia in these sectors. By leveraging their respective strengths and, with a focused approach, Nigeria and Uganda could address these shortfalls and deficits, and further down extend assistance across West Africa, and in East Africa. One key advantage, Uganda has Ethiopia and Egypt as BRICS members, ready-made basis for BRICS collaboration despite the differences and persistent conflicts in the region. The basic requirement here is to find common understanding and distinctive focused sectors for joint collaboration. Comparatively, there are much proven evidences and features, including its size of economic power and wealth, leader in Africa as an energy power and an abundant supply of natural resources. This West African country runs the third position behind Egypt and South Africa, and that Nigeria is qualified for a full-fledged BRICS membership. Nigeria is often referred to as the Giant of Africa by its citizens due to its large population (estimated at 220m) with a large economy, and is considered to be an emerging market by the World Bank. It is, however, believed Nigeria's foreign relations with the Western powers may be a major reason the country has not yet subscribed to BRICS membership. Despite this identified political complexity and authorities however maintain a concrete decision be made over the next two years, Nigeria's expected role in BRICS+ could augment Africa's capability to influence regional trade, economics and politics. Reports monitored indicated that Nigeria runs a deliberative democratic system. As part of a new foreign policy push to have its voice heard in important global organisations, the Federal Executive Council, and even the National Assembly have to make deliberations and official majority decision towards joining the BRICS+ association. Meanwhile, Nigeria is currently in the well-meaning and clearly defined 'partner states' category which guarantees collaboration and partnership with BRICS+ members. In addition, it has the possibility of balancing its national interests with the collective goals of the BRICS. South Africa which ascended BRICS more than a decade ago has noticeably benefited from its membership. Ethiopia, which was granted BRICS membership status in January 2024 along with Egypt, has significant working relations with China, Russia and India. Based on its strong partnership, China has financed the 20-story office complex, is one of the most prominent political buildings in Addis Ababa. It was fully funded, designed, built, and furnished by China as a $200m gift to Africa. While India's case need not be over-emphasized and reiterated, Russia has also followed suit by exploring and making economic investments in Ethiopia. In November 2022, Algeria officially applied for membership in BRICS. But its official application for BRICS+ membership, at first, attracted debates, experts raised controversial points in connection with its role with neighbouring Morocco and particularly the Sahel States, including Mali and Niger which are currently undergoing some tectonic political changes and reforms. Algeria, located in the Maghreb region of North Africa, has strategic importance for external powers such as United States, Europe, China and Russia as well as those in the Middle-East. Its capital and largest city Algiers, situated in the far north on the Mediterranean coast, is considered as a gateway into the North Africa, by foreign players. It has a budget of €15.4 billion and provides the bulk of funding through a number of programmes, as it is included into the the European Union's European Neighbourhood Policy (ENP) which aims at bringing the EU and its neighbours closer. After studying various reports, Algeria has passed through a chequered journey, in fact handling it as potential opportunity to balance its Maghreb regional position, at least, by obtaining BRICS 'partner status' in October 2024. There were serious reports that India vetoed Algeria BRICS+ entry at France's request. Tension arose over Burkina Faso, Mali and Niger geopolitical crisis in the region, Algeria opposed an ECOWAS military operation in Niger, and emphasized the role of diplomacy in bringing about a peaceful solution to the crisis, and refused permission for French military aircraft to fly over Algerian airspace. It was further explained that Paris reportedly pushed New Delhi into using its veto as ‘revenge’ against Algiers for its growing influence in the Sahel and Maghreb region, and as a way to slow down burgeoning ties between Algeria and China. Nonetheless, Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva also opposed Algeria's entry, according to Anadolu Agency. But while Algeria surpasses Ethiopia in the size of the economy and oil production and, Ethiopia and Egypt in terms of the volume of gas exports, China backed by Russia pushed Algeria to be accepted for partnership status in BRICS+, with future possibility of attaining full membership. China sees great potential due to its strategic location between Europe and sub-Saharan Africa. China is funding the rehabilitation of the strategic Port of El Hamdania, as Algeria remains an essential part of the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI). On the sidelines of the ninth annual meeting of the BRICS New Development Bank (NDB) held in Cape Town, Algeria was authorized to become a member of this financial entity. With its 'partner status', Algeria intended to buy shares in the BRICS New Development Bank (NDB) for $1.5 billion. In the opinion of Dilma Vana Rousseff, Chair of the New Development Bank, the move by the joining the bank would mark Algeria's integration into the global financial system as the ninth member of the multilateral development institution. On the other hand, Algeria plans to use its fast-tracked initiatives and its 'partner status' to ultimately attract BRICS+ members to invest in the free industrial zone with Mauritania and Niger, and then with Tunisia and Libya. Algerian President Abdelmadjid Tebboune underlined this to have massive geopolitical ramifications, and could be important to the emerging multipolar goals in the Global South. Furthermore, Tebboune outlined his government's plans for economic development over the next 12 months, including the possibility to boost investments, improve human development, and shift towards a more advanced export structure relying less on hydrocarbons to qualify for membership into BRICS. With this high desire to be in BRICS+, Algeria still considers Western countries as important partners in trade, security, and in other economic areas. Lately, the BRICS countries have been getting more involved in Africa. The New Development Bank (NDB) was set up to help fund infrastructure and sustainable development projects, not just in BRICS countries but now in other growing economies too. It's seen as an alternative to big players like the IMF and the World Bank. The NDB, founded in 2015 by the BRICS countries—Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa—aims to mobilize resources for infrastructure and sustainable development projects in emerging economies. It complements the work of existing multilateral and regional financial institutions in promoting global economic growth. In 2021, the bank expanded its membership to include Bangladesh, Egypt, the UAE, and Uruguay. Despite multiple obstacles within the Arab Maghreb Union, specifically persistent conflict between Algeria and Morocco, in August 2021, Algeria ultimately announced the break of diplomatic relations with Morocco. Besides this, Algeria relations is not very cordial with with Ethiopia and Egypt which are BRICS membership. As a result, its request to join BRICS was slightly opposed by Ethiopia and Egypt. And of course, Ethiopia and Egypt have conflicts over the Grand Renaissance Dam (GERD) and the Nile river. While Algeria remains an inescapable candidate for BRICS+, both African and foregn experts have argued that with the completion of the Trans-Saharan Highway, it is well positioned to develop BRICS-Sub-Saharan trade. The possibilities are immense, and their sponsorship would make Algeria a truly indispensable member of the BRICS. In June 2024, the World Bank's 2024 report marks a turning point for Algeria, which joins the select club of upper-middle-income countries. This economic rise, the result of an ambitious development strategy, places the country in the same category as emerging powers such as China, Brazil and Turkey. In recent years, the Algerian government has halted the privatization of state-owned industries and imposed restrictions on imports and foreign involvement in its economy. This restrictions would make prevent it from benefiting largely from BRICS+ trade and investment platform created during the summit in Kazan. That, however, China and Russia have comparatively less practical investment than the Gulf States. For instance, Turkish direct investments have accelerated in Algeria, with total value reaching $5 billion. As of 2022, the number of Turkish companies present in Algeria has reached 1,400, far lower than Russia and China, and any other BRICS+ in an anticipated positive direction. Algeria has the 10th largest reserves of natural gas in the world and is the 6th largest gas exporter. Despite its huge natural resources, majority of the country's population (an estimated 45.6 million) is still noticeably impoverished, the overall rate of unemployment was 11.8% in 2023. South Africa, Ethiopia and Egypt (full members of BRICS+), and Algeria, Nigeria and Uganda (as partner states) have the potential of bringing various multifaceted economic and social advantages to the African continent and to a new level at the side of BRICS+ association. In many areas, the partnership could be delivered that are beneficial to Africa, although African members of BRICS+ need to utilize the partnership to the fullest in terms of the potential of the available resources, the potential usefulness of African Continental Free Trade (AfCFTA) and the emerging business opportunities. Last but not the least, there is also the need to align these different kinds of partnership to the common strategic objectives of the African Union.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfgCDIw0DiRpVUJaX-bp6BN	2024-12-20T09:47:50-08:00	
The Evolving India-UAE Defense Partnership: Shaping A New Strateg...	The Desert Cyclone joint military exercise, which took place in January of this year, marked a significant milestone that underscored the strengthening defense ties between India and the United Arab Emirates (UAE). The bilateral relationship has undergone a substantial transition from primarily economic cooperation to a comprehensive alliance, as evidenced by this exercise, defense agreements, and deals on advanced weapons. Building on this momentum, the 12th meeting of the UAE-India Joint Defence Cooperation Committee (JDCC), which took place in Abu Dhabi earlier last week, represented yet another significant turning point. Senior defense officials from both countries led the high-level discussion, which reaffirmed their shared commitment to fortifying bilateral ties and advancing defense and security cooperation. India and the United Arab Emirates have a long history of close ties based on trade, culture, and common geopolitical interests. Some of the main factors driving the expansion of India-UAE security cooperation are the high volume of trade and commerce, prevalent threat perceptions like terrorism and piracy, and the ongoing regional instability in West Asia since 2011. But in recent years, their alliance has made defense cooperation a top priority. Initiatives for maritime security, defense technology agreements, and frequent military exchanges all demonstrate this. India and the UAE are redefining their partnership and moving toward a new strategic frontier by tackling new threats, preserving peace, and promoting regional security. Collectively, these events highlight the expanding breadth and importance of India-UAE defense ties, establishing their partnership as a pillar of stability in a changing geopolitical environment.. Geopolitical and Geo-Strategic Convergences The emerging collaboration between India and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) emphasizes a strategic alignment influenced by geopolitical and geo-strategic considerations. This relationship is firmly rooted in shared interests and is further influenced by extensive regional and global dynamics, rendering it a noteworthy example in the field of modern international relations. 1. Regional Influence and Maritime Security India's partnership with the UAE is largely driven by its growing regional influence, especially in the Indian Ocean region. For peace in the area, India's positioning in the Indian Ocean as a major naval power is crucial. The UAE understands that it must align with India to ensure the safety of this vital waterway, which is vital for the flow of energy and commerce around the world. Their dedication to maintaining the regional power balance is demonstrated by their increased defense cooperation, which includes joint naval exercises and intelligence sharing, as a result of their shared objective. 2. Strategic Partnerships and Multilateral Platforms The interplay between India and other regional powers, including Japan, has significantly influenced its relations with the UAE. The recognition by Japan of India's significant position in the Indo-Pacific region has led to enhanced security collaboration between India and Japan. The interplay of factors has shaped the UAE’s choice to enhance its strategic partnership with India, utilizing India’s multilateral initiatives to further its regional objectives. The emphasis on multilateral frameworks such as I2U2, which includes India, Israel, the US, and the UAE, illustrates the effectiveness of these platforms in promoting both bilateral and regional advantages. The initiatives under I2U2, including projects focused on food security and renewable energy, serve as a clear demonstration of the effective results produced through multilateral cooperation. The platform indicates the interest of the UAE and Israel in normalizing relations, with India contributing supportively. 3. Multilateral Diplomacy and Geopolitical Synergies The UAE has endorsed India’s pursuit of a permanent seat at the United Nations Security Council (UNSC), highlighting their diplomatic alignment on a global scale. In forums of geopolitical significance such as BRICS, both nations have engaged in cooperation on matters of shared interest. The India-Middle East-Europe Economic Corridor (IMEC) is a significant initiative that underscores the strategic alignment among the involved regions. IMEC presents India with an opportunity to effectively connect its 'Act East' and 'Look West' strategies, facilitating a linkage between Southeast Asia, the Middle East, and Europe. The corridor holds strategic importance for India's goals of establishing alternative pathways to Europe for Eastern Mediterranean gas, as well as offering Southeast Asian countries a viable option to access the Atlantic Ocean, independent of China. 4. Economic and Energy Security Dimensions The economic and energy aspects of the India-UAE partnership have been pivotal in influencing their geopolitical alignment. The UAE's role as an important energy provider and investor in India's infrastructure aligns with India's requirement for reliable energy sources. Collaborative initiatives under IMEC seek to enhance energy connectivity and trade, thereby reinforcing their interdependence. 5. Strategic Normalization and Policy Synergy India’s evolving policies, including the 'Act East Policy' and 'Look West Policy,' have enhanced its engagements across regions, effectively connecting strategic gaps between Asia, the Middle East, and Europe. The UAE's involvement in these initiatives indicates a calculated approach to diversifying its alliances and enhancing regional stability, which is in line with India's overarching strategic objectives. The alignment of geopolitical and geo-strategic interests between India and the UAE illustrates the flexibility and complexity of their defence partnership. This relationship, grounded in common priorities such as maritime security, multilateralism, economic integration, and energy security, has developed into a fundamental element of regional stability and global connectivity. The partnership effectively tackles both current security and economic issues while simultaneously establishing a foundation for a more integrated and multipolar global order. The Evolution of India-UAE Defense Partnership The defense cooperation between India and the UAE has its roots in the extensive diplomatic relations that were established after the formation of the UAE in 1971. Initially centered on economic and cultural interactions, the collaboration in defense began to emerge in the 1990s, highlighting the importance of counterterrorism and maritime security in the Gulf region. A noteworthy development transpired during Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan’s visit to India in 2003, which catalyzed dialogues regarding the augmentation of defense cooperation. In 2006, the Joint Defence Cooperation Committee (JDCC) was established as a crucial platform for the enhancement of bilateral defense relations. The JDCC has subsequently enabled annual defense dialogues and has been instrumental in organizing defense cooperation. This visit commenced a series of regular exchanges and established a foundation for more profound defense connections. Since 2014, India has engaged with the UAE on a range of counter-terrorism matters. On 4 March 2018, a noteworthy collaboration between the Indian Coast Guard and Emirati special forces culminated in a successful operation. This initiative was requested by Emirati Prime Minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum and received the endorsement of Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, aimed at intercepting a yacht transporting Latifa bint Mohammed Al Maktoum. In December 2020, Indian authorities, in collaboration with the UAE, successfully thwarted a terrorist attack in Delhi that was backed by the Pakistani ISI. The apprehended individuals identified as terrorists included two members affiliated with Khalistani and three associated with Hizbul Mujahideen. The relationship experienced significant evolution following Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s visit to Abu Dhabi in 2015. This visit highlighted the significance of defense as a pivotal element of the bilateral alliance and culminated in a thorough agreement centered on counterterrorism, intelligence sharing, and maritime security. Following agreements, notably the Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement (CEPA) in 2022, broadened collaboration to encompass cyber security, joint exercises, and the production of defense equipment. The progression of defense relations between India and the UAE is characterized by collaborative military exercises. The bilateral air force exercise Desert Eagle II illustrated operational capabilities in aerial combat, whereas the naval exercise Zayed Talwar (2023) highlighted improved maritime coordination. Furthermore, joint initiatives aimed at safeguarding the Strait of Hormuz—a vital conduit for international oil supplies—underscore the profound strategic dimensions of their alliance. The intricacies of geopolitical dynamics have significantly propelled this collaboration forward. The escalating instability in West Asia, coupled with the persistent threat of terrorism and maritime piracy in the Gulf and Indian Oceans, has fostered a convergence of mutual interests. India aspires to enhance its strategic influence in the Gulf region, whereas the UAE endeavors to broaden its security collaborations beyond conventional Western alliances. The alignment of these shared objectives has significantly enhanced defense cooperation, establishing it as a foundational element of their developing bilateral relationship. Through sustained high-level dialogues, collaborative initiatives, and the establishment of frameworks such as the JDCC, India and the UAE have systematically enhanced their defense partnership, tackling regional security challenges and promoting shared strategic interests. This collaboration signifies an essential aspect of their thorough and progressive partnership. Key Areas of Defense Collaboration Between India and The UAE The joint military exercises that highlight the valuable collaboration between India's and the United Arab Emirates' armed forces are an essential component of the defense cooperation between the two countries. Desert Eagle I (2008), Desert Eagle II (2016), and Desert Knight (2024) are examples of advanced air combat joint exercises that demonstrated how both nations prioritized improving their operational coordination in high-pressure situations. Each of these exercises was conducted in 2008. The naval exercise Zayed Talwar (2023), which focused on integrated operations such as search and rescue missions and electronic warfare drills, further strengthened their maritime collaboration. Zayed Talwar was held in 2023. These exercises are being conducted with the intention of ensuring that readiness is maintained for actual challenges, particularly with regard to the protection of the strategic waters of the Gulf State. Additionally, manufacturing and the acquisition of defense supplies have emerged as significantly important aspects of collaboration. Bombs, grenades, torpedoes, missiles, and other types of weapons and ammunition are among the items that India exports. Additionally, both nations are exploring the possibility of forming joint ventures in the defense manufacturing sector. These ventures would make use of the United Arab Emirates’ (UAE) technological and financial hubs, as well as India's indigenous capabilities. As a consequence of this, both nations are currently engaged in discussions regarding the possibility of working together on the development of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV) through the Edge Group and Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL). It is possible that these partnerships will make it possible to collaborate on the development of drones, sophisticated surveillance systems, and other essential items of defense technology. Considering the fact that South and West Asia are both confronted with the same danger posed by extremism, counterterrorism initiatives are of the utmost importance to both countries. Examples of collaborative measures include activities such as monitoring online radicalization channels and exchanging intelligence in order to disrupt networks that finance terrorist organizations. Furthermore, maritime security stands out as a shared strategic concern because of the significance of the Indian Ocean and the Strait of Hormuz for the international trade of energy. In order to combat maritime terrorism, smuggling, and piracy, India and the United Arab Emirates have formed a partnership to conduct coordinated patrols and to share information concerning these issues. By placing such a strong emphasis on the establishment of a secure maritime environment, both countries have demonstrated how essential they are to the maintenance of economic stability on both the regional and international levels. Strategic Implications for Regional Stability and Balance of Power The burgeoning defense alliance between India and the UAE significantly enhances stability in the Gulf and South Asia. In regions such as Yemen and the Strait of Hormuz, their collaboration in the Gulf bolsters the area's ability to address emerging threats such as terrorism, piracy, and geopolitical instability. India and the UAE enhance their role as a stabilizing force in West Asia and advance regional security through collaborative patrols, intelligence sharing, and capacity building. Their counterterrorism efforts in South Asia concentrate on terrorist networks, disrupting operations and funding sources that threaten regional stability. India's expanding strategic alliance with the UAE is vital to its overarching Middle East strategy. India counters China's growing influence in the region, particularly Beijing's extensive economic and strategic endeavors via the Belt and Road Initiative, by reinforcing relations with a significant Gulf state. This partnership illustrates India's ambition to cultivate robust relationships with Gulf allies by establishing a balance of power that safeguards its geopolitical interests and promotes a more stable, multipolar regional order. Challenges and Opportunities for The Partnership The defense cooperation between the UAE and India is still developing, but it still faces many obstacles. India sees China, with whom the UAE has close ties, as a strategic concern because of regional rivalries and border disputes. Similarly, the UAE's long-standing military and economic ties with Pakistan could lead to conflict given India's tense relations with Islamabad. Navigating these interactions requires diplomatic flexibility to make sure that common defense objectives do not clash with more general geopolitical alignments. Furthermore, the complex and often unstable geopolitics of the Middle East, such as the conflicts between Iran and the Gulf states, may limit the scope of India-UAE cooperation in some areas, particularly those where neutrality is crucial to India's larger regional strategy. Despite these challenges, there are plenty of opportunities. India's Make in India campaign offers a basis for increasing defense production with the United Arab Emirates. Possible collaborations in unmanned systems, naval platforms, and missile technologies could reduce reliance on traditional suppliers and boost defense exports. Furthermore, the UAE serves as a gateway for India's strategic outreach in the Gulf and offers a chance for increased interaction with other Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) nations. Through platforms like I2U2 (India-Israel-UAE-USA), there are also chances to improve international cooperation, particularly in areas like security, technology, and economic projects. By addressing these problems and taking advantage of opportunities, India and the UAE can forge a solid and well-rounded partnership that fosters stability both locally and globally. With the strengthening of defense ties, it can be argued that India and the UAE have entered a new stage of their bilateral relationship, progressing from traditional economic cooperation to a full strategic partnership. Cooperative counterterrorism operations, advanced defense manufacturing, joint military drills, and joint maritime security projects all serve as examples of the importance of this collaboration. By resolving shared security concerns and leveraging each other's advantages, both nations are enhancing their global influence and fostering regional stability. In the future, other nations hoping to resolve shared problems in a cooperative and balanced way may find inspiration in India and the UAE's defense cooperation. As they continue to handle obstacles and seize opportunities, their collaboration can help create a more secure Gulf and South Asia. In addition to strengthening bilateral relations, this expanding collaboration supports the larger objective of creating a stable, multipolar global order.

Syria’s Lost Democrats – OpEd	Well before the Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) militia found itself victorious in its struggle against the Assad regime, Abu Mohammed al-Julani, its head, told CNN: 'The goal of the revolution remains the overthrow of this regime.' But Julani omitted to say what he wished to replace it with. Despite all his softly spoken reassurances about his liberal intentions, all the evidence points to a political takeover ​of the country by the leader of the military coup – in fact a Sunni jihadist replacement of Assad. ​Despite talk of inclusivity, there is little sign of the political presence of the many other Syrian groups and organizations scattered across the country. The interim prime minister that Julani has appointed, Mohammed al-Bashir, was plucked from administering an HTS-held area in northwest Syria​. In recent years, HTS has attempted to gain local legitimacy by governing in a less extreme manner than, say, the Taliban in Afghanistan. Through the Salvation Government, an HTS-influenced civilian administrative body, it has – on the lines of ISIS in its heyday – established bureaucratic institutions for education, healthcare, and public services, funded by taxes, tolls, and fees.​ HTS is rooted in a Salafi-jihadist ideology, and although Julani has renounced his former connection with al-Qaeda and attempts to present himself in a more moderate light, his organization is essentially Islamist.​ What is likely to emerge ​in Syria is a Sunni Islamist state, governed according to its own interpretation of Islamic Sharia law. With HTS in the ascendant, it is salutary to remember that the Syrian armed conflict began in 2011 as a popular uprising against the dictatorial government of President Bashar al-Assad​, with the establishment of democracy as its key demand. In March 2011 a few teenagers – fired no doubt by the revolutionary fervor sweeping the Middle East at the time – daubed some inflammatory slogans on a school wall in the southern Syrian city of Daraa. Unfortunately for them, the Syria that President Bashar al-Assad had inherited in 2000 from his autocratic father was a tightly controlled police state, in which a powerful and all-encompassing security machine ensured that the slightest hint of opposition to the régime was ruthlessly crushed. The youngsters were hunted down, arrested​, tortured​ in unspeakable ways, and killed. When details of their ordeal became known, protesters took to the streets. The security forces, unable to break up the demonstration, eventually fired into the crowd. That was enough to spark widespread rebellion. Groups antagonistic to Assad’s government began nationwide protests. Gradually, popular dissent developed into an armed revolt. After months of crackdown by the government's security forces, various armed groups such as the Free Syrian Army (FSA) began forming across the country, marking the beginning of the Syrian insurgency. By mid-2012, the uprising had escalated into a full-blown civil war with the aim of overthrowing the despotic Assad régime and substituting a democratic form of government. Had assistance of any sort been forthcoming from the US or other Western governments at that early stage, Assad could have been defeated. But US President Obama hesitated, and then continued vacillating even after it was clear in August 2013 that Assad had used chemical weapons against his opponents, utterly indifferent to the extensive civilian casualties that ensued. Obama hesitated because he was intent on forging links with Iran leading to a nuclear deal, and Iran regarded Syria as a vital component in what was known at the time as its 'Shia Crescent.' Meanwhile the shining sword of democracy, the weapon the rebels in 2011 hoped would bring down Assad’s dictatorial regime, had become heavily tarnished. Those who are now labelled 'Syrian rebels' are not fighting for democracy. The original FSA, once dedicated simply to establishing democracy in Syria, has over the nine years of civil conflict lost its cohesion and been transformed into an amalgamation of different groups for many of whom establishing an open democratic form of government is far from their aim. Will a second democratic casualty of the civil war be Kurdish hopes of autonomy in the region they have established in north-eastern Syria? The Kurd-occupied ​territory, which is about 25-30 percent of the old Syria, is currently a semi-autonomous region formally designated the Democratic Federation of Northern Syria or, more simply, Rojava. It is, however, in the sights of Turkey’s president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, who has said he will never accept a Kurdish quasi-state ruled by the PYD party, which he considers a terrorist organization, along the Turkish border. Speaking to reporters on December 6, Erdogan endorsed and supported the HTS advance into Syria. 'Our wish,' he said, 'is that this march in Syria continues without accidents or disasters'– another voice with little or no interest in ensuring a democratic future for Syria. Erdogan is wedded to the Muslim Brotherhood, and has every sympathy with the HTS’s objectives. Even as Assad was fleeing the country, the Turkish-backed Syrian National Army (SNA) began offensive operations against the American-backed Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), who are mostly ethnic Kurds. The SDF had stormed Deir Ezzor city, situated on the river Euphrates​ and part of Iran’s supply corridor connecting to Lebanon – a facility the regime has now lost.​ ​They were ousted by the HTS on December 10​, and a mini civil war was only prevented when​, on December 11, the US ​intervened to mediate a deal between the​ SNA and the SDF. So what has happened to the original democratic Syrian opposition of 2011, made up of activists, intellectuals, and defectors pressing for a transition to democracy and an end to Assad’s authoritarian rule? It consisted of the Syrian National Council, which later became part of the Syrian National Coalition, Local Coordination Committees, which organized protests and civil resistance, and the Free Syrian Army (FSA), an informal group of defected soldiers and armed civilians. It was a loosely allied group, and its component parts struggled with ideological, political, and ethnic divisions, resulting in a lack of unified leadership and goals. Elements like ISIS and Jabhat al-Nusra (now HTS) capitalized on the chaos and perverted their cause. As a result the original democratic opposition has largely been sidelined, while efforts to achieve a political resolution through UN-mediated peace talks, such as the Geneva process, made little progress and have now been overtaken by events. In short the original Syrian democratic opposition has been overshadowed by the militarization of the conflict, the rise of extremist groups, and the intervention of foreign powers. It still exists in a fragmented form, but can it reorganize itself into some sort of cohesive entity in time to claim a seat at the table, ​should an opportunity actually arise to negotiate Syria’s future?​Is it realistic to hope for a democratic state of Syria emerging from ​the military coup? ​The more probable outcome is that Syria’s future will be some sort of autocracy headed by HTS leader Julani.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfgCDIw0DiRpfD1rvQEurDO	2024-12-20T09:46:02-08:00	
How Language Teachers Can Save Us From Autocrats – OpEd	Who will save us from the global drift to authoritarianism? Language teachers are the unlikely heroes to save democracy. Politicians are using words in an increasingly confusing manner, thus making it difficult for voters to choose. People are voting for ideas that are nothing more than vague concepts wrapped as imitation concrete. Personas have taken over from the person. A better understanding of language is needed to clear through the muddle and restore some semblance of democracy's ideal, a government by the people for the people. Autocrats are generally great at using language to manipulate the populace. Appealing, simple use of language and referring to the common man despite not knowing who is or what is an ordinary man. Autocrats aim to be a father figure for the forlorn. Simple rally cries are the gels that lubricate the slide to a state of mental submission. Logic and reason become too complex and an anathema to the apparent ease of masking possibilities. Vague words, misused words, pronouns, and so on are the everyday tools of destruction. No wonder, in the USA and other countries, humanities and liberal arts are the first to be targeted as elitist and woke. The language of autocrats is deceptively simple and thus dangerous. Vague words Ask anyone the meaning of woke, and you will get various answers. Dictionaries, too, need help with defining the word. Woke means I disagree with you and cannot specify why. Those who watch US news would have seen many politicians unable to define the word even when using it themselves. Not just woke, but millions, many, a lot and so on. Not researched numbers. Language teachers usually say to use specific words with specific meanings in the context of the sentence. Communicate so the receiver understands. Yet, for autocrats, it is okay if the receiver does not understand clearly because the meaning can be adjusted later. Misused words Alternative facts are not facts but a personal perspective. Yet the phrase has been used along with terms like equality, fairness and reform to mean the opposite of what the word means.Freedom House listed democracy as the autocrats' favourite word. Accountability, transparency and freedom are not on the list. Words are not being redefined but misused. Language teachers would point out meaning changes over time with societal agreement, so use words as understood by standard definitions. However, democracy's definition of a people's voice is still valid. Discrediting ideas and replacing them with associated words such as popular does not change the meaning but highlights misuse and deception. Pronouns They, them, us and so on are codes for groups that can be ambiguous. All great stories have an obstacle to be crossed. Autocrats use this idea, pitting one group against the other. 'They are taking away our job' is a familiar trope. Yet who is 'they' is rarely defined. Catch-all phrases such as immigrants and foreigners are used, ignoring the fact that many of the population are descendants of immigrants and foreigners. Many a language teacher would say to be specific and use nouns, not pronouns. Yet autocrats do not let the truth get in the way of a good story (for themselves). Confusion is an autocrat's smoke screen of action while accumulating wealth and power. Blaming someone or using religious references, oversimplification and claiming credit are forms of inward and outward messaging to appeal to different groups—the possibility of mixed messages. By manipulating words, there is a message that connects to anyone and means anything. The receiver feels addressed with a broad social message. Their group is being led. Details of where and how are for later; just believe the leader. Loyalty matters. Reading and understanding how words are used is vital for the population. Books promote possibilities that can reframe views and introduce skepticism. Hence, autocratic regimes promote banning books. Institutions that promote reading, the classics, logic and critical thinking need support. While the press may be labelled as biased with some validity, a vibrant press, along with libraries and humanities departments, facilitates awareness of language use. Sadly, social media's focus on visual content may be evolving as the main facilitator of autocracy despite the initial Facebook uprisings and governments' interests. Reading builds countries. Understanding language and the language of autocracy is crucial in stopping the tide of authoritarianism. We need a campfire where we can bond with a common language and understanding. This campfire of sorts exists in language classes. As the Trinidadian calypsonian sang, 'With words, any dam fool can rule this world.' Let that choice of fool be clear.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfgCDIw0DiRpStZHrFloSda	2024-12-20T09:45:05-08:00	
Keeping The August 5 Revolution Alive: Lessons From The Jewish Ho...	Yesterday, I was talking with a good friend of mine who (true to his last name) has been at the forefront of human rights movement for decades. In 2018, he and I spoke from the same podium on genocide of the Rohingya people of Myanmar in Cologne, Germany. In the recent past, his group’s tireless lobbying efforts within the US State Department have resulted in billion-plus dollars of funding for the Rohingya refugees in Cox’s Bazar. He visited Bangladesh in late November. As a well-wisher of Bangladesh, he is genuinely worried about the future of Bangladesh. He is not alone. Many concerned expatriates, too, are equally worried whether our people would be able to preserve this revolution. After all, Bangladesh is surrounded by unfriendly countries that have lived by the diabolical formula: ‘what is good for Bangladesh must be bad for its neighbors.’ India, in particular, which has been a beneficiary of the ousted regime (since at least 2009), is yet to come to terms with the latest change inside Bangladesh. Its print and social media, let alone the bigots affiliated with the ruling party (BJP), continue to reinvent Goebbels’ propaganda mechanism to portray an extremely negative image about Bangladesh. Contrary to their false claims, in my recent visit of Bangladesh, I failed to see any sign of intolerance towards religious minorities. My main concern, thus, is an internal one involving our own people that are impatient: expecting results overnight! Our past experiences have shown that half-hearted, poorly planned and executed programs that relied mostly on the ‘old-time’ bureaucrats as ‘band-aid’ solutions or ‘quick-fixes’ to deliver desirable results have only culminated into massive failures, compounding our problem immeasurably. Our people have felt cheated and betrayed by the ‘political pied pipers of the Hamelin,’ leaving bad memories about our politicians and their hollow promises. Will this Second Liberation of Bangladesh, which was led by the students and not politicians, deliver our people a discrimination-free society that is fair and just and values meritocracy? Or will this turn out to be yet another failed experiment in which yesteryears under a brutal tyrant would look better than the present time? I pray and hope not. It is always more difficult to sustain a revolution than birthing it. Successful revolutions are like on-going, continuous processes that aim ever higher and higher. In that process, there is no room for lack of focus and backtracking. As I have noted elsewhere, a transformational change cannot succeed until the revolutionaries or change agents themselves own it, direct it, and finally, excel in it. They cannot rely upon the vanguards of a failed system to deliver the desirable outcomes. The old way of doing politics must yield and adjust to the new ways of thinking, planning, and execution with lofty short and long-term goals. Revolutions are pivotal moments in history that can redefine the trajectory of nations and the lives of their citizens. The Second Liberation of August 5, 2024, which led to the fall of Sheikh Hasina's tyrannical regime in Bangladesh, is one such transformative event that will be etched in the collective memory of the nation. One sure way to avoid backtracking is all about the messaging: the what, the why and the who – of the revolution that is imbedded in the minds of the people. They must be told and retold why the youngsters like Abu Sayeed gave their lives, what motivated them, and who they were. Truly, the challenge that follows such a seismic shift is the preservation of its memory and the ideals for which it stood. We have three memory assets that can help: Student movement and its sacrifices: although short-lived, it is fresh and thus of mixed blessings. Sheikh Hasina's tyranny, which lasted for years: the survivors of the Ayna Ghar and other detention and torture cells are still alive and can recollect their horrors accurately. The third memory is what India is doing to Indian Muslims: the daily lynching of Muslims, esp. in the Occupied Jammu and Kashmir, and the Bangla-speaking Muslims in Assam and Tripura, and the destruction of Muslim properties, including historic monuments and mosques in the BJP-run states. I am motivated here by the story of the Jewish Holocaust, once a footnote in history, which has become an essential reading in all western institutions of learning. Little do people today realize that American Jews in 1939 could not get a bill passed in the Congress to get 20,000 Jewish children to America to protect them against the Holocaust. Within 3 months of that failed bill, M.S. St Louis ship brought more than 900 Jews, mostly children and women, to the USA. None of them was allowed to land in the USA. Back in Hitler’s Germany, 30% of them were murdered. Can we imagine anything like that happening today to a Jew in the USA? No. How did they turn around the American and the western world opinion to even equate anti-Zionism as anti-Semitism? Arguably, it all started with the ‘Holocaust Industry.’ This essay explores the various methods by which the memories of a revolution can be preserved, drawing parallels with the Jewish community's efforts to keep the memory of the Holocaust alive after the Second World War. It is by no means an endorsement of either the racist ideology of Zionism or its settler-colonial state of Israel that is guilty of genocide of the Palestinian people. Education as a Cornerstone One of the most powerful tools for preserving the memory of a revolution is education. The Holocaust is extensively taught in schools around the world, ensuring that the atrocities are not forgotten and that the lessons learned continue to resonate with future generations. Similarly, by incorporating the history and values of the Second Liberation into the educational curriculum, we can ensure that the spirit of the movement is passed down. Textbooks, lectures, and discussions about the causes, events, and outcomes of the revolution can help embed its significance in the national consciousness. Educational reforms might also include the development of specialized courses, or the establishment of research centers dedicated to the study of the revolution and its legacy. Museums and Memorials Museums and memorials serve as tangible reminders of past events. The Jewish community has established numerous Holocaust museums worldwide, such as Yad Vashem in Israel and the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum in Washington, D.C. These institutions not only commemorate the victims but also educate visitors about the historical context and the importance of preventing such tragedies in the future. Bangladesh could establish a national museum dedicated to the Second Liberation, offering a space for reflection and learning, and serving as a repository for artifacts, personal stories, and historical documents related to the revolution. Additionally, legislation can facilitate the creation and maintenance of archives that collect, and safeguard documents, recordings, personal accounts, and other materials related to the revolution. Media and the Arts The arts have a unique ability to capture and convey the emotional essence of historical events. The Jewish experience during the Holocaust has been portrayed through films, literature, theater, and television, reaching a broad audience and evoking empathy, and understanding. Documentaries and feature films about the Second Liberation, along with novels, plays, and songs, can similarly immortalize the struggle and sacrifice of the Bangladeshi people. These cultural works can also challenge revisionist narratives and ensure that the truth of the revolution is not distorted. In this regard, government can allocate funds and create grants to support artistic and cultural projects that commemorate the revolution. By fostering a vibrant cultural ecosystem around the memory of the revolution, the government can help these narratives reach a wider audience and resonate more deeply with the public. Commemorative Dates and Rituals Annual observances and rituals play a significant role in keeping memories alive. Yom HaShoah, or Holocaust Remembrance Day, is a day of commemoration for the millions of Jews who perished in the Holocaust. It is marked by ceremonies and moments of silence, keeping the memory of the victims and the horror of the events alive. Bangladesh could establish its own day of remembrance for the Second Liberation, creating a tradition of honoring those who fought for change and reflecting on the ongoing journey towards the ideals they championed. It would provide an opportunity for reflection, education, and national unity. Such a day could include ceremonies, public speeches, and educational programs that highlight the revolution's impact on the country's trajectory. Oral Histories and Personal Narratives Personal stories have the power to humanize historical events. The testimonies of Holocaust survivors have been crucial in preserving the personal dimensions of the tragedy. Recording the experiences of participants in the Second Liberation can similarly ensure that the personal sacrifices and stories are not lost. These narratives can be archived in libraries, included in museum exhibits, and shared through various media platforms. Government Policy and Legislation: Safeguarding the Legacy of the August 5 Revolution Government policy and legislation can play a crucial role in preserving the memory of significant historical events like the August 5 revolution in Bangladesh. By enacting laws and implementing policies, governments can institutionalize the remembrance and ensure that the principles and sacrifices of the revolution are officially recognized and integrated into the fabric of society. Here below are few more ways in which policy and legislation can contribute to this important task: Truth and Reconciliation Efforts In the aftermath of a revolution, especially one involving significant conflict, establishing a truth and reconciliation commission can be a powerful legislative act. Such a commission can investigate the events leading up to and during the revolution, providing a platform for all sides to be heard and for historical truths to be acknowledged. This process can be instrumental in healing national wounds and ensuring that the lessons of the revolution are remembered and learned from. Digital Initiatives and Social Media In the digital age, online platforms offer new avenues for preserving history. Digital archives can store vast amounts of information, including photos, videos, and written accounts of the Second Liberation, making them accessible to a global audience. Social media campaigns can also keep the conversation alive, engaging younger generations and maintaining public interest in the revolution's legacy. Policymakers can support the development of digital archives and online platforms that make information about the revolution accessible to all. This could involve funding for digital libraries, the creation of official websites, and the use of social media to engage with citizens. By leveraging technology, the government can help preserve the revolution's memory in a format that is easily disseminated and updated. Integration into National Identity Finally, legislation can embed the values and ideals of the revolution into the national identity. This could be reflected in the country's constitution, national anthem and symbols, or official statements of values. By aligning the nation's identity with the principles of the revolution, the government can ensure that the memory of the revolution is not just preserved but actively shapes the country's present and future. Government policy and legislation can be powerful tools for preserving the memory of the August 5 revolution in Bangladesh. By taking deliberate steps to honor, educate, protect, support, and integrate the revolution's legacy into the nation's ongoing narrative, the government can ensure the preservation of a revolution for which so many people died and suffered. In conclusion, such tasks of preservation of history, relying upon the above mentioned three memory lanes, need to be shared, and strengthened not only by the government agencies and institutions but also by the public, the NGOs, and the private enterprises. Fiction, non-fiction documentaries, and songs can be exclusively on one such topic or interwoven with each other. For this to succeed, it is important that the student movement leaders, media leaders, and the government leaders work in a cohesive way with the same objectives in focus.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfgCDIw0DiRpfSsGeDso5kF	2024-12-20T09:43:20-08:00	
Guardians Of Peace: The EU’s Role In Global Security – OpEd	The European Union (EU) plays an indispensable role in promoting peace, stability, and security on the global stage, especially in the context of a fragmented and volatile international environment. Built on principles of multilateral diplomacy, humanitarian aid, and defence coordination through the Common Security and Defence Policy (CSDP), the EU remains a key player in addressing critical global challenges such as military conflicts, terrorism, cyber threats, and climate-induced instability. Though lacking a standing army, the EU’s strategic ability to coordinate civilian and military missions has allowed it to effectively manage crises and contribute to conflict resolution. However, its efforts are hindered by the divergent interests of its member states, increasing geopolitical pressures, and limited resources. To maintain its role as a 'guardian of peace,' the EU must adapt its strategies and enhance its capabilities to meet evolving threats and challenges. The EU’s security framework is grounded in its unwavering commitment to multilateralism and international law. As a primary supporter of the United Nations and NATO, the EU frequently steps in as a mediator during geopolitical crises. One of its most prominent actions has been its response to the ongoing Russian invasion of Ukraine, where the EU has mobilized humanitarian aid, imposed sanctions, and provided military support. This multifaceted approach underscores the EU's belief in upholding Ukraine's sovereignty and maintaining global security norms. Through its CSDP, the EU currently operates 24 missions worldwide, involving over 3,500 military personnel and 1,300 civilians. These missions span regions such as the Sahel, the Balkans, and the Horn of Africa, where the EU addresses key issues like peacekeeping, maritime security, and counterterrorism. This operational reach highlights the EU’s commitment to crisis management through both civilian and military means. In recent years, the EU has expanded its focus to include emerging security threats that go beyond traditional military concerns. Cybersecurity has become one of the bloc’s top priorities, with initiatives like the European Cybersecurity Competence Centre aimed at strengthening digital resilience and countering cyberattacks. Additionally, the EU has recognized climate change as an urgent security issue, understanding its potential to exacerbate resource conflicts and create waves of migration. The bloc has responded with international climate agreements, integrating environmental stability into its broader security policy. Economic tools also play a crucial role in the EU’s security strategy. The European Peace Facility (EPF) funds defence initiatives and assists with global peacebuilding efforts, further reinforcing the EU’s diplomatic influence and commitment to maintaining stability. Despite these proactive measures, the EU faces significant challenges in executing its security agenda. A primary obstacle is the lack of consensus among its 27 member states, each with varying national interests and priorities. This fragmentation often leads to delays in decision-making, preventing the EU from presenting a unified front in the face of global crises. Moreover, rising powers such as China and the ongoing threat of Russian aggression test the EU’s ability to assert itself as a diplomatic force. Resource constraints further complicate its security efforts, as missions often rely on voluntary contributions from member states rather than a unified defence structure. Additionally, as cyber threats evolve rapidly, the EU struggles to keep pace with sophisticated attacks that continuously test its digital security frameworks. To overcome these challenges, the EU must strengthen cooperation among member states through initiatives like Permanent Structured Cooperation (PESCO), which aims to align defence priorities and reduce redundancy. Enhanced coordination will ensure that the EU can act more decisively and efficiently, pooling resources to maximize effectiveness. Another vital recommendation is for the EU to increase its investment in emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence (AI) and quantum computing. These technologies are crucial in countering cyber threats and hybrid warfare, enabling the EU to stay ahead of potential adversaries. Expanding partnerships with emerging powers and regional organizations will also diversify the EU’s diplomatic influence and bolster its role in global security. Finally, developing a robust European defence industry will help reduce dependency on external suppliers and increase the EU’s strategic autonomy, ensuring that the bloc can respond independently to crises. Despite these hurdles, the EU’s multifaceted approach to security underscores its ongoing relevance in global peacebuilding. By leveraging its economic strength, diplomatic influence, and innovative capabilities, the EU continues to adapt to the shifting landscape of international security. Its initiatives in Ukraine, climate security, and cyber resilience are a testament to the bloc’s flexibility and commitment to addressing complex global challenges. However, to secure its future role as a guardian of peace, the EU must unite its member states around a common vision, strengthen its defence capabilities, and ensure that its diplomatic efforts remain focused on fostering stability in an increasingly multipolar world. In conclusion, the European Union stands as a model of multilateral cooperation and proactive security strategy in an uncertain global order. Despite its internal challenges, the EU’s commitment to innovation, diplomacy, and global stability positions it as a key player in maintaining international peace. By embracing institutional reforms, investing in new technologies, and deepening partnerships, the EU can continue to fulfil its mission as a 'guardian of peace' and remain relevant in addressing the complex security issues of the twenty-first century.

Only 4 Of 313 Messenger Prophets’ Scriptures Survived – OpEd	The term ivri (a Hebrew) first appears in the Torah, when Prophet Abraham is called 'the Hebrew'.'And it was told to Abram the Hebrew' (Genesis 14:13) And Prophet Joseph uses the name as both a geographical and an socio-ethnic term: 'I was kidnapped from the land of the ivrim' Genesis 40:15 and 'a Hebrew youth' 41:12, and 'The Egyptians could not eat with the ivrim, since that would be an abomination' Genesis. 43:32. The name for Abraham's grandson Jacob was later changed to Israel, and the name Israel largely replaced Hebrews after the Hebrews left Egypt. Banu Israel is the best name for Jews because it was the name given to Jacob by God himself; and it has been in use for over 3,000 years. The word Muslim is a religious identity term that refers to faithful monotheistic believers. The word Hebrew is a linguistic, geographical and ethnic identity term like German the language, Germany the homeland and Germans the people. The word descendent is a biological inherited birth identity term like nobility or tribe. Islam was a religion designed by God to overcome all other self-identities: 'O mankind, We created you from male and female, and made you peoples and tribes, that you may know (respect) one another. Indeed, the most noble of you in the sight of Allah is the most righteous of you. Indeed, Allah is Knowing and Acquainted.' (Quran 49:13) 'Once all humans were but a single community; then they disagreed (formulating different beliefs and rites). Had it not been that your Lord had already so ordained, a decisive judgement would have been made regarding [the truth of] their disagreements.' (10:19) Then all human communities invented different religions of their own with different creeds and ways This worldly life is a trial to see whether or not you yourselves recognize truth by competing in doing acts of kindness, toleration and welcoming others who are different into your own lands. And: 'Who is better in religion than one who submits himself to Allah while being a doer of good and follows the religion of Abraham, inclining toward truth? And Allah took Abraham as an intimate friend.' (4:125) So Jews have many names to self-identify because they have been immigrants for a little more than half of their 36-8 centuries of Jewish history. Even more important, by God's design Prophet Abraham's biological descendants through Isaac and Jacob became the first ongoing monotheistic community to last to this very day. 'And remember Our servants, Abraham, Isaac and Jacob - those of strength and [religious] vision. Indeed, We chose them for an exclusive quality: remembrance of the home [the 'safe haven' Land of Israel]. And indeed they are to Us among the chosen and outstanding.' (38:45-7) 'And We certainly settled the Children of Israel in an agreeable settlement [the Land of Israel] and provided them with good things. And they did not differ until [after Torah] knowledge had come to them. Indeed, your Lord will judge between them on the Day of Resurrection about that over which they used to differ. So if you [O Muhammad] are in doubt, about that which We have revealed to you, then ask those who have been reading the Scripture before you. The truth has certainly come to you from your Lord, so never be among the doubters. (Qur'an 10:93-4) Qur'an 5:20-21 states: 'Moses said to his people: O, my people, remember the favor of Allah upon you when he appointed among you prophets and made you possessors [of the Land of Israel] and gave you what he had not given anyone among the worlds. O my people, enter the holy land which Allah has assigned to you.' Islam teaches that the one and only God inspired and sent prophets to the whole of mankind in different lands and at different times. One version of a hadith puts the number of prophets sent to mankind as 124,000 (Ibn Hanbal, Musnad, 5, 169). Whether the number was 124,000 or not is not important. What was essential was that no land, people or period was neglected by God. Prophets were sent to every human language group since the age of Adam. The Qur'an says: 'There never was a people without a Warner (Prophet) having lived among them' (35:24) and 'We would never visit our wrath (chastise any community) until We had sent a Messenger to give warning' (17:15) Since there are over 7.000 languages now spoken in the world, and another 10-20,000 that were spoken over the previous 10,000 years and then died out, all human societies have have been taught the way God wants each of them to conduct their Divine worship (Qur'an 21:25), and the moral behavioral rules they should observe (Qur'an 16:90-92). Even today when hundreds of languages are dying out, the African continent is home to some of the most multilingual countries in the world. For example Cameroon has a population of around 27 million people; and over 250 different languages are spoken as first languages. Three Prophets after Prophet Abraham were directed by God to greatly expand their audience. The Hebrew Bible states that the One and Only God told Prophet Jeremiah: 'Before I formed you in the womb I knew you, and before you were born I consecrated you; I appointed you a prophet to (all) the nations.' (Jeremiah 1:5) and the Arabic Qur'an states that the One and Only God told Prophet Muhammad: 'We have not sent you (O Muhammad) but as a mercy for all of humankind, (the) jinn, and the (other kind of life forms on exoplanet) worlds.' (Quran 21:107) In the early years of Islam, Muslims faced the direction of Jerusalem as the qibla (holy prayer direction) for their prayers before changing the direction to face the Kaaba, as a result of a Quranic revelation to Prophet Muhammad. According to Islam, the Kaaba was destroyed and rebuilt several times throughout its history, most famously by Prophet Ibrahim (Abraham) and his son Prophet Ismail (Ishmael). Karen Armstrong asserts that the Kaaba was officially dedicated to Hubal, a Nabatean deity, and contained 360 idols which probably represented the days of the year. Armstrong also says that the Kaaba was thought to be at the center of the world, with the Gate of Heaven directly above it. The Kaaba marked the location where the sacred world intersected with the profane world; the embedded Black Stone meteorite was a further symbol because it fell from the sky and thus linked heaven and earth. The Qur'an contains 3 verses regarding the origin of the Kaaba stating that the Kaaba was the first (monotheistic) House of Worship for mankind, and that it was built by Prophets Ibrahim and Ismail on Allah's instructions. 1 'Verily, the first House (of worship) appointed for mankind was that at Bakkah (Makkah), full of blessing, and a guidance for mankind.— Quran 3:96 2 'Behold! We gave the site to Ibrahim of the (Sacred) House, (saying): 'Associate not anything (in worship) with Me; and sanctify My House for those who compass it around, or stand up, or bow down or prostrate themselves (in prayer).' — Quran (22:26) 3 'And remember (Prophets) Ibrahim and Ismail raised the foundations of the House (praying): 'Our Lord! Accept (this structure) from us: for You are All-Hearing and All-knowing.'— Quran 2:127 Ibn Kathir, in his famous exegesis (tafsir) of the Quran, mentions two interpretations among the Muslims on the origin of the Kaaba. One is that the temple was a place of worship for angels (or perhaps Jinn) before the creation of humans. Later, a house of worship was built on the location but it was destroyed by Noah's flood, and was finally rebuilt by Prophets Ibrahim and Ismail as mentioned later in the Quran. Ibn Kathir regarded this tradition as weak and preferred instead the narration by Ali ibn Abi Talib that although several other temples might have preceded the Kaaba, it was the first Bayt Allah ('House of God'), dedicated solely to monotheism, built with God's instruction, and sanctified and blessed by Him, as stated in Quran 22:26″ There is also a hadith in Sahih al-Bukhari stating that the Kaaba was the first (monotheistic) mosque on Planet Earth, and the second was the Al-Aqsa mosque in Jerusalem. Although the Hebrew Bible is filled with geographic details, it is vague about the places where Prophet Abraham was twice tested by God's demand that he should make his sons into ritual offerings. All we know is that the place was on a hilltop later called Zion. During the almost 950 years that the First and Second Jerusalem Temple stood they welcomed Jews and monotheistic non-Jews (Hanifs), to attend services daily; for as the third expansive Prophet King Solomon himself said in his dedication service for the Jerusalem Temple: 'As for the foreigner who does not belong to your people Israel, but has come from a distant land because of your name— for they will hear of your great name and your mighty hand and your outstretched arm—when they come and pray toward this Temple, then hear from heaven your dwelling place. Do whatever the foreigner asks of you, so that all the peoples of the earth may know your name and be in awe of you, as do your own people Israel, and may know that this house I (Solomon) have built bears your Name.' (1 Kings 8:41-43) Although Islam is a universal religion non-Muslims are prohibited from entering the Kaaba or even the city of Makka where the Kaaba was built. And since Judaism has a pluralistic, many religions are true philosophy, the Jerusalem Temple always had a section available for non-Jewish foreigners to pray.. So 'Each (religious) community has its own direction to which it turns (in prayer), compet then with one another in doing good deeds. Wherever you may be, God will bring you all before Him. God has power over all things.' (Qur'an 2:148) 'Indeed, the believers, Jews, Christians, and Sabians—whoever truly believes in God and the Last Day and does good will have their reward with their Lord. And there will be no fear for them, nor will they grieve.' (Quran 2:62)	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfgCDIw0DiRpcVKTEsRjnGi	2024-12-20T09:41:31-08:00	
Bridging Cultures: Japan And South Korea’s Dynamic Relationship –...	The relationship between Japan and South Korea is one of the most complex and dynamic in East Asia, shaped by a history of cultural ties, colonial legacies, and modern geopolitical challenges. As neighbouring nations with intertwined histories, their bilateral relations are crucial not only for their national interests but also for ensuring regional stability in the Indo-Pacific and broader global security. Despite historical tensions stemming from Japan’s colonial rule (1910–1945) and unresolved grievances, their partnership holds significant potential for economic growth, cultural exchange, and strategic collaboration. Although Japan and South Korea's relationship faces persistent difficulties, it also presents considerable opportunities for reconciliation and mutual advancement if both nations commit to sustained dialogue, engagement, and forward-looking policies. Historical Context and Shared Legacies Japan and South Korea share a profound cultural and historical legacy that predates modern conflicts. Historical exchanges, such as the introduction of Buddhism from Korea to Japan and the shared Confucian values influencing governance and social structures, reflect their enduring connections. However, the legacy of Japan’s colonial rule over Korea (1910–1945) remains a painful chapter. This era resulted in forced labour, the exploitation of 'comfort women,' and economic oppression, leaving lasting scars that continue to influence political and public discourse in both nations.Post-war efforts to normalize relations began with the 1965 Treaty on Basic Relations, which marked a step toward reconciliation through economic assistance and diplomatic ties. Yet, unresolved grievances persist, including demands for direct apologies and compensation for colonial atrocities. Disputes over historical memory, particularly concerning school textbooks and museum narratives, exacerbate tensions and complicate reconciliation efforts. Contentious historical anniversaries and political campaigns often revive these grievances, highlighting the fragility of bilateral relations. Economic Interdependence Economic interdependence is a cornerstone of the Japan-South Korea relationship, with bilateral trade reaching $52 billion in 2022. Both nations are key players in industries such as electronics, semiconductors, automotive manufacturing, and steel production. Japan supplies high-tech materials essential to South Korea's industries, while South Korean companies like Samsung and LG dominate global markets for consumer electronics. Trade disputes have tested the interdependence between Japan and South Korea. In 2019, Japan imposed restrictions on exports of key materials like fluorinated polyimides and photoresists, which are essential for South Korea’s tech industry. This prompted Seoul to complain to the World Trade Organization. Despite these challenges, numerous opportunities for collaboration remain. Joint ventures in artificial intelligence (AI), renewable energy, and electric vehicle (EV) technology could establish both nations as global leaders in innovation, particularly in the face of increasing competition from China. Additionally, such partnerships could help address shared challenges like climate change and energy transitions. Cultural Exchange and Soft Power Cultural exchange between Japan and South Korea has become a significant force for bridging divides. The rise of Korean pop culture in Japan, exemplified by K-pop groups like BTS and popular K-dramas, has created a profound economic and cultural impact, generating billions annually. In turn, Japanese anime, including Studio Ghibli films, enjoys a dedicated following in South Korea. Tourism further strengthens these connections, with over 2.4 million Japanese tourists visiting South Korea and 2.7 million South Koreans travelling to Japan in 2022. However, cultural diplomacy occasionally encounters challenges tied to political disputes. Boycotts of cultural products, such as Japanese films or Korean cosmetics, often arise during periods of heightened tension, highlighting the fragility of these exchanges. To deepen cultural ties, expanding student exchange programs and organizing joint cultural festivals could foster greater understanding, particularly among younger generations less burdened by historical animosities. Security and Geopolitical Cooperation The security aspect of Japan-South Korea relations is underscored by shared concerns regarding North Korea’s nuclear ambitions and the broader strategic challenges posed by China’s regional assertiveness. North Korea’s missile tests threaten both nations, making defence cooperation crucial. Regular trilateral drills with the U.S. Navy and agreements like the General Security of Military Information Agreement (GSOMIA) enhance intelligence sharing and regional preparedness. However, public opinion can hinder deeper military collaboration. In South Korea, historical mistrust of Japan often leads to opposition against closer defence ties, while nationalist rhetoric in domestic politics complicates diplomatic negotiations. Overcoming these barriers requires building public trust through transparency and focusing on practical areas of cooperation, such as maritime security and humanitarian assistance. By working together to ensure freedom of navigation and regional stability, Japan and South Korea can reinforce their roles as essential pillars of the Indo-Pacific security framework Challenges and Opportunities in the Bilateral Relationship Persistent challenges continue to strain Japan-South Korea relations. Territorial disputes, such as the contested sovereignty of the Dokdo/Takeshima islands, remain flashpoints. Historical grievances often resurface during politically charged campaigns driven by domestic nationalism and media sensationalism. These issues, along with economic and cultural boycotts, hinder progress toward lasting reconciliation. Despite these challenges, there are abundant growth opportunities. International organizations like the United Nations and the WTO can act as neutral mediators in disputes, fostering dialogue and compromise. Economic collaborations in emerging fields, such as green technologies and tech startups, present avenues for mutual benefit. Additionally, youth-driven initiatives like digital connectivity and entrepreneurship forums have the potential to reshape public perceptions and promote a more cooperative future. Recommendations for Improving Relations To realize the full potential of their partnership, Japan and South Korea should adopt a multifaceted approach to improving relations. Sustained dialogue is crucial and requires regular bilateral summits to directly address sensitive issues. Expanding educational and cultural exchanges, such as joint historical research and university scholarships, can deepen understanding of shared histories and values. Future collaborations should prioritize green technologies, digital innovation, and AI, aligning with global trends and addressing mutual challenges. Furthermore, leveraging multilateral platforms like the U.S.-Japan-South Korea trilateral framework can strengthen their positions in the Indo-Pacific and beyond. Conclusion The relationship between Japan and South Korea is a critical pillar for regional peace and prosperity, shaped by both historical grievances and shared aspirations. While challenges such as territorial disputes, trade tensions, and cultural boycotts persist, there are vast opportunities for cooperation in economic innovation, cultural exchange, and security partnerships. By prioritizing sustained efforts in diplomacy, education, and forward-looking collaborations, Japan and South Korea can overcome historical animosities and build a partnership that benefits both nations, setting a precedent for reconciliation and harmony in a divided world.

Black Angels Remind Us Of Centuries Of Injustices Plaguing The TB...	Death from TB is caused by human choice. It is caused by human-built systems. And so that is terrifying and horrifying and deeply upsetting. It means we are not doing a good job of assigning equal value to every human life,' said the famous American author John Green at a panel discussion during United Nations General Assembly last year. This is so very true. What else will explain 10.8 million people suffering with TB disease last year when we had the tools and evidence to prevent every single case of TB transmission? What will explain 1.1 million people dying of TB last year when we have the best of tools to diagnose, treat and care for those with TB? TB is a sad but real story of inequity and injustice. We conveniently refer to it as a 'disease of the poor' but shy away from saying the truth- that those who enjoy privileges, rights, entitlements and live a life free from hunger, poverty, homelessness and other forms of discriminations, are much less vulnerable to TB. It is the inequity that puts people at risk of TB. It is the social injustices that deny them timely and accurate diagnosis, deny them the best of treatments, deny them social support and security that puts them at heightened risk of TB and even TB death (along with a range of other human rights abuses and violations). These injustices have been existing since times immemorial and have played a big role in damping the TB response. Ela Gandhi, a South African peace activist who fought against apartheid with Nelson Mandela and others and was a Member of Parliament of South Africa from 1994 to2004, (she is also the granddaughter of Mahatma Gandhi), said that while she was reading about the discovery of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (bacterium that causes TB) in 1882, she realised it mentions that TB killed one out of every seven people living in the USA and Europe in those days. 'But there was absolutely no mention of the people dying of TB in Asia and Africa or other parts of the world. This is the pattern we see all through the ages. Black lives do not matter and when I say 'black,' it is inclusive of all non-whites - we are still grappling with health inequities,' she said. Taking Care: The Black Angels of Seaview Hospital During 1913 - 1961, Seaview Hospital (which was a sanatorium too) in Staten Island New York, USA, was taking care of people with TB. In those days, TB was a leading cause of death among New Yorkers killing thousands of people every year. Of course, back then there was no cure for TB. And to top it all, the white nursing staff refused to work there for fear of contracting the dreaded disease. So, Seaview Hospital recruited black nurses. These nurses earned the name of 'Black Angels' - black because of their skin colour, and angels because they broke racial barriers and risked their lives to take care of the people with TB. Recently, in September 2024, we met Virginia Allen - one of those Black Angel nurses who served in Seaview Hospital. Now over 93 years old, Virginia (who still drives her own car) joined Seaview Hospital as a 16-year-old trainee nurse in 1947 and worked there for 10 years. She was assigned to the children's building, to take care of the children with TB, despite the constant threat of getting infected herself. 'Seaview Hospital provided an opportunity for black nurses - who in those days were unable to find jobs otherwise in the profession that they were trained in, because of racism and the segregation of hospitals. Out of 29 hospitals in New York City, Seaview Hospital was one of the four hospitals that would hire Black nurses. These nurses served the patients diligently, even though their own lives were in danger,' recalled Virginia Allen while speaking at one of the End TB Dialogues hosted by CNS (Citizen News Service). 'We were on the frontlines of the fight against TB long before the cure came, doing what nurses do – take care of the patients to the best of our ability and follow the doctors' orders. I took care of the children with TB. They were like any other child who would have been at home- very inquisitive - and anxious too about being away from their parents. They did require a lot of care, not only because they were sick but also because of being separated from their families. But I loved the children and I loved my job. As I grew older, I realised how important it is to remember those nurses who came before us,' said Virginia. Have you read the book Black Angels? Maria Smilios, adjunct lecturer at Columbia University Mailman School of Public Health, has helped immortalise the work of the black Angel nurses through her book 'The Black Angels: the untold story of the nurses who helped cure tuberculosis,' that was published in 2023. The book celebrates works that affirm the highest value of the human spirit. It won the 2024 Christopher Award in Literature; was a finalist for the prestigious Gotham Book Prize; and chosen as an NPR Science Friday Summer Read for 2024. The book was also selected as one of the two finalists for the National Association of Science Writers Journalism Award 2024. 'When I was a child, I wanted to study science. I had a sixth-grade science teacher who had given back my final exam result with a big '42' written on the top. He looked at me and said – 'that is okay, you have a 'girl brain' and girl brains do not do science. Girl brains do poetry and get married.' I did not study science then. I studied literature. Later while freelance editing for Springer Science, I got back to science in a way,' shared Maria. 'When recently I learnt I was a finalist for National Association of Science Writers Journalism Award, I just thought if that teacher was alive and could see that girls could do science too.' Gender-based harmful stereotypes and social norms need to be countered and dismantled if we are to achieve health and gender justice. Gabriela Leone, the co-curator of the exhibition titled 'Taking Care: The Black Angels of Seaview Hospital' (which is open for public view till 29 December 2024 at Staten Island Museum), said that Maria's book 'Black Angels' greatly informed and inspired the exhibition. Isoniazid study to cure TB In 1951, Seaview Hospital conducted the clinical study of isoniazid (one of the two most powerful first-line anti-TB drugs even today). Seaview's black Angel nurses and other support staff conducted the study- counselling the patients and seeking consent from every study participant, administering medicines, monitoring and observing patients, and reporting results to the two doctors-in-charge (Dr Edward Robitzek and Dr Irving Selikoff). This was a landmark study as isoniazid was shown to work in curing TB when other therapies did not. It could be used in combination with other drugs for improved treatment outcomes. Dr Edward and Dr Irving received the prestigious Lasker Award for their work, but the black Angel nurses and support staff who risked their lives to help conduct the study, did not receive the same recognition. This real story of isoniazid study and how black Angel nurses were made to slip on the blind-spot when it came to awards and recognitions, was one of the drivers for Maria to write the book. 'Black women in science had been erased from this narrative. I am not saying that the men do not deserve the accolades, which they received, but the women who helped conduct these studies, also deserved it. In fact, Dr Edward Robitzek had said: 'had it not been for the black nurses, none of this would have been able to happen'.' Maria reflects on the inequities plaguing our health systems even today. 'We have a two-tiered healthcare system,' she says, referring to a small number of rich privileged elites who can get best of healthcare services while the majority of human population struggles to access even the basic healthcare. Agrees Ela Gandhi: 'Unless we have proper living conditions for everyone, along with safe housing, just wages, nutrition, water, sanitation and hygiene, how will we prevent diseases that lack of these basic necessities puts people at risk (such as TB)? We must end poverty and hunger and ensure everyone has equitable access to healthcare services in a rights-based manner. 'Racial inequities and injustices continue to plague the TB response even today. Most of the TB burden is in poor countries (low- and middle-income countries) in the Global South. Even in the rich nations, marginalised communities are at higher risk of TB', says Tariro Kutadza, TB and HIV community leader from Zimbabwe. Kutadza lauds Virginia Allen and all other black Angel nurses who took care of the patients without any prejudice or discrimination 100 years ago. They did justice to their duty and humanity by taking care of all TB patients regardless of whether they were white or black or brown; whether they were Americans or Latinos or from any part of the world; whether they were rich or poor. The accountability needle and question is pointing towards all other nurses - white nurses in this context - who stayed away from serving their duty and the cause of TB, she said. We can end TB only if we end inequity, inequality and injustice. If we can ensure access for everyone to the full range of best of TB services in a people-centred and rights-based manner, then only we will be able to move towards ending TB. When we say, 'all lives matter,' then does this include lives of us in the Global South also, wonders, Tariro. Agrees Maria Smilios: 'TB is a disease for which we say that it is curable - and add in the same sentence that 'it is a leading infectious disease killer in the world.' If we have a cure, then how come TB is a top killer infectious disease today?' It is because of inequities and injustices that plague our societies where 'some are more equal than others' when it comes to access to health and rights. 'Health inequities exist because we continue to ignore other people.' While many scientific advances have been made since the times of the Black Angels for prevention, diagnosis, treatment and care of people with TB, they are still not available to 1.1 million people today who died from it and 10.8 million people who got infected with TB last year. Unless we end all forms of inequities and injustices that plague our health and social services and bridge the deadly divide between rich and the poor, we will not only fail to end TB but instead force people to live in risky situations that put them at risk of TB and TB deaths - and face a range of other human rights violations. It is high time we make the right choice grounded in human rights, racial equity and development justice.

Indian Migrants Remit $129 Billion Back Home In 2024 – OpEd	India remains the topmost recipient of remittances in 2024 with an estimated inflow of US$129 billion. It was followed by Mexico ($68 billion), China ($48 billion), Philippines ($40 billion) and Pakistan ($33 billion), a blog post by World Bank economists said. The main reason was driven by a recovery in the job markets in high income countries. The growth rate of remittances this year is estimated to be 5.8 percent, compared to 1.2 percent registered in 2023, according to the report. 'The recovery of the job markets in the high-income countries of the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), following the onset of the pandemic, was the key driver of remittances,' the Business Standard newspaper reported quoting the blog as saying. It added that officially recorded remittances to low-and middle-income countries (LMICs) are expected to reach $685 billion in 2024, an increase from $470 billion in 2021. India also has the world’s largest skilled workforce. Many talented Indian doctors, IT specialists, scientists, professors, economists, journalists, engineers, and managers are currently working all around the globe. According to the United Nations’ International Migration Highlights, India has the largest diaspora in the world, with 35.42 million Indians living outside the motherland. The United Arab Emirates (UAE), US, Saudi Arabia and Malaysia host the largest number of migrants from India. The diaspora is a powerful driver for India’s sustainable development. Indians have been at the top in sending remittances for several years. The blog post said remittances have continued to outpace other types of external financial flows to low- and middle-income countries and will continue to increase because of enormous migration pressures driven by demographic trends, income gaps, and climate change. It said the gap between remittances and Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) is expected to widen further in 2024. In the past decade, remittances increased by 57 percent, while FDI declined by 41 percent, the World Bank said. 'Countries need to take note of the size and resilience of remittances and find ways to leverage these flows for poverty reduction, financing health and education, financial inclusion of households, and improving access to capital markets for state and non-state enterprises,' the blog said. According to the Business Standard, remittance flows to South Asia are expected to register the highest increase in 2024, at 11.8 percent, driven by continued strong flows to India, Pakistan, and Bangladesh, the blog post by economists Dilip Ratha, Sonia Plazaeung and financial analyst Ju Kim, added. The main question is how many Indians live abroad? According to the Indian External Affairs Ministry, as of May 2024, there are presently 35.42 million Indians living abroad. This number includes 15.85 non-resident Indians (NRIs) and 19.57 million persons of Indian origin (PIOs). Actually, which are the countries where most of the Indians live? The U.S. is a country where most of the Indians live. There are 5.4 million Indians live in the U.S. The United Arab Emirates is home to 3.56 million Indians, Malaysia 2.91 million , Canada 2.87 million and Saudi Arabia 2.40 million Indians are living. Every year, 2.5 million Indians migrate to other countries. This is the highest number in the world. In Jakarta, some of the Indian expatriates work and send every month money back to India. 'I work in a private company and send some $2,000 every month to India. My parents will get Rs 1.70 lakh and they are very happy,' an Indian expatriate, who refuse to reveal his identity, told this author. ‘’My brother works in a Middle Eastern country and he also sends $2,000 to India. It means my parents every month will get Rs 3.4 lakhs and they are very happy,' he told this author. Indians are helping their families by sending the money home.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfgCDIw0DiRpWsrqf-fXwMp	2024-12-20T09:36:59-08:00	
CPEC: A Strategic Leap Towards Regional Economic Transformation –...	The China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC), as a flagship project under the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), has emerged as a game-changer in Pakistan’s journey towards becoming a pivotal regional economic hub. By enhancing connectivity, fostering energy security, and driving industrial development, CPEC represents not just an infrastructure project but a transformative force that aligns with Pakistan’s long-term development goals. With over $62 billion invested in various projects, CPEC promises to reshape Pakistan’s economy and position it as a central player in regional trade and prosperity. CPEC’s infrastructure and energy projects are perhaps its most visible and impactful aspects. Over 800 kilometers of highways have been constructed, significantly improving connectivity across the country. This has not only streamlined trade within Pakistan but also enhanced its ability to serve as a key transit route between Central Asia, South Asia, and the Middle East. The development of over 5,000 kilometers of roads and motorways, with Gwadar Port at the heart of this network, is expected to reduce transport costs, save time, and foster economic integration in the region. Simultaneously, CPEC has made notable strides in addressing Pakistan’s chronic energy shortages. The addition of over 8,000 megawatts (MW) to the national grid is helping bridge the country’s power deficit, enabling industrial growth, and improving the quality of life for millions of citizens. The power generation capacity in Pakistan has risen from 24,000 MW in 2015 to 41,000 MW in 2023, largely due to CPEC’s energy projects. This surge has alleviated energy crises, reducing power outages by 35% and facilitating industrial operations. CPEC is not just a conduit for infrastructure development; it is a catalyst for broader economic growth. The cumulative impact of its various projects—spanning energy, transportation, and industry—has contributed to Pakistan's GDP growth. By 2030, the initiative is expected to boost Pakistan’s GDP by 2.5% annually. The economic landscape has also been enriched by the establishment of Special Economic Zones (SEZs) under CPEC. By 2024, nine SEZs will have been established, attracting over $8 billion in foreign direct investment (FDI) and creating approximately 500,000 jobs, of which 40% are allocated to local workers. The growth of industries in these zones is expected to boost exports, further integrating Pakistan into the global economy. In terms of trade, CPEC has proven to be a valuable asset. The trade volume through the corridor surged from $4.8 billion in 2015 to $16 billion by 2023, demonstrating the increased flow of goods between Pakistan, China, and regional markets. The reduction in travel time for goods from Gwadar to China by 50% has saved Pakistan an estimated $1 billion annually, making it an increasingly competitive player in the global marketplace. One of CPEC’s most significant long-term impacts is its potential for socioeconomic uplift. By prioritizing infrastructure development in underdeveloped regions such as Balochistan and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, CPEC is contributing to poverty alleviation and regional stability. Improved access to electricity has benefitted over 50,000 households in these regions between 2020 and 2024, while the construction of roads and highways has spurred local economic activities and enhanced social mobility. The initiative also strengthens Pakistan’s position as a central player in regional trade. With CPEC’s strategic focus on enhancing transportation links, Pakistan has emerged as a trade hub connecting China, Central Asia, South Asia, and the Middle East. The development of Gwadar Port is particularly crucial in this regard, as it positions Pakistan as an international shipping and logistics center, further increasing its importance on the world stage. CPEC’s economic success lies not only in its tangible infrastructure and energy projects but also in its design as a sustainable partnership. The myth of CPEC as a 'debt trap' has been debunked by recent reports that show Pakistan’s CPEC-related debt constitutes less than 10% of its total external debt. The majority of funding for CPEC projects comes from a mix of investments, grants, and low-interest loans, ensuring that Pakistan’s fiscal health remains stable while still reaping the benefits of massive infrastructure and industrial development. Moreover, CPEC is contributing to global sustainability efforts. Renewable energy projects, such as solar and wind power plants, are part of the initiative’s commitment to reducing Pakistan’s reliance on fossil fuels and aligning with global climate goals. This green transition not only ensures a reliable energy supply for Pakistan but also fosters long-term environmental sustainability. As CPEC progresses, the impact on Pakistan’s economy will continue to unfold, positioning the country as a regional trade and economic hub by 2030. The potential for job creation, industrial growth, and improved living standards is vast. Pakistan is expected to see a 70% increase in trade volume, cementing its role as a vital artery for regional and global commerce. To ensure that the full potential of CPEC is realized, strategic communication plays a crucial role. From media campaigns to academic discussions, the success of CPEC should be highlighted across all platforms. Engaging key stakeholders through talk shows, seminars, and digital content will foster greater awareness and understanding of CPEC’s benefits. A focused communication strategy will ensure that Pakistan maximizes the opportunities offered by this monumental initiative, ensuring shared prosperity for the country and its regional partners. In conclusion, CPEC is far more than just a series of infrastructure projects; it is a transformative initiative that holds the potential to reshape Pakistan’s economic landscape. With continued investments, strategic integration, and effective communication, CPEC can elevate Pakistan to new heights of prosperity, connectivity, and regional stability, benefitting not just the nation but the broader region as well.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfgCDIw0DiRpdfEERM4J_G7	2024-12-20T09:35:32-08:00	
Jaish-E-Mohammed Re-Emerges In Pakistan – Analysis	By Sushant Sareen The United Nations Security Council (UNSC) designated terrorist Masood Azhar and his organisation Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM) are once again emerging as Pakistan’s go-to non-state instrument for advancing its foreign and security policy agenda, not just against India but also against the Taliban-run Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan. In Azhar’s recent speech to his JeM terrorist cadre, he vowed to send his men to wage jihad in Kashmir and hinted at operations against Israel. This was followed by a message threatening to 'liberate' the Babri Masjid and attack the Ram Janambhoomi temple in Ayodhya. This serves as a clear sign that JeM is now emerging from the shadows and will operate relatively openly, especially against India. Although India's Ministry of External Affairs has called out Pakistan’s 'duplicity' in fighting terrorism and has demanded strong action against Masood Azhar and JeM, it is unlikely that Pakistan’s military establishment will change its decision to redeploy its terror auxiliaries against its adversaries. Over the last few years, Pakistan has steadily replaced the Jamaat-ud-Dawa (JuD) as its favoured jihadist instrument. Many of the top leadership of the JuD were imprisoned (mostly on charges of money laundering and terror finance), and its cadres demobilised, at least for the time being. The JuD had become a liability because of the international opprobrium directed at Pakistan’s use of jihadist terrorism to pursue its foreign and security objectives. There was also a lot of pressure on Pakistan because of the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) ‘greylisting’, which forced verifiable action against internationally proscribed terror groups. This was the time when the JuD was replaced by JeM, which has been rehabilitated and rejuvenated, and has steadily ramped up its activities, albeit silently and without any publicity. While the JuD wasn’t entirely put out of business, the reliance on the JeM has since grown significantly. This was despite the fact that the JeM and Masood Azhar were also proscribed by the UNSC. The FATF had made Azhar one of the test cases for Pakistan to demonstrate investigation and prosecution targeted against him. Apart from Masood Azhar, the mastermind of the 26/11 attacks, Sajid Mir of the Lashkar-e-Taiba was another test case. The Pakistanis seemed to have decided to sacrifice Sajid Mir and save Azhar. This is evident from the fact that in 2022, in its progress report to the Asia-Pacific Joint Group on its 2018 action plan, Pakistan made the plea that it was unaware of Azhar’s whereabouts. According to Pakistan, it had not kept track of his movements since he was not designated a terrorist by the UN until May 2019. Just a few weeks before Masood Azhar was designated as a terrorist by the UNSC, the then-foreign minister of Pakistan, Shah Mahmood Qureshi, had claimed that Azhar was extremely sick and was confined to his home. Miraculously, Azhar recovered just in time to supposedly ‘disappear’ as soon as he was listed by the UNSC and has not been traced since! Even so, the Pakistanis claimed later that they had convicted Masood Azhar in absentia for nine years in August 2021 and had also approached the Taliban authorities in Afghanistan to get their cooperation to apprehend him. In September 2022, on the eve of being taken off the FATF grey list, the Pakistanis claimed Azhar was hiding in Afghanistan, inviting an angry response from the Taliban, who not only denied his presence but went on to say that such 'terrorist organisations' can operate on Pakistani soil under 'official patronage'. By 2022, with relations between Pakistan and the Taliban going into a tailspin, the Pakistanis tried to throw the Afghans under the bus and pin Masood Azhar on them. Something similar happened during the latest address of Azhar when he tried to highlight his close relationship with the Taliban Interior Minister Sirajuddin Haqqani. Haqqani, however, distanced himself from Azhar and refuted his claims. After Pakistan was taken off the FATF 'grey list' in October 2022, some of the constraints imposed by Pakistan on JeM were lifted. Since around that time, there has been a steady uptick in violence in Jammu and Kashmir (J&K), with some high-profile ambushes of military convoys. Although the JeM has been operating through front organisations like the Peoples Anti Fascist Front (PAFF) and the Kashmir Tigers for some years now, there has been a spurt in their activities since the FATF noose was taken off Pakistan's neck. Notably, the front organisations of JeM have generally been involved in target killings of soft targets—migrant workers, minority community members, tourists and locals. The more professional ambushes of military convoys are believed to have been carried out by battle-hardened Jaish cadres who have preferred not to take responsibility for the attacks, lest the heat comes on Pakistan, as it did after the Pulwama suicide bombing in 2019. Masood Azhar’s latest rants indicate that Jaish will now spearhead the export of Jihadist terrorism into Kashmir, something that has once again become the policy of the Pakistan military establishment under the current Pakistan Army Chief Asim Munir. Although the JeM has, for the most part, continued to operate under the radar, it probably has both an organisational and leadership compulsion to occasionally come out in the open. In part, this is to rouse the cadre, attract more recruits with fiery and passionate rhetoric, and infuse in the fighters the jihadist fervour to undertake suicidal missions. This is also to push the envelope with the minders from the military establishment and, in the process, increase the space of operation and gain greater autonomy of action. In addition, it is to send a signal to the enemy (read India) that the jihadist option remains available to Pakistan and that there is an endless supply of jihadist cannon fodder it can deploy against India to keep the fire burning under the pot of terrorism. The purpose of this signalling is to disabuse India of any notion that Pakistan is no longer in the fray and that it can be ignored in trying to settle Kashmir. The speech and message of Masood Azhar is also to apprise India that actions will not just remain limited to J&K but will also extend to exploit both the real and manufactured grievances of Muslims across India. This is also a sort of payback for what Pakistan alleges (one daresay without any shred of evidence) is Indian support for the Baloch and Tehrik-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) insurgencies ravaging through the trans-Indus regions of Pakistan. The Jaish’s utility is not limited to India alone; as a Deobandi jihadist group, the Jaish has had close links with not just the Taliban (both Afghan and Pakistani) but also with other ultra-radical Sunni Deobandi terror groups like the Lashkar-e-Jhangvi and its political fount, Sipah-e-Sahaba Pakistan or its newest avatar Ahle Sunnat wal Jamaat (ASwJ). For Pakistan, which is trying to fight the onslaught of the TTP, the JeM can play a role in weaning away the Punjabi Taliban and redirecting them to the eastern front with India. This is an effort that has been underway for over a decade but has probably gained even more urgency now. Even if the Punjabi Taliban and the Deobandi mullahs are no longer in a position to intercede with the Pashtun Taliban on behalf of the Pakistani state, separating them from the TTP can at least deny them the use of their networks and operational capabilities in Punjab and Sindh. India, of course, cannot afford to be complacent. While the statement by the MEA spokesman does well to flag the issue, India needs to agitate this matter not just before the FATF and other international organisations but also with its partners in the international community. At the same time, the security agencies need to rejig their protocols and grids to factor in new, more lethal tactics that battle-hardened terrorists will bring to bear in Jammu and Kashmir and other parts of India. The developments in Bangladesh, where Deobandi terror groups with links to Pakistani jihadist terror organisations like JeM are re-emerging and re-energising under a climate of impunity, add to the threat matrix confronting India, more so given the nexus that the interim regime in Dhaka is trying to develop with Islamabad and Rawalpindi.

Mongolia Marks Centennial With A New Course For Change – Analysis	By Jack Weatherford With Mongolia having celebrated the centenary of its first constitution on 26 November 2024, the nation has pledged to modernise its governance and entrench democratic norms and practices during a time of geopolitical division in East Asia. Mongolia is considering how the original constitution’s ideals of sovereignty, equality and modernisation, which have provided the foundation for the country’s development in the past century, can be promoted in a contemporary setting. Mongolia’s path to modern statehood began in 1924, when its first socialist constitution transformed the country from a religious monarchy into the People’s Republic of Mongolia. The constitution asserted sovereignty and established the government of Mongolia through the Great People’s Assembly, marking a groundbreaking shift toward unified leadership. Women gained equal rights, the state and religion were officially separated and education became free for all. Beyond changing who held power, this constitution advanced progressive ideas for its time. The 1924 constitution laid the groundwork for Mongolia’s modernisation. Over the course of a century, Mongolia’s constitutional framework has evolved in response to shifting societal, political and economic conditions, with significant changes adopted in 1940, 1960 and 1992. The latter, adopted in the wake of the Soviet Union’s collapse and the country’s transition to democracy, declared Mongolia a sovereign, independent and democratic republic. This transformation aligned with the UN Universal Declaration of Human Rights, ensuring the protection of fundamental rights and freedoms. Constitutional amendments in 1999, 2000, 2019 and 2022 have continued to shape the country’s democratic landscape. In 2023, further reforms increased the size of the State Great Khural, Mongolia’s unicameral parliament, from 76 to 126 members, of which nearly 40 per cent are elected through proportional representation. The changes passed with broad cross-party support, underscoring a national consensus on the importance of promoting unity and advancing democracy. Following Mongolia’s parliamentary elections on 28 June 2024 and the formation of a new cross-party government, the 1924 constitution’s legacy continues to inspire reform efforts, including the ‘Parliament 2.0’ agenda unveiled on 2 October 2024 by the Speaker of Parliament Amarbayasgalan Dashzegve. This agenda is based on three pillars, aiming to modernise Mongolia’s legislative process and governance structure. The first pillar focuses on integrating human rights into every legislative decision, while the second pillar aims to ensure that evolving advancements such as digital currencies and blockchain technology are reflected in legal and regulatory frameworks. The third pillar focuses on simplifying legal language to enhance transparency, reduce ambiguity and differentiate between matters best addressed by law and those that require specific regulatory guidance. The significance of the ‘Parliament 2.0’ agenda lies in its recognition that democratic institutions must evolve to remain effective. Mongolia is seeking to demonstrate how a nation can adapt its governance framework to better meet contemporary challenges, while remaining true to core values. But progress rarely takes a linear path. For example, there remains a need to tackle the long-term issue of corruption, as demonstrated in December 2022 when protestors took to the streets following allegations over corruption linked to the country’s coal trade with China. Despite facing challenges, Mongolia remains committed to democracy and extending its diplomatic and trade links beyond its immediate neighbourhood. For example, a new draft law to improve freedom of the press has been welcomed as a positive sign by Reporters Without Borders, who say its passage would demonstrate a ‘commitment to press freedom’. Mongolia’s challenge will be staying true to its democratic path while its economic success, at least in the short-term, remains closely reliant on trade with its nearest neighbours. While Mongolia still needs to entrench democratic norms at all levels of society, the new set of legislative and governance reforms is a promising sign as the country charts its course in the years ahead.

India’s Oil Strategy In The Trump Era – Analysis	By Amit Bhandari and Aditya Shinde During his visit to Guyana in South America (20-21 November), Prime Minister Modi signed a number of MOUs, including one for cooperation in the hydrocarbon (petroleum) sector.[1] The agreement included sourcing of crude oil, cooperation in natural gas and development of infrastructure.[2] Guyana has become an important oil producer in the past five years – from its astounding oil discovery in 2015 and first oil production in 2019, Guyana now produces 645,000 barrels/day of oil. A consortium led by U.S. oil major ExxonMobil, which includes China’s state-owned CNOOC, is producing this oil. To the north, the U.S. seems set to witness a further boost to its oil industry. Incoming President Donald Trump has announced Chris Wright[3], an oil industry executive with extensive experience in shale oil, as his energy secretary. The expectation is that under a Trump administration, there will be fewer curbs on America’s extensive oil industry. The U.S. is already the world’s largest producer of petroleum, well ahead of Saudi Arabia and Russia. Under an industry-friendly Trump administration, described as 'drill, baby, drill.,' U.S. oil production is set to rise further. These production increases will address the growing global demand for oil. OPEC, the group of oil-producing states, projects that the world’s oil demand will increase to 120 million barrels/day by 2050, up from 102 million barrels/day in 2023. India alone is projected to account for an additional 8 million barrels/day, or 45% of this rise.[4] Clearly, the petroleum industry is far from spent, and still has a long way to go and to grow. The recently concluded COP29, whose outcomes have been described as unsatisfactory, also shows that the world is not yet financially or technologically capable of moving away from traditional fuels. These projections also highlight an uncomfortable fact – that India is lagging in the race for oil. India relies on imports for over 85% of its oil requirement and import dependence will go past 90% given the projected growth in demand. Higher prices of imported oil, as seen in the weeks after the start of the Ukraine war, hurt India’s economy. India has continued to buy Russian oil during the conflict, at the risk of incurring U.S. sanctions, to keep its economy going. With Trump set to deescalate the Russia-Ukraine war, this is one risk that will recede. One way to get around this problem, as China has done, is to invest in oil and gas fields overseas. While India made a promising start in the early 2000s, this initiative has faltered in the past decade. ONGC Videsh Limited (OVL), the national oil company tasked with acquiring foreign assets, has slowed down. In the past five years, OVL has made just two acquisitions – a 14% stake in a Senegalese oil field in 2020[5], and a purchase of 0.615% in an oil field in Azerbaijan, where it already held a 2.31% stake. The financial return from an oil field partly mitigates the impact of higher oil prices. OVL’s own oil and gas production is falling – from a peak of 15 million tons per year in 2019-20, it was down to 10.5 million tons in 2023-24. Much of India’s efforts to secure energy in the past few years have been directed at encouraging electric vehicles and blending ethanol with petrol. Electric vehicle penetration in India remains low, and there are no worthy electric options on the horizon for heavy trucks – which account for over 40% of India’s total oil consumption. In the case of two-wheelers and cars, EVs are just 4.4% and 1.9% of present sales. The share of EVs as a percentage of vehicles on the road is minuscule, as is their impact on India’s oil demand. In the case of ethanol blending, India has substituted 18.1 million tons of crude oil imports over the past decade – less than 1% of total consumption[6]. Ethanol is produced from sugarcane, a notoriously water-thirsty crop which requires farmland that will be otherwise used for food production. While these strategies may offer other benefits, energy security is not one of them. India needs to get back in the game of investing in overseas oil and take a broader view on how to make smart investments. For instance, OVL owns a stake in the Zakum oil block, 84 km northwest of Abu Dhabi Islands, acquired in 2018, but is not the operator of the oil field.[7] This is no different from a financial investment. Instead of buying minority stakes in individual oil projects, India can consider acquiring small stakes in listed oil companies such as Saudi Aramco, ExxonMobil, and Chevron from friendly countries which sit on some of the best and the most diverse portfolios of assets globally and offer attractive stock investment opportunities. In case of the U.S., India should also be open to investing through that country’s deep secondary market in smaller oil companies – which the U.S. has by the thousands. There are three major benefits of this approach. One, it is easier to invest in a listed company than an individual oil project. Each oil field is unique in terms of geology, technical challenges, location, and geopolitics. For instance, Indian companies have large significant investments in Russia (heavily sanctioned), Venezuela (economic meltdown, sanctions) and Myanmar (civil war, sanctions). Companies such as Aramco or ExxonMobil offer a way to invest in oil fields located in stable, friendly regimes. Two, these companies typically pay out a large chunk of their profits as dividends – like Indian PSUs do. For instance, Saudi Aramco has paid out a total dividend of $0.51 per share in 2024[8] – a dividend yield of 7%. Every $100 invested in Aramco will generate a dividend income of $7 per year. ExxonMobil has a dividend yield of 3.3%. These will increase in times of high oil prices – partly offsetting India’s import bill. Three, investments in the U.S. and Saudi Arabia will help improve ties with two of India’s closest partners. India is partnering with Saudi Arabia for IMEC (India-Middle East Economic Corridor). An Indian investment that helps support high-paying blue-collar jobs in the oil industry is a sure way to build ties with the new U.S. government, which is more inclined to the traditional energy sector. To activate this effort, India will need to create a new entity – a pure fund. Resource acquisitions by foreign state-owned enterprises often raise hackles in the home country, as happened with CNOOC’s (China) proposed investment of U.S. oil firm Unocal in 2005. CNOOC dropped the deal, which was also discussed in the U.S. Congress. Chinese firms have faced a similar pushback in Australia and Canada. A purely financial investment by a dedicated fund will not raise such concerns. Oil-rich countries such as Norway, Abu Dhabi and Kuwait have long channelled part of their oil wealth into a ‘rainy day’ fund, to offset low oil prices. As an oil importer, India must prepare for the opposite – times when oil prices are high – and can use a similar approach. The past decade has been one of moderate oil prices. There is no assurance that prices will continue to be moderate – a concern as India revs up its manufacturing plans. India should therefore channel some gains from low oil prices into a wealth fund which will mitigate the pain of high oil prices.

Thread In Struggle: Myanmar’s Garment Workers Under Siege – Analy...	By Dr. Htet Khaing Min The combined impact of economic hardship and forced military conscription on garment workers in Myanmar and their struggles reflect systemic exploitation in the global fashion industry. Key Takeaways: Myanmar’s garment workers endure severe exploitation, compounded by the military junta’s suppression of unions, inflation, and forced conscription. The withdrawal of major fashion brands, citing ethical concerns, further destabilized the industry, leading to increased child labor and unsafe working conditions. Addressing the crisis requires global advocacy, corporate responsibility, humanitarian aid, and targeted sanctions to restore worker rights and economic stability. A recent commentary in Fulcrum by ISEAS illustrates the arduous conditions female workers face in Myanmar’s garment industry. Imagine a woman in her thirties rushing to a garment factory in Myanmar before the clock strikes 8 a.m. She knows even a minute’s delay will mean a deduction from her already meager daily wage of 6,800 kyats (≆ 1.5 $)—a sum that includes unpaid overtime. She works tirelessly from morning until 8 p.m., and her short lunch break is spent in crowded factory lanes or on the floor if she’s late to claim a spot. Holidays offer no reprieve; her boss pressures her to meet impossible targets, warning of grudges or job loss. Her family’s financial strain forces her 13-year-old sister to abandon school and work alongside her, who was hidden by the company during inspections. Meanwhile, the looming threat of military conscription drives her brother overseas, leaving her as the sole provider. She endures harassment from a male supervisor, unable to speak out for fear of losing her job in a system devoid of unions. This story might sound hypothetical, but it mirrors the grim realities faced by Myanmar’s garment workers, caught in a web of exploitation, inflation, and systemic abuse. This article delves into the factors crushing these workers under oppression. 1. Background of Myanmar Garment industry Before scrutinizing the harsh realities of worker oppression, it’s essential to understand the broader landscape of Myanmar’s garment industry first. Ahead of the COVID-19 pandemic, Myanmar’s garment sector was a key pillar of economic growth, supporting approximately 500,000 workers and accounting for 23% of all manufacturing jobs. Many workers, predominantly women, relied on these jobs to sustain their families, with 86% sending significant portions of their earnings back to rural areas. This financial redistribution was a lifeline for vulnerable communities. However, the sector's promise has faltered under political turmoil. The February 2021 military coup, followed by steep inflation, import restrictions, and power outages, has disrupted operations. An estimated 150,000 jobs were lost during the first wave of COVID-19 alone, and by the end of 2020, over 100 garment factories had closed. Post-coup, the industry has seen additional factory closures and job losses, further imperiling workers’ livelihoods. Amid this crisis, the demand for greater productivity has intensified. Many factories now demand double the productivity, forcing employees to work 10-hour days, often without weekends off, while wages remain stagnant or decline in real terms with inflation. 2. Jeopardizing Factors To fully comprehend the plight of Myanmar's garment workers, let’s examine the role of major fashion brands, the impact of conscription, inflation, and the lack of union protection. 2.1. Exodus of Foreign Companies Myanmar’s garment industry, once a global manufacturing hub due to its low labor costs and trade preferences, particularly with the European Union and the United States, has faced significant setbacks since the military coup in 2021. In 2022, exports from this sector reached $7.6 billion, with over half of the revenue stemming from EU markets. However, the junta's political turmoil and oppressive policies have driven several major brands, including Marks & Spencer, Uniqlo, and Inditex (Zara’s parent company), to exit the market. These companies, guided by ethical disengagement frameworks developed with organizations like IndustriALL Global Union, cited escalating labor rights violations and operational risks as reasons for their withdrawal. Meanwhile, some brands, such as Adidas, have continued operations under stricter due diligence policies, though allegations of worker exploitation persist. The Myanmar Garment Manufacturers Association reported that by December 2023, 298 member factories had ceased operations. This marks an increase of 52 closures compared to the previous year, with the share of non-operational factories rising to 36% from 31% in December 2022. Foreign companies face mounting challenges in Myanmar, including new currency regulations that force exporters to exchange 75% of their earnings at unfavorable rates, rampant inflation, and frequent blackouts. Meanwhile, inspectors like IndustriALL and the Fair Wear Foundation flagged over 556 cases of human rights violations in factories linked to international brands by mid-2024. This growing exodus underscores the ethical and operational minefield that Myanmar’s garment sector has become. 2.2. The Impact of Conscription Law Furthermore, introducing a new conscription law in 2024 has intensified the challenges faced by Myanmar’s workforce, particularly in the garment sector. Under the law, all men aged 18 to 35 and women aged 18 to 27 are eligible for military service, with the junta asserting that women will not be drafted for the time being. However, the broader impact of forced enlistment is already being felt across the workforce. Factory workers, especially those from factories supplying international brands, have been drafted, disrupting production and creating widespread instability. A growing labor shortage has emerged in urban areas like Yangon, forcing some factories to increase daily wages to retain skilled workers. However, these efforts fall short of addressing years of wage stagnation. The conscription law has also sparked fears of forced recruitment in industrial zones, with mass resignations and employers being pressured to provide personal details of their workforce. This has led to an increase in child labor as factories turn to underage workers to fill gaps, subjecting them to long hours and exploitation. 2.3. The Inflationary Pressures In response to post-conscription labor shortages, some factories in Myanmar increased wages by 20–30% between 2020 and 2024. However, these modest raises have failed to compensate for years of declining real wages, especially when contrasted with the staggering 160% increase in the cost of a common diet during the same period. This disparity leaves garment workers struggling to meet basic needs, forcing many former workers into dangerous informal jobs, including sex work, to survive. Fueled by excessive money printing and widespread distrust of the kyat, inflation has pushed living costs to unsustainable levels. Economist Jared Bissinger estimates that if wages had kept pace with skyrocketing inflation, the minimum daily wage would be 12,000 kyats instead of the current 6,800 kyats—insufficient to feed a family. Concurrently, international brands exiting Myanmar due to ethical concerns exacerbate the economic strain, reducing foreign investment and destabilizing the currency. Skilled workers, facing bleak prospects, are fleeing the country, leaving factories reliant on underqualified and child labor to fill the gaps. Even modest wage increases in 2024, driven by labor shortages, fail to address the years of declining real incomes, further entrenching cycles of poverty and economic instability. 2.4 Suppression of Labor Unions Since the 2021 coup, labor rights in Myanmar have plummeted to their lowest point, with the military junta systematically dismantling unions, banning collective organizing, and harassing labor leaders. This suppression leaves workers without any platform to advocate for fair wages or improved working conditions. The lack of union representation has exacerbated the exploitation of garment workers, who now face forced overtime, illegal dismissals, and wage theft without recourse. Women comprise most garment workers and are particularly vulnerable in this union-free environment, lacking alternative income sources or support systems. The junta's crackdown on unions is part of a broader strategy to eliminate labor mobilization, as it sees organizing as a political threat to its authoritarian regime. The absence of unions also blinds international brands to the ground realities in factories, preventing them from addressing labor abuses. Organizations like IndustriALL have brought attention to this crisis through the complaints of the OECD (Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development), urging global companies to uphold ethical supply chain practices. In the interim, the European Union, Myanmar’s largest garment export market, is reevaluating its 'Everything But Arms' trade preferences, which, if revoked, could economically pressure the junta but risk further destabilizing the garment sector and its workers. 3. A Path Forward Addressing these challenges in Myanmar’s garment industry requires coordinated efforts from multiple stakeholders. Given the situation's urgency, immediate action (described below) is needed to protect the garment worker’s rights. Corporate Responsibility: Brands operating in Myanmar must prioritizeworkers’ welfare, ensuring fair wages, safe conditions, and freedom of association. Companies that choose to disengage must do so responsibly, minimizing worker harm. International Advocacy: Labor rights organizations and governments must support rebuilding unions and advocate for reinstating workers' rights. Diplomatic efforts should focus on pressuring the junta to lift restrictions on labor organizing. Humanitarian Aid: Displaced workers and their families need financial and material support to navigate the economic crisis. This assistance can help mitigate the impact of job losses and conscription. Sanctions and Diplomacy: Targeted sanctions against the junta’s economic lifelines, coupled with diplomatic initiatives to restore democracy, can weakenthe regime’s grip on power. The plight of Myanmar's garment workers demands urgent attention from the National Unity Government (NUG). As the people's government, the NUG’s Ministry of Labour must intensify efforts to combat human rights abuses and hold accountable those exploiting worker rights by presenting the ongoing situation in UN meetings and ILO hearings. Strengthened collaboration with international labor organizations is essential to pressure global brands to adhere to ethical disengagement strategies. Such measures are crucial to curtail the military government’s financial gains from foreign investments and to protect the dignity and welfare of Myanmar's workers. Conclusion After analyzing the predicament of Myanmar’s garment workers it paints a grim picture of intersecting crises that have left them trapped and voiceless. Yet, their resilience in the face of such adversity is both inspiring and heartbreaking. These women and underage workers continue to endure, striving to keep their hopes alive despite relentless challenges. The responsibility to act falls on those who claim to be governments, corporations, and global citizens who champion human rights and workers' welfare. Every moment of inaction dims the future of these workers. The international community must hold the military regime accountable, prioritize ethical labor practices, and ensure that Myanmar’s economic recovery is built on justice and dignity. Only then can the garment sector become a source of empowerment, paving the way for a more equitable and sustainable future.

The Banalization Of Education – OpEd	The self-evident degradation of educational quality in our society today has several causes. But of all of them there are three that most immediately come to mind. The first is the apparent inability of teachers and curricular designers to rigorously analyze the impact of new technologies on culture in general, and on the cognitive patterns of students in particular. The second is the tendency among teachers and administrators to rapidly and often unreflectively consign exemplarity and love, long considered central to the learning process, to marginal roles within their daily teaching practices. The third is the custom among many teachers who are alienated and frightened by the promotion of hedonistic individualism under our culture’s dominant ethos of consumerism to try to remedy this evil by drastically minimizing the concepts of merit and personal responsibility in their interactions with students. In his Amusing Ourselves to Death (1984), the great educational philosopher Neil Postman, following in the footsteps of his mentor Marshall McLuhan, reminds us again and again that while we, as adherents of the modern creed of inexorable linear progress, like to focus almost exclusively on the supposed benefits provided by new communication technologies, we tend to ignore the fact that each such innovation carries with it a new epistemology; that is, a new way of mentally organizing the physical, spatial, and temporal elements of our lives. Postman does not believe that it is either advisable or possible to try to hinder or cancel the development of new communication tools. But he warns that it is the responsibility of all people interested in the continuity and enrichment of culture to talk openly and honestly about which cognitive and human qualities are lost, and which are gained, with the adoption of each important new communicative technology. He suggests that it is only when we know whether and/or how the new technologies facilitate the apprehension of the skills and the canons of knowledge that we, as adults, have decided as essential to the achievement of the good life, that we should allow them a prominent place in our classrooms. But in order to do this, we would, of course, have had to do something that we have not done as citizens, educators, and administrators until now: have a serious debate about what exactly is this Good Life thing that the Greek philosophers (and every serious educator in history until quite recently) talked about, and what are the skills, and perhaps more importantly, the set of cognitive and psychological dispositions that are most likely to help students achieve it. And this confusion brings us back to the second problem mentioned at the outset of this piece: how technical innovations profoundly alter our ways of perceiving reality. When people, like Postman, reflect upon this phenomenon they generally focus, as we have seen, on how technological innovations affect our perceptions of space and time. What they do not highlight as often, however, is how they can also alter our perceptions of the very nature of what it means to be human. I am referring to the rising tendency to conceptualize students as machines, and from there, the learning process in terms of the operations of a computer in which the output (knowledge) is seen as a mere product of the sum of the inputs (information) carefully provided by the programmer (the teacher). Much more than information processors, however, young people are seekers of the transcendental; that is, those realities and experiences that transport them beyond ordinary elements of their daily lives. This is why they take so many risks during adolescence. And that is why they also seek, often without being able to admit it, adults who possess what they do not yet have: a knowledge of their own strength, uniqueness, talent, and resilience. They are constantly seeking beacons of exemplarity, visions of what it means to be an intellectually formed person with the ability to wrestle with life and with complex ideas with enthusiasm and a style of their own. And if, due to a lack of security or a fear of being seen as 'repressive,' we as educators do not show them this authority—understood here in the etymologically-linked sense of becoming the true author of one’s life—they will look for it elsewhere. At the same time as this, they are constantly looking for love, something that should not be confused, as is so often the case in our day, with an indulgence of their immature ways of being. No, they are desperately looking for a platonic form of love, honed by the constant, careful, and compassionate observation of them by a teacher who strives to understand their unique ways of being, and who seeks to convey to them, in small ways and large, that they are always much smarter and more capable than they believe themselves to be. But to be able to behave like this with young people in a consistent way, the teacher himself must have cultivated his very own source of vitality, rooted in a firm conviction that the process of learning is in itself a noble and humanizing idea, and not a mere adjunct to the ubiquitous game of making a living. And with this we arrive at the last great barrier against intellectual and human excellence in our schools: the listlessness induced in many teachers by our prevailing economic system. While our economic system constantly promises us abundance and happiness, it is sustained in many ways through the cultivation of precariousness in large sectors of the population. And worse, as Debord warned us more than fifty years ago, this consumerist spectacle tends to devour the traditions, values, and ethical presumptions—such as the idea that there must be a certain relationship between the difficulty, danger, or inherent social value of a job and its financial reward—that provided us with a sense of social order for many years. Faced with this chaotic landscape, many teachers give in to discouragement and, in a fit of misplaced sympathy for our students buffeted by the ambient disorder, the temptation to 'liberate' them from the traditional codes of conduct and the need to comply with merit-based canons of achievement. But we must remember that in the life of a young person, there is only one thing worse than suffering the unjust attacks of the adult powers in his or her life. It is intuiting that the adults in their lives are big children; that is, beings incapable of showing them how to fight for personal dignity in a world that, despite all the rhetoric aired in the media in favor of inclusion and diversity, is increasingly characterized by its enormous intolerance towards individuals who disagree with the dominant narratives issued by the great centers of cultural power. Having friends who listen compassionately to our woes is great. But, in general, we can only develop the 'intimate resistance' that fortifies us during the endless struggles of life by observing the ways of being of older people who, having themselves dialogued and fought with both the 'just' and the 'unjust' authorities in their lives, have been able to develop their own philosophy and praxis of being. When those of us who have been invested with institutional authority by society lower ourselves to the level of mere compassionate friends of the students, we run the risk of completely canceling this essential process of growth. It is both incredible and shameful that it has taken us more than fifteen years to start a serious debate on whether or not to allow mobile phones, one of the most disruptive technologies in human history, into schools. They may or may not be a great accelerator of learning. But it’s a crime that we let them into our schools without a serious discussion beforehand about the possible negative consequences of doing so. The same can be said regarding the current race to integrate AI into our teaching paradigms. For centuries philosophers have spoken of the fundamentally spiritual nature of the teaching and learning processes. But under the influence of a culture that has replaced the veneration of transcendental forces with the veneration of mechanical solutions, we have forgotten this, resulting in a tendency to see the student as a kind of machine that processes 'facts' instead of what he is by nature: a flesh and blood miracle capable of the most radical and creative acts of mental alchemy. Consumerism is, to paraphrase León Gieco’s famous anti-war anthem, 'a monster that stomps down hard' and obliterates most everything in its path. And it goes without saying that young people facing this voracious beast deserve compassion. But perhaps more than that, they need practice in what it means to wage intelligent combat against the authority figures in their lives. So rather than trying, in utopian fashion, to try and protect them from pain and clashes with their elders, we should seek to provide them with ample opportunities to spar with us in our schools under conditions that are hopefully mediated by a core respect for their humanity as well as our own. Working within the classic canons of liberal reformism, we can surely institute changes that will slightly improve the educational experience of students in the coming years. But it seems to me that in this moment marked by rapid changes in our perceptions of many basic elements of existence, incremental reforms of this type will no longer suffice. No, to face the educational challenges of our time of breakneck change in an effective way I believe we will have to return, paradoxically, to the old-fashioned spiritual and affective roots of education in our search for answers.

Bangladesh: 10 Shocking Revelations From Commission’s Report Abou...	By Shailaja Neelakantan Macabre killings, casual torture, misdirection and snooping were part of 'the anatomy of enforced disappearances' linked to deposed Bangladesh Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, an inquiry commission said in its first report. The five-member commission learned about how forced disappearances were carried out based on accounts from surviving victims of such incidents – that is, those who resurfaced. The commission, led by a retired Supreme Court judge, presented its report last weekend to Muhammad Yunus, the Nobel laureate who became Bangladesh’s interim leader days after Hasina fled to India on Aug. 5. The commission also interviewed officers, the military and various security forces including the Rapid Action Battalion (RAB). The United States, which sanctioned RAB in December 2021, accused it of more than 600 forced disappearances over 12 years. The commission has recommended RAB be disbanded. A longtime human rights activist, Jyotirmoy Barua, said any claims by Hasina or her supporters that the commission’s members were politically motivated would not hold water. 'The members of the commission are not directly or visibly politically connected – none have a political background,' he told BenarNews. A Bangladeshi human rights lawyer, Sara Hossain, concurred. The commission head was known for his impartiality, and the other four members had long investigated human rights violations under governments led by both major political parties, she said. Below are 10 shocking revelations from the commission’s report, which is based on its scrutiny of 758 forced disappearance cases: 1. The number of forced disappearance cases likely exceeds 3,500, the commission said. It received 1,678 registered complaints. Of the 758 people’s cases it has scrutinized so far, 204, or 27%, are still missing. '[T]he massive scale at which it was unleashed on the population during Sheikh Hasina’s regime is a novel phenomenon,' its report said. 2. Forced disappearances were not carried out by a few bad apples, the commission reported. The finesse with which each of the steps involved in a disappearance were carried out and how responsibilities were divided across agencies – and all over a span of 15 years – did not happen by accident, the report said. '[T]hese systems reflect a deliberate design orchestrated by a central command structure,' the report added. 3. With so many involved, how did the network remain undetected for a decade-and-a-half? That, too, was no accident, the commission found. '[S]security forces would … falsely attribute their actions to other agencies. … The forces would also exchange victims amongst themselves, with one force abducting, another incarcerating, the third one killing or releasing the victims,' the commission learned. 4. Even as they stayed undetected, the perpetrators could be brazen. The report said one victim of forced disappearance who was returned was even told that Hasina was giving him 'a second chance,' but with conditions. 'You must refrain from politics, leave the country, and return only when the situation improves,' he was told, the commission’s report said. 5. Abducting people without anyone around them noticing – known as 'silent pick-ups' – was a vital part of forced disappearance operatives staying undetected. That was entirely impossible without electronic surveillance, according to the commission’s interviews with RAB and military officers. 6. Victims were detained for varying periods, ranging from 48-60 hours to several weeks or months, and in some cases, up to eight years. Some were mixed in with legal detainees and some were stashed in secret cells. The commission said it had identified more than eight secret detention facilities where victims were held across the country. 7. The remarkable consistency in forced disappearance practices across the country, included congruence in torture rituals, which were also 'profoundly brutal and disturbingly methodical,' the commission report said. One victim described RAB sewing his lips shut without anesthetic – 'akin to stitching cowhide.' Another recounted, RAB again, electrocuting his ears and genitals. 8. A forced disappearance case ended in one of two ways, the commission learned. The victim was killed or turned loose into the criminal justice system. For those the operatives decided to kill, they wanted to ensure the body would be difficult to identify. But RAB and other forces couldn’t resist making a sport of it. One survivor said a police officer pushed him onto a highway in front of a vehicle, which swerved away from him. The officer didn’t try again. 9. A victim turned loose into the criminal justice system may have had his or her life spared, but the perpetrators made sure they perversely destroyed that life. The captors filed a slew of cases against the victim in an attempt to justify the forced disappearance. This perpetuates 'the sufferings of victims, who are forced to navigate a deeply flawed and punitive legal system for years afterwards,' the commission report said. 10. India’s Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) government has since 2014, when it came to power, been Hasina’s steadfast supporter. Before that, India’s Congress government too favored a Hasina administration. Did this closeness also involve prisoner exchanges, including of Bangladeshi forced disappearance victims? The commission said it did, basing its assessment on two cases and interviews with soldiers deputed to RAB Intelligence. Zia Chowdhury in Dhaka contributed to this report.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWejIAnupCJlRJhtEeCvgevt	2024-12-19T16:53:52-08:00	
Iran: The Nuclear Program Of Regime At A Crossroad – OpEd	On December 18, a regular session of the United Nations Security Council convened to address nuclear non-proliferation and review the implementation of Resolution 2231 concerning Iran’s nuclear program. During the session, representatives of three permanent Security Council members—the United States, the United Kingdom, and France—each underscored a warning from the United Nations Under-Secretary-General for Political and Peacebuilding Affairs, who stated, 'Time is of the essence.' The U.S. representative said, 'when you look into the forces behind some of today’s most devastating and destabilizing conflicts, you see one country’s name pop up – over and over again: Iran.' The U.K. representative said, 'With UNSCR 2231 set to expire next October, we are reaching a critical juncture. We will take every diplomatic step to prevent Iran from acquiring a nuclear weapon, including the triggering of snapback if necessary.' The French representative said, 'Iran has continued to escalate its nuclear program, in violation of its commitments under the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPoA)… Today, Iran reportedly possesses four ‘significant stockpiles,’ meaning four times the amount of fissile material beyond which the possibility of manufacturing a nuclear weapon cannot be excluded. These enrichment levels and activities have no credible civilian justification. Furthermore, Iran continues to increase its enriched uranium production capacity by installing thousands of advanced centrifuges, including at the underground Fordow site, where such activities are prohibited under the JCPoA… The nuclear escalation in which Iran is engaged is highly dangerous. It undermines the substance of the JCPoA and obstructs the resumption of a diplomatic pathway to address international concerns about Iran’s nuclear program. It threatens international peace and security and therefore requires the attention of the Security Council.' Before the Security Council session, the U.K., France, and Germany issued a joint statement in which they said, 'Iran’s stockpile of High Enriched Uranium has also reached unprecedented levels, again without any credible civilian justification. It gives Iran the capability to rapidly produce sufficient fissile material for multiple nuclear weapons.' Berlin, London, and Paris raised the possibility of using the snapback mechanism in the 2015 nuclear agreement on Iran’s nuclear program, which allows signatories to reimpose sanctions that had been lifted. As the Trump administration is set to take office in the United States next month, and with the collapse of the Assad regime in Syria and the unraveling of the regional strategic depth of Iran’s regime, the ruling mullahs face a crisis, signaling a significant shift in regional and international dynamics. Moreover, with the October 2025 expiration of Resolution 2231’s validity approaching, the activation of the snapback sanctions in response to years of violations by Tehran has become a serious option. The time for Europe’s unjustifiable appeasement and hesitation in using this mechanism is running out. Consequently, after years of exploiting Western leniency, the regime now faces the real threat of the snapback sanctions. This is why the regime authorities and analysts are warning in various ways that 'the situation is dire,' urging regime supreme leader Ali Khamenei to rethink the policies he has pursued thus far. Whenever Khamenei has perceived a serious risk of decisive action from the international community, he has resorted to deceit and manipulative maneuvers to buy time and continue covertly advancing towards nuclear weapons, which he considers essential for the survival and perpetuation of the regime. In recent weeks, an increasing number of regime officials and parliament members have stressed that the survival of the regime hinges on a 'shift in nuclear doctrine' and accelerating progress toward acquiring nuclear weapons. The international community is also at a critical crossroads: either it continues the shameful policy of appeasement, accepting the disastrous consequences of the octopus of fundamentalism and the central banker of terrorism acquiring the most dangerous weapon, or it heeds the warnings of Mrs. Maryam Rajavi, the president-elect of the National Council of Resistance of Iran (NCRI), who reiterated again on November 20 at the European Parliament, 'The long-overdue activation of the snapback mechanism and the six UN Security Council resolutions is the first urgent and necessary step. Nevertheless, the ultimate solution for getting rid of this evil dictatorship is regime change at the hands of the Iranian people and the Iranian Resistance.'	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWejIAnupCJlRL6kQ0Ik1MLS	2024-12-19T16:46:55-08:00	
Bitcoin Won’t Put Food On The Table – OpEd	Bitcoin also won’t put gas in your car or provide medical care for your family. To be clear, I mean this literally. I realize people have made millions and billions speculating in Bitcoin. They can use that money to buy food, gas, and medical care, but the point is that Bitcoin doesn’t actually produce these items or anything else that we directly consume. That may seem obvious, but this simple point is important to anyone interested in thinking about Bitcoin seriously. If our economy is facing supply constraints, as was the case at times in the recovery from the pandemic recession, Bitcoin will not help address the problem. It does not produce any of the goods and services that people need. If Bitcoin, or other crypto currencies, sell for high prices, it means that the people who hold these currencies can command more of a limited supply of goods and services. In other words, high priced crypto is a recipe for inflation, in the same way as would be the case if the government just dropped trillions of dollars from the sky for people to grab on the streets and in their backyards. This is especially the case if we go through with the idea of creating a 'strategic reserve' of crypto. This would effectively mean that the government is dropping tens of billions of dollars on the homes of people who own crypto. If the economy is producing near its limits, this would be a virtually certain way to increase inflation. The crypto cult has insisted that we somehow need crypto. While crypto has proved somewhat useful for paying for drugs and blackmail, no one has yet identified a legal use. People may feel better because they hold crypto. This can be said for lots of things. Many people feel better because they gamble, whether in Las Vegas or in financial markets, but none of these actions put food on the table. When people gamble, they are giving money to casinos. When they speculate in financial markets, they are giving money to the Wall Street boys. And, when they speculate in crypto, they are giving money to the crypto bros. Of course, some people can win in crypto or on Wall Street, just like some people can win in gambling, but the vast majority of people don’t. They are just handing money to the intermediaries. That will allow crypto bros and the Wall Street gang to put more food on their tables, but this is the result of taking it away from everyone else, not because they are adding to the economy’s output in any way. There can be an argument that financial markets, although not crypto, can increase output by better steering investments to their most productive uses. There is some truth to this, but we could probably steer investment just as effectively with a financial sector that is half its current size, as we did in decades past. The other half is just waste that makes Wall Street rich at the expense of the rest of us. (If we subjected financial transactions to the same sort of sales tax most of us pay when we buy food, clothes, and other items it would eliminate much of the waste in the financial sector. It would also raise a ton of revenue.) Anyhow, it is understandable that politicians getting campaign contributions from the crypto bros would be singing the praises of crypto, but everyone not on their payroll should realize their song is nonsense. Crypto produces nothing, it is just a scheme to get money from the rest of us and hand it to the crypto bros. The Foreign Trade Exception That Donald Trump Should Hate (If He Had a Clue) There is one story where the country as a whole could in principle benefit from crypto. That would be the case if we could sell it to other countries in exchange for their goods and services. This would mean, for example, that we would get coffee from Brazil or cars from Japan and pay them in crypto. In that story, the U.S. as a country would effectively be acting like crypto bros. We would be giving worthless digital bits in exchange for real goods and services. That would put food on our table, even if takes it off the tables of our trading partners. However, there is an interesting twist on this story. This is essentially what the United States is already doing with its $950 billion annual trade deficit. We are buying $950 billion of goods and services that we are not paying for with our own exports, instead we are paying with dollar bills. This trade deficit allows us to consume more than we produce. But this is exactly the story that has sent Donald Trump raging for years. In his speeches, Trump claims that other countries are ripping us off by selling more to us than they buy from us. Insofar as this is the case, they will be ripping us off even more if they sell stuff to us for crypto, instead of the goods and services we produce. That would make our trade deficit even larger. Hopefully we don’t end up as a country heavily involved in crypto, and we will never have to worry about this story. But if we do it will be yet one more of the ironies of Trump policy that his crypto dreams will make the trade deficit 'disaster' even worse. It’s all very MAGA!

Without Assad, Syria Will Fall Apart – OpEd	By John Kennedy As President Bashar al-Assad flees Syria, neocons and Zionists celebrate throughout the world, while those who will truly suffer—the people of Syria—will be left to clean up the mess of American and Israeli ambitions. Despite the accusations against Bashar al-Assad, those who have replaced him are much worse—the Hay’at Tahir al Sham. Formed in 2011, the CSIS claims this group is an al-Qaeda affiliate of Jabhat al-Nusra. In 2018, the State Department designated it as a foreign terrorist organization that retains a 'Salafi-jihadist' ideology, meaning they intend to wage war on modernity, which they claim has twisted the minds of Muslims. The swift victory of HTS seems sudden to many in the West. Past events had signaled that Assad had all but won the civil war: they had regained membership to the Arab League in 2023 and the last strongholds of the SDF were recaptured. Two important questions appear in the analysis of the Syria situation: Who supported the HTS in the swift victory against Assad? What will happen to Syria as a country now that its twenty-four-year government has been toppled? Past events both in Syria and elsewhere may help answer these questions. The Syrian Mess The larger goal in Syria is to hurt Iranian influence in the area by toppling Bashar al-Assad, as Gideon Rachman stated: 'Those who take the Iranian threat very seriously argue that the best way to deal a blow to Tehran is to topple its regional ally—the Assad regime in Damascus.' To do this, the United States government and its agencies have funded rebel groups in Syria in hopes one will eventually take out Assad. But the rebels in Syria all have different goals, ideologies, and funders. In 2013, it was believed that there were 1000 armed opposition groups in Syria. This did not stop people such as Hillary Clinton and the State Department from sending support to rebel groups, even if these groups were affiliated with al-Qaeda. Clinton stated: We know al Qaeda [leader Ayman al-] Zawahiri is supporting the opposition in Syria. Are we supporting al Qaeda in Syria? Hamas is now supporting the opposition. Are we supporting Hamas in Syria? Despite this knowledge, support for rebel groups had not gone anywhere. In an email from the current National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan to then-Secretary of State Clinton, it was stated that, 'Al-Qaeda is our friend in Syria.' Other rebel groups, such as the Free Syrian Army, led by General Idris, have been accused of working with al-Qaeda but were still graced with a visit from John McCain and asked for 'weapons and other military aid.' Other 'moderate' rebels who seek 'democracy' in Syria, like the Northern Storm Brigade, have taken to kidnapping civilians for ransom money, or the al-Qaeda-affiliated rebel group al-Nusra, which showed one of its military commanders, Abu Sakar, eating a human heart. But the biggest player in the game in the fight against Bashar al-Assad has been the Syrian Democratic Forces—a Kurdish group led by the Kurdish militia, YPG. With the support of President Obama, a convinced President Trump, and a withering President Biden, the Kurds have found dominance in North-Eastern Syria. Conveniently enough, much of the Syrian oil fields and refineries are found in this part of the country. This is how the State Department was able to convince President Trump to stay in Syria. A Trump administration official stated: I think DoD and State [Department] can now make the argument to [President Donald] Trump that we have to stay and make sure the oil flows or the U.S. company will lose all their investment. So it’s a gift for those who want us to stay in Syria. Because of this, Syrian production of oil has dropped by 90 percent—from 353,000 bpd in 2011 to 24,000 bpd in 2018. Syria now relies on the production of consumer goods, such as olive oil, cotton, nuts, and seeds. The Kurds—with their newfound governance—have had increasing hostilities with native Arab tribes: Some Arab tribes in the Deir Ezzor region, with whom they have partnered in the fight against the so-called Islamic State (IS) over the past several years, have rebelled against them in recent months over allegations of discrimination and an inadequate share of oil revenues. The United States has not been the only actor waiting to see Assad toppled. Israel too has made it its policy to overthrow Assad. The Times of Israel even made it clear in April of 2024 that 'the Israelis clearly warned Assad that if Syria was used against them, they would destroy his regime.' The ultimate goal for both the United States and Israel in both Syria and the whole Middle East is destabilization. This harkens back to the days of Henry Kissinger when dealing with Bashar al-Assad’s father—Hafez al-Assad—on the Palestinian situation. In a documentary called HyperNormalisation by Adam Curtis, Kissinger’s policy was laid out: Kissinger thought that strengthening the Arabs would destabilize his balance of power. So he set out to do the very opposite, to fracture the power of the Arab countries, by dividing them, and breaking their alliances so they would keep each other in check. Compared to What? Despite Bashar al-Assad’s crimes, he is the only realistic answer to Syria’s troubles. When analyzing Assad, people must ask themselves the common question for which economists are known: compared to what? Let’s not forget how Iraq looked after Saddam Hussein was toppled in 2003. An Iraqi by the name of Kadom al-Jabouri took his sledgehammer to help topple Saddam Hussein’s statue as US troops entered the city. A decade later, he says why he regrets it: 'Then we had only one dictator. Now we have hundreds.' Iraq today suffers from the typical instability produced by countries unaccustomed to parliamentarianism. In 2022, protestors stormed the Iraqi parliament in support of a cleric named al-Sadr. Today, many Iraqis feel as though they do not have sovereignty within their own nation, as their politicians are either American or Iranian puppets. Libya, too, after Gaddafi, experienced a resurgence of chattel slavery where a man was bought for $400 in an auction. Much like Russia during the 1990s, people in nations that are corrupt and destabilized will come to the conclusion that law, order, and stability are far more attractive than a failed democracy or vague ideas of liberty. Now, with the war in Ukraine coming to an end, as admitted by President Zelensky, Putin may come to the aid of President Assad, but until then the people of Syria will continue to live amongst the terror and infighting of the HTS.

Key Takeaways From China’s Recent National Development And Reform...	By Yang Xite On December 13, China’s National Development and Reform Work Conference was held in Beijing, where Zheng Zhajie, Director of the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC), delivered the work report. This meeting, held in the context of the Central Political Bureau and the Central Economic Work Conference, serves both as a concrete implementation of the discussions and as a plan for the key tasks and priorities of the NDRC for 2025. Given the NDRC’s responsibilities and control over national development resources, local governments and development departments will likely meticulously review and consider the key tasks outlined at this meeting. Researchers at ANBOUND believe that it is important to clarify that the National Development and Reform Conference is an 'executive meeting', not an 'innovative meeting'. The essence of the meeting is more about conveying and implementing the central government's economic development direction, and clarifying the specific tasks of the national development and reform system in this process. The NDRC has long played a key role in China’s economic governance, serving as a crucial agency for macroeconomic regulation. Its responsibilities extend beyond policy implementation and it acts as an essential tool for driving the country's overall economic development. However, within the new political system, the Central Committee's leadership is paramount. Even the State Council’s main tasks focus on executing the central government’s directives and realizing the blueprint set by the central leadership, not to mention the NDRC, which is a subsystem of it. Therefore, local governments will need to understand this fundamental positioning when carrying out their work. The key tasks outlined at this conference focus on seven major areas: macroeconomic policy, domestic demand, medium- and long-term planning, deepening reforms, building a modern industrial system, ensuring people's livelihoods, and regional development and carbon neutrality. Each task is a detailed breakdown of the objectives set by the Central Economic Work Conference, rather than the introduction of new policy directions. This focus on execution reflects the adjustments in the national governance system. The central government sets the development direction through top-level design, while the NDRC is responsible for translating and implementing these decisions at the operational level. From the content released, it is evident that the meeting did not introduce any major innovative policies. Instead, it focused on how to translate the established goals into concrete action plans. This shift reflects both the current need for policy stability and the external challenges to China's internal governance capacity. First, the conference emphasized the importance of policy research and economic analysis, planning and promoting a package of incremental policies, and implementing a more proactive and effective macroeconomic policy. It also stressed strengthening the consistency of macroeconomic policy orientation, as well as improving economic communication and expectation management. In recent years, due to dramatic changes both in China itself and in the international economic environments, the issue of insufficient policy coordination has frequently emerged, leading to some policy goals not being fully achieved. In this context, the NDRC has been entrusted with the responsibility of ensuring policy consistency, with its core task being to avoid policy conflicts. This is done by enhancing overall coordination and creating a unified policy approach. The meeting's focus on policy research and economic analysis also highlights a shift in the role of the NDRC, that it is no longer the source of policy innovation but instead analyzes economic issues and proposes targeted implementation plans. While this technical shift improves the precision of policy implementation and reduces the risk of policy mistakes, it also means that the NDRC’s initiative in shaping policy discourse has been weakened, making its function more akin to that of a 'policy conveyor'. Second, 'expanding domestic demand in all aspects' is another core task of this meting. This called for expanding effective investment, encouraging the introduction of private capital into major projects, and implementing special actions to boost consumption. Such measures are a concrete implementation of the 'stabilizing growth' goal outlined at the Central Economic Work Conference. The NDRC, through resource coordination and optimizing fund allocation, ensures that the demand expansion in key areas is completed on schedule. The meeting also proposed using tools such as central government budget investment, special government bonds, and local government special bonds to drive more tangible work output. Third, in terms of boosting consumption, the meeting outlined the direction of enhancing residents' consumption capacity by optimizing the policy environment and expanding consumption scenarios. This focus on the consumption sector is also a concrete breakdown of central policies, with stability as the core objective. It reflects the basic role of the NDRC, which is to ensure the smooth achievement of the central government's established goals through execution-oriented actions. Fourth, regarding the implementation of the five-year plan, the meeting presented key tasks for 2025, including achieving the goals of the 14th Five-Year Plan and starting the preparation of the 15th Five-Year Plan. It specifically highlighted the importance of new-type urbanization, which not only responds directly to central policies but also provides clear guidance to local governments. According to the meeting’s content, urbanization work in 2025 will focus on a 'people-centered' approach, promoting the urban integration of rural migrants and fostering coordinated development across large, medium, and small cities. Fifth, the conference emphasized the implementation of further comprehensive and in-depth reform measures. The key areas listed by the meeting include: (1) focusing on key sectors and critical areas for targeted reform; (2) prioritizing the construction of a unified national market and revising the market access negative list; (3) strengthening efforts to promote the development of the private economy and advancing the prompt introduction of the law on private sector promotion. The common feature of these initiatives is the clear and actionable implementation paths. The conference also mentioned the need to promote the construction of a modern industrial system, stabilize employment, increase residents' income, improve the social security system, and implement regional development strategies along with the goals of carbon peak and carbon neutrality. Whether it is the coordinated development between regions or the enhancement of energy and resource security, these tasks reflect the stability of policy execution rather than breakthroughs in direction. The NDRC's responsibility is to strengthen regional cooperation and optimize energy allocation to ensure that the ecological and regional development goals set by the central government are achieved. From the content released by official media, the characteristic of this meeting is not innovation. It does not stand out in terms of systematically promoting development work at the national level. Moreover, the conference was not a one that focused on strategic thinking and planning. Its main theme consists of specific 'key tasks' to be advanced and concrete areas of development. Given the relatively severe internal economic situation China is facing, along with the possibly even more challenging external development environment, especially considering the significant reduction in development resources compared to the past, we believe that even if the tasks already outlined are to be successfully implemented in 2025, it will not be an easy task. Expanding domestic demand, stabilizing growth, stabilizing employment, and stabilizing prices, while strengthening baseline thinking and risk prevention and resolution, will likely be the core tasks of economic work in 2025. Final analysis conclusion: Overall, the core characteristic of China’s recent National Development and Reform Work Conference is its 'executive' nature rather than 'innovative' focus. The main task of the meeting was to clarify the specific implementation paths for the goals set by the Central Economic Work Conference. This executive focus reflects an adjustment in the role of the NDRC and indicates that its influence in the future will be more evident in specific operational matters rather than in strategic innovation. Local governments, in addressing the economic tasks for 2025, will have to pay close attention to the NDRC's guiding role in policy implementation. By accurately understanding its functional positioning, they can find breakthroughs in the complex internal and external environment and provide strong support for achieving economic growth goals.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWejIAnupCJlRBD7IEgXczxi	2024-12-19T16:35:39-08:00	
Iran’s Axis Crumbles As Hezbollah And Assad Falter – OpEd	The dramatic sequence of events that began on October 7, 2023, with Hamas’s strike in Israel, has cascaded through the Middle East, toppling regimes and reshaping the region’s fault lines. On the very day Israel and Hezbollah agreed to a ceasefire halting hostilities in Lebanon, the Syrian militant group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) launched a bold offensive to capture Aleppo, marking the end of an era for Syria. Earlier this month, the reign of President Bashar al-Assad—a tenure synonymous with repression, conflict, and decay—crumbled under the weight of accumulated resistance. Syria, long shackled by a Ba’athist dictatorship and scarred by 14 years of brutal civil war, now glimpses a fragile freedom. Yet, the challenges ahead are formidable: sectarian tensions and entrenched divisions could derail the nation’s rebirth. Meanwhile, the upheaval in Syria has laid bare the vulnerability of Tehran’s once formidable 'axis of resistance.' For Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, the collapse of this network, painstakingly built to project Iranian influence, represents an existential political crisis. The fall of Assad’s regime signals not just a geopolitical shift but also a psychological blow to Iran’s ambitions. The Middle East, a region perpetually in flux, faces yet another transformation, fraught with uncertainty but also infused with the hope of a new beginning. Hezbollah’s gamble in opening a second front against Israel during the Gaza conflict may go down as one of its gravest miscalculations. The Shia Lebanese movement, heavily supported by Iran, was emboldened to assist Hamas, but misread both the regional dynamics and Israel’s military prowess. By striking along the UN-demarcated Blue Line, Hezbollah stirred a hornet’s nest, and the consequences proved catastrophic. After nearly a year of skirmishes that uprooted hundreds of thousands, Israel escalated its operations in September, delivering precision blows that decimated Hezbollah’s leadership. The group’s iconic leader, Hassan Nasrallah, was among those eliminated in a series of airstrikes that left Hezbollah’s command structure in tatters. On the ground, Israel’s forces drove Hezbollah militants away from the contested border zone, a tactical and symbolic victory for a nation accustomed to perpetual conflict. By November, Tehran’s calculus shifted. Acknowledging the unsustainable losses, Iran urged its Lebanese ally to seek peace rather than risk further erosion of its capabilities. Reluctantly, Hezbollah acquiesced, agreeing to a ceasefire that handed Israel the upper hand. This episode highlights the limitations of proxy warfare in a region where alliances are tenuous and military missteps can unravel years of carefully constructed influence. For Hezbollah, the toll of this misadventure extends beyond the battlefield, leaving its future—and Tehran’s credibility—irreparably shaken. Iran’s reliance on Hezbollah as a cornerstone of its influence in Syria has long been a strategic necessity. In 2015, the Lebanese group, alongside Russian forces, proved pivotal in rescuing Bashar al-Assad’s regime from the brink of collapse. But the Middle East is a region defined by shifting alliances and resource exhaustion, and neither Iran nor Russia could muster the will—or the means—to defend Damascus. Tehran, after all, was drained by its proxy war with Israel, and Moscow was deeply entangled in Ukraine. Their absence created a vacuum, which the HTS and the Syrian National Army were quick to exploit. Seizing on Assad’s weakened position, these groups launched an offensive on Aleppo, ostensibly to preempt a regime operation targeting their strongholds in northwest Syria. What unfolded revealed the fragility of Assad’s government. Rife with corruption and demoralization, Syria’s army offered scant resistance. Aleppo fell with startling ease, underscoring just how diminished Assad’s authority had become. Iran and Russia may have propped up Assad in the past, but their inability to save Assad signals a profound weakening of the axis that once anchored Syria’s survival. Iran faces a sobering recalibration of its regional ambitions. Stripped of direct influence on Israel’s borders, it must rely on proxies in Iraq and its longstanding ties with the Houthi militia in Yemen to project power. Yet, a renewed focus on its nuclear ambitions could be fraught with peril, especially with Donald Trump’s imminent return to office. Trump’s previous strategy of extreme pressure left Tehran with little room to maneuver, and Supreme Leader Khamenei may tread cautiously this time. Meanwhile, tensions have flared on the Syrian-Israeli frontier. For the first time since 1974, Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) entered the Syrian-controlled Golan Heights to repel an assault on a UN outpost near the Druze village of Khader. By Sunday, Israel had deployed additional troops to secure the buffer zone, aiming to contain Islamist rebel groups and prevent a flood of refugees. It is too early to envision a scenario where Abu Mohammed al-Jolani, the leader of HTS, brokers peace with Israel over the contested Golan Heights. Yet, as the Middle East repeatedly proves, the unimaginable has a way of becoming reality.

African Gold Helps Fund Russia’s War With Ukraine – Analysis	Since Russia invaded Ukraine, it has extracted at least $2.5 billion worth of gold from Africa through illicit operations facilitated by its paramilitary forces. That money, taken from artisanal and small-scale mines in Burkina Faso, the Central African Republic, Eritrea, Guinea, Libya, Mali and Sudan, 'has been funneled back into the Russian war machine,' according to a World Gold Council report published in November. 'The mysterious death of Yevgeny Prigozhin, head of the Russian mercenary Wagner Group, in a plane crash in August 2023, has not curtailed Russia’s looting and pillaging of natural resources around the world — from Libya to the Central African Republic (CAR),' the report said. 'Instead, the Kremlin has seized the moment to wrest back control over those lucrative business interests.' Experts say the gold is moved through intricate, illegal international schemes. 'We’re seeing a great deal of gold being sold, smuggled and refined and effectively laundered through the Middle East, in particular the UAE [United Arab Emirates], in the Dubai gold market,' political analyst Jessica Berlin told National Public Radio (NPR). 'Also, via China and Hong Kong, there are very, very extensive and complex front companies, shell companies being used to move the money.' Berlin, co-author of 2023’s 'The Blood Gold Report,' said the gold is transported on trucks and planes to those countries, where it is melted down and mixed with legally sourced gold. Berlin’s report focused on Russia’s gold mining work in the CAR, Mali and Sudan. 'These countries are where Russia’s blood gold trade has really taken off,' Berlin told NPR. 'They’re the primary targets for Russia’s operations in the gold industry.' In the CAR, Russian Africa Corps mercenaries have committed massacres at artisanal mining sites. At least 20 artisanal miners in Koki were killed in mid-June after failing to attend a meeting called by the mercenaries. After the meeting, the mercenaries attacked the mining sites surrounding Koki, according to the CAR’s Corbeau News Centrafrique (CNC). About a week later, Africa Corps fighters called a meeting of stakeholders in the town’s mining sector. According to CNC, the mercenaries declared that no one was allowed to buy gold on the site and that anyone who did would be executed. The mercenaries designated six people as middlemen to buy gold exclusively for them. Any violation of that rule, they said, also was punishable by death. The mercenaries then confiscated everything the miners and traders brought to the meeting, including mobile phones, gold reserves, valuable tools and cash. Russian mercenaries also are known to take over mining operations with help from government forces in countries led by military juntas with ties to the Kremlin. In February, for example, Africa Corps fighters arrived by helicopter near the rural Malian village of Intahaka in the Gao region and seized the country’s largest artisanal gold mine. With the help of the Malian military, the mercenaries secured the site by forcing out a Tuareg rebel group. In August, junta-led Burkina Faso granted Russian gold mining company Nordgold a four-year license to operate a new gold mine in the North Central region, where Nordgold already operated three gold mines. According to the Norbert Zongo Cell for Investigative Journalism in West Africa, Nordgold in 2018 raked in $16.5 million in gold mining royalties thanks to a low tax deal made with a former Burkinabe government 15 years earlier. The money could have funded vital public services. There is 'no single panacea to eliminate the risks' tied to Russia’s pursuit of African gold, the World Gold Council report said. It called for international, government and business actors to develop a strategic plan to expand law enforcement, reinforce sanctions and offer incentives for artisanal gold mining communities to formalize. 'International coordination needs to be improved, and a single primary forum should be agreed for bringing together the otherwise siloed efforts to boost implementation and enforcement,' the report said.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWejIAnupCJlRJp-cVEvAVVq	2024-12-19T16:30:02-08:00	
Zelenskyy Says European Security Guarantees Alone Won’t Be Enough	By Alexandra Brzozowski (EurActiv) -- Security guarantees from European countries alone will not be 'sufficient for Ukraine' and must be accompanied by US commitment, Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said after talks in Brussels on Thursday (19 December). 'I believe that only European guarantees won’t be sufficient for Ukraine,' Zelenskyy told reporters after talks with EU leaders in Brussels. 'It is impossible to discuss only with the Europeans because the only guarantee, currently or in the future, is NATO,' Zelenskyy added. 'It is very important for us to have both on board, the United States and the Europeans (...) - a common decision,' he also said. Zelenskyy's comments come as European partners are scrambling to assure Kyiv of continued military support, and the strategic debates come just ahead of US President-elect Donald Trump's return to the White House next month and fears that he could pull US support for Kyiv and force it to make concessions to Russia. Zelenskyy did not comment on whether he had received guarantees at Wednesday’s dinner on security guarantees for Ukraine hosted by NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte and several EU leaders. 'There are no decisions about it,' Zelenskyy said, adding that he was not able to share details 'until decisions are made.' 'Peace through strength remains the motto,' Dutch Prime Minister Dick Schoof, who attended Wednesday's talks, said when asked about how the meeting went. 'We explicitly did not talk about negotiations. We stated that Ukraine is the one who decides under what conditions talks can take place. That is not up to us,' Schoof added. When meeting with EU leaders Thursday, Zelenskyy made a fresh appeal to European partners to coordinate their efforts to bring lasting peace to Ukraine, building on recent coalition-building efforts by European leaders to secure continued support for Ukraine in the event of any future ceasefire talks. 'We need coordinated work for lasting peace, not just the suspension of hostilities that Putin seeks to buy time. We must push Moscow towards genuine, sustainable and guaranteed peace,' Zelenskyy told the European leaders in the room. German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, who also attended Wednesday's brainstorming dinner, told reporters that Europe 'needed to secure long-term support for Ukraine.' EU member states would need to take a look at what they can commit to in terms of air defence, artillery and ammunition 'so that Ukraine can defend its independence and sovereignty,' Scholz added.But when asked what more Europe could do to help, Zelenskyy criticised some European partners for not yet fulfilling their pledges, such as the training of brigades. Regarding the request to train and equip 13 Ukrainian brigades outside of Ukraine, Zelenskyy said only two had been trained and equipped - one in France and one in Germany. Zelenskyy also said his country needed at least 19 more anti-missile systems to protect its energy facilities this winter. A number of EU leaders on Thursday also started to publicly caution that forcing Ukraine into rushed negotiations with Moscow would risk a 'bad deal' for Kyiv. 'Any push for negotiations too soon will actually be a bad deal for Ukraine,' the EU's top diplomat, Kaja Kallas, told reporters in Brussels ahead of the summit talks. 'All the other actors in the world are carefully watching how we act in this case, and therefore, we really need to be strong,' she added.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWejIAnupCJlRF6YNRypq0wL	2024-12-19T16:20:19-08:00	
Putin Sends Signals To The West On Ukraine Ahead Of Trump’s New T...	By Steve Gutterman (RFE/RL) -- Vladimir Putin’s end-of-year Q&A session with reporters and the public is billed as a chance for Russian citizens to ask the president about the issues that matter to them most. But while much of the televised marathon focuses on domestic affairs, Putin always uses it to send signals to the West and the rest of the world, too. This year, Putin’s messaging was colored by expectations that U.S. President-elect Donald Trump will push or an end to Russia’s war against Ukraine, or at least for a cease-fire, when he takes office on January 20. He dangled the prospect of Russian concessions before audiences in Washington and the West, saying more than once that Russia was ready for compromise, and headlines abroad reflected those remarks as he spoke for nearly 4 1/2 hours. But he attached numerous conditions to the idea of compromise, suggesting that Moscow’s goal of subjugating Ukraine and winning major security guarantees from NATO and the West remain in place, as well as saying he does not consider Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy a legitimate partner for talks. 'Plenty To Talk About' With Trump Putin said that he has not spoken to Trump in over four years and is 'ready for this, of course, at any time. And I will be ready for a meeting if he wants it.... I’m sure we will have plenty to talk about.' Putin, as he often does, may have been aiming to portray Russia as a constructive country that is open to dialogue, while at the same time leaving Moscow a path to shut the door on any negotiations and blame others for their failure. He rejected an assertion from a reporter for the U.S. network NBC that that amid heavy Russian losses in Ukraine and after the downfall of ally Bashar al-Assad in Syria and other setbacks for Moscow, he would be in a weaker position than Trump in talks. With Russia is making gains on the ground as its full-scale invasion nears the three-year mark, he suggested that Moscow would have little reason to make compromises and that it would be approaching any peace process from a position of strength. On the battlefield, where Russian forces have had the upper hand since an unsuccessful Ukrainian counteroffensive in 2023, 'the situation is changing dramatically,' Putin said. 'There is movement along the entire front line. Every day.' Unanswered Question Coughing and clearing his throat repeatedly, Putin tried to exude an unhurried air of calm, asserting that Russia is ready to fight on indefinitely, and to keep churning out the weapons it needs to do so, while seeking to cast doubt on Ukraine’s ability to keep up its defenses for long. 'Soon, those Ukrainians who want to fight will run out, in my opinion -- soon there will be no one left who wants to fight. We are ready, but the other side needs to be ready for both negotiations and compromises,' Putin said.He compared Ukrainian recruiting methods to a dogcatcher rounding up strays and said Kyiv is sending unprepared draftees to the front with insufficient training -- something that Russia, which has suffered casualties in the hundreds of thousands as it presses for months to take Ukrainian cities it has virtually destroyed, is widely accused of doingitself. He also trolled both Ukraine and the West in comments when he rejected a suggestion that his claims that a hypersonic intermediate-range missile Russia used against Ukraine last month cannot be shot down were bogus, challenging the United States to a 'high-tech 21st century duel' between the Oreshnik missile and U.S. missile defenses. 'Let them determine some target for destruction, say in Kyiv,' he said.Despite his show of confidence that Russia will prevail in Ukraine, he left one question in many Russian minds unanswered: When will the war be over? While he said near the end of the marathon that he will not be happy until Russian soldiers return home -- something tens of thousands or more will never do -- he declined to put a timeline on the end of the war or on what he promised would be the ouster of Ukrainian forces from Russia’s Kursk region, where they have held territory since a surprise offensive in August.

Addressing AI’s Bias From A Humanistic Perspective – Analysis	By Patrizia A. Ecker Artificial intelligence has transformed how we live, work and interact, promising efficiency, precision, and even objectivity. Yet, beneath the shiny veneer of algorithms lies a pressing issue that remains insufficiently addressed — bias. Far from being impartial, AI often reflects the same prejudices and inequalities embedded in the societies that create it. Bias in AI is not just a technical glitch; it is a social and ethical challenge that demands our attention. AI systems are only as unbiased as the data they are trained on and the people who design them. Training data often mirrors historical inequalities, stereotypes, or underrepresented groups, leading to biased outcomes. For example, a widely cited 2018 MIT study found that facial recognition algorithms had an error rate of 34.7 percent for darker-skinned women compared to just 0.8 percent for lighter-skinned men. This disparity is not just an abstract technical issue — it manifests as a real-world disadvantage for those who are already marginalized. Bias in AI also stems from the lack of diversity in its creators. With technology sectors still largely homogenous, the perspectives shaping algorithms often miss critical nuances. As someone with experience in digital transformation projects, I have observed these biases firsthand. For instance, in one project involving AI-powered customer care agents, the system struggled to interpret diverse accents and cultural nuances, leading to a subpar experience for non-native speakers. The impact of AI bias extends beyond theoretical concerns, influencing decisions in critical areas such as hiring, healthcare, law enforcement, and digital marketing. In hiring, Amazon’s algorithm famously demonstrated bias against women because it was trained on male-dominated data. This perpetuated existing inequalities in a field that already struggles with gender diversity. Similarly, in healthcare during the COVID-19 pandemic, pulse oximeters were found to be less accurate on individuals with darker skin tones, highlighting how biased technology can exacerbate health disparities. In digital campaigns, in a discussion about targeted marketing, such as those used by fashion brands including Mango, concerns arose about AI reinforcing stereotypes. For example, the reinforcement of narrow definitions of beauty. These examples underscore the human consequences of biased AI systems. Some argue that AI bias is inevitable because it mirrors the flaws of human data. While refining datasets and improving algorithms are essential, this perspective oversimplifies the issue. Bias in AI is not just about better coding; it is about understanding the broader societal context in which technology operates. Others propose that AI can also serve as a tool to highlight and address biases. For example, AI can analyze hiring trends and suggest equitable practices or identify disparities in healthcare outcomes. This dual role of AI — as both a challenge and a solution — offers a nuanced perspective. Tackling bias in AI requires a comprehensive approach. An essential requirement is diverse development teams to ensure that AI systems are built by groups with varied perspectives and experiences. This is vital to uncovering blind spots in algorithm design. In addition, there should be transparency and accountability so algorithms are interpretable and subject to scrutiny, and allow users to understand and challenge decisions. There should also be ethical considerations integrated into every stage of AI development. This includes frameworks for bias detection, ethical audits, and public-private collaborations to establish guidelines. A further requirement is for education and media literacy, to equip individuals and organizations with the tools to recognize AI’s limitations and question its outputs. Critical thinking and media literacy are crucial for fostering a society that demands fairness from technology. AI is neither a villain nor a savior — it is a reflection of humanity. Bias in AI challenges us to confront uncomfortable truths about inequality and injustice in our societies. While the journey toward unbiased AI may be complex, it is one we cannot afford to ignore. As someone deeply involved in driving digital transformation and fostering human-centered skills, I have seen firsthand the potential of AI to either entrench inequality or unlock unprecedented opportunities. The choice lies in how we build, deploy, and use these systems. By addressing the roots of bias and fostering an inclusive approach to AI development, we can ensure that technology serves all of humanity — not just a privileged few. • Patrizia A.

Biden’s Immigration Legacy Is A Complex One – Analysis	By Aline Barros Immigration has been a defining challenge of the Biden presidency, marked by record numbers of asylum-seekers and other migrants arriving at the U.S.-Mexico border. President Joe Biden pledged to modernize the nation's immigration system and rebuild a refugee resettlement program that had hit historic lows under the previous administration. But despite issuing a record number of immigration-related executive actions — surpassing the Trump administration — Biden's efforts drew criticism from both sides of the political spectrum. Critics on the right said the administration was being too lenient, while those on the left said it was too harsh. The Biden administration inherited a fractured immigration system, including a backlog of asylum cases, a reduction in refugee processing capacity, and policies such as Title 42 that significantly shaped migration patterns. During a webinar, Muzaffar Chishti, a senior fellow at Migration Policy Institute (MPI), provided an overview of the Biden administration's record. He noted that Biden's approach to enforcement away from the border has been seen as largely favorable by experts and immigration advocates. He said Biden administration officials focused on enforcement guidelines, rather than trying to deport everyone, yet the crisis at the border cast a long shadow over his legacy. He emphasized the success of legal immigration under Biden, pointing to the high numbers of visas issued, the record number of naturalizations and the resurgence of refugee admissions. About '3.5 million people were naturalized under the Biden administration, the highest of any one-term presidency,' he said. However, Chishti said the administration's handling of border security was less successful. The administration faced overwhelming numbers of migrants, many arriving from countries beyond Mexico and Central America. 'The Biden presidency entered office with a crisis at the border, which was precipitated by the COVID crisis and Title 42,' he said. The administration's failure to call the situation a crisis, he added, contributed to a perception of mishandling, despite efforts to manage it through new programs like the CBP One app and various parole initiatives. Handling the border Marielena Hincapie, a visiting scholar at Cornell Law School who participated in the webinar, praised efforts under the Department of Homeland Security's leadership to increase naturalization rates, expedite work permit processing, and implement innovative policies such as deferred action for undocumented workers who had experienced labor disputes. These measures, she said, benefited not only immigrants but also the broader U.S. workforce and economy. Hincapie also criticized the administration's handling of border issues, calling itmismanagement. She highlighted the role of Texas Governor Greg Abbott and Florida Governor Ron DeSantis in exacerbating the crisis by busing and flying thousands of migrants to New York, Chicago and elsewhere. Hincapie also pointed to additional involvement at the state level, saying, 'There's not only the busing and flying of migrants, which DeSantis did, but also litigation.' 'And I really see this as the Biden's inner circle, his political and communications folks, failed to understand that this was a narrative war and the fact that they refused to call it a crisis when that is what voters were seeing. … They fell silent and decided not to prioritize immigration, and by doing so, they ceded the narrative,' she said. Migration shifts The Biden administration also faced shifts in migration patterns. Colleen Putzel-Kavanaugh, associate policy analyst at MPI, said the reality at the U.S.-Mexico border shifted once again during Biden's term with migrants arriving in large numbers from across the Western Hemisphere and from countries around the world. The demographics of migrants also changed, she said, from single adults to families, and many were seeking asylum, further complicating border processing. U.S. law offers asylum to people facing persecution in their home countries on the basis of race, religion, nationality, political opinion or membership in a particular group. Though there are two kinds of asylum, affirmative and defensive, not all asylum claims come from migrants arriving at the border. Immigrants may claim affirmative asylum within one year of their latest arrival in the United States or request a defensive asylum while fighting an order of deportation. 'All this resulted in a high number of migrants released into the interior of the U.S.,' Putzel-Kavanaugh said. This brought the border crisis into the interior of the nation, with large numbers of newly arrived migrants heavily concentrated in cities like New York, Chicago and Denver — cities already facing housing shortages. Putzel-Kavanaugh also praised the Biden administration's work to pair increased enforcement with options for safe and orderly legal migration. 'We saw the introduction of programs like CBP One app, which allowed migrants to make appointments at ports of entry along the border, and the parole program for nationals from Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua and Venezuela,' she said. Despite these efforts, Putzel-Kavanaugh said many saw the measures as 'too little, too late.' But that shift in migrant arrivals from irregular crossings to legally arriving at ports of entry has been one of the few success stories of Biden's border management strategies. Monthly migrant encounters dropped significantly from the highs of December 2022, with a decrease from more than 300,000 encounters to about 106,000 in October 2024, according to CBP figures. Issue for years to come While Biden's efforts to modernize immigration systems and address asylum claims were significant, experts said the ongoing challenges of irregular migration and border security will remain a focal point in U.S. immigration policy for years to come. 'I do think in summary, we do have two real important crises in our country,' Chishti said. 'We do have a labor market crisis across occupations from low, mid to high levels [and a border crisis]. This is why a lot of these people who have come in, even though they came irregularly, have been absorbed.' Chishti pointed to remarks in 2022 from Jerome Powell, chair of the Federal Reserve, about the U.S. labor market and its dynamics. Powell said immigration is a key source of labor supply, and the significant decline in immigration levels during the COVID-19 pandemic exacerbated the labor supply-demand mismatch. That shortfall in immigration resulted in fewer workers available to fill jobs, particularly in sectors that traditionally rely on immigrant labor, such as health care, hospitality and agriculture. Powell acknowledged that addressing the labor supply constraints, including through immigration policy, could help ease pressure to raise wages and reduce inflation without significant harm to employment levels. 'The reason nothing is happening on changes or reform to our legal immigration system — so we can get more people legally for our labor market needs — is because of the crisis of the border,' Chishti said. 'These are twin crises, but they're getting interlinked,' he said. 'Unless we get the border crisis under control, we won't be able to address our labor market crisis.'	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWejIAnupCJlRE-bWcJSA7qf	2024-12-19T16:10:18-08:00	
Junta Forces Are Mobilizing In Central Myanmar Amid Shan State Ce...	Myanmar’s junta has been mobilized forces for offensives in the Mandalay, Sagaing and Magway regions at the same that it has significantly reduced attacks in northern Shan state following a recent ceasefire there, members of the rebel People’s Defense Forces told Radio Free Asia. Between Dec. 2 and Dec. 6, junta airstrikes and artillery killed 19 people and wounded at least 10 others in three townships in Mandalay region’s Myingyan district, according to an official from a pro-democracy paramilitary People’s Defense Force, or PDF, who requested anonymity for security reasons. Among the dead were four rebel paramilitary fighters, the PDF official said. The attacks are likely inspired by the junta’s larger aim of regaining control of Myanmar’s central plain heartland, according to the PDF official. The central plains -– home to the country’s majority ethnic Bamar peoples –- has seen fierce fighting since the military’s Feb. 1, 2021, coup. PDF units are made up of ordinary civilians who took up arms against the junta following the coup, and in many areas they have pushed junta troops back from territory the controlled. The offensives also coincide with the recent ceasefire agreed to by the Myanmar National Democratic Alliance Army, or MNDAA, and the Ta’ang National Liberation Army, or TNLA, after pressure from neighboring China. 'China’s interference has played a significant role in Myanmar’s overall military situation,' a PDF member in Magway region’s Pakokku township said. 'While the TNLA and MNDAA in northern Myanmar are facing pressure from China, the junta has reduced its airstrikes, and battles have decreased in these areas,' he said. 'This has led the junta to focus more on the plains.' The attacks have notably increased in Mandalay, Sagaing, and Magway regions since just after junta chief Min Aung Hlaing returned from his early November trip to China, according to local rebel fighters. Resistance forces have abandoned some road sections between Myingyan and Taungthar townships in Mandalay due to the junta’s intensive ground and air attacks, according to the PDF official in Mandalay region’s Myingyan district. The junta has also moved forces into Sagaing region’s Pinlebu township, and have also sent troops along the Ann-Padan route, which is the only connection between Ann town in Rakhine state and Padan in Magway region, the official said. 'They are likely preparing to control the central plain areas of Myanmar through a defensive war strategy,' the PDF official said. Political analyst Than Soe Naing said the last few weeks have again highlighted how anti-junta forces need to improve on their military strategy and coordination in central Myanmar. 'Without a united front in the plain areas, their offensives have slowed, and they still require more weapons and ammunition,' he said. RFA attempted to contact junta spokesperson Maj. Gen. Zaw Min Tun to ask about the military offensive in the central plains region, but received no response.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWejIAnupCJlRKc_Eiiu8w62	2024-12-19T16:07:53-08:00	
‘New Syria’ Offers Historic Moment Of Hope But Also Threats And U...	By Ephrem Kossaify While recent developments in Syria offer a long-awaited opportunity for Syrians to realize their aspirations for freedom 'there is a real risk that progress could unravel' if the situation is not managed carefully, UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres warned on Thursday. Long-time dictator Bashar Assad fled the country on Dec. 8 following a swift offensive by a group of rebels. Their operation, which lasted less than two weeks, met little resistance. Guterres noted that the end of more than five decades of 'brutal, dictatorial rule' by the Assad family offers a long-sought opportunity for all Syrians to fulfill the aspirations that sparked their peaceful movement for change in 2011. The slogan that echoed across the country, 'The Syrian people are one,' has never been more relevant, he added. 'It holds great promise for a country so rich in diversity, history and culture, along with its deep-rooted traditions of generosity, which I witnessed first-hand as high commissioner for refugees when the Syrian people welcomed millions of displaced Iraqis,' Guterres said. However, he stressed that 'nothing is guaranteed' and warned: 'If the ongoing situation is not managed carefully by Syrians themselves, with the support of the international community, there is a real risk that progress could unravel.' Guterres emphasized that 'all communities must be fully integrated into the new Syria,' and 'the rights of women and girls must be fully respected.' He also reiterated the importance of ensuring the process is guided by the principles outlined in UN Security Council Resolution 2254. Adopted in 2015, the resolution calls for a ceasefire agreement and political settlement in Syria, and sets out a road map for the country’s transition, including 'free and fair' elections. Although some parts of Syria are relatively stable following the fall of Assad, Guterres warned that the conflict is far from over and civilians continue to be killed, injured and displaced. Daesh remains a threat in some areas, while Israel continues to target the country with extensive airstrikes. 'These are violations of Syria’s sovereignty and territorial integrity,' Guterres said. 'They must stop.' In the Golan Heights, he said, the UN’s Disengagement Observer Force has reported an ongoing Israeli military presence in several locations within the Area of Separation, despite long-standing agreements prohibiting such deployments. The peacekeeping mission has also observed Israeli personnel and equipment in at least one place inside the Area of Limitation. The 1974 Disengagement of Forces Agreement between Israel and Syria stipulates that this area must remain free of military forces. Guterres called on Israel and Syria to fully comply with the terms of the agreement, which 'remains in full force.' He added: 'Let me be clear: There should be no military forces in the Area of Separation other than UN peacekeepers, period. Syria’s sovereignty, territorial unity and integrity must be fully restored, and all acts of aggression must come to an immediate end.' Neighboring country Turkiye has 'a very important role' to play in convincing parties in Syria of the need for inclusive dialogue, Guterres said. However, he also stressed the need to establish a permanent ceasefire in northeastern Syria, and to stem the activities of Daesh in the area. Meanwhile, the humanitarian crisis in the country remains one of the worst in the world, with the recent escalation further exacerbating the needs of people nationwide. Guterres stressed the urgent need to ensure humanitarian and recovery efforts receive adequate funding. The UN’s humanitarian chief has already warned that the appeal for aid to Syria, one of the largest in the world, remains severely underfunded. Describing the current moment in Syria as one of 'hope and history' but also 'great uncertainty,' Guterres said: 'Some will try to exploit the situation for their own narrow interests. But it is the obligation of the international community to stand with the people of Syria, who have suffered so much. 'Syria’s future must be shaped by its people, for its people, with the support of all of us.'	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWejIAnupCJlRPLJPAPE1F9h	2024-12-19T16:02:06-08:00	
Asia-Pacific At A Crossroads: Addressing Conflict In Key Geopolit...	The South China Sea, Korean Peninsula, and Taiwan Strait are some of the most geopolitically volatile regions in the world. These hotspots are characterised by overlapping territorial claims, rising militarisation, and the destabilising influence of global powers in the Asia-Pacific. Each area is crucial for trade security and global stability but faces escalating tensions in 2024. These flashpoints pose not only a threat to regional peace but also risk drawing the United States and China into confrontation. This essay examines recent developments, underlying challenges, and potential pathways for conflict resolution while emphasizing the urgent need for multilateral cooperation to prevent crises. The South China Sea is a contested maritime area where geopolitical tensions have escalated. As a vital artery for global trade—with 30% of maritime commerce passing through its waters—the region is essential for economic stability. However, China's extensive 'nine-dash line' claim, which was rejected by the 2016 ruling of the Permanent Court of Arbitration, continues to exacerbate disputes. In 2024, satellite imagery revealed ongoing Chinese militarization of artificial islands, such as Fiery Cross Reef, where missile systems and airstrips have been expanded. The Philippines, Vietnam, and Malaysia have condemned these actions, particularly incidents where Chinese coast guards blocked Filipino resupply missions to Ayungin Shoal. In response, the United States has increased its Freedom of Navigation Operations (FONOPs), further reinforcing its presence in the region. To de-escalate these tensions, it is essential to adhere to international law under the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS). Multilateral agreements, such as an enforceable Code of Conduct (COC), could help mediate disputes and establish mechanisms for resource sharing while promoting confidence-building measures among stakeholders. The Korean Peninsula is one of the most militarized regions in the world, facing renewed threats of nuclear conflict in 2024. North Korea has intensified its weapons development, conducting its most powerful intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) test in February, which demonstrated its capability to reach the U.S. mainland. Pyongyang has justified its actions by citing joint U.S.-South Korea military exercises as evidence of a potential invasion. In response, South Korea has increased its defence spending to a record 3.2% of GDP, deploying advanced missile systems like THAAD and strengthening its alliance with Washington. This has contributed to a regional arms race, with Japan enhancing its defence capabilities and Russia indirectly supporting North Korea. Diplomatic efforts remain stalled as China and Russia veto further sanctions at the United Nations Security Council, complicating international responses. To reduce tensions, it is critical to revitalize multilateral diplomacy, such as the Six-Party Talks. Tying humanitarian aid to denuclearization milestones and promoting cultural exchanges could help foster inter-Korean trust, paving the way for broader peace negotiations. The Taiwan Strait, a vital waterway connecting the South China Sea and the East China Sea, has emerged as a key flashpoint in U.S.-China strategic rivalry. Taiwan, a vibrant democracy, is under increasing pressure from Beijing, which views the island as a breakaway province. In 2024, Chinese military incursions into Taiwan’s Air Defense Identification Zone (ADIZ) reached record levels, with over 1,500 sorties recorded by November—a 20% increase from 2023. In response, the United States has expanded arms sales to Taiwan, including advanced fighter jets and missile systems under the Taiwan Relations Act, further solidifying its commitment to Taiwan’s defence. Public sentiment in Taiwan is increasingly leaning toward formal independence, a move Beijing considers a red line. Furthermore, Taiwan’s critical role in global semiconductor production—accounting for over 60% of advanced chips—heightens its strategic significance. A conflict in the Taiwan Strait could not only disrupt global supply chains but also trigger widespread economic turmoil. To prevent escalation, delicate diplomacy is essential, including agreements to limit military activities in the strait, support for Taiwan’s autonomy without provoking Beijing, and establishing crisis communication hotlines to avoid miscalculations. The broader implications of tensions in these regions extend beyond immediate territorial disputes. Economic disruptions in the South China Sea, the Korean Peninsula, or the Taiwan Strait would destabilize global trade and supply chains that are already strained by inflation and ongoing geopolitical rivalries. The semiconductor industry, particularly dependent on Taiwan, is especially vulnerable, with potential consequences for global technology and manufacturing sectors. Militarily, the risk of accidental escalation or miscalculation could draw major powers, including the United States and China, into direct conflict. As both nations expand their military presence and alliances in the Indo-Pacific, the likelihood of proxy conflicts increases, further complicating peace efforts. Despite these challenges, there are pathways for de-escalation and cooperation. Strengthening institutions such as ASEAN, the United Nations, and regional security dialogues can provide platforms for negotiations. Confidence-building measures, including joint disaster response exercises and environmental protection initiatives, offer opportunities for non-confrontational collaboration. Economic integration through trade agreements and shared infrastructure projects could create mutual incentives for peace. However, achieving these outcomes requires sustained political will, trust, and adherence to international norms. The role of neutral mediators, such as ASEAN, will be crucial in fostering dialogue among disputing parties. In conclusion, the South China Sea, the Korean Peninsula, and the Taiwan Strait exemplify the delicate balance between conflict and cooperation in the Asia-Pacific. As tensions escalate in 2024, these regions threaten both regional and global stability. Yet, through multilateral diplomacy, confidence-building measures, and adherence to international law, these hotspots can evolve into arenas for dialogue and collaboration. The stakes are high, and the need for action is urgent. As tensions rise, nations must take decisive steps to secure peace, stability, and prosperity for the region and beyond.

Trump’s HHS Nominee Robert F. Kennedy Jr. Reassures Pro-Life Sena...	By Tyler Arnold Robert F. Kennedy Jr. is reassuring Republican senators that he will back certain pro-life policies if the Senate confirms him to lead the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). In November, U.S. President-elect Donald Trump nominated Kennedy to serve as the United States secretary of the HHS, a position that requires Senate confirmation. HHS oversees 10 agencies, including the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Kennedy is a former Democrat. He ran for president as an independent in 2024 before dropping out and endorsing Trump. Although Kennedy has supported legal abortion for his entire public career, he told pro-life senators in closed-door meetings that he would oppose taxpayer funds for abortion domestically and abroad and restore conscience protections. 'Today I got to sit down with [Kennedy] — we had a substantive discussion about American health care … [and] a good discussion, at length, about pro-life policies at HHS,' Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Missouri, said in a series of posts on X. According to Hawley, Kennedy told him that, if confirmed, he would reinstate the Mexico City Policy, which ends federal funding for overseas organizations that promote abortion. Trump reinstated the Mexico City Policy during his first term and said in an October interview with EWTN News that he would consider doing so again in a second term. Hawley said Kennedy’s plans include 'ending taxpayer funding for abortions domestically' and 'reinstating the bar on Title X funds going to organizations that promote abortion.' He said that Kennedy also 'pledged to reinstate conscience protections for health care providers.' Sen. Tommy Tuberville, R-Alabama, told reporters that he and Kennedy also talked about abortion, saying: 'The big thing about abortion is that he’s telling everybody … whatever President Trump [supports], I’m going to back him 100%.' 'Basically, [Kennedy] and President Trump have sat down and talked about it and both of them came to an agreement,' Tuberville said. 'Roe v. Wade is gone, [abortion has] gone back to the states. Let the people vote on it.' Sen. Markwayne Mullin, R-Oklahoma, told reporters that Kennedy told him he 'serves the will of the [incoming] president of the United States and he’ll be pushing his policies forward.' '[Kennedy’s] first thing is [that] we have too many abortions,' Mullin said. '... His follow up to that is [that he is] serving at the will of the president of the United States. … I think that should clear up that question for anyone.' Sen. Tim Scott, R-South Carolina, said in a post on X that he also spoke with Kennedy about abortion. 'I had a productive discussion with Robert F. Kennedy Jr. this evening about the future of our nation’s health care system, preventing taxpayer-funded abortion, and Americans’ long-term well-being,' Scott said. During his independent presidential campaign, Kennedy first endorsed abortion in all stages of pregnancy, including late-term abortion. He later retracted that position and said he would back restrictions at the point of fetal viability. Kennedy also said during his campaign that he would support a 'massive subsidized day care initiative' to reduce abortion without limiting legal access. No word on chemical abortions Tuberville, however, said that he did not speak with Kennedy about chemical abortions, which are regulated by the FDA. Trump himself has said he will not restrict access to the abortion pill mifepristone. Chemical abortions account for about half of all abortions in the country. The FDA first approved mifepristone to be used in chemical abortions in 2000. Under current law, the drug is approved to abort an unborn child up to 10 weeks’ gestation, at which point the child has a fetal heartbeat, early brain activity, and partially developed eyes, lips, and nostrils. Mifepristone kills the child by blocking the hormone progesterone, which cuts off the supply of oxygen and nutrients. A second pill, misoprostol, is taken between 24 to 48 hours after mifepristone to induce contractions meant to expel the child’s body from the mother, essentially inducing labor. Pro-life advocates have been urging the incoming administration to restrict abortion drugs. Many activists have argued that the executive branch could prohibit the delivery of abortion drugs in the mail by enforcing the Comstock Act — a plan that has not been embraced by Trump.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWejIAnupCJlRI-ooPczJ2CM	2024-12-19T15:54:35-08:00	
Bitcoiners’ Guide To Austrian Economics – Analysis	By Per Bylund Austrian economics is a scholarly tradition that consists of a body of theory that explains how an economy works. Austrian economists develop theory a priori, meaning explanations are derived logically from sound starting points (i.e., the 'action axiom' to Mises). This means the theory is true and can therefore be used to uncover the actual causalities behind observable phenomena. Economics is, therefore, to 'Austrians' a framework for understanding what we see. Other traditions in economics rely on data to formulate theory, which means their theory is a set of corroborated hypotheses. They thus make a much weaker claim because the data analyzed are always a selection (a sample, not an entire population), the measures and metrics are not the actual concepts but mere proxies, and the theory is about correlations not causal relationships. Such theories are neither true nor universal. Because it is a priori, Austrians can rely on their economic theory as a framework to interpret and understand what is going on in the economy. This is why Austrians can say without any doubt that, for example, credit expansion—an increase of the money in circulation—will cause market prices to increase if nothing else changes. However, Austrian economic theory cannot tell how quickly this happens or what exact prices will be affected to what extent. Only that this must be so. This also means that Austrian theory is much narrower in scope than mainstream economics. Whereas the latter presumes to develop 'theory' to explain anything that is related to the data at hand, such theory can and will be debunked (falsified) whenever data are collected that point in another direction. Austrians cannot and do not go beyond what can be derived logically, which means economic theory remains true, but also cannot be used to explain specific phenomena in detail or predict precise outcome magnitudes (such as 'measured price inflation next year will be 4.6 percent'). Austrians do predict, but only using established causal relationships. Austrian theory disallows predictions that are quantitative or state exact times. The Meaning of Money As Austrian economics is theory and deductive, definitions must be clear, concise, and used consistently. It also means some phenomena that we rely on in everyday interactions that are quantitative in nature do not have unambiguous definitions. 'Money' is such a concept, which is defined as that medium of exchange that is commonly accepted (i.e., universally used). Bitcoin is certainly a medium of exchange, but many things are. Bitcoin has also become much more widely used as a medium of exchange, but it is not yet money. That 'many' stores accept Bitcoin as a means of payment is not quite enough and neither is that many of your friends accept it for paying what you owe. A money is what you can use to exchange for things without having to search for those who accept it. A money also doesn’t need to be converted to some other medium of exchange (such as dollars or euros) to buy things. It is also not any 'properties' of the thing that is a medium of exchange that makes it money. Mainstream economics confusingly teaches that money typically has certain properties such as divisibility, fungibility, and a store of value. Those are indeed common (and perhaps important) functions of the money good, but are not what makes it money. What makes something money is that it is used as a medium of exchange and that it is rather universally accepted as such. It is money’s moneyness that makes it money. Carl Menger explained what money is and where it comes from in his essay 'On the Origins of Money' from 1892. He notes that barter trade (direct exchange) is difficult and costly, which means there are great gains available from using indirect trade to exchange for what you want. If I have apples to spare and would love some oranges, whereas you have oranges but don’t want apples in exchange, then we cannot trade directly. However, if you would accept bananas and someone else has bananas and will accept apples in exchange, then I can trade my apples for bananas and then bananas for oranges—even if I have no personal use for bananas. In other words, bananas here serve as a medium of exchange. Menger notes that goods have different saleability (marketability) in the economy, which means some goods are more widely accepted in exchange (demanded) than others. It may be that pears can be used instead of bananas and that pears also are useful if I wish to trade for bread and eggs. But the sellers of bread and eggs may not accept my apples or bananas (or even oranges). This means I would be better off trading my surplus apples for pears to then exchange them for what I want. Both bananas and pears in this case are media of exchange, but pears have the greater saleability. He goes on: because pears have greater saleability, more people will trade their goods for pears and, therefore, its demand as a medium of exchange greatly increases. This, in turn, makes it even more useful as a medium of exchange. At some point, most or all people in an economy will trade goods for pears. This is when pears become money. The example may be clear, but it is ambiguous when exactly a medium of exchange becomes money. Thus far (in November 2024), Bitcoin is not generally money. But it may be money in some specific circumstances or groups. The Regression Theorem Monetary theory is not complete simply because the meaning and usefulness of money have been established, however. We must also explain the value of money. Simply put, money is worth what it can purchase, which means money has many prices (as many prices as there are goods it can be used to purchase) that change over time. The question is, where does this value as a medium of exchange come from—what determines it? Ludwig von Mises wrestled with this question and answered that people’s demand for money (meaning they are willing and able to give up goods for cash) is based on their expectations of its purchasing power. We choose to hold money because we expect to use it in exchange. We base our expectations on what it will buy in the future ('tomorrow') based on what it buys in the present ('today'). The same thing happened in the past ('yesterday'): we formed expectations about money’s purchasing power today based on what it could buy yesterday, and so on. Mises showed that this does not constitute an infinite regress but that there must logically have been a starting point—a time before the money-good was money. In the example above, I place value in bananas not because I want bananas, but because I expect to be able to use them in exchange. I speculate on the use and value of bananas as a medium of exchange and I base my hunch on what I’ve heard about (or from) the person with oranges. Because pears turn out to be even more saleable, I value them higher than bananas as a medium of exchange and, therefore, sell my apples for pears instead. When 'everybody' uses pears for exchange, they are money. And they are valued because of their expected purchasing power. By logically going back in time, we can see that pears-as-money have much greater market value than pears-as-consumption good (before it was money) because it is money—its demand is much greater because people use it as a go-to medium of exchange. How much greater? This can be answered by noting the difference between the demand (and thus market price) for pears when it is money and the demand for pears as a consumption good (when it is not money). The same is true for bananas although they never became money. Because I expected to be able to use bananas to exchange for oranges, I valued (and demanded) bananas and sold apples to acquire them (even though I did not want to consume bananas). Because bananas were a medium of exchange, market demand (and therefore price) increased. Back to Bitcoin How does this apply to Bitcoin? Theory is used to uncover and understand what is actually going on. Bitcoin is certainly a medium of exchange, but it is not yet money. Some (perhaps many) expect it to become money, and therefore acquire it. This increases its demand. Many others invest in Bitcoin as an asset, speculating that it will go up or at a minimum not lose value. This also increases its demand. But there is a difference between being in high demand and being a money: the latter implies the former, but the former does not imply the latter. High demand only means higher price, not that it is therefore generally accepted and used as a medium of exchange. Many things are in high demand, but are not therefore media of exchange, but instead used as, for example, consumption goods or assets. The former because they directly satisfy our wants and the latter because they are expected to serve as stores of value (stable or increasing). Our demand for money (cash) is neither for consumption nor as a speculative asset—it is (primarily) to be used in exchange. In other words, we demand (and acquire) money to get rid of it. It’s a means to get what we really want—it is a medium of exchange. We can apply this reasoning to 'holders' of Bitcoin, who sell their fiat currency (cash) or take out loans in it in order to acquire Bitcoin, which they then hold as an asset. Perhaps the intent is to use it in exchange when it becomes money or just to ride the tide (or bubble, depending on who you ask) to earn a speculative profit. In both cases, they do not use Bitcoin as a medium of exchange—they use the cash (dollars, euros, whatever) as a medium for acquiring Bitcoin. The decision to buy-and-hold could (and does) increase demand for Bitcoin, but the same was true for toilet paper under the pandemic. That didn’t mean toilet paper became a medium of exchange. Even if demand for toilet paper had exceeded supply to such an extent that people engaged in black-market trade for it, toilet paper still would not have been a medium of exchange—only a highly sought-after good. Certainly, high demand can lead to people using a good as a medium of exchange. But it is quite roundabout to buy-and-hold a good in order to increase its demand (and therefore market price) as a means for making it money. There are better and more effective ways. Including the obvious one: to use it in and for exchange, that is, to use it as money.

Preference Falsification And Cascade – OpEd	Tech entrepreneur Marc Andreessen posted the following: 'We are living through the most dramatic preference cascade of my life. Every day I am hearing the most amazing things.' What an unusual phrase, I thought, so I looked it up. It comes from a book written 30 years ago: Private Truths, Public Lies: The Social Consequences of Preference Falsification, by Duke University economist Timur Kuran. I downloaded and read it. It’s brilliant. It seems to explain everything. Maybe it explains too much. Regardless, Kuran has given us a language to describe a remarkable feature of our times. How is it that only a few months ago, people were afraid to wear MAGA hats and then Trump, having survived multiple assassination attempts, won not only the Electoral College but also the popular vote, sweeping the House and Senate in with him? How can it be that during this transition time, people widely assume that the president and vice president is already not Biden/Harris but Trump/Vance? How can it be that foreign leaders are making pilgrimages to Mar-a-Lago while Royals praise him as a great leader? It all changed in an instant. Or seemed to. Maybe the preference for regime change was already in the air but just not revealed. It took a fair election with secret ballots to show the truth. Kuran speaks of preference falsification, which is 'the act of misrepresenting one’s genuine wants under perceived social pressures.' It is different from self-censorship because people outright lie about what they really think. When the lie persists long enough, people begin to believe the lie and essentially live fake lives, proclaiming fealty to one idea while holding another one in their heart of hearts. He starts the book with the most mundane example of wall paint. You are invited to a friend’s house the walls of which have been repainted in fashionable starkness of which the owner is very proud. Your opinion is solicited. Instead of saying what you think, you simply go along and proclaim it to be just great. You have falsified your preferences. 'Preference falsification aims specifically at manipulating the perceptions others hold about one’s motivations or dispositions,' he writes, 'as when you complimented your host to make him think that you shared his taste.' It’s a tiny case but the problem is ubiquitous. It’s all about social pressure, peer expectations, the desire not to stick out, the drive to conform. It’s the problem of the Emperor’s New Clothes. Everyone says they are beautiful even though he is naked. The story sounds rarified but in fact it is a driving feature of current society and probably all of human history. The intriguing feature of Kuran’s book is that he is writing as an economist but rejecting the usual economist toolkit, relying instead on psychology and sociology. In this way, the book is old-fashioned such as one would read in the 18th or 19th centuries, a treatise by a learned man that draws on many disciplines, sort of like Adam Smith’s Theory of Moral Sentiments. Such books rarely garner professional praise because that is not how we 'do science' today, but they can end up sticking in popular culture. The preference falsification of the economics profession says that such books are not really economics. The author of this one rejected his own tendency to write as his profession expects and instead wrote a book of huge meaning. He closely examines the case of India’s caste system, the rise and fall of communism, and the case of affirmative action in the US. In each case, the establishment was on one side and everyone knew how to fit in and falsify preferences. In either event, public opinion was solidly on the side of the regime. But in each case, something changes and the mood changes. The hidden truth becomes exposed. The esoteric becomes exoteric. People start speaking their minds and acting according to their actual views. In each case, the regime lost control and the prevailing orthodoxy collapsed. This is what Kuran calls the moment of the preference cascade. It can happen all at once. Seemingly out of nowhere, people reject the caste system, communism, and DEI hiring, behaving as if each system was always awful and had to go immediately. A good example is the collapse of the Berlin Wall. One day it was heavily enforced, essential to national security and national identity, guarded with killer weaponry, and approved of by everyone on one side. The next day, it was like no one really cared anymore and the cars raced through and the thing was torn down while the soldiers watched and then joined in. That is a great example of falsified preferences turning suddenly to a preference cascade. We can think of this thesis as Thomas Kuhn’s Structure of Scientific Revolutions as applied in the world of social change. The cascade comes when anomalies make the orthodoxy unsustainable in polite society. There is a new scramble in pre-paradigmatic times to find a new way forward, a new operations manual for the thing in question. In the Kuhnian view, science progresses only with the funerals of the old guard but in the Kuranian view, it happens all at once because people simply decide to stop lying. The lying in this model is necessarily public and shaped by social pressure. When you go to the store, you buy only what you want or decline to buy at all. But when you are at a group banquet or at someone’s house for dinner, you are more inclined to go with the crowd. This of course is reinforced by many social psychology experiments from the 1960s which repeatedly proved the power of the crowd and peer pressure. We don’t usually think of this as applying to whole societies, much less all political systems in the world at once. But that seems to be happening. There was a headline last night that the German government had collapsed but I had to do a double take. The story could have been written about Canada, France, Spain, Brazil, Israel, and innumerable others that are quaking with pressures from within. The themes are the same: people vs. the establishment. As one must, let’s speak of the preference falsifications around Covid. A mucky cloth mask at six feet is going to stop you from getting a medically insignificant respiratory virus? Did anyone really believe this? A sterilizing shot invented in no time that had never existed for this kind of infection? Really? And there were even more absurd examples: no singing, playing instruments only in sealed tents, dousing yourself with sanitizer, banning skateboarding and surfing, quarantining on either side of the state line for two weeks, and so on. It was all outrageous and people were willing to put up with the Kabuki dance for a time. But at some uncertain point, and maybe in various iterative rounds, the people grew incredulous. Nearly five years later, we know that they were lying, as we’ve argued in great detail in a thousand articles for four years. Brownstone played a crucial role in making this happen. And then we ask that telling question: what else have they been lying about and for how long? That’s the salient issue of our time. The desire to pretend to believe seems to have been shattered. Falsification has turned to a truth cascade, one that might just barely have started and certainly has an uncertain end. This is why Kuran’s book is newly in play. I highly recommend it, and further recommend other books in this genre, including Mattias Desmet’s Psychology of Totalitarianism. These books help us understand ourselves and our times, turning seemingly random and mysterious phenomena into recognizable patterns, allowing us to see world events with more clarity than before. May the preference cascade continue until all that is worth knowing is known.

Preparing For China’s Future Economic Challenges – Analysis	By Wei Hongxu China’s recent Central Economic Work Conference, when discussing the current economic situation, expressed the view that, on one hand, this year's social and economic development goals can be successfully achieved; on the other hand, it also issued a warning about the severity of the current economic situation. The conference pointed out that the adverse impacts of changes in the external environment have deepened, and the country's economic operations still face many difficulties and challenges. These include insufficient domestic demand, production and operational difficulties faced by some enterprises, pressure on employment and income growth for the public, and numerous risks. Considering the current economic performance and the conference's assessment of the situation of 2025, researchers at ANBOUND believe that even with further strengthening of macroeconomic policies, the economic outlook for next year remains far from optimistic. When compared to last year's Economic Work Conference's description of the situation, this year's meeting mentioned that the impact of external changes has deepened further, creating additional pressure on external demand and casting a shadow over economic growth, which has led to a greater emphasis on 'domestic circulation' where the focus is on the issue of insufficient demand. However, the negative consequences caused by the imbalance between the supply and demand sides have further intensified. From last year's 'local imbalances in supply-side capacity' to this year's 'production and operational difficulties faced by some enterprises', and from last year's 'unstable expectations' to this year's 'pressure on employment and income growth for the public', these developments reflect the further evolution of the three major issues of 'demand, supply, and expectations' that were discussed last year. These issues are now affecting business operations and residents' employment, and the 'unstable expectations' around income have turned into the reality of 'income growth pressure'. In the view of researchers at ANBOUND, the decline in corporate and household income, i.e., profits and wages, is the root cause of insufficient demand. It shows that the economic situation is deteriorating further, making the problem of insufficient demand even more prominent. Moreover, although supply-side issues are no longer as prominent, they have not disappeared. The conference mentioned that the 'incremental policies by the Central Politburo meeting on September 26 effectively boosted public confidence and led to a clear economic rebound'. This means that the current economic stability and the achievement of this year's economic and social development goals are also the result of strengthened policies, rather than the result of enhanced internal economic momentum. Such economic stability and sustainability face significant challenges. It appears that the Central Economic Work Conference has identified expanding domestic demand as the focus of macroeconomic policy support for the economy next year. However, as researchers at ANBOUND previously warned, although the intensity of macroeconomic policies may reach an 'unprecedented' level, the economic situation is not exactly optimistic. In the face of increased downward pressure on the economy, the strengthening of policy drive aims to support the economic downturn caused by insufficient internal economic momentum, rather than stimulate a rebound in economic growth. In the absence of internal economic momentum, economic growth can only come from the strengthening of policy-driven efforts. In fact, looking at the economic goals set for 2025 in the meeting, last year's goal of 'promoting sustained economic recovery' has now been shifted to 'maintaining stable economic growth'. Even with 'unprecedented' macroeconomic policy strength, the economic growth target has been set only as 'stable', emphasizing the stability of employment and prices. This suggests the lack of internal economic momentum will become more severe next year. It is worth noting that this year's conference specifically mentioned, in terms of policy scale, the deepening of the understanding of the regularity of economic work. This is a reminder that the current downward trend in the economy is part of the cyclical development of the economy, and counter-cyclical policies may not be sufficient to reverse the trend in economic operations. Although policy has identified 'consumption' as the primary focus for next year, from the demand side, next year's 'three pillars' of growth will be reduced to just one, i.e., consumption. The 'three pillars' here refer to the three main drivers of economic growth, namely consumption, investment, and exports. This year’s meeting set the target for external demand as 'maintaining a basic balance in international payments'. This means that, due to increasing external pressures, foreign trade and foreign investment will no longer be expected to contribute to economic growth through a 'surplus'. Instead, the focus has shifted to achieving 'balance'. This implies that economic growth will have to rely solely on domestic demand, and as long as external demand does not drag the economy down, the target will have been met. In terms of domestic demand, next year’s focus in investment will be on improving efficiency, which naturally limits the extent of investment expansion. This creates a clear distinction between next year’s macroeconomic policy and the 'easing policies' of 2008, which were primarily centered around expanding infrastructure investment. After years of active fiscal policies, the returns and efficiency of government investment have significantly decreased. Further stimulating investment in the future is likely to result in more debt and additional ineffective assets, which will not contribute much to economic growth. If under conditions where external demand not dragging down economic growth and limited contributions from investment, the only remaining space to support economic growth lies in consumer demand. This time, more resources will be directed towards stimulating consumption, primarily through increasing consumption subsidies, raising the income of the mid- and low-income groups, and improving social security with the objective of enhancing consumption capacity. The effects of these policies are unlikely to be as direct as those of expanding government investment, but they will improve the way the government participates in economic activities and push the economic demand structure further toward consumption. Therefore, stimulating consumption is more likely to lead to a change in the demand structure, and its contribution to overall demand growth is likely to be limited. Although the Central Economic Work Conference has made stimulating consumption and expanding domestic demand a key priority for next year, the expansion of domestic circulation will require time. Relying solely on stimulating consumption as the leading driver will lead to short-term boosts, but in the mid-and long-term, it will still be a gradual improvement process. Despite the significant external pressures, ANBOUND’s founder Kung Chan pointed out that policies should maintain a balance between both domestic and external circulations. Over-relying on domestic circulation is not advisable; the balance among the 'three pillars' should be preserved. In the context of unstable incomes and difficult business operations, domestic circulation cannot bear the full weight of economic growth in the short term. If external circulation is abandoned too easily, it could quickly lead China's economy into an imbalanced state. In the economic principle, when structural changes occur in the long-term factors affecting economic growth, the phase of rapid domestic economic growth has already passed. Future economic growth will face more structural challenges, requiring improvements in efficiency and the development of new productive forces to achieve high-quality growth. Therefore, fully expanding domestic demand is not solely focused on the demand side in policy, but still requires efforts on both the supply and demand sides, with the emphasis on stimulating demand. Although this year’s conference did not specifically mention supply-side structural reform, the repeated references to 'coordination' implicitly suggest that, under the policy of expanding domestic demand, supply-side reforms must continue to be advanced to achieve a balance between total supply and total demand. At the same time, the new policy has shifted in its approach, particularly in renewing old growth drivers and revitalizing existing resources, replacing capacity reduction with capacity optimization. It also continues to focus on risk prevention policies, highlighting the need for the real estate sector to halt the decline, give attention to its stabilization, and establish a new model for real estate development. These measures reflect the balance between supply-side adjustments and demand-side expansion. In this regard, the policy to expand domestic demand outlined in the Central Economic Work Conference still differs to some extent from the strengthening of counter-cyclical adjustments mentioned in the previous Politburo meeting. The issues on both the supply and demand sides also suggest that the current complexity of the economy cannot be solved merely by artificially expanding domestic demand. This further indicates that, even with unprecedented counter-cyclical efforts on the demand side, the overall economic recovery may not rebound quickly. Instead, it is more likely to slow the pace of decline and help the economy stabilize more swiftly. Achieving the goal of stable economic growth next year will require increased policy efforts, but in the long-term, this may become increasingly difficult. Final analysis conclusion: For China, while further easing of macroeconomic policies is positive news for stabilizing the economy, the weaker the internal economic momentum, the more these policy efforts serve to prevent a sharp downturn rather than stimulate growth. The complexity of economic laws and the current economic situation suggests that the long-term downward trend in the country will be difficult to reverse quickly. Therefore, decision-makers and policy implementers of the market will need to have a more rational understanding and realistic expectations of the economic challenges ahead, while maintaining a proper balance between 'stability' and 'progress', as well as between domestic and external circulations.

Telegram, Crypto And Corruption: The Ukrainian Men Fleeing The Mi...	Angry at a corrupt, coercive system of military conscription, or simply unwilling to fight, many Ukrainian men are paying their way past a ban on leaving their homeland, slipping into Moldova, Romania, Poland and Hungary. By Gabriel Bejan, Oxana Bodnar, Claudia Ciobanu, Zsófia Fülöp, Sofie Kochmar and Valentina Nicolae-Gesellmann Andriy paid the smugglers in cryptocurrency and received instructions via Telegram. But in the end it was a plain old ladder that got him over the border between his native Ukraine and the breakaway Moldovan region of Transnistria. 'I don’t know where we crossed the border because our phones were turned off,' the 22-year-old said from Germany, speaking on condition his real name not be used. Two men were waiting on the other side and passed him a ladder, marking the climax of his flight from Ukraine. A student of Kyiv’s College of Communications when Russia launched its full-scale invasion in February 2022, Andriy had always hoped to continue his studies abroad. He supported Ukraine’s resistance by working as a volunteer with refugees in the western city of Lviv and was part of the youth movement of President Volodymyr Zelensky’s party, but had grown increasingly worried at the prospect of being called up to fight. At the end of last year, Ukraine’s parliament began debating whether to cut the age of conscription from 27 to 25, a proposal that eventually became law the following April. All males between the ages of 18 and 60 were already prohibited from leaving the country and from January, all 18 to 25-year-olds will be obliged to undergo military training. By February, Andriy felt like a noose was tightening around him, a feeling reinforced by claims on social media about forced conscription and violence by local recruitment centres known as TCKs. 'I began to understand I must run from Ukraine,' he said, speaking in English. For this investigation, by BIRN in partnership with HotNews, eight Ukrainian men of or near recruitment age were interviewed over a period of several months. All of them fled their homeland with the help of smugglers to escape mobilisation. Andriy was one of them. They spoke of hours of online research, of Telegram channels and mystery middlemen, of smugglers paid in cryptocurrency. In Andriy’s case, it cost him $4,500 – $1,000 up front and the rest the moment he entered Transnistria, a mainly pro-Russian region of Moldova that broke away from the Chisinau government’s control in the early 1990s and where Russia has a military presence. When it’s all over, those who flee face being denounced back home as traitors, pawns of Russia’s war propaganda machine. Indeed, a Ukrainian information security expert and former official in the Ministry of Information Policy said Russia was behind at least some of the Telegram channels and Facebook pages offering instructions on how to leave Ukraine to avoid being sent to fight. 'When you find such an advertisement on Facebook, behind it may be a real smuggler who really wants to make money, but it may also be someone from the Russian intelligence services, from Transnistria or even from Russia,' he told BIRN on condition of anonymity. Russia’s goal, he said, is 'to tell Ukrainian men, through Telegram channels and any other social media, that the process of mobilisation amounts to death'. Interrogation by agents Ukraine says that some 43,000 of its soldiers have been killed since February 2022. The West says Russia has lost far more, with Britain estimating that an average of 1,523 Russian soldiers are being killed or wounded every day. Those determined not to be called up often turn to smugglers. Andriy, who is from Kyiv, made his first attempt in late February, two years into a war that shows no sign of abating. He and four other people were caught, however, by Ukrainian border police in the region of Odesa. They were kept overnight. 'The next morning, they gave me back my phone, handed me a summons to the military enlistment office in Kyiv and told me that there would be a court case,' he said. Andriy was fined 8,500 Ukrainian hryvnia, roughly 200 euros. But he didn’t stick around for enlistment. He called the smugglers, referred to locally as ‘organisers’. They told him to return to Odesa, a Black Sea port city in the southwestern corner of Ukraine near the border with Moldova. The next day, Andriy received a location pin on Telegram and called a taxi to take him there. When he arrived, the driver told him to walk straight ahead. He reached the border with Transnistria, where the ladder was waiting. It didn’t take long before he and his group were intercepted again, this time by Transnistrian border guards. Instructed to hand over his personal belongings and the password to his mobile phone, Andriy was placed in a cell he said was roughly 10 square metres in size. With as many as 20 other men already inside, it was standing room only. Andriy said they discussed the situation and compared the prices they had paid the smugglers. Andriy spent the night in another police station, where he had more room, and the next day he was interrogated by agents he believes were members of the Russian intelligence service, the FSB. 'Nobody said directly that it was the FSB; they were called ‘investigators’, but they didn’t belong to the border guard,' Andriy said. He also noted the ‘clean’ Russian they spoke, which suggested they were from Russia itself, and the fact they wore civilian clothes, unlike all the other officials who were in uniform. 'They asked me who I am, where I come from, where I studied, where I lived, where my parents live, my education, my opinion about the situation in Ukraine, why I wanted to flee Ukraine.' 'They placed particular emphasis on questions about the Ukrainian armed forces, on whether I know anything about air defence systems, military technology or whether I know anyone in the military.' Interrogation over, Andriy was released and picked up by the smugglers. They drove him to the central bus station in Transnistria’s main city, Tiraspol, and gave him money to buy a ticket to the Moldovan capital, Chisinau. 'The Transnistrian border officer checked my documents and gave them back,' he said. 'The Moldovan officer didn’t check them.' In Chisinau, Andriy was taken to a private, downtown apartment rented by the smugglers for those who had paid extra, 'so that we could rest a bit'. Crypto or cash Andriy had done his homework, mostly on Telegram. 'I searched for providers of these services, their prices, chances of success and reviews,' he said. 'I asked the same people with different accounts about the entire process of crossing the border, looking for inconsistencies and lies.' He only came across one route: Odesa-Transnistria-Chisinau. And he said he thinks there is only one organisation behind the smuggling. 'I think it’s a mafia,' he said. Andriy’s account fits with the findings of an official investigation by prosecutors in Moldova. 'Ukrainian citizens are contacting the organisers of illegal migration networks on specific Telegram channels,' the Office against Organised Crime and Special Cases in Chisinau told BIRN. 'Afterwards, they are paying in cryptocurrency, because it’s harder for investigators to track the money, or by cash. After paying they receive instructions, also on Telegram, about the itinerary for the crossing of the border and where they will meet the person who will take them to the border with the Republic of Moldova.' The prosecution said it is investigating 120 separate cases of illegal border crossings by Ukrainian citizens between February 2022 and August 2024, and that 45 alleged smugglers had been taken to court in that period, both Ukrainian and Moldovan citizens, for smuggling some 60 Ukrainians into Moldova. 'Most of them are men capable of fighting, in the context of the ban they have on leaving Ukraine,' the Office against Organised Crime and Special Cases said. Classified as victims of organised illegal migration, most apply for asylum and do not face prosecution, it added. Moldova’s Border Police Inspectorate said it has 41 criminal cases open involving border police officers accused of complicity in illegal migration between 2022 and 2024. Besides via Transnistria, the Inspectorate said Ukrainians also entered Moldova by swimming across the Dniester River; others, it said, try to enter hidden inside cars, buses or lorries, or using false IDs. The fact that military-age males are fleeing the country is not just bad for Ukraine’s military effort. It’s bad PR too. The authorities have sought to pin the blame on Russia, accusing Moscow of playing mind games with young Ukrainian men. The former official of the Ministry of Information Policy said Russian-orchestrated Telegram channels were exaggerating the Ukrainian casualty figures and pretending to help people avoid the mobilisation patrols that comb Ukrainian cities for military-age males. 'The channels basically teach people how to avoid these patrols,' he said. 'But it is not necessary for the Russians to know exactly where these patrols are. They even communicate fake locations. Ukrainian men can see sponsored pages on Facebook that claim to teach them how to exit the country legally. These pages also include links to specific Telegram channels'. It’s on these channels, he said, that unidentified individuals supply information on the itinerary, the price, how to pay and where to go. He said Ukrainian authorities had reported the Facebook pages to the social media site’s owner, Meta, for removal – but without success. Telegram, which was founded in Russia, never responds, the former official added. ‘The whole bus was illegal’ In Chisinau, Andriy bought a bus ticket to the city of Iasi, just over the border in eastern Romania. At the border, he said, the driver asked the passengers, 'Who’s illegal?' 'The whole bus was illegal,' Andriy said. 'So we were dropped off, our passports were taken away, we went to the building of the Moldovan Border Guard Service, and there we were called by name, in groups, for interrogation.' He said the atmosphere was tense, that the Moldovan border guard was angry and demanded he write in Russian. The guards asked how he had entered Moldova and checked his phone for the contacts of the smugglers. But Andriy’s ‘organisers’ had told him to delete their contacts and any trace of communication, and to lie about how he crossed the border. 'I told the Moldovan officers that I crossed the border in a random taxi, at a random time, between a Ukrainian village and a Moldovan one,' he said. He also told them he paid a villager $100 to drive him to Chisinau. 'It’s funny,' said Andriy. 'A bus full of Ukrainians telling the same lie about crossing the border without intermediaries, about the taxi, the $100 and so on.' 'They know we have ‘organisers’,' he added, 'but if they can’t find the contacts or messages they can’t do anything about it. They can just stamp your passport and send you on your way.' Andriy crossed the border on a bus bound for the port city of Hamburg, northern Germany. The bus went straight through Romania, but for some young Ukrainian men, Romania – not Moldova – is their first target. The choice can be fatal. Between February 2022 and October 2024, according to Romanian border police, 25 Ukrainians died trying to cross the border between Ukraine and Romania. Fifteen of them drowned in the Tisza river; the rest died in falls or of hypothermia in the mountains of Maramures. Mountain rescuers in Maramures said those who try to cross the mountains are rarely equipped for the unforgiving conditions. Since Russia’s full-scale invasion, 18,300 Ukrainian citizens have crossed illegally over Romania’s northern border; that includes 10,000 in 2024, as of October 16. On surrendering to Romanian border police, they receive temporary protection and are free to go anywhere in the European Union. Through the fields Andriy’s bus reached the Hungarian border at night, when he was woken by the driver instructing the passengers to prepare their passports. He crossed without question, entering eastern Hungary via Hajdu-Bihar. Further north, in Nyirbator, social worker Eva Adoba said she had seen many Ukrainian men arrive through the surrounding fields, muddy and wet, sometimes without shoes. Nyirbator is about 80 kilometres from the border between Ukraine and Hungary. None of them want to stay, said Adoba, who works for an NGO helping migrants and refugees. 'I’ve never met a single Ukrainian man who wanted to stay in Hungary. They are on their way to Germany, Spain, Portugal, even Canada,' she said. 'When I tell them I am from Transcarpathia [western Ukraine] and I speak Ukrainian with them, they trust me more,' said Adoba. 'Sometimes they tell me that they came from Kharkiv, Mykolaiv or Odesa, and their journey lasted a couple of weeks or even months. Sometimes they must hide for weeks in Transcarpathian villages to attempt to cross the border. But sometimes they don’t want to say a word about their route. They are highly traumatised.' 'They are told to wear waterproof clothing and shoes two sizes smaller than their feet, so they don’t get stuck in the mud. Yet, I met men who lost all their belongings in waist-deep water, except for their phones and the money they were carrying around their necks.' Ukrainians welcomed According to EU data, as of the end of September 2024, EU member states had granted temporary protection to more than 4.1 million Ukrainians, just over 37,000 of them in Hungary. The status, currently valid until March 2025 but almost certain to be extended, entitles Ukrainians to a residence permit and access to education, healthcare and employment. Of the more than 37,000 in Hungary, 5,241 were men between the ages of 18 and 65, according to data from the Hungarian Central Statistical Office. The language barrier and general anti-immigration sentiment means Hungary is not the most attractive destination for Ukrainians, but the welcome they receive contrasts strongly with the abuse and rejection that frequently awaits migrants and refugees from Asia, Africa and the Middle East who cross Hungary’s southern border with Serbia. 'When men fleeing from Ukraine to Hungary meet the police or border guards, they are picked up, taken to an immigration office where they are given papers, dry clothes, food and water if necessary, and then they are free to go,' said Adoba. Hungary even said this year it would consider Ukrainian passports that have expired during the war valid within Hungary when it comes to sorting out a person’s status and helping them find work. Hungary also offers very good road and rail links with western Europe. An EU legal expert, who declined to be named, told BIRN: 'Hungary, Poland and Romania abide by the rules and don’t distinguish between people fleeing Ukraine, even if they are men of military age.' Neither the EU expert nor Adoba said they had ever heard of Ukrainians being ‘pushed back’ over the border. Ukraine vows to ‘humanise’ conscription Andriy’s bus ride to Germany took him through the Czech Republic, where he recalled paying $150 for the petrol with his Ukrainian bank card because he had been unable to withdraw money from an ATM to pay for the ticket. In Germany, he applied for a temporary residence permit and signed up for language classes. He plans to enroll in university. He is far from alone. According to the Central Register of Foreigners, as of October 12 there were just over 1.2 million Ukrainian refugees in Germany. Around a million of them have residence permits, the right to work and apply for welfare benefits. Roughly 37 per cent of them are men, 260,000 of them of military age. Andriy remains active on Telegram and TikTok, keeping in touch with his peers, discussing alleged abuses by Ukrainian authorities, and strategies for escape. Thirty-one-year-old Sergey Khorolsky, a TikTok blogger, is one of the most vocal critics of Ukraine’s conscription strategy and the exit ban on men aged 18-60. Having escaped through the Dniester river to Moldova, Khorolsky began organising protests in Berlin this autumn. Like-minded activists have sought to do the same in Dublin. Of the latest demonstration on November 17, Khorolsky said: 'This time, we wanted to draw attention to the fate of men who died after being detained by the recruitment commissions in Ukraine.' 'We held up their photos, so they are not forgotten.' At roughly the same time, media affiliated with the Ukrainian defence ministry branded the protesters as Russian stooges, and urged Ukrainians not to take part. But Khorolsky and other protesters in Berlin denied having anything to do with Russian intelligence agencies or of serving Russian interests. They all said they had given money to the Ukrainian war effort but criticised what they claimed was violence used by army recruiters. Khorolsky said he had evidence that seven men had died while being forcibly conscripted by the Ukrainian military recruitment centres, the TCKs. Media reports in Ukraine say three of the seven cases are under investigation. Responding to widespread criticism of the TCKs’ tactics, Ukrainian Defence Minister Rustem Umerov said in November that the government was working to 'humanise the mobilisation process'. Umerov told reporters he hoped the digitalisation of the recruitment system would minimise incidents in which men are picked up in the street and, in general, 'help move away from these painful issues for the population'. The defence ministry did not respond to a request for comment on this story. Fake passes and ‘friendly’ guards Konstantin [not his real name] follows Khorolsky on social media and shares his grievances. 'It took me three minutes to exit Ukraine into Poland, no questions asked,' said the 22-year-old. He left in June this year. 'I didn’t even have to wait in line with the other people. When I was a few kilometres from the border, I received a call from the border guards, who explained which way I had to go. I drove into Poland in the lane used by diplomats.' The deluxe treatment did not come cheap. Konstantin said he paid $12,000, a figure well out of reach for most Ukrainian men trying to leave. As a professional sportsman, Konstantin said he had been making good money for years. He also knew whom to pay: the head of a local NGO, who arranged a one-month pass for him to leave the country as a volunteer for the organisation ostensibly to work ‘in the interests’ of the Ukrainian army. A part of the fee was passed to ‘friendly’ border guards, who waved Konstantin through. The one-month pass expired, but Konstantin never returned. The newspapers might be full of stories about Ukrainians perishing in the Carpathian Mountains or swimming across the Tisza, but many more slip unnoticed into Poland having bribed their way to false papers. 'It’s the Ukrainian men that have enough money to pay a bribe that usually come to Poland,' said Jakub Ber, who spoke in September when he was working at the Centre for Eastern Studies, OSW, a Warsaw-based, state-funded think-tank, and is now an independent expert. Geography plays a part, Ber said. For the most part, the border region between Poland and Ukraine is flat, making it easy for border guards to spot anyone trying to cross illegally. That makes smuggling difficult. Any military-age man trying to cross must do so ‘legally’ – with a document obtained in Ukraine granting him a temporary pass to leave. A number of other Ukrainians offered similar accounts. In Germany, a Ukrainian woman said she and her boyfriend had used their entire savings to pay $7,000 for a fake disability document that exempted him from the exit ban, allowing him to cross into Poland in late 2023. The woman, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said they were told precisely when to cross, in order to encounter ‘friendly’ border guards. All the communication went through Telegram and they never met the intermediary in person. 'My boyfriend rode to the border in an informal ‘taxi’, the system we use here: it’s basically women making an income out of driving people to the border; they have nothing to do with illegal crossings,' said the woman, a 30-year-old IT worker. 'But we had to give the licence plate number to our intermediary, so that he could pass it to the border guards.' Like others who eventually fled, the woman said they had originally volunteered for the Ukrainian war effort, but became disillusioned by the sight of young men being sent into battle unprepared, having to buy their own gear. The man increasingly confined himself to their apartment, frightened at the prospect of being made to fight. Konstantin too said that, in the beginning, he had travelled to Western Europe to buy prosthetic limbs for children wounded by Russian missiles and even a Starlink satellite for the army. He did so by paying the same NGO $3,000 for a pass to get out. 'It’s crazy,' he said. 'You have to pay in order to volunteer.' But he admitted, 'Many of us also used those volunteering trips to get a break from the stress of living in a war-torn country'. In autumn 2023, Konstantin received a health assessment from a state medical commission, believing he could avoid conscription on the grounds that he had heart problems and high blood pressure. 'Despite my medical issues, which are real and well-documented by doctors, the guy in the commission told me he will declare me fit to fight unless I pay him $20,000,' he said. Konstantin refused. 'In Ukraine, if you are rich, you can buy yourself a lifetime exemption from the army,' he said. 'Completely healthy politicians turn out to be ‘unfit’ to serve, while thousands of normal men with health issues end up on the battlefield.' Poland’s economic incentive to turn a blind eye According to data from the Polish Interior Ministry, as of September this year over 167,000 Ukrainian men aged 18 to 60 had received protection in Poland since February 2022. Earlier this year, Ukraine suspended consular services for men abroad, as a way of forcing them to sign up to the military database. Poland, a staunch ally of Ukraine in the war against Russian invaders, declared its readiness to help Ukraine get men living abroad to return and join the fight. 'I think many Poles are outraged when they see Ukrainian men in hotels and cafes, and they hear how much effort we have to make to help Ukraine,' said Polish Defence Minister Wladyslaw Kosinian-Kamysz, in remarks that would have sent a chill down the spines of many Ukrainian men in Poland. For years before the war, hundreds of thousands of Ukrainian men had moved to Poland in search of work. Despite the defence minister’s comments, Miroslaw Skorka, head of the Ukrainians’ Union in Poland, said Warsaw could ill afford to send them back. 'Those may be the statements of politicians, but employers’ associations in Poland are begging for workers,' said Skorka. 'The Polish labour market had no problem absorbing the hundreds of thousands of Ukrainians who came since the full-scale war started, and it needs more.' The benefit to the Polish economy is clear. In 2023, Bartosz Marczuk, the head of the Polish Development Fund, calculated that Ukrainian refugees would pay more into the state budget than Poland spent on aid for them by the end of that year. That’s a big reason not to make a fuss about military-age men avoiding the draft. 'Our authorities never say anything about it,' said independent Polish expert Ber. 'This topic doesn’t exist in Polish public discourse.'	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWet_9MfW6XVCWNJ3VIbb4xz	2024-12-18T17:09:56-08:00	
Why Liberals Will Give Two Cheers For Trump – OpEd	Liberals hate Trump, no question about it. He’s the definition of illiberal: authoritarian, racist, sexist, and downright nasty. Not only that, he’s a living repudiation of the liberal delusion that America runs on meritocracy. But you want to know a dirty, little secret? In back alleys, encrypted group chats, and off-the-record conversations, liberals will still support Trump on a case-by-case basis. Of course, they’d never vote for the guy, but they’ll give two cheers for some of his policies. I discovered this ugly truth during Trump’s last term while writing an article on the shift in U.S. policy toward China from lukewarm engagement to hostile decoupling. The general consensus among the foreign policy elite was that, at least in terms of relations with Beijing, Trump was a useful idiot for slowing China’s roll with harsh rhetoric and tariffs. 'Trump is a madman, but I want to give him and his administration their due,' one prominent liberal intellectual told me. 'We can’t keep playing on an unlevel playing field and take promises that are never delivered on. It’s really China’s turn to respond, and it’s long overdue.' It wasn’t just China. For years, liberals and conservatives alike were, for instance, pushing the concept of burden-sharing: getting U.S. allies to cover more of the bill for their security needs. But it was only Trump who really made it happen by blackmailing NATO members and other U.S. partners into doing so. Sure, few warmed to the idea of the United States actually pulling out of NATO, but even many of our European allies, though they publicly grumbled, were secretly happy about The Donald’s gaiatsu. That’s the Japanese word for outside pressure that enables a leader to force through unpopular changes by blaming it all on foreigners. The self-described liberal leader of NATO, Dutch politician Mark Rutte, even came out in the open after Trump’s reelection to praise the American president for making European countries more militarily self-sufficient. It wasn’t just liberals who thrilled to Trump’s unorthodox foreign policy during his first term either. Some of those further to the left also embraced Trump the engager (with North Korea’s Kim Jong-un), Trump the isolationist (and his threats to close U.S. military bases globally), and Trump the putative peacemaker (for concluding a deal with the Taliban to end the U.S. military presence in Afghanistan). Trump, in other words, was not just an unanticipated crisis; he was also an opportunity. Deep in their hearts, anyone unhappy with the status quo will support a disrupter. Quite a few Democrats disgusted with this country’s border policies, inflation, and its coastal elites even crossed over to vote for Trump in November because they wanted change, regardless of the consequences. Trump 2.0 is going to be the same but worse, like a strong cheese voted out of the refrigerator only to grow ever more pungent as it moldered in a dark corner of Florida. The latest version of Trump has promised more violence and destruction the second time around, from mass deportations to mass tariffs. And he’s planning to avoid appointing anyone to his administration who might have a contrary thought, a backbone to resist him, or the least qualification to enact sensible policy. In the face of such a vengeful and truculent force returning to the White House, surely, you might think, it will be impossible to find any liberals embracing such anarchy the second time around. Think again. This is how American politics works, if only for liberals. The modern Republican Party routinely boycotts Democratic administrations: blocking Merrick Garland’s Supreme Court nomination, working overtime to shut down the federal government, voting en masse against legislation it would have supported if introduced by a Republican administration. The MAGA crowd has, in fact, turned noncooperation into something of an art form. Liberals, on the other hand, pride themselves on bipartisanship, on getting things done no matter who’s in power. So, inevitably, there will be cooperation with the Trump team as it sets about the 'deconstruction of the administrative state' (as Trump cheerleader Steve Bannon once put it). Worse, there will even be some silver-lining liberals (and a few leftists) who pull up a seat to applaud the wrecking ball — not perhaps for its wholesale destruction of neighborhoods but at least for its demolition of a select number of buildings that they deem irreparable. Each time such destruction takes place, the self-exculpatory comment from such silver-liners will be: 'Well, somebody had to come along and do something!' If Trump is the only tool in the governing toolbox, some liberals will indeed try to use him to pound in a few nails they think need hammering. Burning Bridges with China In his 2024 State of the Union address, Joe Biden argued that he did a better job than Donald Trump of standing up to China. He certainly devoted more Pentagon dollars to containing China. And not only did he not roll back Trump’s tariffs on Chinese products, but he added some of his own, including a 100% tax on Chinese electric vehicles. Biden also made concrete moves to decouple the U.S. economy from China’s, especially when it came to the supply chains for critical raw materials that Beijing has sought to control. 'I’ve made sure that the most advanced American technologies can’t be used in China,' he insisted, adding, 'Frankly for all his tough talk on China, it never occurred to my predecessor to do any of that.' Biden’s moves on China, from export controls and subsidies for chip manufacturers to closer military relationships with Pacific partners like Australia and India, received the enthusiastic support of his party. No surprise there: It’s hard to find anyone in Washington these days who has a good word to say about engaging more with China. So, when Trump takes office in January, he won’t actually be reversing course. He’ll simply be taking the baton-like stick from Biden while leaving all the carrots in the ground. That said, Trump’s proposed further spike in tariffs against China (and Canada and Mexico and potentially the rest of the world) does give many liberals pause, since it threatens to unleash an economically devastating global trade war while boosting prices radically at home. But trade unions backed by such liberals support such measures as a way to protect jobs, while the European Union only recently imposed stiff tariffs of their own on Chinese electrical vehicles. So, yes, neoliberals who embrace free trade are going to push back against Trump’s economic policies, but more traditional liberals who backed protectionist measures in the past will secretly (or not so secretly) applaud Trump’s moves. Back to the Wall On taking office, Joe Biden rolled back his predecessor’s harsh immigration policies. The rate of border-crossings then spiked for a variety of reasons (not just the repeal of those Trump-era laws) from an average of half a million to about two millionannually. However, in 2024, those numbers plummeted, despite Trump’s campaign claims — but no matter. By then, many Democrats had already been reborn as border hawks. That new, tougher attitude was on display in executive actions President Biden took in 2024 as well as the border security billthat Democrats tried to push through Congress earlier this year. Forget about finding a path to citizenship for the millions of undocumented immigrants who keep the American economy humming, Biden’s immigration policy focused on limiting asylum petitions, increasing detention facilities, and even allocating more money to build Trump’s infamous wall. As Elora Mukherjee, director of the Immigrants’ Rights Clinic at Columbia Law School, pointed out on the eve of the November election, 'What we are seeing is that the center of the Democratic Party is now adopting the same policies, the same postures, that MAGA Republicans were fighting for about six years ago.' And yet such punitive policies still weren’t harsh enough for MAGA Republicans and their America First followers. The bottom line was that immigration-averse voters didn’t want to support Democrats pretending to be MAGA Republicans. When it came to the White House, they wanted the real thing. As politics change hands in Washington next January, it’s going to be difficult to find any Democrats who will support the mass detentions and deportations Trump is promising. Yet many liberals, like the unprecedented number of Latinos who pulled the lever for Trump in 2024, do want major changes at the border with Mexico. In Arizona, Democrat Ruben Gallego won a squeaker of a Senate election by emphasizing border security and even backing a border wall (in certain areas). Such liberal border hawks will be happy when the Republican president does the dirty work so that Democrats don’t suffer the political fallout that is sure to follow. Remapping the Middle East On the face of it, the Abrahamic Accords were a liberal nightmare. The brainchild of Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner, they promised to repair relations between Israel and the major authoritarian regimes in the region: Saudi Arabia, the Gulf States, Morocco, and Sudan. The deal was a reward for illiberal leaders, particularly Israel’s Benjamin Netanyahu. The primary losers would, of course, be the Palestinians, who would have to give up their hopes for a separate state in exchange for some Saudi handouts, and the Sahrawi people who lost their claim to the Western Sahara when the United States and Israel recognizedMoroccan sovereignty over the entire region. Instead of shelving the Accords, however, the Biden administration pushed ahead with them. After roundly criticizing Saudi autocrat Mohammed bin Salman for, among other things, ordering the murder of a U.S.-based Saudi journalist, Biden mended ties, fist-bumping that rogue leader, and continuing to discuss how and when the Kingdom would normalize relations with Israel. Nor did his administration restrict Washington’s staggering weapons deliveries to Israel after its invasion and utter devastation of Gaza. Yes, Biden and crew made some statements about Palestinian suffering and tried to push more humanitarian aid into the conflict zone, but they did next to nothing to pressure Israel to stop its killing machine (nor would they reverse the Trump administration’s decision on the Western Sahara). The liberals who support Israel (come what may) like Pennsylvania Senator John Fetterman, New York Congressman Ritchie Torres, and the New Democrat Coalition in the House of Representatives are, of course, going to be enthusiastic about Trump’s ever tighter embrace of Netanyahu next year. But there are also likely to be quiet cheers from other corners of the liberal-left about the harder line Trump is likely to take against Tehran. (Remember Kamala Harris’s assertion during her presidential run that Iran was the main adversary of the United States?) The Arab Spring is long gone and a strong man in the White House needs to both schmooze with and go toe to toe with the strong men of the Middle East — or so many liberals will believe, even as they rationalize away their relief over Trump’s handling of a thoroughly illiberal region. Looking Ahead (Or Do I Mean Behind?) Anyone to the left of Tucker Carlson will certainly think twice about showing public enthusiasm for whatever Trump does. Indeed, most liberals will be appalled by the new administration’s likely suspension of aid to Ukraine and withdrawal from the Paris climate accord, not to mention other possible hare-brained maneuvers like sending U.S. troops to battle narcotraffickersin Mexico. Trump will attract liberal support, however quietly or even secretively, not because of his bridge-building genius — in reality, he couldn’t even get a bridge-building infrastructure bill through Congress in his first term — but because all too many liberals have already moved inexorably rightward on issues ranging from China and the Middle East to immigration. The MAGA minority has seized the machinery of power by weaponizing mendacity and ruthlessly breaking rules, in the process transforming politics much the way the Bolshevik minority did in Russia more than a century ago. In the pot that those Republicans put on the stove, the water has been boiling for more than a decade and yet the left-of-center frogs barely seem to recognize just how altered our circumstances have become. In normal times, finding overlapping interests with your political adversaries makes sense. Such bedrock bipartisanship stabilizes fractious countries that swing politically from center left to center right every few years. These are, however, anything but normal times and the second-term Trump team anything but center-rightists. They are extremists bent on dismantling the federal government, unstitching the fabric of international law, and turning up the heat drastically on an already dangerously overcooking planet. In 2020, I raised the possibility of a boycott, divestment, and sanction (BDS) movement against the United States if Trump won the elections that year. 'People of the world, you’d better build your BDS box, paint ‘Break Glass in Case of Emergency’ on the front, and stand next to it on November 3,' I wrote then. 'If Trump wins on Election Day, it will be mourning in America. But let’s hope that the world doesn’t mourn: it organizes.' Four years later, Trump has won again. Do I hear the sound of breaking glass? Here, in the United States, a stance of strict non-engagement with Trump 2.0, even where interests overlap, would not only be a good moral policy but even make political sense. When things go disastrously south, laws are broken, and the government begins to truly come apart at the seams, it’s vitally important that no left-of-center fingerprints be found at the scene of the crime. Let’s be clear: the Trump administration will not be playing by the rules of normal politics. So, forget about bipartisanship. Forget about preserving access to power by visiting Mar-a-Lago, hat in hand, like Facebook’s Mark Zuckerberg or the hosts of MSNBC’s Morning Joe. 'Fascism can be defeated,' historian Timothy Snyder wrote immediately after the November elections, 'but not when we are on its side.' So, my dear liberal-left, which side are you on?

Pentagon Report Says Despite Corruption Problems, China Progressi...	The Defense Department released Wednesday the annual 'Military and Security Developments Involving the People's Republic of China' report, a congressionally mandated annual report that offers insight into the capabilities, strategies and goals of China and its military. Of note in this year's report is a rise in corruption within the People's Liberation Army, China's efforts to curtail that corruption, and how that corruption might affect the PRC's ambitions. 'I think the [intensity] of the anti-corruption hunt is reflective of a serious concern that this is having serious problems,' said Ely Ratner, assistant secretary of defense for Indo-Pacific security affairs, while speaking today at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington. 'I think there are questions about the overall effect on the PLA and the whole way in which corruption reverberates through the entire system and what that means.' The corruption touches every service in the PLA, the report notes, and Xi Jinping, China's president, has made rooting out corruption in the military a focus of his tenure since taking office. Last year, corruption-related investigations resulted in the removal of at least 15 high-ranking military officers and defense industry executives from their posts, including the PRC Defense Minister Li Shangfu. 'I think if you just look at the language that China's senior leaders use to describe the intensity of the anti-corruption campaign and why it's so vital, that gives you a good sense of how they see it,' said Michael Chase, deputy assistant secretary of defense for China, Taiwan and Mongolia. Based on who was removed and from what parts of the PLA, Chase said, the corruption could relate to such things as major military construction projects as well as research development and acquisition programs. 'Therefore, [this] may be a different kind of impact on the PLA's ability to meet the capabilities development milestones that Xi Jinping has set out for them,' he said. 'It certainly has to shake the leadership's confidence in the political reliability of the PLA, and again, in its sort of overall ability to deliver what they've been tasked to deliver.' According to the report, the PRC's public defense budget increased in inflation-adjusted prices to $220 billion for 2023 and allows the PLA to focus on modernizing its weapons and equipment, recruitment and retaining personnel, and enhancing the military's strategic capacities. '[It] reflects investments in a range of capabilities that are focused on Taiwan contingencies, on the East or South China Seas — operations relatively close to the PRC borders,' Chase said. 'It also reflects investments in power projection capabilities, the kinds of things that we note in the report about the PLA Navy trying to improve its ability to operate out beyond the first island chain. And it reflects the longer-term ambition to really become a global military with capabilities that can, from the PRC's point of view, defend their interest worldwide.' Chase said there are also investments in nuclear expansion and modernization as well as space and counter-space capabilities. The report details China's build-up of nuclear weapons. The U.S. Defense Department estimates the PRC has surpassed 600 operational nuclear warheads as of mid-2024 and estimates the PRC will have more than 1,000 by 2030. 'We also talk in the report about not just the expansion in numbers, but also the increase in quality,' Chase said. 'We talk about the growing technological sophistication [and] the increasing diversity of China's nuclear arsenal.' In earlier reports, decades ago, similar reports detailed China's small and outdated nuclear weapons capabilities. That has changed. '[What] we've seen over time is that they've expanded to a nuclear triad, with the PLA Navy having ballistic missile submarines, conducting deterrence patrols, as we cover in the report, and that the PLA Air Force has also regained a nuclear deterrence and strike mission with the addition of nuclear-capable bombers,' Chase said. There is also an increase in diversity and capabilities such as precision strike capable missiles with lower yield nuclear warheads, for instance. 'That gives the PRC a wider range of options in terms of the kinds of nuclear deterrence operations they would conduct, as well as ... kind of having more rungs on the escalation ladder in terms of how they could conduct nuclear operations,' Chase said. The report also highlights struggles with deficiencies in China's military. One area that is true involves the readiness and capabilities of commanders. A term 'the five incapables,' used by the PLA, describes areas where Chinese military officers might improve, including the ability to evaluate situations, understand the intent of higher authorities, make operational decisions, deploy forces and manage unexpected situations. 'I think from the PRC perspective, some of this derives from their lack of combat experience,' he said. 'From the PRC point of view, it means that the experience that they do have is coming from the overseas operations, from the exercises that they conduct at home — not from any sort of real-world experience with combat operations.' Other areas where the PLA might not be where it needs to be, the report concludes, include conducting urban warfare and long-distance logistics. Ties between the PRC and allies, including Russia, are also included in the report. Included there is China's support to Russia for its ongoing war in Ukraine and in military cooperation and exercises. 'We continue to see them conduct the maritime exercises ... [and] the PRC to participate in other Russian exercises, and the joint bomber patrols to take place with some regularity,' Chase said. 'They will add some new elements to these over time. But a lot of the time, I think [PRC is] also trying to kind of maximize the political signaling value, to showcase more and deeper military cooperation.' Chase said that as Russia has become more dependent on the PRC, China will want more from it. 'The PRC ... is probably going to want to exert more leverage, to kind of extract greater cooperation from Russia in areas where Russia historically has been more reluctant,' he said. 'In the Arctic, for example, would be one example where that might take place.' Ratner said the PRC's relationship with Russia is not the only one to be watching. The PRC has relations with the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, Iran and Iranian proxy groups as well. The PRC's support to Russia's war in Ukraine, Ratner said, 'is just one of the ways in which the PRC's, anti-Western, anti-American orientation has been destabilizing, not only in Europe but in other theaters throughout the world.' The PRC is active in the Middle East as well, he said, where the PRC continues to support Iran and its proxies such as Hamas, Hezbollah and the Houthis. 'The Houthis have built a supply chain into the PRC for drones and missiles that they are using to attack international shipping,' he said. 'These are not just one-off transactions. This is really systemic in terms of how the Houthis are acquiring the capabilities they need.' He also said there is a 'bargain' between the Houthis and the PRC, where if the Houthis don't attack PRC shipping, Beijing will continue to provide diplomatic and political support to the Houthis. 'That is just an extraordinarily destabilizing set of activities,' he said. 'I think that the Russia piece is important, but we ought to not leave out the Middle East piece as well.' The PRC has made public its goals for modernization of the PLA. The PLA has made uneven progress toward its 2027 capability milestone for modernization, which the report said could make the PLA a more credible military tool for the Chinese Communist Party's Taiwan unification efforts. The year 2035 has also been touted as when the PLA plans to complete its modernization efforts, while 2049 remains a target to become a 'world-class military.'	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWet_9MfW6XVCS4bcCK3KK5Z	2024-12-18T17:06:27-08:00	
France: Sarkozy Must Wear Electronic Tag After Losing Graft Case ...	(EurActiv) -- France's highest appeals court on Wednesday (18 December) confirmed a verdict against former president Nicolas Sarkozy for corruption and influence peddling, ordering him to wear an electronic tag for a year, a first for a former head of state. Sarkozy, who had earlier been found guilty of illegal attempts to secure favours from a judge, will 'evidently' respect the terms of the conviction after the Court of Cassation's verdict, his lawyer Patrice Spinosi told AFP. But he will take the case to the European Court of Human Rights (ECtHR) within weeks, Spinosi added. This move at the Strasbourg-based ECtHR will, however, not hold up Wednesday's verdict from being carried out. The sanction now comes into force, Sarkozy having exhausted all legal avenues in the case in France. Spinosi said it was a 'sad day' when 'a former president is required to take action before European judges to have condemned a state over whose destiny he once presided'. In 2021, a lower court found that Sarkozy and his former lawyer, Thierry Herzog, had formed a 'corruption pact' with judge Gilbert Azibert to obtain and share information about a legal investigation. The court sentenced him to a three-year jail term, two of which were suspended and one that was to take the form of home detention with an electronic tag allowing his movements to be monitored. That verdict had already been upheld once, by an appeals court, last year. Other cases pending Sarkozy, 69, has always claimed his innocence, with his lawyer saying he would 'not give up this fight'. The right-winger, who was president for one term between 2007 and 2012, failing to win re-election. He has been embroiled in legal troubles ever since leaving office. The latest case, dubbed 'Bismuth', comes on top of separate cases about campaign financing overspending, and the alleged financing by Libya of Sarkozy's 2007 election campaign. Despite his legal problems, Sarkozy continues to enjoy considerable influence and popularity on the right of French politics and has the ear of President Emmanuel Macron, with whom he is known to meet on occasion. Sources have told AFP that Sarkozy held talks at the Élysée earlier this month in a bid to persuade Macron not to appoint veteran centrist Francois Bayrou as prime minister. The former president is widely known to despise him. After a long hesitation, Macron however went ahead and named Bayrou.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWet_9MfW6XVCTdsBh3dql-L	2024-12-18T17:05:23-08:00	
France And Germany’s Woes Could Seriously Weaken The EU – OpEd	By Mohamed Chebaro One government in, another one out — that is becoming a feature pointing to the instability within the EU’s family of nations. One could easily dismiss this and consider it the usual liberal-democratic game of politics within each country of the bloc. But the vote of no-confidence in the center-left government of Olaf Scholz after weeks of turmoil does not bode well for Germany, Europe’s biggest economy. It now seems set to join France in a potential spiral of instability, which could leave the EU without two of its biggest players at a crucial junction of history. As 2025 dawns, the two superpowers of the EU are likely to welcome the new year without a working government, no agreed budgets and fractured politics, with the narratives of the extremes dominating the public debates, if not yet their political institutions. The two engines of the EU, France and Germany, are in crisis just as adversities gather at the gates of the bloc and multiply. Embattled Chancellor Scholz of Germany is, after three years in power as part of an unruly three-colors coalition, lagging badly in the polls behind conservative opposition leader Friedrich Merz, of the Christian Democratic Union party of ex-Chancellor Angela Merkel. And while his government has struggled to revive a stuttering economy that is suffering from high energy prices and tougher competition from China, one wonders what chance any alternative coalition would have. Germany is facing major geopolitical challenges, such as its confrontation with Russia over the Ukraine war and the looming return of Donald Trump to the US presidency, which heightens uncertainty over the future of NATO and trade ties in general. The same could be said about President Emmanuel Macron’s France. Despite his nomination last week of centrist Francois Bayrou as prime minister, the same old problems are likely to weigh Paris down. The intransigent extreme right and extreme left are bent on sinking the presidency of Macron, unconcerned about headline issues like fixing the budget, the country’s debts or even pension reforms, let alone how Europe can deal with the Ukraine war once Trump returns to the White House next month. It is not an exaggeration to suggest that the consequences of France and now Germany being in disarray will be catastrophic for the EU, but also for democracy as a whole. That is unless both Berlin and Paris miraculously manage to restore the credibility of their leaderships and systems relatively soon. Otherwise, the demise of the EU and mainstream European democracy might be next. Despair is written all over the coming weeks. Germany’s path might be simpler if the CDU could win a larger chunk of the seats in parliament in February’s snap federal election. But even then the problems will not go away, as they are rooted in an ever-increasing wealth divide and sinking living standards, which many experts have long blamed on a failure of leadership across the Western world. Too many countries have not dealt with the root causes of the financial crisis of 2007-2008, while globalization has become a bad word for voters across Europe, despite the prosperity it once afforded them. Germany might find a potential escape route by electing Merz, who has steered his party away from Merkel’s legacy and positioned it closer to its roots in a bid to blunt the impact of the far-right Alternative for Germany and its appeal among conservative voters. His dream of winning an outright ruling majority might be far-fetched in this age of rising populist forces and their anti-traditional politics narratives, but he could still work with the Social Democrats post-Scholz and with the Greens. However, this could also be problematic. In France, many blame Macron and his 'mercurial arrogance' for ushering in this crisis, which emanated from the battering his party got in June’s European Parliament elections. His decision to hold snap elections over the summer produced a three-way split in parliament between his centrists, the left and Marine Le Pen’s far-right National Rally. A fourth or even a fifth prime ministerial appointment might not aid Macron or the country, as he keeps refusing to nominate one of the many moderate figures from the leftist coalition that earned the highest number of seats in the elections. France seems to be in a tight corner, with polls indicating that between 35 percent and 38 percent of voters intend to support Le Pen in the next presidential election, which is due in 2027. This could put her far-right movement at the steps of the Elysee Palace. Commentators across Europe are right to continuously ring the alarm bells, warning that the bloc is in need of a series of ententes cordiales, both within nations and between states, and that voters and leaders ought to wake up because 'the enemy is at the gate.' Rather than external enemies — as Russia continues to present an existential challenge to European security and society and China’s pursuit of its interests, capitalizing on any holes in the European economic guard rails, continues unabated — it may be the enemy within that ultimately unravels the tenets of the EU project, as the European populists will surely feel the winds of Trump behind them come 2025. Giorgia Meloni of Italy might feel fewer constraints and pursue a more illiberal agenda. Some states in Central and Eastern Europe, formerly part of the Warsaw Pact, are already leaning toward authoritarianism. There is Hungary and Slovakia and maybe Czechia will soon join them in an orbit of politics that is not far from the Kremlin’s. The exceptions remain the Baltic and Nordic states and Poland, which are just holding on but maybe not for long. That is why it is imperative for nations like Germany and France to find their withering political balance and leadership in the new year. The alternatives in populist-led European nations could only further sink the EU, its liberal democratic anchors, its peace and security mechanisms and, above all, its prosperity and welfare state.

The Strawman Of Antisemitism: Banning Protests Against Israel Dow...	Of late, a spate of incidents has taken place in Australia giving sheer delight to the simian-resembling Opposition Leader, Peter Dutton. On a visit to South Australia, he showed himself to be merrily divisive in attacking protestors who had shown solidarity for Palestinians in Gaza in the wake of their catastrophic suffering since October last year: 'If you allow these lunatics to continue their protests at university campuses and you allow them to spew their hatred and affiliate with a listed terrorist organisation, and there [is] no consequence, of course we’ll see the sort of outcomes we have seen – which most recently has culminated in the firebombing of a synagogue in Melbourne'. The December 6 attack on the Adass Israel Synagogue in Melbourne, while horrid, was immediately elevated to a level of concern warranting an emergency – that, at least, was the view of Dutton and his charges. The attacks on mosques and their worshippers, a feature of Australian public life for some years now, hardly warranted a mention. (A 2021 joint study by three Australian universities surveying 75 mosques found that 58.2% had experienced violence between 2014 and 2019.) Dutton also had inspiration from another source. 'The burning of the Adass Israel synagogue in Melbourne is an abhorrent act of antisemitism,' stated Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on platform X. 'I expect the state authorities to use their full weight to prevent such antisemitic acts in future.' Ever the opportunist, Netanyahu saw a chance to see unsubstantiated links between the bombing in Melbourne, Australian foreign policy and antisemitism. 'Unfortunately, it is impossible to separate this reprehensible act from the extreme anti-Israeli position of the Labor government in Australia, including the scandalous decision to support the UN resolution calling on Israel ‘to bring an end to its unlawful presence in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, as rapidly as possible’, and preventing a former Israeli minister from entering the country.' The conclusion was childishly simple: 'Anti-Israel sentiment is antisemitism.' This unbridled nonsense had its effect. In the aftermath of the synagogue attack, Australia’s antisemitism envoy, Jillian Segal, got busy. On the Australian public broadcaster SBS, she took the rather authoritarian view that Australian cities were no place for protests against Israeli policies towards the Palestinians. 'There should be places designated away from where the Jewish community might venture, where people can demonstrate.' Presumably, pro-Palestinian protestors needed to be given, like smokers, caged areas to engage in their activities, leaving the pure and docile safe to go about their everyday business. In Segal’s view, the weekly protests held in solidarity for Palestinians in Gaza and the West Bank had become 'something more sinister'. Not only were they 'intimidatory', they had 'morphed into attacking the Jewish community.' Not exactly furnished with much by way of evidence, she pointed to the display of 'flags from a terrorist organisation' and 'anti-Jewish sentiments' seen and heard at rallies. Demagogy always resists context. Amnesty International Australia, in a December 13 statement, expressed its strong opposition to Segal’s call 'to ban pro-Palestinian protests from city centres. Protests advocating for a ceasefire, the protection of human rights, and an end to Israel’s genocide of Palestinians in Gaza are an essential and protected outlet for Australians to freely express their views.' It was vital to distinguish instances of 'hateful acts and calls for justice, freedom, and human dignity.' These views are correct – to a point. As Australia lacks a human rights charter protecting the right to lawful assembly and free speech, parliaments at both the federal and state level can show sneering contempt for protests when they wish to do so. Wishing to jump to the aid of Segal and the unspecified fearful in the Jewish community, Victoria’s Premier Jacinta Allan has done just that, proposing legislation that targets pro-Palestinian protests. 'Antisemitism,' she solemnly stated, 'thrives in extreme and radical environments, and we are giving police more powers to control protest and making it harder for agents of violence and hate to hide.' Allan gives the impression that the proposed laws are universal in nature. 'Doesn’t matter if you’re Christian, Jewish Muslim, Sikh, Hindu – you all deserve the right to simply be who we are'. However, things become very clear with the explicit mention 'that Jewish people increasingly feel the promise of a modern and multicultural Victoria is being denied them.' The ludicrously named Anti-Vilification and Social Cohesion Bill 2024 will not only, as the premier noted in a public announcement, ban the flags and symbols of designated terrorist organisations (Hamas and Hezbollah included), undefined 'white nationalists' (presumably those of other colours slip under the radar), 'and more': the statute will also focus on the decorative and dramatic nature of protest. Masks, 'used by agitators to shield identities and hide from personal accountability', are to be banned, along with glue, rope, chains, locks and other devices 'used to cause maximum disruption and endanger Victorians.' This shows that protestors of all stripes, including those concerned with climate change and environment, will also be targeted. Showing a conventional loathing for Victoria’s own Charter of Human Rights, which has a paper tiger protection for freedom of assembly, Allan condescendingly shreds it: 'the right to protest is balanced against the right of people to live safely – free of danger, discrimination and harassment.' These moves replicate the Commonwealth Criminal Code Act 1995, as amended by the Counter-Terrorism Legislation Amendment (Prohibited Hate Symbols and Other Measures) Bill 2023 passed last year. As if Australia’s citizenry needed to have more strangulating laws, these measures already criminalise the display and trade of prohibited symbols, along with the Nazi salute, which includes 'a prohibited terrorist organisation symbol.' Police-minded bureaucracies, whatever their level, adore duplication. The beneficiaries in all of this are the noisy, bellicose members of the pro-Israel lobby, a divisive federal opposition keen to capitalise on hatreds it claims not to have, and the State of Israel itself. However murderous, annihilating and cruel its policies might be to the Palestinians, the belief shared by many of its defenders is that the Jewish state is faultless, beyond the moral and soiling reach of any protest. To think otherwise would instance, as Netanyahu barkingly insists, antisemitism.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWet_9MfW6XVCUnurwHCmMdU	2024-12-18T17:02:55-08:00	
Ukraine Drones Kill 50 North Koreans In Battle In Kursk Region	By Park Jaewoo Around 50 North Korean soldiers were killed in a battle against Ukrainian army drones in the Kursk region this week, video of the battle shared on social media revealed. It’s the latest evidence that North Korean forces are participating in Russia’s war with Ukraine, a fact that Moscow and Pyongyang are trying to hide, including by allegedly burning the faces off of North Koreans who are killed in action. The video, shared by Ukraine’s 8th Special Operations Regiment on Facebook, showed a drone attack in the battle fought on Monday. In the video, what are believed to be North Korean soldiers are seen running away or hiding behind trees when they encounter Ukrainian first-person-view drones, also known as FPV drones. Sgt. Mykhailo Makaruk, a member of the Ukrainian unit confirmed to RFA Korean that he had fought against North Koreans in the battle captured on video. 'I think nearly 200 (North Korean soldiers) came to our position,' Makaruk said, explaining that shortly after, the drones began an aerial attack. He likened the North Koreans to zombies, a staple of horror films. 'They came and they came and the drones are bombing them,' he said. 'I don’t understand how they can come to this war. They look like, you know, real zombies.' Makaruk did not disclose the exact location where the battle was fought because his unit is still deployed in a combat situation. RFA has not verified the authenticity of the video. Makaruk said that the North Korean soldiers involved in the battle moved alongside Russian troops, and that mid-level North Korean officers were among them. He said the North Korean soldiers were equipped with Russian military supplies and used outdated tactics typical of the Soviet military in the 1950s. They were totally unprepared to fight against drones, and they appear to think they can avoid detection while on the ground or under cover of night, Makaruk said. These FPV drones are said to be able to reach speeds of up to 150 kilometers (93 miles) per hour, meaning that if they encounter each other within 100 meters, it will take less than a second for them to collide. Andrii Kovalenko, the head of Ukraine’s Center for Countering Disinformation at the National Security and Defense Council, posted on on his Telegram account that North Korean soldiers were no match for the drones, also called unmanned aerial vehicles, or UAVs. 'The dead DPRK soldiers did not have a visual understanding of the danger from UAVs before the drone strikes, which may indicate that the Russians poorly informed the Koreans about the use of drones at the front,' Kovalenko said. He also said that the Russian soldiers were seen trying to quickly recover the bodies of North Korean soldiers who died on the front lines, which was different from the way they recovered Russian casualties. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Monday in an address that preliminary data suggests that the Russians were trying to hide the deaths of North Korean soldiers. 'Unfortunately, we are forced to defend against them as well, even though there is not a single reason for North Koreans to die in this war,' Zelensky said. 'The only reason is Putin’s madness, which has consumed Russia and fuels this war.'	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWet_9MfW6XVCR2gyrfXWndR	2024-12-18T16:56:25-08:00	
Developments In Syria Can Give Opportunity To ISIS To Bounce Back...	Mr Shoresh Ismail Abdulla is the Minister of Peshmerga affairs in the Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG). The Peshmerga are the military forces of the Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG) and one of the most capable forces in the region, which pushed back ISIS from its strongholds. Currently, Peshmerga is also playing a vital role in counter-terror operations against ISIS. In an interview with Manish Rai, Geopolitical Analyst for the Middle East at the Ministry of Peshmerga Affairs in Erbil, Iraqi Kurdistan. Mr. Abdulla speaks about the reemergence of ISIS in the context of developments in Syria, planned reforms of Peshmerga, and expectations from the incoming United States administration of President-Elect Donald Trump. Question: What role are Peshmerga forces playing in countering ISIS? Is the threat of ISIS still imminent? Mr Abdulla: To understand the role played by the Peshmerga in countering terrorism, we have to dig into the past of this force. Historically, Peshmerga, to save the people and the region, fought with the brutal Baathist regime of Saddam Hussein and other terror groups. So, when ISIS emerged as a significant threat in 2014, we already had the expertise to deal with this kind of force. We confronted ISIS with all our strength, and while doing that, we also made a lot of sacrifices. For example, we had more than 10,000 injured and 2,000 martyrs in the fight against ISIS. But combined with our experience and determination, we were able to defeat ISIS and stop this terror group's expansion. Yes, the threat posed by ISIS is far from over, and this extremist group remains the most prominent threat to the stability and peace of the region. Question: Do you think they still can capture large territories? Mr Abdulla: Their fighting tactics have changed. Islamic State is still carrying out its operations through its cells very frequently, and even after losing the large territory it once controlled, we are observing very high military activities from ISIS. As the ideology of ISIS is still very much present, it has the potential to re-emerge as a significant threat. The recent developments in Syria will provide favorable conditions for ISIS to strengthen themselves. Question: Still, many units (Unit 70 forces are affiliated with the PUK, and the KDP controls Unit 80 forces) of Peshmerga are affiliated with the political parties of Kurdistan. Will all the units be unified under the Ministry of Peshmerga Affairs anytime soon? What is the biggest hindrance to unification? Mr Abdulla: There is no hindrance as such. The process of unifying all the Peshmerga units is underway. We are receiving support for this effort from the coalition forces led by the United States. There is a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) between the two biggest parties of Kurdistan, KDP and PUK, to unify the Peshmerga forces by the end of 2026. Question: How is the Peshmerga modernization progressing? It is often stated that Peshmerga forces lack heavy weaponry and air power. Is there any plan in place to address these issues? Mr Abdulla: We have taken these reforms very seriously. A separate Directorate was established under the Ministry of Peshmerga Affairs, which oversees 35 points of planned reforms. Some critical areas, such as establishing a transparent chain of command, training, and logistics, are prioritized in the modernization process. We are receiving continuous support from the US and other coalition forces. The Federal government in Baghdad is preventing us from procuring heavy and advanced weapons. Baghdad is not even providing ammunition for the armaments we already possess. This behavior of the Federal government of Iraq is strange as Peshmerga forces have also fought against any threat Iraq faces. Our forces have defended the Kurdistan region and Iraq, and we expect more cooperation from Iraqi authorities. Question: Recently, Peshmerga forces received some artillery pieces (105mm M119 howitzers) from the United States. However, Baghdad has opposed this kind of weapons transfer by the US, arguing that the Iraqi national Army should only possess heavy weapons. Mr Abdulla: We already possess some heavy weapons, and in the past, the Iraqi government didn’t oppose it. Recently, some people have objected to weapons being transferred to Peshmerga forces by the United States. Prejudices and narrow thought processes drive these objections. There is a misinformation campaign being run that possession of heavy weapons by Peshmerga forces can be a threat to the Iraqi Army. But the matter is that Peshmerga has never been a threat to anyone. Also, it should be remembered that when the Iraqi National Army was not able to fight ISIS and fled, we were the only force that defended Iraqi territory and saved the innocents from ISIS. Hence, I would say that strong Peshmerga forces are also in Iraq's interest. Question: What assistance should the international community provide you in the fight against terrorism? Mr Abdulla: We expect that each country that is part of the international coalition against terrorism should enter into bilateral agreements with the Iraqi federal government, and we should also be included in such agreements. We are playing an essential role in the fight against terrorism in this region. I am not saying that we should be included as a third party in these bilateral engagements. However, it should be considered that the Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG), as per the Iraqi constitution, is an autonomous region of Iraq. Hence, we should be part of every agreement about counter-terror efforts. Question: Do you think the policies of US President-elect Donald Trump's administration will affect the region differently, especially Kurdistan? Mr Abdulla: We can’t say with certainty whether the policies of the new US administration will change or not. But the officials chosen to serve in the new administration—almost all of them—have had positive views about the Kurdistan region and the Peshmerga in the past. We believe that policies in the United States are decided at an institutional level after considering the ground realities.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWet_9MfW6XVCWaXoVfxaADz	2024-12-18T16:55:00-08:00	
US, UK Say Medvedev’s Comment Calling NATO Officials ‘Legitimate ...	By Rikard Jozwiak and Zoriana Stepanenko (RFE/RL) -- The U.K. and U.S. governments on December 18 said the comments of Russian Security Council Deputy Chairman Dmitry Medvedev following the assassination of a high-ranking Russian general by Ukrainian security services were irresponsible and yet another sign of Moscow's desperation. Medvedev, reacting to an editorial in the London-based Times newspaper that called the December 17 killing of a high-ranking Russian officer 'a legitimate act of defense by a threatened nation,' said Moscow should apply the same logic. Medvedev accused NATO and officials from countries allied with Ukraine in its battle to repel invading Russian troops of being participants in the conflict, making them 'legitimate military targets.' The U.S. State Department told RFE/RL that Medvedev's comments amounted to more irresponsible rhetoric from the Kremlin and reiterated that the United States and NATO do not seek a military conflict with Russia. 'The Kremlin's aggression against Ukraine is the most significant and direct threat to Europe's security and to peace and stability in the Euro-Atlantic area. It is the Kremlin that started this war, and [Russian President Vladimir] Putin could end it today,' the State Department's press office said in a statement e-mailed to RFE/RL. U.S. State Department spokesman Matthew Miller told a briefing on December 17 that Washington had no connection to the killing of Lieutenant General Igor Kirillov, the head of Russia's Nuclear, Biological, and Chemical Defense Forces (RKhBZ), or any prior knowledge of it. The U.K. Foreign Office said the comments were 'just another example of Putin’s propaganda machine,' while a spokesman for British Prime Minister Keir Starmer was quoted as saying Medvedev's comments were 'simply the latest in a stream of desperate rhetoric' to come out of Putin's government. 'Unlike in Russia, a free press is a cornerstone of our democracy and we take any threats made by Russia incredibly seriously,' the spokesman added, according to The Times. 'Our newspapers represent the best of British values: freedom, democracy and independent thinking,' he said. 'I stand with The Times.' In its article, The Times said the assassination was 'a discriminate strike against an aggressor' and that it underlines the need for Western governments to give Ukraine 'all support it needs to fight a just war of self-defense.' 'All officials of NATO countries involved in decisions about military assistance to Ukraine and those participating in hybrid or conventional warfare against Russia are now considered legitimate military targets for the Russian state and all Russian patriots,' Medvedev wrote in response. EU foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas told RFE/RL on December 18 that 'Russia is always threatening. And it is meant to scare us, so what we see is the threats we have heard before.' Speaking in Brussels before a meeting of EU leaders to discuss the war, she said: 'I think the only response we can have is not to be afraid.'	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWet_9MfW6XVCcLHTWZQzrvG	2024-12-18T16:53:25-08:00	
Gwadar Port Highlights Precarity In Pakistan’s Geopolitical Balan...	By Muneeb Yousuf Eight months after the February 2024 general elections, Pakistan’s politics continue to be marred by political, economic and security challenges. The country’s most popular politician, Imran Khan, remains in jail, the coalition government lacks legitimacy and the military establishment continues to hold veto power over the government’s policies. Pakistan is also facing acute security challenges. Terrorist attacks have increased in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan since October, targeting Chinese nationals working on critical infrastructure projects. In September 2024, leaked military and diplomatic documents claiming that Pakistan has privately agreed to grant China approval for a military base at the strategic port of Gwadar in Balochistan surfaced. Both Pakistan and China have denied these claims, but the accusation sheds light on Pakistan’s internal security problems and its delicate relations with China and the United States. Pakistan’s foreign policy is under significant economic and geopolitical pressure. While Islamabad shares longstanding military and investment ties with Washington, it has also cultivated a strong relationship with Beijing predicated on mutual animosity toward New Delhi. US–Pakistan relations have deteriorated since the 2020–21 US withdrawal from Afghanistan. The Pakistani government and military’s attempts to repair ties with the United States have failed to yield meaningful dividends, such as securing a crucial International Monetary Fund (IMF) package. These diplomatic manoeuvres have visibly frustrated China, which views such overtures as a potential shift in allegiance to Washington. Pakistan’s motivation behind potentially approving a military base would stem from the country’s economic and security problems. Reliance on IMF loans to keep the economy afloat, mounting debt repayments and persistent difficulties to raise capital have pushed Pakistan to renegotiate loan terms with China. Unlike previous years when Pakistan extracted strategic rent from the United States which paid for its exports and military modernisation, the country now finds its geopolitical significance substantially diminished. If Pakistan were to grant a military base to China, it would face a dilemma. Beijing’s access to the base could alleviate Pakistan’s economic crisis and ensure that a continuous supply of advanced military hardware enters the country. But it would also lead to further deterioration of ties with the United States and affect Pakistan’s strategic autonomy. If a military base were to be approved, internal security challenges would also be exacerbated. Baloch insurgents and other militant groups could be encouraged to increase attacks targeting Chinese nationals and development infrastructure. The Balochistan Liberation Army views the China–Pakistan Economic Corridor as a mechanism which furthers the economic marginalisation of the Baloch community. Baloch insurgents could exploit the situation to strengthen regional sentiments, which have long viewed the Pakistani state as unfairly appropriating mineral and gas reserves. Rising attacks on Chinese infrastructure projects and workers have prompted Beijing to push for joint military mechanisms with Pakistan to safeguard Chinese citizens and projects in the country. Chinese Ambassador to Pakistan Jiang Zaidong has maintained that security threats are the primary constraint behind the slow progress of the China–Pakistan Economic Corridor and has exhorted the Pakistani government to strengthen the security of Chinese personnel, institutions and projects. But this push is unlikely to lead to a resolution, as there is little clarity on the role of Chinese guards in Pakistan if joint security were to be implemented and whether they would be able to participate in combat operations in case of attack. There would be a score of foreign policy and internal security implications for Pakistan if the claims made by the Drop Site portal — based on leaked military and diplomatic documents — are accepted at face value. The aim is not to assess the merits of these claims, but to speculate about what implications such developments may have upon Pakistan’s relationship with the United States, China and the China–Pakistan Economic Corridor. Given this, it would not be prudent for Pakistan to take sides in the US–China rivalry, which is set to intensify with the re-election of former US president Donald Trump. Islamabad is not a likely priority for the Trump cabinet, yet Washington would not wish for Islamabad to fall into Beijing’s lap.

Syrian Rebels Adopt Approach Similar To Taliban’s To Seek Interna...	By Roshan Noorzai and Sayed Aziz Rahman While the international community is setting conditions for the new rulers in Syria, the leading rebel group has taken a conciliatory approach, similar to one the Taliban adopted in Afghanistan, to seek international recognition, say analysts. Ahmed al-Sharaa, also known as Abu Mohammed al-Jolani, the leader of Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, or HTS, met with the U.N. special envoy for Syria on Sunday and emphasized 'rapid and effective cooperation' to rebuild Syria's economy and maintain its territorial integrity. In an interview with The Times of London, al-Jolani said that Syrian soil will not be used against any neighboring country, including Israel. Asfandyar Mir, a senior expert at the Washington-based U.S. Institute of Peace, told VOA that HTS presented 'a conciliatory message,' similar to the one the Taliban presented after seizing power in 2021, by 'positioning itself in regional politics in a way that would not provoke regional countries [and global powers] against them.' After seizing power in August 2021, the Taliban tried to assure the neighboring countries and regional powers that the group would not allow anyone to use Afghanistan as a launchpad against any country. But the U.N. said in July that while the Taliban claims there are no foreign terrorist groups in Afghanistan, member states reported more than two dozen terrorist groups were operating inside the country. He added that HTS learned from its own experience, and also from observing the Taliban, to avoid making enemies overseas 'by signaling and trying to assure them that look, we don't have any beef with you,' Mir said. Mir said the global and regional powers have relatively moderate aims when dealing with the rebels in Syria, 'but they are going to spend time watching HTS.' Syrian rebels, led by HTS, started an offensive against former President Bashar al-Assad's forces on November 27 in the northern Idlib province and, after capturing some strategic cities, seized control of the capital, Damascus, in 11 days. The U.S. welcomed the rebels' 'hopeful' statements but said that 'we're going to judge them by their actions.' 'We're going to make our decisions when it comes to sanction posture, when it comes to recognition, posture, when it comes to all the tools in our toolbox, based on what we see from HTS and other actors on the ground here,' Mathew Miller, the spokesperson for the U.S. State Department said Monday in response to a question from VOA. A top EU diplomat said Sunday the European Union would not lift sanctions on Syria before its new rulers provide guarantees to safeguard minorities and women's rights and disavow terrorism. The international community demanded similar guarantees from the Taliban after the group seized power in Afghanistan in August 2021. The international community urged that the Taliban honor their commitments to counter terrorism, form an inclusive government and respect human rights, particularly women's rights, before they were recognized as a legitimate government of Afghanistan. No country has yet formally recognized the Taliban, though many countries have established diplomatic relations with the Taliban government. Colin Clarke, the director of research at The Soufan Group, told VOA that the U.S. policy toward Syria is shaped by its experience in Afghanistan. 'I think that informs a lot of what they do in terms of foreign policy,' said Clarke. He said there are 'a lot of similarities' between how the Taliban and HTS present themselves. 'Being more pragmatic, being more moderate, distancing themselves from more hardcore Jihadist ideology,' he added. larke said the question, though, is whether HTS would remain moderate. He said concerns exist about hardcore foreign militants, particularly those from Central Asia, within the rebel groups. 'They may defect and either split off their own, or they may want to go and join other groups like IS because they may see this whole governing project as a fool's errand,' he added. The U.N., the U.S., Turkey, and many other countries have designated HTS as a terrorist organization. HTS is 'a coalition of northern Syria-based Sunni Islamist insurgent groups that evolved from Jabhat al-Nusrah, or 'Nusrah Front,' al-Qaida's former branch in Syria,' says the website of the National Counterterrorism Center, the U.S. agency with primary responsibility for analyzing and integrating information on international terrorism. In 2013, the U.S. State Department designated al-Sharaa as a global terrorist, and the U.S. offered a reward of up to $10 million for information leading to his arrest. Though the Taliban are not designated as a terrorist group by the U.S. State Department, the Haqqani Network, now part of the Taliban's government, is among the U.S.-designated terrorist groups. Clarke said he thinks the Syrian rebels will be recognized sooner than the Taliban because they represent 'a newer phenomenon, and they don't have as many skeletons in the closet at this point.' Merissa Khurma, director of the Middle East Program at the Washington-based Wilson Center think tank, said it is 'very difficult' to compare the Syrian rebels to the Taliban. 'With Syria, it was freeing the Syrian people from a brutal regime. With Afghanistan, it was essentially the return of a brutal regime to power,' said Khurma. But, she said, in both cases the governments these groups fought against suffered from 'low morale.' 'It does showcase that both systems were already eroding,' she said.

Eric Adams And Daniel Penny Make Black People The Face Of Crime –...	Daniel Penny’s acquittal was not surprising, and neither is Mayor Eric Adams' defense of Penny and law enforcement power being used against Black people. 'You have someone [Penny] on that subway who was responding, doing what we should have done as a city.' -- Eric Adams, Mayor of New York City Millions of people in the United States are de facto deputies who can be asked at a moment’s notice to carry out what is considered the most important job in the nation, keeping Black people under physical control. The most recent case brought to public attention was that of Daniel Penny, a white man who put an emotionally disturbed Black man, Jordan Neely, in a chokehold on a New York City subway. Neely died after the assault and Penny was recently acquitted of manslaughter and criminally negligent homicide. What followed was a predictable and righteous reaction of outrage at the obvious racist injustice. Black people are riveted whenever white racist killers go on trial. Those persons may be police like Derek Chauvin, who killed George Floyd on camera. They may be vigilantes like the men who killed Ahmed Aubery. In those two cases there were guilty verdicts and prison time. Black people and anyone who cared about justice applauded the outcomes but what was missing was an explanation of the white supremacist nature of the United States and the inevitability of absolution in most of these cases, as there was for Penny. Penny was called a 'hero' by the public, pundits, and politicians. His defense fund now totals more than $3.3 million , with donations being made on a daily basis, even after he was acquitted of all charges. So exalted is his celebrity status that former president and now president-elect Donald Trump and his soon to be vice president, J.D. Vance invited Penny to be their guest at the Army-Navy football game . What is missing from the discussion and media attention is honesty about the nature of law enforcement in this country. The United States is the world’s largest jailer, with two million people behind bars. No other country has as many people or as large a percentage of their population incarcerated. Some 37% of all those imprisoned are Black people, who make up only 14% of the entire population. This imbalance is quite purposeful and explains the love of violence and punishment that afflict the United States. Any effort towards justice and compassion is immediately met with scorn and political attack. The slightest, most minor changes to policing and imprisonment are vehemently opposed, and anti-Black racism is the explanation for the draconian mindset that prevails in this country. Even small efforts at reform are met with fierce opposition. In New York a very modest program to end cash bailfor minor offenses was undone by democrats who control that state. Eric Adams was among those making the case for more people to end up in jail awaiting trial just because they didn’t have money. Bail reform has succeeded by every measure, with crime rates down, and those who would have been held in jail not being rearrested. Facts don’t count when white people are whipped into a crime panic frenzy, just as Penny choking Neely’s neck was found not to be the cause of death. New York is not alone in this regard. Around the country more progressive prosecutors are defeated in election campaigns. In California a proposition that would have done away with forced labor in prisons was defeated at the polls. Those same voters approved another proposition which elevated some minor crimes from the category of misdemeanors to felonies , reversing a proposition to decriminalize which they passed ten years earlier. Eric Adams, New York City’s Black mayor routinely elevates the concerns of his white constituents. He read the room when he defended Penny as having done what the city should have done. His comment gave the appearance that he has no role in allocating funds for social services and can’t make the case for mental health care or housing. Of course he has the power to do these things, but Adams has made a career out of being the white people’s Black man and he knows when to repeat their favorite coded language in order to keep them happy. The settler mentality is ever present, and subjugated groups present a danger in the minds of the modern day pioneers who are afraid of seemingly everything. From enslavement, to the chain gang, to mass incarceration, Black people are viewed as being inherently dangerous, which in the minds of many white people means they must be policed and punished at every opportunity. There are Black people willing to help their effort. The infamous stop and frisk policies which were used so heavily by mayor Michael Bloomberg not only never ended, but have gotten worse during Eric Adams’ tenure. In 2013 a federal monitor found that NYPD stop and frisks violated the Fourth Amendment, protecting against unreasonable searches, and the Fourteenth Amendment, which guarantees equal protection under the law. After some years of decline now Adams has brought back the bad old days, with 59% of stops being carried out against Black people. 'In 2020, there were a little more than 9,544 stops, according to the monitor. That number decreased by around 600 in 2021, the year before Adams took office. In 2022, the number of reported stops rose to 15,102. The number of stops again rose in 2023, when nearly 17,000 stops were reported.' Eric Adams often gives the appearance of not being the sharpest knife in the drawer but he certainly knows how to win an election. Whipping up a crime panic is a sure path to political success. All the better if the person stoking the fear is himself a Black man who dilutes any action against racist policies. Not only did Donald Trump invite Penny for a hang out, but he has also defended Eric Adams, who is now under federal indictment on bribery charges . Trump says that Adams has been 'treated pretty unfairly ' and adds that he would consider pardoning him if he is found guilty. Now Adams is hoping to get a ticket to Trump’s inauguration . Such is the life of a Black man who plays his cards right. He wins the mayoralty by placating racist fears, uses the power of his office against Black people, and cozies up to a president-elect who honors a racist killer. If history gives us any indication, Adams may end up being mayor again.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWet_9MfW6XVCWR-gT2ZIAJz	2024-12-18T16:35:52-08:00	
Charismatic Leadership: Legal, Political And Moral Costs – Analys...	Constitutions are foundational documents that shape the political and legal structure of a nation. In democratic systems, they are intended to establish a clear separation of powers, protect individual rights, and ensure that governance is responsive to the needs of the people. However, leaders in countries like Venezuela, Russia, and Turkey have exploited constitutional amendments to centralize power, eroding democratic institutions. Indonesia faces similar risks with proposals like presidential term extensions and reintroducing state policy guidelines (PPHN), raising concerns over potential abuses of power. This article examines these issues through global comparisons and suggests reforms to safeguard democracy. Hence, the following lines are examining how the mechanism of constitutional amendments can be misused to consolidate power and undermine democratic norms, a phenomenon known as abusive constitutionalism. By analyzing cases from Turkey, Russia, Venezuela, and China, it explores how leaders manipulate legal frameworks to entrench authority and foster a cult of personality. The paper highlights preventative measures such as eternity clauses, the basic structure doctrine, and civil society engagement as safeguards to protect democracy. It also considers how Indonesia can strengthen its constitutional framework to prevent authoritarianism. Using conceptual legal research and a comparative approach, this study aims to answer three key questions: (1) What drives the proposed constitutional amendments in Indonesia? (2) How do these proposals align with principles of constitutionalism and democracy? (3) What safeguards can prevent abusive constitutional practices in Indonesia? It seeks to address the research questions by evaluating how constitutional amendments have led to abusive constitutionalism, focusing on Indonesia's current proposals. Cases from countries such as India, Colombia, and Venezuela provide insights into how term limit extensions, power shifts, and personalization undermine democratic principles. The study emphasizes the role of civil society in maintaining accountability. II. Constitution, Legal Order and Political Power 2.1 Comparative Framework: Abusive Constitutionalism in a Global Context Abusive constitutionalism, as defined by David Landau, refers to the manipulation of constitutional mechanisms to undermine democracy under the guise of legal reform. This global phenomenon has been observed in countries like Hungary, Venezuela, Turkey, China, Colombia, and Indonesia. Tactics include extending presidential terms, weakening checks and balances, co-opting judicial institutions, and consolidating power under the rhetoric of stability or national progress. In Colombia, the 1991 constitution limited the president to a single term to prevent the rise of authoritarian leaders, seeking to entrench power. However, President Álvaro Uribe Vélez sought to amend the constitution to allow re-election, raising concerns about democratic backsliding. Similarly, in Venezuela, constitutional reforms extended the presidential term from one four-year term to two six-year terms, enabling Hugo Chávez to consolidate power. Like Colombia’s example, these amendments were framed as necessary for national progress, but they ultimately allowed for the rise of authoritarian rule. In Hungary, the ruling party employed both amendments and replacements to the constitution to consolidate power. This included adding more constitutional court judges, restructuring key state commissions, and making it more difficult to amend the constitution in ways that could challenge the ruling party’s dominance. These measures illustrate how constitutional reforms can be used as tools for entrenching power, rather than reforming governance. Similar trends are observable in Indonesia, where proposed constitutional amendments, such as reintroducing the National Guidelines (PPHN), may serve to further centralize authority in the hands of the president. Rosalind Dixon and David Landau’s concept of Abusive Constitutional Borrowing highlights how democratic frameworks are repurposed for authoritarian control, often by weakening institutions like constitutional courts or anti-corruption bodies. Research shows that while leaders frequently attempt to evade term limits through constitutional changes, public resistance, rather than judicial intervention, is often the key deterrent. The global patterns suggest that Indonesia’s proposed amendments may not aim to improve governance but rather consolidate power, exemplifying Landau’s concept of abusive constitutionalism. 2.2 SEA as a Case Study: Current Constitutional Proposals This section examines the largest country of Southeastern Asia, that or RI's proposed constitutional amendments, specifically the reintroduction of the National Guidelines (PPHN) and the extension of the presidential term, highlighting their potential to reshape the country's political landscape. While these proposals are framed as governance and stability enhancements, they raise concerns about democratic principles and the risk of power consolidation. While Article 37 provides a structured framework for constitutional amendments, it centralizes power within the People’s Consultative Assembly (MPR), raising concerns about potential abuse. The MPR could prioritize the interests of the ruling party, potentially undermining democratic accountability. Key concerns include: Reintroduction of the PPHN: This could centralize policy control under the People’s Consultative Assembly (MPR), weakening the independence of other state institutions. Presidential Term Extension: Extending the presidency to three terms risks eroding safeguards against power personalization and weakening democratic consolidation. Though Article 37 legitimizes the amendment process, it also reveals vulnerabilities where mechanisms intended to enable constitutional change can be exploited for undemocratic purposes. This aligns with global trends in abusive constitutionalism, where amendment processes are used to entrench power rather than strengthen democracy. The subsequent analysis will assess whether these proposals represent genuine reforms or potential abuses. 2.3 The Role of the Cult of Personality in Consolidating Power The cult of personality is a political strategy where leaders create a heroic and idealized image to centralize authority, often undermining institutional governance. Personalization of power centralizes decision-making, undermining institutional integrity and democratic norms. While it may offer short-term stability, it often results in volatile governance. A comparative analysis of China, Russia, and Turkey illustrates how personalization of power influences governance and constitutional changes. In China,Xi Jinping has constructed a cult of personality through state propaganda, portraying himself as indispensable to China's future. The removal of presidential term limits in 2018 marked a significant step toward consolidating indefinite rule, shifting governance from a collective leadership model to a centralized and personalized system. This strengthens Xi’s authority but risks long-term instability. Similarly, Vladimir Putin has cultivated a strongman image tied to Russia's global resurgence. Constitutional changes in 2020 reset term limits, allowing him to stay in power until 2036. Unlike China, Russia maintains a façade of democratic institutions, which are systematically weakened to ensure control. In Turkey, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan has used populist rhetoric to reshape governance. The 2017 constitutional referendum transitioned Turkey from a parliamentary to a Semi-Presidential system (of the French type), granting Erdoğan extensive executive powers while eroding judicial and legislative independence. His leadership demonstrates how personalization can align institutional frameworks with individual authority. All three leaders use propaganda, legalistic and legal mechanism of constitutional amendments, and weakened institutional checks to consolidate power. However, their methods differ: China relies on institutional propaganda, Russia undermines democratic processes while maintaining a democratic façade, and Turkey invokes populist narratives. While Indonesia faces some risk of developing a cult of personality under a charismatic leader like President Prabowo Subianto, its democratic safeguards act as barriers. The multi-party system, decentralized governance, and two-term presidential limit reduce the risk of power concentration. Additionally, Indonesia's historical experience with Suharto’s authoritarian regime has fostered societal resistance to personalization of power. However, threats like media control, weakened institutions, or populist appeals remain, making vigilance and reform essential for preserving democracy. 2.4 Abusive Constitutionalism: Detection and Prevention The personalization of power, as observed in China, Russia, and Turkey, often manifests through constitutional amendments that consolidate authority. To counteract such trends, it is essential to explore mechanisms that protect constitutional integrity and democratic principles from being abused—a concern that resonates with Indonesia's ongoing constitutional debates. Abusive constitutionalism, where leaders manipulate constitutional amendments to entrench their power, poses a significant threat to democratic integrity. Lessons from India, Colombia, and Venezuela highlight strategies to prevent such practices, focusing on eternity clauses, the basic structure doctrine, and civil society involvement. These mechanisms aim to protect the constitution’s fundamental principles from being jeopardized by constitutional amendments. Eternity Clauses Certain core democratic principles, like executive power limitations, should be enshrined as unalterable. For example, Colombia used eternity clauses to block amendments extending presidential terms, with civil society and courts preserving institutional integrity. Likewise, Indonesia’s constitution already includes immutable clauses (e.g., protecting the unitary state), but clauses related to term limits and the balance of powers should also be safeguarded. Basic Structure Doctrine This doctrine, pioneered in India, ensures that fundamental constitutional principles cannot be amended. In Kesavananda Bharati v. State of Kerala (1973), India’s Supreme Court ruled that constitutional amendments cannot alter the constitution's core framework. Indonesia’s judiciary could adopt similar judicial review mechanisms to block amendments concentrating power in the presidency or weakening checks and balances. Civil Society Active civil society is crucial for resisting constitutional abuses. Public pressure and grassroots activism can expose and challenge manipulative amendments. For example, Venezuela’s failure to maintain an independent judiciary or robust civil society allowed repeated amendments that eroded democracy under Hugo Chávez. In contrast, Colombia and India demonstrate how civil society and judicial action can resist overreach. Indonesia’s vibrant civil society and constitutional safeguards have so far resisted elite-driven amendments, such as proposals for term extensions or system changes justified as necessary for stability. However, increasing media control and elite-driven reforms in Indonesia make public engagement and judicial oversight ever more crucial to prevent potential abuses of democratic principles. Summary and outlook This analysis highlights the risks posed by selected countries’ proposed constitutional amendments, which aim to strengthen the executive branch through measures like extending presidential terms and reintroducing the PPHN of largest country in SEA. These changes mirror trends in Russia, Turkey, and China, where centralizing power fosters a cult of personality, erodes institutional independence, and undermines democratic principles. The amendments could diminish democratic accountability, weaken institutional safeguards, and pave the way for authoritarian rule by concentrating power among political elites. To counteract such risks, these countries must strengthen checks and balances, adopt mechanisms like eternity clauses and the basic structure doctrine, and ensure robust civil society engagement in constitutional processes. A political culture emphasizing pluralism, transparency, and institutional independence is imperative to preserving democratic values and preventing the personalization of power. The analysis concludes that while constitutional reforms may be justified as necessary for progress, history shows their potential to consolidate power and erode democracy, emphasizing the importance of preventive measures against authoritarianism.

Trump’s Ukraine Plan – Analysis	The Russian-Ukrainian war, which began with the annexation of Crimea in 2014 and escalated into a full-scale conflict in 2022, has caused immense suffering for countless individuals and devastated entire communities. Economically, Ukraine has incurred losses exceeding $500 billion, according to the World Bank. Addressing this ongoing crisis requires more than political manoeuvring; it demands a compassionate, innovative, and multifaceted strategy that incorporates diplomacy, economic recovery, and international collaboration. Donald Trump's proposed approach, based on his well-known deal-making philosophy, aims to bridge divides and rebuild lives through direct negotiations, conditional economic sanctions, demilitarized zones, peacekeeping operations, and energy independence. While his strategy offers a pragmatic path to ending the conflict, it faces significant challenges. This essay explores the potential of Trump’s proposal, acknowledges its complexities, and argues that careful execution could foster lasting peace and hope for Ukraine’s future. At the core of Trump’s plan is the initiation of direct peace talks between Russian President Vladimir Putin and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, mediated by Trump or another neutral actor. This direct engagement highlights the urgency of ending the war and echoes Trump’s past diplomatic successes, such as the Abraham Accords, which normalized relations between Israel and several Arab nations. These accords demonstrate the power of personal diplomacy in resolving entrenched conflicts. Historical parallels, including the Camp David Accords of 1978, further illustrate how leader-to-leader negotiations can pave the way for peace. However, the personal animosity and mistrust between Putin and Zelenskyy complicate this proposal. Nevertheless, U.S.-brokered talks, framed with trust-building measures, could lead to immediate ceasefires, prisoner exchanges, and humanitarian aid agreements, offering a glimmer of hope to those caught in the crossfire. Economic sanctions are a critical pillar of Trump’s strategy. He envisions sanctions as both a carrot and a stick—easing them conditionally in exchange for Russian withdrawals and adherence to ceasefire agreements while tightening them if violations occur. Sanctions have already shown their effectiveness, as evidenced by Russia’s 2.2% GDP contraction in 2022 and the freezing of $300 billion in foreign reserves. However, sanctions alone cannot compel peace. If poorly managed, they risk entrenching hostilities or appearing to reward aggression. Still, conditional easing tied to verifiable steps toward de-escalation could incentivize compliance and open avenues for trust. The challenge lies in balancing accountability with the flexibility needed to encourage diplomatic progress. Another cornerstone of Trump’s plan is the establishment of a demilitarized zone (DMZ) in contested regions like Donbas. A DMZ could serve as a buffer, reducing the risk of accidental escalations and providing space for dialogue. The Korean DMZ, established in 1953, exemplifies how such arrangements can prevent further violence. However, defining acceptable boundaries is fraught with difficulties, especially as Ukraine insists on reclaiming sovereignty over all its territories. International monitoring, possibly through peacekeeping operations, is essential to enforce such an agreement and protect civilians, ensuring the DMZ does not become a flashpoint for renewed tensions. Peacekeeping forces are another vital element of Trump’s proposal. Neutral missions, potentially led by NATO or UN coalitions, could oversee ceasefires, monitor DMZs, and facilitate humanitarian aid. Past successes, such as NATO’s interventions in Bosnia (1995) and Kosovo (1999), highlight how coordinated peacekeeping efforts can stabilize war-torn regions. However, Russia’s strong opposition to NATO's involvement complicates this approach, necessitating creative solutions, such as involving non-NATO actors or neutral countries. Ensuring impartiality while maintaining operational strength will require nuanced diplomacy and unwavering international commitment. Territorial disputes over Crimea and Donbas remain some of the most contentious aspects of the war. Trump’s plan proposes negotiating autonomy agreements for these regions, seeking a compromise that balances Ukraine’s sovereignty with Russia’s security concerns. Yet, these proposals face resistance from both sides. Ukrainian leaders and citizens, motivated by their resilience and sacrifices, view territorial concessions as unacceptable. Conversely, Russia’s insistence on legitimizing its annexations underscores deep-rooted grievances and power dynamics. Addressing these disputes requires empathy for the pain and loss experienced on all sides while crafting fair and practical solutions. Economic reconstruction is pivotal to the strategy. Trump envisions leveraging international financial institutions like the IMF and World Bank to rebuild Ukraine’s infrastructure and revitalize its economy, thereby reducing long-term vulnerabilities. Comparisons to the Marshall Plan, which aided Europe’s recovery after World War II, emphasize the transformative potential of coordinated aid. Successful implementation hinges on transparency, accountability, and collaboration among donor nations. Ensuring that funds reach the communities most affected by the war—particularly displaced families and businesses—will be key to fostering trust and stability. Energy security is another integral aspect of Trump’s proposal. The war has revealed Europe’s dependence on Russian gas, with 40% of its imports sourced from Russia in 2021 (International Energy Agency). Trump’s strategy envisions enhancing Europe’s energy independence through increased U.S. LNG exports and investments in renewable energy infrastructure. While this shift could diminish Russia’s economic leverage, transitioning to alternative energy sources requires significant investment and time. Nonetheless, such measures could help Europe protect itself from future geopolitical crises, illustrating the intersection of energy policy and national security. Despite its potential, Trump’s plan faces profound challenges. The deep mistrust between Russia and Ukraine, exacerbated by years of propaganda and violence, complicates negotiations. Unresolved territorial disputes prevent either side from making significant concessions. The risk of failed ceasefires or provocations—whether deliberate or accidental—further undermines confidence in a lasting resolution. Geopolitical tensions, particularly between NATO and Russia, add another layer of complexity, alongside the humanitarian challenges of addressing the needs of over eight million displaced Ukrainians. Any sustainable solution must prioritize the voices and well-being of those most affected by the war’s devastation. In light of these obstacles, implementing Trump’s plan should commence with confidence-building measures such as localized ceasefires, humanitarian aid corridors, and prisoner exchanges. Neutral mediators, including countries unaffiliated with NATO or Russia, could play a crucial role in facilitating dialogue and reducing perceptions of bias. Robust verification mechanisms—overseen by trusted international organizations—would be essential to ensure accountability and transparency. Finally, the international community must remain steadfast in its support, providing not only financial aid but also moral solidarity to those enduring the conflict’s daily realities. In conclusion, Trump’s plan to end the Russian-Ukrainian war provides a framework grounded in pragmatic diplomacy, economic incentives, and international collaboration. By prioritizing human dignity and addressing the immediate needs of those most affected, this strategy aims to transform the current stalemate into a pathway for hope and healing. While significant obstacles remain, the plan’s multifaceted approach highlights the importance of empathy, resilience, and a shared commitment to peace. If implemented with care and compassion, it has the potential to not only end the war but also lay the foundation for a stable and secure future for Ukraine and its people.

Year-End Review Of India’s Neighborhood Policy And Prospects In 2...	Geopolitical challenges and opportunities for India in 2025 New Delhi will have to hone its diplomacy to foresee and meet the challenges that might arise in its geopolitical domain. Events in 2024 have given a foretaste of what might be expected. The year 2025 is expected to pose significant challenges and also offer equally significant opportunities to India in its bid for dominance over its geopolitical domain. Countries that immediately matter to India are Nepal, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, the Maldives and also Myanmar. Indo-US, Sino-Indian, and Sino-US relations will also have a bearing on India's prospects in the region. South Asia 2024, which is on its last legs, has given a foretaste of what is to come. There were significant changes in the environment. The pro-Indian Sheikh Hasina regime in Bangladesh was toppled in August by a mass movement which New Delhi neither anticipated nor handled skilfully. It took New Delhi five excruciating months to send Foreign Secretary Vikram Misri to mend fences with the Interim Government led by Nobel Laureate Dr. Muhammad Yunus. Misri's foray smoothened ruffled feathers in Bangladesh. But the communal passions whipped up in India over the alleged atrocities against Hindus in Bangladesh, are not helping the restoration of full normalcy. In Sri Lanka, a leftist and avowedly nationalistic political party, the Janatha Vimukth Peramuna (JVP), was swept to power creating apprehensions in New Delhi. But the Indian Establishment quickly moved in with offers of grant projects to wean the rulers away from China, the JVP's traditional ally. As of now, India-Sri Lanka relations are on an even keel with prospects of their remaining so looking good. The recent State Visit of Sri Lankan President Anura Kumara Dissanayake showcased a spirit of mutual understanding. Projects which were controversial were either been dropped or put on the backburner or left for further discussions. In the Maldives, a pro-China and anti-Indian regime led by President Mohamad Muizzu was tamed by judiciously using the stick and the carrot. But the Muizzu regime could become an embarrassment if its popularity, already showing signs of waning, declines further due to missteps in managing the economy and the public disenchantment that could intensify. Therefore, New Delhi will have to keep a close tab on the goings on in the Mizzu administration and also on the public sentiment. Nepal has always been a problem for India because of the dominance of its communist parties with their pro-China proclivities. The Modi regime's bid to promote Hindu nationalism in a country which is largely communistic in orientation and New Delhi's tendency to use strong arm methods to subdue belligerent Nepalese politicians had backfired in the past. Continuing with his habitual anti-Indian line, the current Nepalese Prime Minister, K.P.Sharma Oli, visited Beijing recently creating an apprehension in New Delhi about possible Chinese moves in Nepal. Myanmar, always unstable, is on the boil again with armed rebel tribal groups in the North bordering India gaining dominance over troops of the junta in power at Yangon. India has been supporting the junta consistently despite the latter's persecution of democrats, the Christian non-Bamar tribal groups, and the Muslim Rohingyas in the norther districts bordering North-East India. Since China had a hold on the junta, India had thought it fit to also cultivate the junta rather than the tribal rebels and the persecuted democratic groups. In recent times, the junta has been suffering reverses against the rebel armies in areas bordering India, triggering a minor refugee influx into India's North Eastern States, populated by kindred Christian tribes. If the situation in North Myanmar worsens, the influx could become a flood, destabilizing India's North East, in which, one of the States, Manipur, has been burning for months due to a conflict between the Hindu Meities and Christian Kukis. United States The ascent of maverick Donald Trump in US politics poses its own unpredictable challenges for India. Trump's reported moves to meet China's X Jinping and probably strike a deal with him, should worry India as India has for long been counting on US technological and intelligence inputs to counter China's threatening moves on the Sino-Indian border. There have been reports saying that the US and China have signed an agreement on scientific cooperation and that Trump had invited Xi to attend his inauguration as US President in January. Though Trump has made overtures to Modi calling him a friend, there is no knowing if he would actually give concessions to India on trade and tariffs and also on visas and immigration. 2024 saw an unprecedented Indo-US face off over the cross-boundary extra-judicial killing of a Canadian citizen of Indian origin in Canada and an alleged plot to kill an American citizen of Indian origin in the US by Indian intelligence agents. These cases remain putting India-US relations under a strain. Close on the heels of these unusual developments, came the indictment of the Indian tycoon and Modi acolyte, Gautam Adani, by a US court for alleged attempts to bribe Indian officials to get lucrative energy projects using the money of US investors. Whether the Trump Administration will help the Modi regime to pull its chestnuts out of the fire for the sake of India-US strategic cooperation is yet to be seen. China Sensing a downturn in its relations with the US, New Delhi warmed up to the long-time adversary, China. Modi and Xi broke the ice by talking on the side lines of the BRICS summit in Kazan (Russa) in October. India's Economic Advisor, said that India should welcome Chinese investment in some sectors to increase exports. More recently, the Indian and Chinese military agreed on patrolling rights on the Sino-Indian border in East Ladakh. It is now reported that China and India will revive the periodical talks between their Special Representatives. These were suspended due to military face offs on the border. Media reports said that in January, India's Special Representative and National Security Advisor, Ajit Doval, will fly to Beijing to meet his Chinese counterpart, Foreign Minister Wang Yi to take forward the talks on the border dispute and other outstanding issues. An India-China thaw appears to be on the cards, at least for now.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWet_9MfW6XVCYfjrwjYW0C_	2024-12-18T16:23:04-08:00	
Feeding Chaos: Israel Cripples Syria’s Defence – OpEd	The justifications are always the same. We are moving into territory for security reasons. We are creating a temporary buffer zone from which tactical advantage can be gained against potential dangers. Then, over time, these buffers become strategic fixtures, de facto real estate seizures and annexations. Israel now finds itself in what was a United Nations-patrolled buffer zone on the Golan Heights, and Turkey is established in parts of northern Syria, keeping a watchful eye on Kurdish militants. Since October 7 last year, Israel’s response to the attacks by Hamas has been one of sledgehammers and chisels, a conscious attempt to broaden the conflict beyond its Palestinian confines to targeting the Lebanese militia group Hezbollah and its sponsor, Iran. In doing so, Israel has played an increasingly destructive role in Syria, where Hezbollah targets and Iranian supply lines have been struck with regularity. The move is intended to cripple Teheran’s Axis of Resistance, a patchwork of Shia militias spanning Iraq, Yemen, Lebanon and Syria. With the collapse of Bashar al-Assad in Syria, Israel intends further disruption. This marks a departure from a policy it had maintained with Assad for some years, one that permitted him and the Syrian Arab Army to operate without molestation subject to one stern caveat: that Hezbollah and, by virtue of that Iran’s influence, could also be contained. This point is made in documents recently unearthed by the New Lines magazine, one that directly involved a channel of communication between an Israeli operative code-named 'Mousa' (Mosses) and the Syrian Defence Minister Lt. Gen. Ali Mahmoud Abbas. A message dated May 17, 2023 outlines Israel’s indignation at an incident involving the firing of three rockets on Israel from the Golan Heights, an action purportedly instructed by Khaled Meshaal and Saleh al-Arouri of Hamas. 'Lately, because of Quds Day and Flag March, we are observing Palestinian activities on your land […] We warn you of the prospect of any activity of these parties on your territory and we demand you to stop any [Iranian] preparations for the use of these forces on your territory – you’re responsible for what is happening in Syria.' The collapse of Assad’s rule, spearheaded by Hayat Tahrir Al-Sham (HTS), has brought Israeli intentions to the fore. The group’s leader, Mohammed al-Julani, has made previous mutterings favouring the Hamas October 7 attacks and expressing solidarity with the Palestinian cause. Since then, al-Julani has expressed no desire to do battle 'with Israel or anyone else and we will not let Syria be used as launchpad for attacks', promised to protect minority rights and disband rebel groups for incorporation into the Ministry of Defence, and dissembled on whether the new administration would be focused on Islamic law. On December 10, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu made fairly redundant remarks that his government had no intention meddling in Syria’s internal affairs, only to warn Assad’s successors that any move allowing 'Iran to re-establish itself in Syria or allows the transfer of Iranian weapons or any other weapons to Hezbollah, or attacks us – we will respond forcefully and we will exact a heavy price from it.' Defence Minister Israel Katz similarly warned Syria’s triumphant rebel forces that 'whoever follows in Assad’s footsteps will end up like Assad did. We don’t allow an extremist Islamic terror entity to act against Israel from beyond its borders… we will do anything to remove the threat.' Since Assad’s fleeing on December 7, Israel’s air force has made it a priority to destroy the military means of any successor regime in Damascus, citing concerns that material would fall into the hands of undesirable jihadists. Over December 10 and 11, 350 strikes were conducted on anti-aircraft batteries, airfields, weapons production sites including chemical weapons, combat aircraft and missiles (Scud, cruise, coast-to-sea and air-defence varieties) in Damascus, Homs, Tartus, Latakia and Palmyra. 'I authorised the air force to bomb strategic military capabilities left by the Syrian army,' reasoned Netanyahu, 'so that they would not fall into the hands of the jihadists.' A bold estimate from the IDF about the operation described as 'Bashan Arrow', was that it had destroyed approximately 70-80% of the strategic military capabilities of Assad’s Syrian Arab Army. As of December 16, the total number of strikes Israel has conducted on Syrian territory has reached 473. For any advocate of stability, which would require some measure of military capability, this could hardly augur well. Over the course of this glut of sorties, Israeli troops have militarised the demilitarised zone inside Syria created in the aftermath of the 1973 Arab-Israeli War, including Mount Hermon, a site overlooking Damascus. The menacing move on Syrian territory was sanitised by IDF military spokesperson Colonel Nadav Shoshani: 'IDF forces are not advancing towards Damascus. This is not something we are doing or pursuing in any way.' Both the Beirut-based Mayadeen TV, and the UK-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights have taken the gloss off such assessments, stating that the IDF has moved within 16 miles of the Syrian capital. Crippling the infrastructure of the state that awaits the fledgling ruling parties in Syria, who can only count themselves as a ragtag transitional entity at this point, stirs an already turbulent, precarious situation. The very scenario which Netanyahu and his planners wish to avoid, and Assad sought to prevent, may well be realised.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWet_9MfW6XVCVSImCsqq4-8	2024-12-18T16:16:39-08:00	
Malaysians Guilty Of Roles In 2002 Bali Bombings Released From Gu...	By Muzliza Mustafa Two Malaysians who pleaded guilty for their roles in the 2002 Bali bombings were in their government’s custody after the United States announced their repatriation from the military prison at Guantanamo Bay, where they were locked up for 18 years. The duo, Mohammed Farik bin Amin and Mohammed Nazir bin Lep, were turned over to Malaysian authorities, according to a statement from the home ministry in Kuala Lumpur. 'The unity government has received from the United States government the two Malaysian nationals, Mohammed Farik bin Amin and Mohammed Nazir bin Lep, who were in prison since 2006 at the Guantanamo Bay Detention Camp on the principle of human rights and support for universal justice,' the ministry said in a statement Wednesday. However, it did not mention whether the two would be sent to a Malaysian prison upon being repatriated from the U.S. naval base in Cuba. In January, a U.S. military judge at Guantanamo Bay sentenced bin Amin and bin Lep to five more years in prison after they pleaded guilty to five charges connected to their supporting roles in twin bombings that killed 202 people in October 2002 – Indonesia’s deadliest-ever terror attack. Their repatriation this week was made in secret and information was released to their lawyers at the last minute. Lawyer Brian Bouffard said his client, bin Lep, was a changed man and ready to be reunited with his family. Their repatriation this week was made in secret and information was released to their lawyers at the last minute. 'It is now more than two decades since Nazir was taken. He has grown in that time, and is today a man of peace who will live the remainder of his life in peace. We are grateful to everyone, in Malaysia and in the U.S., who understood that it was time to bring Nazir home,' Bouffard said in a text message to BenarNews. In its own statement, the U.S. Defense Department said both men had provided testimony before their departure against Indonesian Encep Nurjaman (Hambali) the alleged mastermind of 'al-Qaeda-affiliated attacks on nightclubs in Bali, Indonesia, in 2002, and the attack on the J.W. Marriott Hotel in Jakarta, Indonesia, in 2003.' Hambali is expected to stand trial before a military court at Guantanamo Bay on similar charges against him. As part of their plea agreements, bin Amin and bin Lep could not return to the United States for any reason, making it necessary for them to testify before leaving, Bouffard said. Arrested in Thailand in 2003, bin Amin and bin Lep were held at a CIA black site before being transferred to Cuba in 2006. They pleaded guilty in January to murder, conspiracy and three other charges linked to the Bali bombing that killed over 200 people. Previously, a source who requested anonymity for privacy concerns, told BenarNews that both were likely to be sent home before U.S. President-elect Donald Trump’s inauguration on Jan. 20. 'There has been concern following Trump’s victory in the U.S. election. But we leave it to the government and the authority to work on it. Our hope is for him to be released soon,' the source said. We love him Relatives of bin Lep were elated that he is back in Malaysia. Professing his love for his younger brother, Najib Lep, 60, said he had already made plans to reintegrate him back into the society. 'We love him. We will take care of him and his welfare when he returns to us,' Najib told BenarNews. 'For now, we have yet to receive any information from the Malaysian authorities. What we’ve got so far is just details from the media. Nevertheless, we cannot be more happy and grateful to Allah.' A source, who requested anonymity to ensure the safety of bin Amin’s family, said they were ready to welcome him home. 'Mohammed Farik has expressed his desire to care for his ailing parents upon return. His siblings have prepared a place for him to stay and will provide other necessary assistance for him. It will take time to readjust as he has been away from home for more than 20 years.'The family is not ready to speak to the press and is waiting for clearance to meet Mohammed Farik,' the source told BenarNews.Bin Amin’s parents, ages 82 and 88, had been made aware of his return. Lawyer Christine Funk said she and other members of bin Amin’s legal team were overjoyed by the prospect of their client being back in Malaysia. 'Mr. bin Amin said it best at his sentencing, when he told the Commission, the prosecution, the victim family members, and the observers, ‘Instead of trying to change the world, I can only change myself. And over the past 20 years, I have changed. I am not an angry young man anymore. I am a reformed man,’' Funk said in a statement to BenarNews, adding he planned to 'go forward as a good and peaceful Muslim.' Funk said the other members are confident that bin Amin will succeed. Malaysian National Police Chief Razarudin Husain said the pair were to be evaluated and rehabilitated before being reintegrated into society, adding 'everyone deserves a second chance. 'Both individuals are in good and healthy condition and feel blessed that they are able to return home and finally reunite with their family,' he said in a statement about bin Amin and bin Lep. 'Both showed a positive attitude and openness toward the evaluation process and rehabilitation and have expressed their high commitment to become progressive members of society.' Congress notified last month Leading up to their release, U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin notified Congress on Nov.14 'of his intent to repatriate' the Malaysians 'and, in consultation with our partners in Malaysia, we completed the requirements for responsible transfer,' the statement from the Pentagon said. A 30-day notice must be filed before such transfers can occur. Court documents state that beginning at the end of 2001, 'including the periods before, during, and after the October 12, 2002, Bali bombings,' bin Lep and bin Amin helped Hambali 'transfer money for operations, and obtain and store items such as fraudulent identification documents, weapons and instructions on how to make bombs.' With the transfer, the number of detainees at Guantanamo Bay has been reduced to 27, the Pentagon said.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWet_9MfW6XVCfx3o3vNCgAV	2024-12-18T16:10:02-08:00	
Europe Needs A Coordinated Approach To Industrial Policy – Analys...	Industrial policy is having a moment in Europe, as countries increasingly turn to sectoral policy interventions to address the challenges of geopolitical fragmentation and economic security, enhance productivity, and accelerate the green transition. State aid spending by European Union countries has tripled in the last decade, reaching 1.5 percent of GDP. Much of this aid flowed into green technologies and energy efficiency, with major economies like France, Germany, Italy, and Spain driving the surge. As the recent report from Mario Draghi suggests, there is a growing consensus that even more such spending is necessary to spur growth. But before rushing ahead, it is important to take stock. A new IMF working paper shows that the success of industrial policy depends not just on how much is spent, but on spending it well: targeting the right priorities and avoiding costly missteps. When poorly designed and targeted, industrial policies tend to fail. Good intentions aren’t enough Under the right circumstances, industrial policy can deliver tangible economic gains and strengthen economic resilience. By being focused on addressing market failures—such as by fostering innovation in sectors with knowledge spillovers (think of green technology) or enabling regional clustering (think of Silicon Valley)—it can boost productivity and incomes. However, even the best-intentioned policies can backfire if poorly coordinated. Powerful interventions, such as subsidies or tax breaks, that expand production and lower costs in a particular sector in one country will have the opposite effect in another, undermining comparative advantages and creating inefficiencies. Model simulations offer cautionary lessons. Unilateral industrial policies are a losing strategy for most EU countries, given their openness to trade. Without careful design, unilateral policies risk triggering powerful spillovers and spillbacks across the region that outweigh their benefits. As another IMF working paper shows, this is already a concern: European state aid benefits recipient firms but is often detrimental to others. Why coordination matters The solution is clear: Europe’s industrial policies need a unified, coordinated framework. When countries align their efforts, the benefits of industrial policy can outweigh the costs. Coordinated policies preserve the gains from trade, ensure a level playing field, and make full use of the EU’s single market. Simulations underscore this point. In a scenario where the EU acts as an integrated region and adopts a well-targeted industrial policy, better outcomes are obtained than under fragmented, country-specific approaches. Coordination prevents costly distortions of production patterns and trade prices between EU countries. As workers and firms are assumed to move freely across the single market, this can maximize the policy’s benefits. Importantly, coordination can help cushion any adverse impact on regions that might otherwise lose out, including through potential use of intra-EU fiscal transfers, fostering solidarity across the bloc. Building a better framework Existing EU state aid rules provide a starting point but fall short of what is needed to guide strategic industrial policies across Europe. Better data sharing and unified programs could enhance transparency and trust among member states. A centralized decision-making body could streamline priorities and better allocate resources to areas of mutual benefit. The creation of the Airbus venture almost half a century ago showed that coordination at scale can work: this collaborative, multi-country initiative combined resources and expertise to create a globally competitive player. Similar efforts could unlock the potential of Europe’s green and tech transitions. Deeper integration is an essential part of the equation. A stronger single market for goods, services, and capital with more labor mobility would amplify the effectiveness of industrial policies, allowing firms to scale up (see also Regional Economic Outlook for Europe, October 2024). An ambitious EU budget or centralized fiscal capacity could further support shared priorities. Europe and beyond Europe’s industrial policies have global implications. Subsidies and trade adjustments don’t stop at the EU’s borders, underscoring the need for engagement with multilateral fora such as the World Trade Organization. The right industrial policies can help where markets fall short. By embracing coordination and integration, the EU can ensure its policies foster growth, innovation, and productivity—while avoiding costly pitfalls. —This article is based on the IMF Working Paper 'Industrial Policy in Europe: A Single Market Approach', by A.

INS Nirdeshak: A Quiet Enabler Of India’s Maritime Strategy In Th...	Geopolitical competition has deepened across the Indo-Pacific. Amid this, India is quietly advancing its maritime capabilities to consolidate its role as a regional stabiliser. On December 18, 2024, the Indian Navy will commission INS Nirdeshak, the second of four Survey Vessel Large (SVL) ships, in Visakhapatnam. The commissioning of a hydrographic survey vessel might seem low on the spectrum of naval power projection. However, INS Nirdeshak marks a key shift in how India prepares for the evolving challenges of a contested Indo-Pacific theatre. Built indigenously in Kolkata by Garden Reach Shipbuilders & Engineers (GRSE), INS Nirdeshak is more than a support ship— it is a strategic enabler, a force multiplier, and an understated symbol of India’s growing technological prowess and maritime aspirations. Its induction reinforces New Delhi’s bid to assert itself as a key maritime power while aligning with its broader Security and Growth for All in the Region (SAGAR) policy. The Overlooked Strategic Utility of Hydrographic Survey Ships While aircraft carriers and frigates often dominate headlines, hydrographic survey vessels like INS Nirdeshak are vital to maritime dominance in the 21st century. These ships provide the foundation upon which naval operations rest— accurate undersea mapping, navigational safety, and resource exploration. For India, a nation deeply invested in safeguarding the strategic choke points of the Indian Ocean Region (IOR), hydrographic intelligence is indispensable. With a displacement of 3,800 tonnes and a length of 110 meters, INS Nirdeshak is equipped with cutting-edge hydrographic and oceanographic survey systems, sub-surface sensors, and satellite-based navigation tools. These technologies enable the vessel to map coastal zones, deep-sea areas, and undersea topographies with unmatched precision. This capability comes at a critical juncture. The IOR, once regarded as a largely stable waterway, is now a hotspot of power competition, driven by China’s increasing naval activity. Beijing’s research vessels— often doubling as intelligence-gathering platforms— have intensified their presence, raising concerns over undersea surveillance and resource exploitation. INS Nirdeshak, therefore, enhances India’s ability to monitor its own waters while ensuring that maritime data remains a strategic asset under its control. Indigenisation: Advancing Self-Reliance and Naval Diplomacy The commissioning of INS Nirdeshak carries another, equally significant message— India’s commitment to self-reliance under its Aatmanirbhar Bharat (Self-Reliant India) initiative. Over four-fifths (80%) of the vessel’s components have been sourced domestically, including the indigenously developed DMR 249A steel that forms its hull. Indian firms like BEL, BHEL, Avantel, and ECIL have supplied the vessel’s advanced communication and positioning systems, demonstrating a remarkable leap in India’s defence-industrial capabilities. Regarding global outreach, India positions itself as a potential exporter of cost-effective and versatile maritime solutions by showcasing its ability to produce advanced naval platforms domestically. For other nations in the Indo-Pacific— particularly smaller ones Southeast Asia and Africa— India’s shipbuilding expertise could serve as an attractive alternative to Chinese offerings. Enhancing Maritime Domain Awareness in the Indo-Pacific The deployment of INS Nirdeshak will significantly augment India’s Maritime Domain Awareness (MDA) capabilities. As the IOR becomes increasingly contested, the need for accurate seabed data, navigational routes, and undersea surveillance has never been greater. The vessel will enable India to identify strategic undersea chokepoints, resource clusters, and submarine operating areas by conducting comprehensive hydrographic surveys. This capability aligns with India’s role as a regional net security provider. Through initiatives like the Information Fusion Centre – Indian Ocean Region (IFC-IOR), India shares maritime data with partner nations to improve regional security. INS Nirdeshak will feed into this information network, allowing India to enhance its operational preparedness while supporting regional allies. India’s leadership in hydrographic capabilities also has a soft power dimension. For decades, the Indian Navy has assisted smaller coastal states with hydrographic surveys, fostering goodwill and strengthening bilateral ties. A Strategic Signal Amid Growing Competition INS Nirdeshak’s induction is also symbolic in light of China’s aggressive forays into the Indian Ocean. China’s dual-use 'research' vessels, like the Yuan Wang and Xiang Yang Hong series, have sparked concerns about espionage and seabed mapping in waters close to India. By commissioning advanced survey ships like INS Nirdeshak, India is signalling its intent to monitor and secure its maritime backyard. The vessel’s ability to stay at sea for over 25 days, combined with its advanced sensors and navigation systems, ensures that India’s undersea intelligence-gathering capabilities remain a step ahead. In the era of undersea warfare, where submarines and unmanned vehicles dominate naval strategies, survey ships are an often overlooked yet vital asset. Building Toward 2047: A Future-Ready Indian Navy INS Nirdeshak is part of a larger modernisation strategy that aims to make the Indian Navy a Fully Aatmanirbhar Force by 2047. India’s emphasis on domestic shipbuilding reflects its understanding of how defense autonomy translates into strategic strength. The SVL project, which includes the upcoming sister ships Ichhak and Sanshodhan, highlights India’s ability to design and construct complex naval platforms with minimal foreign input. As India prepares to assume a greater leadership role in the Indo-Pacific, investments in hydrographic capability, maritime domain awareness, and regional partnerships will define its strategy. INS Nirdeshak is not just a vessel— it is a quiet but powerful enabler of India’s maritime future. Charting New Waters In a region where naval power is increasingly measured by technological sophistication and information dominance, the commissioning of INS Nirdeshak marks a decisive step forward for India. Beyond its hydrographic role, the vessel symbolises India’s growing capacity to safeguard its maritime interests, responsibly project power, and stabilise the Indo-Pacific. For the broader Eurasian strategic community, INS Nirdeshak’s induction serves as a timely reminder that maritime dominance is not just about ships armed with missiles but also the vessels that quietly map, monitor, and secure the seas.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWe6dX7MBfuzb_S0WWb4ToUR	2024-12-17T17:17:18-08:00	
Political Instability In South Korea Should Lead To Questions Abo...	In South Korea, only a democracy since 1987, a 'reverse January 6' has happened. Instead of storming the legislative building to undermine democracy and interfere with the results of a free and fair election—as in the United States and Brazil—protesters helped South Korean lawmakers swarm past armed troops to end President Yoon Suk Yeol’s short-lived attempt at martial law. It is hoped the perpetrator of this power grab to exterminate the young democracy will be evicted, in one way or another, from office in short order. In any case, such political instability should raise questions about the continued stationing of 30,000 U.S. troops on South Korean soil. They may have been needed after the Korean War (1950-1953) to prevent North Korea from invading the then-poor South Korea again. However, South Korea has undergone an economic miracle in the ensuing seven decades while the communist and chronically destitute North Korea has undergone periodic famines. South Korea now has a GDP that is 60 times that of the North and should be able to defend itself. Yet, South Korea routinely underspends on its military because it has a shield of U.S. nuclear and conventional weapons protecting it. The United States, which has a staggering national debt of 36 trillion and rising, must encourage its wealthy allies to make more significant efforts for their defense, as they soon may be pressured to do when Donald Trump takes office. Trump should first announce that over five years, the United States would gradually withdraw all 30,000 troops, which now act as just a tripwire for a massive U.S. intervention if North Korea attacks the South again. During those five years, South Korea would be incentivized to spend more on defense and rapidly upgrade its already capable military forces. Because any North Korean invasion would need to proceed down mountain valleys into the South, it should lessen the difficulty of defending against such an attack. North Korean invasion forces would be very vulnerable to attack from the air in those confined areas as they move South—being caught in a shooting gallery. North Korea has a large, lumbering military, but well-to-do South Korea has, or can buy, much better military technology. Communist North Korea, which has been impoverished by a dysfunctional economy, has trouble doing either. Critics of such a change in U.S. policy argue that the United States turning over more defense responsibilities to South Korea might result in South Korea going nuclear to match North Korean nuclear weapons capabilities. Spanning authoritarian and democratic governments over the decades, South Korea has always been a responsible player internationally, as has Japan. Under Joe Biden, Japan and South Korea—two U.S. allies that have been mutually suspicious of each other because of Japan’s past treatment of South Korea before and during World War II—have now reconciled. If either one of those upstanding countries became nuclear powers to better defend themselves against China and North Korea, it would not be the worst thing that ever happened because they likely would have a deterrent from attack independent of the United States. Also, by giving wealthy South Korea (and maybe Japan) incentives to do more for their defense, U.S. security policy in East Asia could be more flexible. A lower-key U.S. approach to the static defense of South Korea—perhaps as a balancer of last resort in a dire emergency—could allow more U.S. attention to prodding Taiwan to augment its defenses against perhaps a more acute threat from China. Even after withdrawing U.S. forces from South Korea, the United States could arrange a base-access agreement that U.S. military forces could use in any dire regional emergency—for example, during any general war with China. South Korea would certainly have an incentive to agree to such arrangements. Finally, deployed U.S. forces definitely should not get involved in any internal suppression of dissent or violence in South Korea. Such disturbances could find them. In short, South Korea can remain a nation friendly to the United States without 30,000 U.S. troops being stationed there.

US Officials Take Credit For Regime Change In Syria – OpEd	Officials in the Biden administration are taking credit for creating conditions in Syria that enabled opposition forces to overthrow the Syrian government. Now that opposition forces have ousted Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, administration officials are insisting that longstanding U.S. policies, including actions taken by the Biden administration against Assad’s supporters, made the overthrow of the Syrian government possible. Administration officials deny that they aided Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), the U.S.-designated terrorist organization that led the drive to overthrow Assad, but they insist that they facilitated the opposition’s victory, citing years of U.S. efforts to empower the opposition and weaken the Syrian government. U.S. policy 'has led to the situation we’re in today,' State Department Spokesperson Matthew Miller said in a December 9 press briefing, the day after Assad fled the country. It 'was developed during the latter stages of the Obama administration' and 'has largely carried through to this day.' White House Spokesperson John Kirby agreed, giving credit to the president. 'We believe that developments in Syria very much prove the case of President Biden’s assertive foreign policy,' Kirby said in remarks to the press on December 10. U.S. Policy For over a decade, the United States has sought regime change in Syria. Officials in Washington have openly called for an end to the rule of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, the repressive and authoritarian leader who first began ruling Syria in 2000, following decades of rule by his father, Hafez al-Assad. U.S. efforts to oust Assad date back to 2011, when Syria descended into a civil war. As Assad responded to popular uprisings with violent crackdowns, the United States began supporting multiple armed groups, several of which were seeking the overthrow of the Syrian government. The Obama administration designed the initial U.S. strategy to oust Assad. Hoping to avoid 'catastrophic success,' or a situation in which extremists ousted Assad and seized power, the administration decided on a stalemate strategy. The United States provided opposition forces with enough support to keep pressure on Assad but not enough to overthrow him. The administration’s goal was 'a political settlement, a scenario that relies on an eventual stalemate among the warring factions rather than a clear victor,' U.S. officials explained at the time, as reported by The Washington Post. The Obama administration came close to achieving its objectives in 2015, when opposition forces began moving into areas around Damascus. With Assad under growing pressure, it appeared that he might lose his grip on power and be forced to negotiate or surrender. As opposition forces gained momentum, however, Assad received a lifeline from Russia, which intervened to save him. By coming to Assad’s assistance with airstrikes and military support, Russia enabled Assad to turn the tide against the rebels and remain in power. Following Russia’s intervention, the civil war largely settled into stalemate, which left Syria divided into different areas of control. Assad consolidated his control of Damascus and the surrounding areas with support from Russia, Iran, and Hezbollah. Many opposition forces regrouped in northwestern Syria, where they received support from Turkey. Kurdish-led forces, which were separate from the opposition, carved out an autonomous region in northeastern Syria, keeping another part of the country outside of Assad’s control. Keeping Pressure on Assad As the civil war cooled, U.S. officials maintained its strategy of stalemate. Although they believed that Assad had secured his position in Damascus, they remained convinced that they could still pressure him into resigning, primarily by keeping him weakened and denying him a victory. U.S. policies to keep Assad weakened spanned the administrations of Barack Obama, Donald Trump, and Joe Biden. These policies included the diplomatic isolation of Assad, severe economic sanctions on Syria, ongoing military strikes inside Syria, and additional support to opposition groups. With Syria becoming a 'cadaver state,' as an official in the Trump administration described it, U.S. policies also kept the country dismembered. By preventing Assad from regaining control of areas that he had lost in the war, U.S. officials hoped to pressure him into accepting a political transition. U.S. officials focused much of their efforts on the Kurdish-led forces in the northeast, an area that includes strategically important wheat fields and oil reserves. Although the Kurds did not seek to overthrow Assad, wanting instead official recognition for their autonomous region inside Syria, U.S. officials knew they could undermine Assad by keeping northeastern Syria outside his control. At the same time, U.S. officials worked to ensure that opposition forces remained in control of northwestern Syria. Even with the region controlled by HTS, a U.S.-designated terrorist organization, U.S. officials abetted the group’s operations, viewing HTS as 'an asset' and believing it was critical to keeping Syria dismembered. 'I just did everything I could to be able to monitor what they were doing and ensuring that those people who spoke to them knew what our policy was, which was to leave HTS alone,' former U.S. diplomat James Jeffrey acknowledged in a 2021 interview with the PBS program Frontline. Questions about the Biden Administration’s Approach Since the Biden administration entered office in 2021, however, it has been largely quiet about its intentions for Syria. Although the administration appeared to continue the strategy of stalemate, mainly by keeping Assad weakened and Syria dismembered, administration officials rarely expressed a great deal of interest in the country. As administration officials grew quiet, some lawmakers grew suspicious, wondering whether the Biden administration was abandoning the project of ousting Assad. During a 2022 congressional hearing, congressional leaders criticized the administration for creating an impression that it had accepted Assad’s rule. 'I remain concerned this administration has accepted Assad’s rule as a foregone conclusion,' U.S. Senator James Risch (R-ID) remarked. From 2022 to 2023, a number of U.S. allies in the Middle East began moving to restore relations with Assad. In May 2023, Arab leaders welcomed Syria back into the Arab League, ending its suspension from the organization. Officials in the Biden administration criticized the moves, but they did not express any interest in returning to the more volatile dynamics of the civil war. In fact, recent news reports indicate that the Biden administration was working to forge a deal in which Assad cut ties to Iran in exchange for reductions in pressure on his government. This major diplomatic push, which involved the United States and its Gulf allies, preceded the recent armed uprising that ousted Assad, leading to speculation that the Biden administration had been anticipating a future in which the Syrian leader remained in power. Revivals and Surprises After HTS began its offensive in late November 2024, the Biden administration revived a familiar playbook. Resorting to the ideas and tactics of its predecessors, the administration presented HTS’s maneuvers in a manner that fit with a policy of stalemate. In a December 1 interview with CNN, National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan pointed to the stalemate framework by making two basic points. The first was that the Biden administration had concerns about HTS, which Sullivan placed 'at the vanguard' of the uprising. 'We have real concerns about the designs and objectives of that organization,' he said, acknowledging it is a U.S.-designated terrorist organization. His second point was that the Biden administration did not see the actions taken by HTS as particularly worrisome, as they could potentially weaken the Syrian government. 'We don’t cry over the fact that the Assad government, backed by Russia, Iran and Hezbollah, [is] facing certain kinds of pressure,' Sullivan said. Even as administration officials saw advantages to be gained from the stalemate strategy, however, it remained unclear just how much pressure the Biden administration wanted HTS to put on Assad. Once HTS began making rapid gains, officials appeared to grow concerned. 'These are not good folks,' White House Spokesperson John Kirby said on December 2, referring to HTS. Still, some observers indicated that there was a strategic logic to HTS’s moves. Former U.S. official Andrew Tabler, who worked on U.S. policy toward Syria in the Trump administration, suggested at a policy forum hosted by The Washington Institute that the uprising could test Assad’s capabilities. 'They just decided to sort of poke the front lines, so to speak, in a very dramatic way,' Tabler said. Tabler acknowledged that HTS’s uprising revealed significant weaknesses in Assad’s capabilities, but he anticipated that it would take several years to pressure Assad into leaving office. Like many officials in Washington, he saw the offensive as a way to increase pressure on the Syrian government rather than the beginning of the end to Assad’s rule. 'This is a challenge to the regime, but it’s not going to lead to its immediate collapse,' Tabler said. In fact, many U.S. officials did not anticipate that the offensive would lead to a sudden collapse of the Syrian government. Given that Assad had previously survived a comparable challenge in 2015, there were strong beliefs both inside and outside of Washington that Assad and his supporters would continue to repel opposition forces. 'I think the entire international community was surprised to see that the opposition forces moved as quickly as they did,' Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin later noted. 'Everybody expected to see a much more stiff resistance from Assad’s forces.' It was only once opposition forces began to take control of Aleppo in early December, about a week before Assad fled the country, that the Biden administration began planning for the possibility of Assad’s downfall, according to U.S. officials. When 'we saw the fall of Aleppo, we started to prepare for all possible contingencies,' a senior official in the Biden administration explained. Indeed, the speed of the opposition’s movement caught many of the highest-level officials in the Biden administration by surprise, as they had been working on the assumption that Assad would remain in power for the immediate future. 'We didn’t directly see the fall of Assad,' State Department Spokesperson Matthew Miller acknowledged. Shifting Balance of Power Regardless of the ebb and flow of the Biden administration’s Syria policy, years of U.S. actions have clearly taken a toll on Syria. Just as U.S. officials have claimed, the United States played a central role in creating the conditions that led to Assad’s ouster. Since the Obama administration first devised the strategy of stalemate, which helped transform Syria into a dismembered cadaver state, Assad ruled over a devastated country, one that may never recover. The Biden administration’s resurgent American empire has also had major consequences for Syria. By spending the past two years supporting Ukraine against Russia and the past year backing Israel’s military offensives across the Middle East, the Biden administration has implemented policies that have imposed major costs on Assad’s supporters, especially Russia, Iran, and Hezbollah. Without external support, the longtime Syrian leader could no longer withstand violent challenges to his rule. Shortly after the fall of Assad, President Biden recognized the implications of his administration’s actions, claiming in a major address that U.S. policies set the stage for Assad’s downfall. Even while acknowledging that 'some of the rebel groups that took down Assad have their own grim record of terrorism and human right abuses,' he proudly insisted that his administration’s actions had made regime change possible. Indeed, President Biden has been quick to take credit for the overthrow of another government in the Middle East. Rather than being open about the implications of 'catastrophic success,' Biden has taken pride in how he and his predecessors have implemented policies that enabled a U.S.-designated terrorist organization to force Assad from the country. 'Our approach has shifted the balance of power in the Middle East,' Biden said. Through a 'combination of support for our partners, sanctions, and diplomacy and targeted military force when necessary, we now see new opportunities opening up for the people of Syria and for the entire region.'

Last Acts: Time For Biden To Pardon Assange – OpEd	Since making what was likely a life-saving plea deal to spare himself from the medieval barbarities of the US prison system, Julian Assange, and his campaign intimates, are now focusing on the next step. Having been directly targeted by the speech stomping apparatus known as the US Espionage Act, and convicted under it, the US government made the WikiLeaks publisher an example. On June 24, 2024, he pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy to obtain and disclose national defence information under the Act, or section 793(g) (Title 18, USC). In one respect, it was an improvement, reducing the original charge sheet of 18 alleged offences, 17 of them based on elements of espionage. While Assange’s conviction delighted those scribbling defenders of the national security state, the toadies, the paid-up worthies, and anyone from the CIA to CBS ('Assange: hacker, thief and exposer of confidential sources!' came the shrill voice of approval), his prosecution and ultimate conviction on a single charge of the Espionage Act served only one purpose: pouring oil on obtaining, using and discussing material about the crimes and vices of national security, notably the sort supplied by whistleblowers. One way of diminishing the sinister implications of that thuggish legacy is to persuade Freedom Land’s highest, doddering magistrate to show a skerrick of good sense – whatever is left of it. The Assange campaign has now shifted its focus to obtaining a pardon for the publisher, with a goal of persuading up to 30,000 people to write to US President Joe Biden to do just that. 'By granting a pardon to Julian Assange,' the campaign online site states, 'President Biden can not only correct a grave injustice but also send a powerful message that defending democracy and press freedom remains at the core of his presidency. He can reaffirm America’s dedication to truth and the First Amendment.' Two US lawmakers are convinced that one of Biden’s last acts in office should be just that. It would be fitting, in some ways, that he does so. In the dying days of his administration, President Barack Obama commuted the sentence of one of WikiLeaks’ most invaluable sources, Chelsea Manning. While it fell short of a pardon, its effect was to modify the crushing sentence of 35 years imposed by a military tribunal for disclosing classified government information to WikiLeaks. Last month, US Reps. James McGovern (D-Mass.) and Thomas Massie (R-Ky.) penned a letter to Biden approving the 'resolution of the criminal case against' the WikiLeaks founder, thereby ending his 'protracted detention', permitting him to return to Australia and be reunited with his family. But they expressed grave concerns 'that the agreement that ended the case required Mr Assange to plead guilty to felony charges under section 793 of the Espionage Act'. Doing so 'set off alarms' among various members of Congress and advocates of free speech and freedom of the press by setting 'a precedent that greatly deepens our concern.' It was, fundamentally, 'the first time the Act has been deployed against a publisher'. The letter went on to note that section 793 of the Espionage Act had always posed a risk that it could be used against journalists and news organisations 'particularly those who cover national security topics' as it 'criminalizes the obtaining, retaining, or disclosing of sensitive information'. It was precisely that risk that 'informed the Obama administration’s decision not to prosecute Mr Assange'. Accordingly, 'a pardon would remove the precedent set by the plea'. As for the prospects for an actual pardon from the Biden Whitehouse, one can hardly tell. Certainly, the president is in a frightful muddle after pardoning his own son Hunter for felony gun and tax convictions, an act of familial indulgence he said he would never succumb to. It was also complicated by its sheer broadness. In his justification, Biden’s words struck a familiar note, largely because they could have come out of the mouth of his opponent and successor, Donald Trump. While he believed 'in the justice system […] I also believe raw politics has infected this process and it has led to a miscarriage of justice'. CBS is now reporting that Biden is ruminating over the possibility of issuing various pre-emptive pardons for senior White House aides and members of the House Jan. 6 committee in anticipation of any retributive campaign that might be waged by the incoming Trump administration. Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders has also publicly urged the president to do the same. The president has also granted clemency to almost 1,500 individuals placed in home confinement during the COVID-19 pandemic, and pardoned 39 individuals convicted of non-violent crimes. Could all of this possibly make Biden mellow towards the man he once accused of high-tech cyberterrorism? A pardon would go some way to thinning the toxic legacy Assange’s conviction under the Espionage Act, one that, by its very nature, signals a global warning to all publishers and journalists involved in exposing the crimes and misdemeanours of state. Assange was the first non-US national foreign publisher working outside the United States to be charged and convicted under that archaically oppressive law, ostensibly for injuring the national security of the US when exposing the identities of informants and sources. Assange’s plea deal, much like his entire prosecution, is also imbued with farce and gross pantomime. Was former New York Rep. Peter King right to claim, as he did in November 2010, that the WikiLeaks publications were 'worse even than a physical attack on Americans', worse, even, 'than a military attack'? Not according to the Northern Mariana Islands Chief Judge, Ramona V. Manglona, presiding over the final proceedings facing the publisher. 'The government has indicated that there is no personal victim here. That tells me the dissemination of this information did not result in any known physical injury.' If Biden is of the belief that raw politics infected the prosecution of his son, the shoddy case against Assange is even clearer. It was political, personal and misguided. Here was a vindictive effort, steered by characters of such clouded malevolence as former CIA director Mike Pompeo and an overzealous prosecution team in the Department of Justice, to punish a figure who had muddied the sanctimonious waters of the Imperial Republic. As he has now assumed the mantle of pardoner-in-chief, Biden has a chance to bulk the folder and make history of the right sort.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWe6dX7MBfuzbxGWoFpaqyYZ	2024-12-17T17:14:21-08:00	
The Slow Motion Death Of Syria – OpEd	By José Niño On December 8, 2024, the 24-year reign of Syrian strongman Bashar al-Assad came to an end after a rebel coalition of Al-Qaeda offshoots, Turkish proxies, and other Islamist militants overwhelmed the capital of Damascus. In effect, a Sunni Islamist saturnalia brought an end to the Middle East’s last secular Arab government. The Assad family, starting with Hafez al-Assad in 1971, has held an iron grip on Syrian politics for over five decades. As committed members of the Arab Socialist Ba’ath Party, the Assads aligned with rivals to the West and Israel such as the Soviet Union, the Islamic Republic of Iran, and later on the Russian Federation. For it being a perennial thorn in the US‘s and Israel’s side, Syria was mentioned as a potential target for regime change by neoconservative policy advisors Richard Perle and Douglas Feith in their policy document A Clean Break: A New Strategy for Securing the Realm. The neoconservative plan, authored in 1996, was directed to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who was serving his first term as Israeli prime minister. The proposals outlined in the document have guided the foreign policy grand strategies of the ultranationalist Likud coalition that has dominated Israeli politics in the last three decades in addition to American Zionists across the political aisle. During the Global War on Terror, the Syrian regime and the then-administration of George W. Bush briefly became strange bedfellows on the issue of torture. Because the Bush administration could not torture suspected terrorists during interrogations on US soil, it turned to the controversial practice of extraordinary rendition to circumvent restrictions on torture. As former CIA agent Robert Baer candidly put it, 'If you want them to be tortured, you send them to Syria.' Whatever rapprochement took place between Syria and the US during the Bush year soon evaporated after the Arab Spring uprisings of 2011. After a series of protests, Syria spiraled into a state of civil war, where Sunni militants embedded themselves in the protests and soon mounted a full-fledged revolt against the Assad regime. These so-called 'moderate rebels' received patronage from Gulf Arab states such as Saudi Arabia and Qatar. Even more radical Islamist sects such as the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) attempted to carve out their own statelet in eastern Syria. Always looking for a new conflict to get its dirty paws in, the CIA under Barack Obama launched the clandestine operation Timber Sycamore with the aim of providing the 'moderate rebels' with military aid. The name of the game here was regime change as the euphoria of the Arab Spring convinced DC elites democracy was an inevitability across the Middle East. Other Middle Eastern players were not so keen on jumping on the pro-democracy bandwagon. In the early stages of the Syrian Civil war, Iran and its Lebanese proxy Hezbollah came to the Assad regime’s defense, which raised further alarms in Tel Aviv and the pro-Zionist NGO consortium in Washington, D.C. At the request of the Assad regime, Russia decisively intervened in 2015 to prop up the embattled Syrian government as the conflict began to spiral out of control. Turkey added further fuel to the fire by directly intervening in northern Syria in 2016 to back up its Islamist proxies while subsequently launching punitive campaigns against Kurdish elements in northeastern Syria it deemed as terrorist entities. What started out as a routine civil war, the Syrian Civil War became a magnet for external actors vying for influence in the Levant. Although the threat of ISIS largely subsided during the presidency of Donald Trump due to the rare instance of the US, Iran, and Russia putting their differences aside and launching operations to crush the extremist group, the US maintained a firmly anti-Assad stance. On two occasions, Trump authorized airstrikes against the Syrian government for its alleged use of chemical weapons. Further, the Trump administration implemented the crushing Caesar sanctions in 2019 in another attempt to crush the Assad regime. To Trump’s credit, he made a genuine attempt to withdraw the US’s 900 troops stationed in Syria in 2019. However, his orders were countermanded by Pentagon leaders who would re-deploy troops to the oil-laden Deir ez-Zor province in eastern Syria – another move designed to undermine the Assad regime. For some time, the Syrian conflict appeared to enter a frozen state as a result of the Astana discussions held by Iran, Russia, and Turkey starting in 2017. These multi-year discussions would be focused on determining the fate of Syria after years of domestic upheavals and foreign interventions in its affairs. In the end, these discussions created a false peace. After years of hard fighting that depleted the country’s resources, growing corruption, tightening sanctions, the US’s looting Syria of its wheat and oil, the Assad regime finally reached a breaking point in the final months of 2024. Syrian troop demoralization did not help matters, as evidenced by lackluster pay for soldiers ($7) and generals ($40). Syrian forces were exhausted and demoralized, which proved fatal for the Syrian state after Islamist militant group Hay’at al Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) and other allies launched an offensive against the city of Aleppo towards the end of November. In short order, the Syrian military crumbled and the Islamist rebels overran the country with little to no resistance in the ensuing week. Amusingly, Abu Mohammad al-Jolani, the emir of HTS and the de facto leader of Syria after Assad’s departure, has a $10 million bounty on his head for previously engaging in terroristic activity. To casual observers of international affairs, this seems like a bizarre turn of events. However, the US has a long track record of backing Sunni extremists in great power conflicts — from the Caucasus all the way to Xinjiang — as a means of creating geopolitical quagmires for its rivals. The US backing the likes of HTS and similar organizations is par for the course. In fact, there is already talk of the US and its NATO allies removing HTS’s terrorist designation because of the group’s alleged pragmatic turn, which is more likely a cynical reward for the group’s successful effort to topple the Assad government. It remains to be seen if HTS’s pivot to moderation is genuine. Though it would be wise to not get ahead of ourselves here. The Syrian Civil War is far from over, and it might be entering a new phase similar to that of the Libyan Civil War as extremist factions duke it out to determine who will be king of the hill in the Levantine state. For his part, president-elect Donald Trump has good instincts on recent events in Syria. In an X post he published on December 7, 2024, he proclaimed, 'Syria is a mess, but is not our friend, & THE UNITED STATES SHOULD HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH IT. THIS IS NOT OUR FIGHT. LET IT PLAY OUT. DO NOT GET INVOLVED!' The only quibble here is the US has been 'involved' in Syrian affairs in some capacity for over a decade. As mentioned before, the US has used tools spanning covert operations to harsh sanctions to destabilize the country. The damage is already done, and chaos awaits Syria. For now, US leaders should exercise some self-awareness and admit their interventions have cause unwarranted degrees of suffering abroad, Syria included. Sober minds should also acknowledge there is no critical national security interest at stake in Syria, nor does the country pose an existential threat to the US. With the US dealing with a wide array of domestic problems, ranging from mass inflation to a ballooning national debt, the last thing it should entertain is getting involved in another Middle Eastern geopolitical scuffle.

The US Government’s Building Fiscal Crisis – OpEd	Government spending is going through the roof as the outgoing Biden-Harris administration cements its fiscal legacy of failure. That’s not an understatement. Even U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen is apologizing for the administration’s sad fiscal performance. Here are her comments from the Wall Street Journal‘s CEO Summit on December 12, 2024: WSJ: One not-so-great aspect of the legacy you and President Biden leave behind is a very large budget deficit, roughly 6% of GDP. Are you sorry you couldn’t make any progress on that, and how much of a risk does that pose to the economy? YELLEN: I am concerned about fiscal sustainability, and I am sorry that we haven’t made more progress. I believe that the deficit needs to be brought down, especially now that we’re in an environment of higher interest rates. Over the past year, the interest cost of the debt has increased by several hundred billion. It’s one of the largest items responsible for the increase in the budget deficit, so we do need to bring it down. One day earlier, the U.S. Treasury Department she runs reported the federal government is spending money far faster than ever as its fiscal year gets underway. The chart below shows how its rate of spending of the past two months compares to the previous two fiscal years: The chart confirms revenue is not the problem. Tax collections during the first two months of FY 2025 have kept up with both FY 2023 and FY 2024 at this point of time. The amount of money the government collects in taxes is consistent across all these fiscal years. It is also worth noting that the federal government went on to collect a record amount of revenue in FY 2024. Unrestrained Spending Growth is the Real Problem The chart shows how much higher the U.S. government’s spending has been so far in FY 2025 compared to the previous two fiscal years. The Biden-Harris administration has somehow managed to cram the equivalent of three months of FY 2024’s spending into the first two months of FY 2025. Going back to Janet Yellen’s remarks, she cites the rising interest cost of the U.S. government’s total public debt outstanding as a major problem. If you’re wondering why she is apologizing, it is because she is personally responsible for that problem. Her mismanagement of the nation’s debt has been called the 'worst fiscal blunder in U.S. Treasury history.' Worse, because spending is rising so fast, the national debt has surged during the first two months of FY 2025. Even with the Federal Reserve cutting interest rates, the federal government’s cost of interest on the money it has borrowed will surge in December. The Biden-Harris administration’s legacy of unrestrained spending growth is building toward a fiscal crisis for the U.S. government.

A Decisive Moment For Argentina’s Stabilization Plan: Now It’s Th...	Argentina’s Stabilisation Plan has entered its decisive phase. The IMF must play a vital role. By Ernesto Talvi and Sofía Harguindeguy This is the decisive moment to capitalise on the successes achieved so far by the Argentine Stabilisation Plan and the sacrifices asked of the population, to set the country on the path to eradicating the scourge of inflation, macroeconomic instability and recurrent crises. The quickest, most reasonable and, indeed, most logical way to achieve this is a new agreement with the IMF to provide Argentina with fresh funds (international reserves that it currently lacks) to dispel the spectre of external debt restructuring, lift currency controls smoothly while keeping expectations anchored, and thus ensure the programme’s success. Argentina has already travelled a long way on its own, without external conditions imposed by any outside agent, which, in the past, would have led swiftly to an IMF agreement: severe fiscal adjustment; a sharp tightening of monetary policy; a cleanup of the Central Bank’s balance sheet; a capital repatriation amnesty; and an ambitious agenda of structural reforms. With these foundations, an agreement with the IMF is perfectly attainable. Achieving it would set a virtuous cycle in motion: the certainty of repaying foreign currency debt amortisations would further reduce country risk to levels compatible with Argentina’s re-entry into international capital markets; and lifting currency controls would enable the inflow of investments in strategic sectors that, under the RIGI framework, are waiting for the end of currency restrictions to be deployed.[1] All of this would likely result in a vigorous economic recovery. One could argue that history is not on Argentina’s side: that the IMF’s exposure to Argentina is already too high; that it is its largest debtor; and that too many stabilisation plans have failed in the post-war period, even the most promising and enduring, like the Convertibility Plan of the early 90s. Also, that under these conditions, reaching a new agreement with the IMF will be difficult. Perhaps so. But there are always moments in the lives of countries and institutions —and certainly of people— when, to make history, you must break with history. That is the challenge. Nothing more, nothing less. Analysis The Stabilisation Plan of President Javier Milei’s government, launched just days after he took office on 10 December 2023, has now entered its decisive phase. The fiscal adjustment, the cornerstone of the plan, was much faster and more severe than one might have expected from a government with a minority in Congress, facing predictable resistance from unions and social movements. Yet, against all odds, this is exactly what happened, and the results have been remarkable. Although achieving these results has come at a high social cost (recession, declining incomes and rising poverty), approval ratings of the government are still very high. How did we get here? Why are we now at a decisive phase? What role does the IMF play at this stage? This analysis aims to answer these questions. 1. The pillars of the Stabilisation Plan These are the essential components of the Stabilisation Plan: (1) a severe fiscal adjustment; (2) a severe monetary tightening; (3) a clean-up of the Central Bank’s (BCRA) balance sheet; (4) an end to monetary financing of the NFPS fiscal deficit and the BCRA’s quasi-fiscal deficit; (5) an initial devaluation of 100% in the official exchange rate and pre-announced 2% monthly depreciation, while retaining exchange controls; and (6) a capital amnesty. 1.1. Severe fiscal adjustment The fiscal adjustment amounted to around 5% of GDP, leading to a swift elimination of the fiscal deficit. It primarily focused on reducing primary public spending, with all spending categories experiencing significant real reductions compared with the first nine months of the previous year. The reductions included capital spending (-80%), transfers to provinces (-70%), public sector wages (-26%) and pensions (-23%) (see Figure 1 a-d). Figure 1. Fiscal policy Source: INDEC, BCRA and Ministry of Finance. Figure 2. Monetary and exchange rate policy Source: BCRA. 1.2. Severe monetary tightening The plan also began with a severe monetary tightening. Real liquidity in domestic currency dropped 20% to 30%, depending on the liquidity indicator used (see Figure 2.a). The resulting illiquidity is evident in the dramatic increase in the spread between the interest rate charged by banks on personal loans and the BCRA’s interest rate (previously on interest-bearing liabilities, now on LeFI).[2] The spread, which reflects the opportunity cost of holding liquid money, rose from an average of 2 percentage points (200 basis points) in November 2023 to an average of 25 percentage points (2500 basis points) between December 2023 and October 2024 (see Figure 2.b). 1.3. Clean-up of the Central Bank’s (BCRA) balance sheet The BCRA’s interest bearing liabilities were exchanged for Treasury Notes (LECAP and LeFI), transferring the responsibility for interest and principal payments to the National Treasury (see Figure 2.c). This measure eliminated an automatic source of monetary expansion (the interest payments on BCRA liabilities) and restored the BCRA’s independence in setting the monetary policy rate.[3] Additionally, puts held by the financial system were repurchased from banks, allowing the BCRA to extinguish almost 80% of this stock (see Figure 2.d),[4] thereby deactivating a potential source of monetary expansion outside of its control. 1.4. End of monetary financing of the NFPS fiscal deficit and the BCRA’s quasi-fiscal deficit The combination of restrictive fiscal and monetary policies meant that in the first nine months of the year the main source of growth in the BCRA’s monetary base was the purchase of dollars to strengthen the international reserves position (see Figure 2.e). This was possible because the severe contraction in local currency liquidity not only led the markets to sell dollars to the BCRA for pesos, but also enabled the BCRA to issue its interest-bearing liabilities in domestic currency (now scarce and revalued) at substantially lower rates. This facilitated a dramatic reduction in the interest rate on the BCRA’s interest-bearing liabilities (see Figure 2.f). 1.5. Initial devaluation of 100% of the official exchange rate and pre-announced 2% monthly depreciation, while retaining exchange controls The official exchange rate acts as the monetary anchor of the plan. The maintenance of exchange controls, known as the cepo in Argentina, serves partially, and for practical purposes, as a substitute for the international reserves that the BCRA currently lacks to support the exchange rate parity (see Figure 2.g). 1.6. Capital amnesty The capital repatriation amnesty introduced by the government is a scheme allowing individuals and companies to regularise undeclared assets, both in Argentina and abroad, by paying a special tax.[5] Furthermore, the government has announced its intention to eliminate the databases of those who participate in the amnesty, aiming to prevent these taxpayers from facing future taxes on the regularised assets. To join the programme, taxpayers must open a Special Asset Regularisation Account (CERA) at an authorised local financial institution. The funds deposited in these accounts must remain in the system until 31 December 2025. If the regularised funds are invested in public securities issued by the Argentine government, taxpayers may be exempted from the special tax. 2. Macroeconomic outcomes The macroeconomic results of the Plan came in fast: The parallel or blue dollar stabilised, and the gap with the official rate narrowed from 160% at the start of the plan to less than 20% (see Figures 3.a and 3.b). Expectations for the official exchange rate aligned with the government’s announced guideline of a 2% monthly depreciation (see Figure 3.c). Inflation decreased significantly, at a pace much faster than the market expected, and inflation expectations converged to the implicit guideline in the plan: an annualised devaluation of 27% plus international inflation (see Figures 3.d and 3.e). Primarily as a result of the capital repatriation amnesty, banking system deposits increased by over US$12 billion, reaching a higher level than at the end of former President Mauricio Macri’s term (see Figure 3.f). Due to peso illiquidity and, more recently, the capital repatriation amnesty, BCRA’s dollar purchases increased substantially, boosting international reserves (see Figure 3.g). Country risk dropped from 2,500 basis points at the start of the plan to less than 1,000, in recent weeks on the back of the success of the capital repatriation amnesty and its incentives to invest in government securities (see Figure 3.h). After a sharp initial economic contraction project at 4% this year, a rebound is expected in 2025, with the economy projected to grow at 3.5%, following the typical pattern of stabilisation plans that begin with severe monetary tightening (see Figure 3.i). Other real variables are also displaying common patterns observed in stabilisation plans of this nature: a sharp initial decline in real wages followed by a recovery (see Figure 3.j); initially negative real interest rates that later shift to positive levels (see Figure 3.k); and an appreciation of the real exchange rate (see Figure 3.l). Figure 3. Macroeconomic outcomes Source: INDEC, BCRA, Ámbito and JP Morgan. 3. A decisive phase and the IMF’s vital role The Stabilisation Plan has entered its decisive phase. To capitalise on the excellent results achieved so far and the significant sacrifices made by the population, the government needs to make a final push. The next phase of the Stabilisation programme presents two major challenges: (a) lifting currency controls; and (b) meeting the foreign currency debt amortisation schedule in what remains of 2024 and 2025. To address both challenges, Argentina requires a level of international reserves it currently lacks. To tackle the second challenge, the government is negotiating with a consortium of international banks to secure a short-term loan known as a ‘repo’ (repurchase agreement). Such an agreement would provide immediate funds by offering sovereign bonds or gold reserves as collateral, with a commitment to repurchase them at a later date. The primary goal of this repo is to strengthen the Central Bank’s international reserves and ensure debt payments due in January 2025. However, to achieve the first challenge —lifting exchange controls smoothly—the funds from the repo are insufficient, thus delaying the timing for doing so. Without access to the international capital markets, there is only one reasonable and logical way to simultaneously meet both objectives: a new agreement with the IMF that injects sufficient fresh funds to replenish Argentina’s international reserves. If successful, this would set in motion a virtuous cycle: the assurance of foreign currency debt repayment would further reduce country risk to levels compatible with the re-entry of Argentina to the international capital markets; and lifting currency controls would open the door for investments in strategic sectors that, under the RIGI framework, are waiting for currency restrictions to be lifted. All of this would likely result in a vigorous economic recovery. How much fresh funding are we talking about? Considering the remaining external debt amortisations for 2024 and 2025 (excluding those with the IMF, multilateral organisations and official bilateral agreements) and the reserve stock needed to lift currency controls without triggering the risk of destabilising expectations and ‘de-anchoring’ the Plan, we estimate that Argentina requires around US$45-48 billion in gross international reserves. Currently, it holds US$28 billion. Is an agreement of this magnitude possible? Let us take a closer look. 4. Towards an agreement with the IMF The key elements in negotiating an agreement with the IMF typically involve the following: A fiscal target. A reserve accumulation target. The definition of the exchange rate and monetary policy regime. The amount of new financing that would be provided by the IMF. Agreeing on a fiscal target should not be an obstacle in the negotiations. Argentina has already implemented a fiscal adjustment of 5% of GDP by its own decision, without any external conditions imposed. It currently has a primary surplus of 1.4% of GDP, and markets expect that surplus to continue into 2025. This ensures that Argentina will maintain balanced fiscal accounts this year and the next. The internation reserves target should aim to increase the stock of international reserves from US$28 billion to US$45-48 billion over the next three years, implying an annual reserve accumulation target of US$5-7 billion per year, a goal that is achievable solely through seigniorage and the inflation tax. With the ‘cleanup’ of the BCRA’s balance sheet already completed and monetary policy instruments restored, the exchange rate regime after lifting exchange controls must be defined. Two constraints limit this transition. First, Argentina will need to accumulate international reserves for the foreseeable future by purchasing dollars in the market. This means the exchange rate cannot float freely downward, as the BCRA will have to intervene by buying dollars to meet the reserve accumulation target. Secondly, the exchange rate cannot float freely upward either. In a highly dollarised economy like Argentina’s —where the dollar is both the unit of account and store of value— and with very low levels of monetisation in the domestic currency, the interest rate lacks the muscle as a monetary policy tool to stabilise expectations. This leaves two options: a managed float (with reasonably predictable intervention criteria) or an exchange rate band. In the latter case, it will be necessary to define the band’s width and the monthly depreciation rate for its upper and lower limits. This last point is primarily a technical matter, well within reach of an agreement, although it may require the usual arduous and heated discussions with IMF staff. Finally, after resolving the first three negotiation points, the amount of new financing the IMF will provide under the new programme must be agreed upon. These funds are necessary to dispel the spectre of external debt restructuring and, more importantly, to allow the exchange-rate regime to anchor expectations and meet the international reserves accumulation target, and to ensure the programme’s success. Conclusions Argentina’s Stabilisation Plan has entered its decisive phase. This is the time to capitalise on the successes achieved so far and the sacrifices asked of the population, putting Argentina on the path to eradicating the scourge of inflation, macroeconomic instability and recurring crises. The quickest, most reasonable and, indeed, most logical way to accomplish this is through a new agreement with the IMF, which would provide Argentina with fresh funds to dispel the spectre of external debt restructuring and, more importantly, to lift exchange controls smoothly, keeping expectations anchored and thereby ensuring the programme’s success. Argentina has already travelled a long way on its own, without external conditions imposed by any outside entity, a path that, in the past, would have quickly led to an agreement with the IMF: a severe fiscal adjustment; sharp monetary tightening; a clean-up of the BCRA’s balance sheet; a capital repatriation amnesty; and an ambitious agenda of deregulation and structural reforms. With these foundations, an agreement with the IMF is entirely within reach. Achieving it would set a virtuous cycle in motion: the assurance of foreign currency debt repayments would further reduce country risk to levels compatible with the re-entry of Argentina to the international capital markets; and lifting currency controls would pave the way for investments in strategic sectors which, under the RIGI framework, are waiting for currency restrictions to be lifted. All of this would likely result in a vigorous economic recovery. One could argue that history is not on Argentina’s side, that the IMF’s exposure to Argentina is already too high, that it is its largest debtor and that too many Stabilisation Plans have failed in the post-war period, even the most promising and durable, like the Convertibility Plan of the early 90s. Under these conditions, reaching a new agreement with the IMF will be challenging. Perhaps so. But there are always moments in the lives of countries and institutions —and certainly of people— when, to make history, one must break with history. That is the challenge.

Trade Wars Are Neither Good Nor Easy To Win – Analysis	By Sourabh Gupta ‘Trade wars are good, and easy to win’, US President-elect Donald Trump tweeted three weeks before he authorised tariffs on China under Section 301 of the Trade Act of 1974 in March 2018. Trade wars are easy to start, for sure. The US president enjoys extensive congressionally delegated authority to ratchet tariffs upwards. Courts will not second-guess this exercise of authority if its usage is based on an ‘intelligible principle’, allowing the president to enact measures bearing a ‘reasonable relationship’ to the proposed trade policy objective. The US consumer towers, too, over their international peers and tariff-regulated market access can be a useful source of leverage to instigate dealmaking on trade and non-trade concerns such as market purchase targets, shutting down illegal immigration and closing passageways for fentanyl trafficking. But are trade wars ‘easy to win’ too, as Trump claims? The Trump tariffs did lead to a sharp dip in China’s share of US imports. His campaign promise of 60 per cent tariffs could have punishing short-term effects on China’s macroeconomy and currency as it flirts with the familiar ailments of overcapacity, underconsumption, deflation and indebted local governments. On the other hand, China’s overall market share of global goods exports has increased since 2018, meaning the country has become more — not less — important to the global economy. EU–China trade ties have also intensified, particularly in medium-skill and technology-intensive production. This intensification is set to deepen over the next decade, including in electric vehicles and battery storage systems, their trade friction notwithstanding. As for the US overall goods trade deficit, it is larger — not smaller — as a percentage of GDP in 2024 than it was in 2017. The decrease in Chinese exports to the United States has been deflected elsewhere. While some producers have relocated production outside China to bypass the Trump tariffs, this diversification seems limited and shallow. Nearshoring to Mexico and friendshoring to Vietnam have dominated the trend. Final assembly in these countries is often dependent on China-sourced intermediate inputs. This ‘lengthening’ of the distance between suppliers in China and customers in the United States is counterintuitive to the logic of supply chain resilience which was the supposed reason — or excuse — to ‘derisk’ trade dependence on China. Besides, the pandemic-era dislocations were likely not fundamentally the product of a supply shock. Supply chains were resilient but businesses could not adapt quickly to the extraordinary surge in demand for durable goods. This challenges the premise of nearshoring and friendshoring. Much of the foreign direct investment (FDI) supporting supply chain diversification has arrived from non-Western sources. This suggests that East Asian — and most likely Chinese investors — provide the FDI driving trade diversification. So much for ‘decoupling’ from China. Just as Japan. Inc.’s forced relocation of domestic production due to US badgering to revalue the yen four decades ago spawned remarkable Asia-Pacific-wide production networks, so too will the Section 301 tariffs come to be seen as a blessing in disguise — one that equipped Chinese firms to internationalise their supply chain operations and obtain valuable ‘learning by doing’ experience along the way. Trump’s tariffs have turbocharged calls for protectionism within the US body politic. Like salted peanuts, the more they are dispensed to favoured industries, the more they are being demanded. The tariffs have also dislodged the Washington consensus on trade policy from its pro-liberalisation moorings, with trade policy shot through with streaks of populism and protectionism. At a time when the European Union, Japan, China and ASEAN continue to liberalise their trade policy frameworks, albeit at a slower pace since 2008, the US tariff play has accentuated the country’s relative isolation within the multilateral trading system. The United States’ defence of its unlawful tariffs under the catch-all guise of ‘national security’ has resulted in successive losses at the panel stage of the dispute settlementmechanism of the World Trade Organization (WTO). US refusal to support the Appellate Body’s restoration may not perturb Trump. But Washington’s conduct has dented the country’s reputation. The United States’ invocations of ‘essential security interests’ is propelling its retreat too from trade rulemaking, as was the case at the WTO’s plurilateral e-commerce negotiations. The United States was among the first countries to benefit from the imposition of the then-novel most-favoured-nation (MFN) principle through the ‘unequal treaty’ of 1844 with the Chinese Empire. In 1950, the United States walked away from the stillborn International Trade Organization due to broad domestic opposition to the Havana Charter. Business interests opposed the Charter’s retention of tariff preferences, weak investment protections, ample scope for discrimination against US goods based on current account adjustment grounds and other potential quantitative restrictions. Like the post-war United Kingdom, the modern United States hankers for managed trade and discrimination against foreign goods, and threatens to impose reciprocal, not MFN, tariffs. Trade wars will not extinguish the US trade deficit — driven by domestic macroeconomic factors and only secondarily by China’s industrial subsidies. Nor will broad protectionism deliver the return of well-paying manufacturing jobs to middle America — though selective deployment of industrial policy could yield a fighting chance. Trade wars may be easy to start but they are easier to lose. About the author: Sourabh Gupta is Senior Fellow at the Institute for China-America Studies in Washington, DC.

Gaza War May Soon End, But The Calamity Will Last Years – OpEd	By Osama Al-Sharif A pivotal moment could be close for the 14-month-old war on Gaza, which has claimed the lives of tens of thousands of Palestinians, destroyed almost 80 percent of the enclave and left more than 2 million Gazans internally displaced. There have been many such moments, only for all hopes of a ceasefire to be dashed. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s intransigence and vacillation have been the main impediments preventing a cessation of what the world now sees as a genocidal war against the Palestinians. What makes this pivotal moment different are several things. President-elect Donald Trump is a month away from his historic inauguration. He has indicated that he wanted the war in Gaza to end before he took office on Jan. 20, a message that was intended for both Netanyahu and the leaders of Hamas. Trump has also threatened to unleash US firepower if the Israeli captives are not released by the time he is sworn in. Also, the outgoing administration is believed to be exerting severe pressure on the Israeli premier to adopt a deal in a bid to give President Joe Biden some credit for stopping the bloodbath in Gaza. In addition, internal pressure on Netanyahu has spiked since the end of the war with Hezbollah, which was seen as delivering a victory for Israel. The north is now secure and thousands of Israelis can return home. The sudden collapse of the Assad regime in Syria last week was the icing on the cake. Israel has now neutralized all threats from Syria, having destroyed almost all of the country’s military capabilities. But perhaps the most pressing factor is former Defense Minister Yoav Gallant’s claim last month that the Israeli army had achieved all its military objectives in Gaza. Hamas’ top military and political leaders have been terminated and the group’s ability to pose a threat in the future is no more. In the eyes of the Israeli public, Hamas has been defeated and attention must now turn to bringing home the captives. There are other issues at play. The daily carnage in Gaza is now a liability, with mounting evidence of indefensible war crimes and crimes against humanity. Israel’s allies can no longer justify or excuse what it is doing, such as the targeting of schools, hospitals, designated safe areas, journalists and aid workers, as well as the gruesome images of starving children and bereaved women. Netanyahu has known for some time that the war has lost its strategic purpose. The killing spree has continued for several reasons: delaying an investigation into the Oct. 7 attacks, breaking the spirit of the Palestinians and forcing Hamas into a humiliating deal. His ploy about dictating his terms on Hamas appears to have worked. While the conditions of the latest proposed agreement remain vague, it is now believed that Hamas has accepted a partial truce, not an end to the war, while also allowing Israel to stay in control of the crucial Philadelphi Corridor and other parts of the now-partitioned enclave. There will reportedly be a gradual release of the Israeli captives in different phases in return for an easing of all restrictions on the passage of aid into Gaza. A Hamas source has confirmed that a deal that would gradually end the war could be imminent if Netanyahu does not obstruct it. Trump and Netanyahu discussed such a deal on Sunday. On Monday, Israeli Defense Minister Israel Katz reportedly told Knesset lawmakers that Israel is 'closer than ever' to closing a deal with Hamas to free the hostages held in Gaza. If approved by Netanyahu, the ceasefire — albeit a temporary one that would not stop the war — could pave the way for the release of Israeli captives and Palestinian prisoners, while providing a reprieve for the people of Gaza. The last time a similar pause was reached was back in November 2023, when 105 hostages were released in a week-long truce. Netanyahu is believed to be ready to present his coalition government with details of the deal this week. Israeli and US sources believe the agreement could be in place before the end of the year. But what would follow this truce is unknown. Netanyahu’s ability to resume the war would be degraded, even if all the hostages are released. Trump would be in the White House by then and he would not back the resumption of a war that has no benefit for the US or even Israel. The day-after scenario is also uncertain. Netanyahu has vowed to keep Gaza under permanent Israeli military control. Meanwhile, Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas has pulled out of an agreement reached in Cairo by Palestinian groups, including Hamas and Fatah, for a joint administration of Gaza. Palestinian sources said that Abbas’ Fatah party had pulled out for fear that the administration committee would become a de facto ruler of Gaza and an alternative to the Palestinian Authority. Ironically, Netanyahu has rejected the notion of allowing the PA to run Gaza, while his Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich is taking steps to consolidate the annexation of the West Bank and push the PA into financial collapse. Regardless of what Netanyahu has in mind for Gaza, the international community must be ready to act immediately once the war comes to a halt. International aid groups, UN observers and foreign journalists must have full access to the beleaguered enclave to document the horrors that have taken place in Gaza over the past 14 months. And while the daily barrage may finally come to an end, the reality is that there are 2 million Palestinians who are displaced with no access to shelter, clean water, sanitation, food, health or education. This will be a humanitarian crisis for many years to come. It is way too early to talk about reconstruction. The priority must be to help the survivors. Israel will attempt to release itself from responsibility toward the victims of its genocidal war. It must not be allowed to do so. The day the war ends must also be the day Israel begins to answer for its war crimes in Gaza. For Hamas, the end of the war must trigger open and serious discussions on its future and its purpose in Palestinian life and the liberation struggle. The Oct. 7 attacks have changed the trajectory of the Palestinian fight to end the occupation in a cataclysmic way. The outcome of that fateful day has now become a fork in the road in the decades-old Palestinian saga. While it has exacted an unimaginable cost on the Palestinians, Oct. 7 also awakened the world to their ongoing injustice and suffering. Where to go from here, no one knows. But what is clear is that the fates of Israel and the Palestinians have become more interconnected than ever before. Osama Al-Sharif is a journalist and political commentator based in Amman.

Who Is Donald Trump? From Real Estate Mogul And Reality Star To U...	Politics tells fascinating, beautiful, ugly, incredible, and sometimes strange, if not unimaginable, stories. One such story is the rise of the colorful and unconventional politician and two-time U.S. president, Donald Trump. He was the first alternative candidate to win the White House in 2016 and 2024, despite not previously holding any public office. Before entering politics in 2015, Trump was a respected businessman and a prominent figure in the American entertainment industry (a reality TV star), who was largely admired by Americans. However, after entering politics, everything changed, and Trump became someone people either loved or couldn’t stand. Love him or not, he is a once-in-a-lifetime figure. Childhood and Youth Donald John Trump was born on June 14, 1946, in the Queens borough of New York City as the fourth of five children of Frederick C. and Mary MacLeod Trump. Frederick Trump was a builder and real estate developer specializing in constructing and selling middle-class apartments in Queens, Staten Island, and Brooklyn, New York. Young Donald was a lively and bright, yet unruly child. At the age of 13, his parents sent him to the New York Military Academy, hoping the school would discipline young Donald and channel his energy in the right direction. The military academy was both a significant and challenging period in the future multi-billionaire and U.S. president’s life. It was a shocking change for a 13-year-old to be told one summer day that he wouldn’t be attending a regular school but a military academy located about 100 km from West Point. He would no longer be with his family in their luxurious home. The school was not just about academics. Students were required to wear uniforms and, from time to time, received tools to polish floors and carry out other physical tasks. Trump performed well at the academy both academically and socially, becoming a popular athlete and student leader by the time he graduated in 1964. During summer breaks, Trump worked on construction sites for his father’s company. He enrolled at Fordham University in the Bronx but later transferred to the Wharton School of Finance at the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia, graduating with a degree in economics in 1968. Trump was not drafted into the Vietnam War due to his studies and medical exemptions. Besides his father, who greatly influenced Donald’s career choice, real estate developer William Zeckendorf also had a significant impact. Young Trump’s dreams and ambitions far exceeded those of his father. Early Beginnings in the Business World After graduating, Trump joined the family company, Elizabeth Trump & Son, which he later renamed the Trump Organization. In 1971, Trump moved to Manhattan, where he met many powerful individuals. 'It was a gift for me,' he later commented. 'You know, being someone’s son could have been competitive for me. This way, I got the whole of Manhattan to myself.' Confident in the economic opportunities offered by the big city, Trump ventured into large development projects that promised significant profits. Trump seized these opportunities by using attractive architectural designs and gaining public recognition. However, it’s always worth noting that Trump had a relatively favorable and eased path to success. He came from a wealthy family with a prosperous father, so his business success was practically guaranteed. By the 1970s, Frederick Trump’s company was valued at around $200 million. Donald later admitted that he received a loan of several million dollars from his father. In addition to a financial head start, he also had social connections and a good societal status. According to some analyses, had Trump invested his inherited money into mutual funds instead of business ventures, he would be equally wealthy today. Donald’s father, Fred, was, like his son, a colorful character and a workaholic who worked from dawn to dusk, and he was an extremely ambitious man. Mary Trump was a very theatrical individual who loved being the center of attention. When their son Robert was born, Mary was often ill. Donald grew up with a lack of attention and affection from his parents, which may explain his character as someone who enjoys being at the center of media attention and has an insatiable appetite for publicity. Media Recognition and Building the Trump Organization Donald Trump sought publicity as early as the 1960s. His first business venture was producing a Broadway play. It was not a successful production and closed after ten weeks. Like his parents, Donald always possessed a theatrical personality. He realized he could pursue success in New York through his name, image, and persona—these were his assets. Even before he 'put two bricks together,' he was featured in The New York Times as a rising tycoon. Trump quickly convinced his father to entrust him with an independent project, managing an abandoned apartment complex, Swifton Village, which he renovated and then sold relatively quickly for a significant profit for the company. This was a turning point, and by 1971, Trump was appointed CEO of the Trump Organization. When the Pennsylvania Central Railroad went bankrupt, Trump had the opportunity to secure rights to purchase railroad land on Manhattan’s west side. When initial plans for housing proved unfeasible due to poor economic conditions, Trump promoted the property as a location for the Jacob Javits Convention Center, which the city eventually chose in 1978 over two competing sites. Accusations of Racism In 1973, Donald and his father found themselves in the spotlight when the federal Department of Justice filed charges against the Trump Organization for systematically discriminating against African Americans seeking to rent apartments. Trump’s defense that they rejected applicants due to low incomes was deemed unconvincing. The case was settled in 1975 without the Trumps admitting wrongdoing, though they made a concession by informing employees about the Fair Housing Act. They also agreed to educate the community about fair housing practices free of racial discrimination. Trump wrote in his book The Art of the Deal: 'In the end, the government couldn’t prove its case, and we ended up making a minor settlement without admitting any guilt.' Successful Real Estate Developer Meanwhile, Trump had a vision for significant achievements in real estate. In 1974, he secured the opportunity to purchase one of Penn Central’s hotels, the Commodore, which was unprofitable but located near New York’s Grand Central Station. The following year, he signed a partnership agreement with the Hyatt hotel corporation, which lacked a large hotel in the city center. Trump then navigated a complex deal with the city to renovate the hotel. The renovation cost $70 million. Renamed the Grand Hyatt, the 90-meter, 26-story skyscraper became popular and economically successful, making Trump the most famous and controversial real estate developer in the Big Apple. In his personal life, Trump always had an eye for beautiful women, particularly those of Eastern European descent. In 1977, he married Czech model Ivana Zelníčková. After the birth of their first of three children, Donald J. Trump Jr., Ivana Trump was appointed Vice President of the Trump Organization, responsible for design. She played an important role in renovating the Commodore. Together, they had two more children: Ivanka and Eric. Trump Tower and Casino Complexes In 1979, Trump leased a plot of land on Fifth Avenue in New York, near the famous Tiffany & Company jewelry store, as the location for a massive residential and retail complex valued at $200 million. The 58-story skyscraper was named Trump Tower and opened in 1982. The tower featured a six-story atrium adorned with pink marble and a large indoor waterfall. This luxurious complex attracted prominent retailers and celebrity tenants, earning Trump national attention. Meanwhile, Trump began exploring the profitability of the casino business. In 1980, he managed to secure ownership rights in Atlantic City, New Jersey. Donald enlisted his younger brother Robert to manage the complex project, which involved acquiring land, obtaining gambling licenses, and securing permits and financing. Holiday Inn Corporation, the parent company of Harrah's casino hotels, offered a partnership, leading to the development of a $250 million complex. It opened in 1984 as Harrah's at Trump Plaza. Trump decided to expand his operations further and purchased the historic Mar-a-Lago estate for $8 million. He later used the estate for professional training sessions and international business meetings before converting it into a resort, in compliance with regulations. During the 1980s, Trump opened a series of casinos, skyscrapers, and hotels along the Atlantic Coast. Trump bought out Holiday Inn hotels in 1986 and rebranded the property as the Trump Plaza Hotel and Casino. He also acquired a casino-hotel from Hilton Hotels in Atlantic City after the company failed to obtain a gambling license. Trump renamed the property Trump Castle, an investment valued at $320 million. Later, during its construction phase, Trump acquired ownership of the world’s largest hotel-casino complex at the time, the Taj Mahal in Atlantic City, which opened in 1990. The Trump Taj Mahal featured one of the largest gaming areas in the world, spanning 15,500 square meters, and was also the most expensive casino ever built, costing $1.1 billion. Expanding Trump’s Business Empire Expanding his empire southward, Trump launched a residential project in West Palm Beach, Florida. In 1989, he diversified by purchasing Eastern Air Lines Shuttle for $365 million, later renaming it Trump Shuttle. However, the company failed to generate a profit and merged with another firm in 1992. In January 1990, Trump traveled to Los Angeles to unveil a plan for a $1 billion commercial and residential project, including a 125-story skyscraper, but an economic downturn soon disrupted those plans. In New York City, Trump acquired a residential building and the Barbizon-Plaza Hotel, located near Central Park, with plans to build a major residential complex on the property. However, tenants protected by the city's rent control and housing programs opposed Trump's plans and won the battle. Trump instead renovated the Barbizon, renaming it Trump Parc. In 1985, Trump purchased 76 acres of land on Manhattan's west side for $88 million to build a complex called Television City, which would include a dozen skyscrapers, a shopping center, and a park along the Hudson River. Opposition from critics and delays in securing city permits stalled the project, which was designed to attract television networks. In 1988, Trump bought the Plaza Hotel for $407 million and spent $50 million on renovations under the supervision of his wife Ivana. Who is Donald Trump? During the 1980s, polls showed that Trump consistently appeared on the list of the 10 people Americans admired the most. Trump’s strategy for seeking attention was always as successful as it was perhaps transparent. 'I don’t do it for the money. I have enough, much more than I will ever need. I do it to do it. Deals are my art form. Other people paint beautifully on canvas or write magnificent poetry. I like making deals, preferably big deals. That’s how I get my kicks,' Trump wrote in 1987. He also invested in sports, organized the USFL football league, and launched Trump University, a school specializing in real estate education. New Accusations of Racism Trump again found himself in the spotlight due to racial issues in 1989. A robbery occurred in Central Park in New York when a young woman was attacked and nearly killed by five men. The case made headlines. Five young men, all members of racial minorities (Latino and African American), were arrested. It was later revealed that they gave confessions under coercion. Trump’s response to the tragic case was to purchase an $85,000 full-page ad in newspapers, calling for the return of the death penalty, signed with his name. This move was extremely inflammatory and provocative. The accused men were later exonerated, but Trump insisted they did not deserve their release because they were not 'good guys.' The same year, as a prominent American businessman, he appeared in an interview on NBC, where he claimed that Black people had an advantage and that he would much rather be a young, educated Black man than a white man in America in 1989. This was an exaggeration because the Black population in 1989 did not yet enjoy fully equal conditions in education and employment compared to the white majority. Business Problems and Changes in Private Life In 1990, a sudden decline in the real estate market occurred, reducing the value of Trump’s empire. His wealth fell from an estimated $1.7 billion to $500 million. The Trump Organization needed massive loans to stay afloat, which was a dangerous situation threatening bankruptcy. Some observers saw Trump’s decline as a symbolic embodiment of all the economic, business, and social excesses of the 1980s. However, Trump managed to recover, and by 1997, his wealth was estimated to be close to $2 billion. Trump’s image partially faded due to publicity surrounding his controversial divorce from his wife Ivana. Donald remarried, this time to rising actress Marla Maples. The couple had a daughter, Tiffany, two months before their wedding in 1993. The couple separated in 1997, and their divorce was formally finalized two years later. After his second divorce, Trump began a relationship with Slovenian model Melania Knauss. They married in 2005 at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida. Among the notable guests at the wedding were Bill and Hillary Clinton. The following year, the couple had a son, Barron. Entering the Entertainment Industry In 1996, Trump partnered with NBC to buy the American Miss Universe Organization, which runs beauty pageants – Miss Universe America, Miss USA, and Miss Teen USA. He owned part of the rights to these beauty pageants until 2015. Many real estate dealers paid significant sums for licenses to use Trump’s brand. This changed dramatically when he announced his presidential candidacy in 2015. In 2004, Trump ventured into television. He leveraged his celebrity status by launching the TV series 'The Apprentice', in which contestants competed to become managers within the Trump Organization. The show quickly became a hit and made Trump’s catchphrase, 'You’re fired,' immensely popular. The success of the series, which was nominated for an Emmy Award, led to a spin-off series, 'Celebrity Apprentice', featuring numerous celebrities as contestants, including Lennox Lewis, Dennis Rodman, and Leeza Gibbons, among others. Despite his image as a ruthless boss, in the real world (privately), Trump is a warm and pleasant person. He personally hired numerous people and gave them more responsibilities and rewards than other employers. Talented young people who joined his companies and proved themselves capable of completing tasks were given increasingly challenging responsibilities and were always richly rewarded for their success. Even in cases of failure, he would give second chances, unlike what was portrayed on the TV series. The Unshakable Billionaire At the beginning of the 21st century, Trump began implementing several large hotel and residential projects on a global scale, including Trump World Tower in New York, Trump International Hotel and Tower in Chicago, Trump Hotel in Las Vegas, and Mar-a-Lago Club in Palm Beach, Florida. Projects were also carried out outside the U.S., in Panama City, Rio de Janeiro, Vancouver, and Toronto. In 2016, the American business magazine Forbes ranked Trump as the 324th richest person in the world and the 113th in the U.S., with a net worth of $4.5 billion. Religiously, Trump is a Christian and was a member of the Protestant Presbyterian Church until 2020, when he declared himself a non-denominational Christian. On one occasion, he cited the Bible as his favorite book, followed by his own 'The Art of the Deal.' Trump has authored or co-authored several books. His latest book, 'Let’s Save America,' was published this year. In it, he outlines his achievements during his first presidential term from 2017 to 2021 and his plans for a second term, which he claims will lead America into a new era of prosperity. He has received numerous awards and recognitions. Trump, for instance, earned his star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in Los Angeles and was named Time magazine’s Person of the Year in 2016. Although his behavior may suggest that he despises journalists and the media, the opposite is true. Trump loves the media because they provide him with the attention he craves. Before launching his 2015 presidential campaign, Trump would start nearly every day by reviewing where his name appeared in the media. The media are crucial for boosting Trump’s ego. The Political Chameleon Trump’s political beliefs can be described as chameleon-like. For most of his life, he was a member or supporter of the Republican Party, but not always. Trump supported Ronald Reagan during the 1980s. He became a registered party member in 1987. In 1988, he considered running for president. However, in 1999, he joined the Reform Party. In October of that year, Trump announced the formation of an exploratory committee to determine whether he would run as the Reform Party’s candidate in the 2000 presidential campaign. Ultimately, he withdrew due to internal party issues and modest results in the California primaries. However, his political aspirations did not disappear. Between 2001 and 2008, he identified as a Democrat, but in the 2008 presidential election, he supported Republican John McCain. The following year, he returned to the Republican Party and promised in 2011 never to change parties again. Over his life, he has donated to both Republicans and Democrats. In 2012, there was speculation that he would run for president, but Trump withdrew because he believed he had no realistic chance. Entry into Politics In June 2015, Trump announced his decision to run for President of the United States. He quickly emerged as one of the frontrunners among the many Republican Party candidates. From the start, he based his campaign on issues such as illegal immigration, outsourcing of jobs, national debt, Islamic terrorism, and redefining foreign policy. He encapsulated his beliefs in the slogan: 'Make America Great Again' (MAGA). At the same time, he launched the 'America First' slogan, asserting that in foreign policy, America must primarily look after its own interests, not those of other countries. This concept also involved withdrawing from the numerous wars in which the United States had been entangled. By May 2016, all Republican candidates had dropped out of the race. In July, he was officially nominated as the presidential candidate, with Mike Pence as his running mate for Vice President. Triumph Trump based his campaign on the image of an outsider and anti-establishment candidate, adopting populist policies that resonated with conservative and right-leaning American voters, particularly white voters from suburban and rural areas. Despite relentless media and establishment attacks, Trump surprisingly won the election on November 8, 2016. The American people rallied behind a candidate who promised a new and better America. Interestingly, the American animated TV show The Simpsons had predicted Trump as president back in 2000. From 2017 to 2021, Trump’s first term unfolded with both successes and setbacks, during which he spent a significant amount of time defending himself from accusations of being a Russian agent and colluding with Moscow to win the White House. Other allegations followed, including abuse of power, leading to two impeachment attempts in Congress. Fall and the Great Comeback Trump narrowly lost the presidential election on November 3, 2020, under extraordinary circumstances amid the COVID-19 crisis. The elections were marked by many uncertainties and unanswered questions. Allegations of electoral fraud and manipulation would remain forever unresolved. Although it seemed he would never return to politics as a relevant figure—being banned from all social media—the opposite happened. Despite accusations of orchestrating the January 6, 2021, attack on Capitol Hill, mishandling classified documents, and attempting election fraud, none of this deterred him. Not even two assassination attempts stopped Trump, and he became the Republican presidential candidate in the summer of 2024. On November 5, he won the election decisively, capturing nearly all swing states and triumphing in the overall popular vote. Trump’s victory was not a surprise, but the significant margin was. While the elections were expected to be extremely close, with the winner unclear for days, Trump won overwhelmingly, and the result was clear on election night. A Permanent Place in History As the 45th and 47th President of the United States, Donald Trump has secured his place in history forever. The past, present, and future of Trump’s presidency will determine the final judgment of his character and achievements. However, his life story is unique and unparalleled, as is his political career, which leaves no one indifferent. Trump is either loved or hated—few can remain neutral. He could be succinctly described as: a top businessman, a wealthy man, a controversial figure of good character, and a politician after whom the United States will never be the same. His statement sums it up: 'Love him or hate him, Trump is a man who knows what he wants and goes for it—no limits. Women are attracted to his power as much as his money.'	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWe6dX7MBfuzb-JbjYuwjDrD	2024-12-17T16:30:45-08:00	
The Western Balkans At A Crossroads: An Old War From In New Geopo...	Hybrid warfare has made the transition from being a purely theoretical concern to a multifaceted and pervasive strategy that fundamentally affects the structure of modern societies. It has transcended the boundaries of propaganda and disinformation, by transforming these tools into powerful weapons to influence democratic processes and government decision-making. In this context, the Western Balkans represents a dynamic laboratory where hybrid strategies are clearly manifested, which not only challenge the stability of the region, but also reconfigures its political and social landscape. The phenomenon of 'Srpski Svet' (Serbian World) and 'Ruski Mir' (Russian World) constitute two of the most visible strategies operating in this space. Built on the goals of global multipolarization, these projects are an integral part of Russia's Eurasian strategy, which seeks to challenge Western dominance and expand its influence in the region. Multipolarization has evolved from a simple theoretical idea into a reality characterized by concrete and interventionist actions, as illustrated by the initiatives undertaken by the BRICS countries, which clearly aim to reshape the global balance of power. A significant example of this dynamic is the overthrow of pro-Western structures in Montenegro, a process that has been the product of direct intervention by Russia and Serbia. Following these developments, the next strategy seems to be to create a legal framework that would allow Serbian citizens of Montenegro to automatically obtain Serbian citizenship. This move follows a broader narrative of demographic and political influence, supported by recent census data. Its results show an increase in the number of citizens who identify as Serbs, thus creating a demographic base that favors the strategic ambitions of Belgrade and Moscow. This combination of covert influence, manipulated demography, and political interference poses a serious challenge not only to the countries of the region, but also to the broader Euro-Atlantic security architecture. In this context, hybrid warfare in the Western Balkans presents itself as a clear model of complex hybrid strategies, which require in-depth analysis and a coordinated response from international actors. Dual citizenship law in Montenegro: a tactic to expand the 'Serbian world' In May 2024, the Institute for Hybrid Warfare Studies 'OCTOPUS' published a scientific study that analyzes the geopolitical strategy of Russia and Serbia comparing to Montenegro, focusing on hybrid warfare as a means to influence the country’s demographics and political structure. This study sheds light on how Russia and Serbia are using ethnic engineering and political influence to strengthen Serbian identity and consolidate the concept of the 'Serbian world'. One of the main tools of this strategy is the demand of dual citizenship for Serbian citizens of Montenegro. Currently, Montenegro has a strict stance on dual citizenship. According to the current legislation, a foreign citizen seeking Montenegrin citizenship must surrender his previous citizenship. This legal provision constitutes an obstacle to the implementation of proposals by pro-Serbian and pro-Russian parties, which demand that Montenegrin citizens of Serbian origin have the right to have dual citizenship, including that of Serbia. These efforts resulted as part of a broader strategy to change the demographic and political balance in Montenegro, significantly strengthening ties between the Serbian community and Serbia. This scenario creates a favorable basis for political manipulation and increasing Belgrade's influence in Montenegro. Demographic statistics show profound changes in the ethnic composition of Montenegro over the past decades. In the last census, 41.12% of the population declared themselves Montenegrins, while 33% declared themselves Serbs—an increase of 4% compared to the 2011 census. This change is particularly significant when compared to historical data: These figures show a disproportionate growth of the Serbian community, especially after the collapse of Yugoslavia. This trend has important implications, suggesting a well-thought-out strategy to change the ethnic composition and to overthrow the political dominance of Montenegrins. The results of the latest census and the growth trends of the Serbian community constitute a clear indication of what can be described as ethnic engineering. The main goal is to create a demographic base that would enable the realization of major strategic objectives: 1. Referendum on unification with Serbia: A possible scenario where Serbia uses its demographic majority to organize a referendum on unification with Montenegro. 2. Division of a part of the territory by referendum: The other scenario is when a part of Montenegro dominated by a Serbian majority and a pro-Serbian and pro-Russian majority organizes a referendum on separation. 3. Changing geopolitical circumstances: In the case of international tensions, a Serbian invasion of Montenegro could be justified on the basis of 'protecting' the Serbian community. 4. Expansion of Serbian identity: Through culture, religion and politics, an empowered Serbian identity is promoted in Montenegro. This strategy is not simply a demographic or legal issue, it rather represents a serious threat to Montenegro's sovereignty. As Serbian influence in the country’s ethnic and political structure grows, Montenegro’s internal stability and territorial integrity are at risk. In particular, Serbia's and Russia's hybrid interventions through disinformation, diplomatic pressure, and the fomentation of ethnic divisions aim to undermine the country's democratic structures. The ethnic and social engineering efforts in Montenegro will not stop because this country constitutes a substantial component of the completion of the dream of the 'Serbian world' and constitutes Russia's current easiest route to sea access to warm waters. The Western Balkans remain a key point in international geopolitical dynamics, where historically inherited tensions combine with modern threats of hybrid warfare. Hybrid warfare, as a sophisticated and multidimensional strategy, has transcended the usual frameworks of previous conflicts, becoming a means of influencing the political and social structures of the region. Serbia and Russia use these tactics to achieve their agendas in the region, directly challenging the sovereignty and stability of countries such as Kosovo, Montenegro and Bosnia and Hercegovina. One of the most visible strategies of this phenomenon is the implementation of the 'Srpski Svet' project, which aims to create a demographic and political base that supports the interests of Belgrade and Moscow. This is achieved through demographic engineering, electoral manipulation, and historical and cultural narratives that promote Serbian identity and its ties to Russia. Similarly, the hybrid tactics used in Georgia and Ukraine provide a clear model for understanding the potential for escalating tensions in the Balkans, involving the use of demographics, ideological narratives, and hybrid tools. It is also clear that these efforts are not limited to demographic or legal aspects. On the contrary, they represent a multidimensional threat that jeopardizes the regional security architecture and the Euro-Atlantic integration of the Western Balkan countries. The manipulation of democratic processes and the creation of ethnic tensions through hybrid means underlines the necessity for a rapid and coordinated response by Western actors. The experience of hybrid conflicts in Georgia and Ukraine shows that a delayed response only reinforces the strategies of the aggressors and creates space for further destabilization. In this regard, the continued engagement of NATO and the European Union in supporting the stability of the Balkans is vital to avoid further escalation of the situation. Ultimately, hybrid warfare in the Balkans should not be treated as an isolated issue. It is part of a broader global strategy to challenge Western and create a new multipolar international order. Therefore, the response to these challenges must be equally strategic and comprehensive, including strengthening democratic and security capacities in vulnerable countries, as well as addressing the sources of hybrid influence.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWe6dX7MBfuzb46l_DJZ_OOB	2024-12-17T16:29:24-08:00	
Abusive Constitutionalism: Detection And Prevention – Analysis	By Prof. Dr. Djawed Sangdel and Damla Mesulam Constitutions are foundational documents that shape the political and legal structure of a nation. In democratic systems, they are intended to establish a clear separation of powers, protect individual rights, and ensure that governance is responsive to the needs of the people. However, leaders in countries like Venezuela, Russia, and Turkey have exploited constitutional amendments to centralize power, eroding democratic institutions. Indonesia faces similar risks with proposals like presidential term extensions and reintroducing state policy guidelines (PPHN), raising concerns over potential abuses of power. This article examines these issues through global comparisons and suggests reforms to safeguard democracy. Hence, the following lines are examining how the mechanism of constitutional amendments can be misused to consolidate power and undermine democratic norms, a phenomenon known as abusive constitutionalism. By analyzing cases from Turkey, Russia, Venezuela, and China, it explores how leaders manipulate legal frameworks to entrench authority and foster a cult of personality. The paper highlights preventative measures such as eternity clauses, the basic structure doctrine, and civil society engagement as safeguards to protect democracy. It also considers how Indonesia can strengthen its constitutional framework to prevent authoritarianism. Using conceptual legal research and a comparative approach, this study aims to answer three key questions: (1) What drives the proposed constitutional amendments in Indonesia? (2) How do these proposals align with principles of constitutionalism and democracy? (3) What safeguards can prevent abusive constitutional practices in Indonesia? It seeks to address the research questions by evaluating how constitutional amendments have led to abusive constitutionalism, focusing on Indonesia's current proposals. Cases from countries such as India, Colombia, and Venezuela provide insights into how term limit extensions, power shifts, and personalization undermine democratic principles. The study emphasizes the role of civil society in maintaining accountability. II. Constitution, Legal Order and Political Power 2.1 Comparative Framework: Abusive Constitutionalism in a Global Context Abusive constitutionalism, as defined by David Landau, refers to the manipulation of constitutional mechanisms to undermine democracy under the guise of legal reform. This global phenomenon has been observed in countries like Hungary, Venezuela, Turkey, China, Colombia, and Indonesia. Tactics include extending presidential terms, weakening checks and balances, co-opting judicial institutions, and consolidating power under the rhetoric of stability or national progress. In Colombia, the 1991 constitution limited the president to a single term to prevent the rise of authoritarian leaders, seeking to entrench power. However, President Álvaro Uribe Vélez sought to amend the constitution to allow re-election, raising concerns about democratic backsliding. Similarly, in Venezuela, constitutional reforms extended the presidential term from one four-year term to two six-year terms, enabling Hugo Chávez to consolidate power. Like Colombia’s example, these amendments were framed as necessary for national progress, but they ultimately allowed for the rise of authoritarian rule. In Hungary, the ruling party employed both amendments and replacements to the constitution to consolidate power. This included adding more constitutional court judges, restructuring key state commissions, and making it more difficult to amend the constitution in ways that could challenge the ruling party’s dominance. These measures illustrate how constitutional reforms can be used as tools for entrenching power, rather than reforming governance. Similar trends are observable in Indonesia, where proposed constitutional amendments, such as reintroducing the National Guidelines (PPHN), may serve to further centralize authority in the hands of the president. Rosalind Dixon and David Landau’s concept of Abusive Constitutional Borrowing highlights how democratic frameworks are repurposed for authoritarian control, often by weakening institutions like constitutional courts or anti-corruption bodies. Research shows that while leaders frequently attempt to evade term limits through constitutional changes, public resistance, rather than judicial intervention, is often the key deterrent.The global patterns suggest that Indonesia’s proposed amendments may not aim to improve governance but rather consolidate power, exemplifying Landau’s concept of abusive constitutionalism. 2.2 SEA as a Case Study: Current Constitutional Proposals This section examines the largest country of Southeastern Asia, that or RI's proposed constitutional amendments, specifically the reintroduction of the National Guidelines (PPHN) and the extension of the presidential term, highlighting their potential to reshape the country's political landscape. While these proposals are framed as governance and stability enhancements, they raise concerns about democratic principles and the risk of power consolidation. While Article 37 provides a structured framework for constitutional amendments, it centralizes power within the People’s Consultative Assembly (MPR), raising concerns about potential abuse. The MPR could prioritize the interests of the ruling party, potentially undermining democratic accountability. Key concerns include: Reintroduction of the PPHN: This could centralize policy control under the People’s Consultative Assembly (MPR), weakening the independence of other state institutions. Presidential Term Extension: Extending the presidency to three terms risks eroding safeguards against power personalization and weakening democratic consolidation. Though Article 37 legitimizes the amendment process, it also reveals vulnerabilities where mechanisms intended to enable constitutional change can be exploited for undemocratic purposes. This aligns with global trends in abusive constitutionalism, where amendment processes are used to entrench power rather than strengthen democracy. The subsequent analysis will assess whether these proposals represent genuine reforms or potential abuses. 2.3 The Role of the Cult of Personality in Consolidating Power The cult of personality is a political strategy where leaders create a heroic and idealized image to centralize authority, often undermining institutional governance. Personalization of power centralizes decision-making, undermining institutional integrity and democratic norms. While it may offer short-term stability, it often results in volatile governance. A comparative analysis of China, Russia, and Turkey illustrates how personalization of power influences governance and constitutional changes. In China, Xi Jinping has constructed a cult of personality through state propaganda, portraying himself as indispensable to China's future. The removal of presidential term limits in 2018 marked a significant step toward consolidating indefinite rule, shifting governance from a collective leadership model to a centralized and personalized system. This strengthens Xi’s authority but risks long-term instability. Similarly, Vladimir Putin has cultivated a strongman image tied to Russia's global resurgence. Constitutional changes in 2020 reset term limits, allowing him to stay in power until 2036. Unlike China, Russia maintains a façade of democratic institutions, which are systematically weakened to ensure control. In Turkey, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan has used populist rhetoric to reshape governance. The 2017 constitutional referendum transitioned Turkey from a parliamentary to a Semi-Presidential system (of the French type), granting Erdoğan extensive executive powers while eroding judicial and legislative independence. His leadership demonstrates how personalization can align institutional frameworks with individual authority. All three leaders use propaganda, legalistic and legal mechanism of constitutional amendments, and weakened institutional checks to consolidate power. However, their methods differ: China relies on institutional propaganda, Russia undermines democratic processes while maintaining a democratic façade, and Turkey invokes populist narratives. While Indonesia faces some risk of developing a cult of personality under a charismatic leader like President Prabowo Subianto, its democratic safeguards act as barriers. The multi-party system, decentralized governance, and two-term presidential limit reduce the risk of power concentration. Additionally, Indonesia's historical experience with Suharto’s authoritarian regime has fostered societal resistance to personalization of power. However, threats like media control, weakened institutions, or populist appeals remain, making vigilance and reform essential for preserving democracy. 2.4 Abusive Constitutionalism: Detection and Prevention The personalization of power, as observed in China, Russia, and Turkey, often manifests through constitutional amendments that consolidate authority. To counteract such trends, it is essential to explore mechanisms that protect constitutional integrity and democratic principles from being abused—a concern that resonates with Indonesia's ongoing constitutional debates. Abusive constitutionalism, where leaders manipulate constitutional amendments to entrench their power, poses a significant threat to democratic integrity. Lessons from India, Colombia, and Venezuela highlight strategies to prevent such practices, focusing on eternity clauses, the basic structure doctrine, and civil society involvement. These mechanisms aim to protect the constitution’s fundamental principles from being jeopardized by constitutional amendments. Eternity Clauses Certain core democratic principles, like executive power limitations, should be enshrined as unalterable. For example, Colombia used eternity clauses to block amendments extending presidential terms, with civil society and courts preserving institutional integrity. Likewise, Indonesia’s constitution already includes immutable clauses (e.g., protecting the unitary state), but clauses related to term limits and the balance of powers should also be safeguarded. Basic Structure Doctrine This doctrine, pioneered in India, ensures that fundamental constitutional principles cannot be amended. In Kesavananda Bharati v. State of Kerala (1973), India’s Supreme Court ruled that constitutional amendments cannot alter the constitution's core framework. Indonesia’s judiciary could adopt similar judicial review mechanisms to block amendments concentrating power in the presidency or weakening checks and balances. Civil Society Active civil society is crucial for resisting constitutional abuses. Public pressure and grassroots activism can expose and challenge manipulative amendments. For example, Venezuela’s failure to maintain an independent judiciary or robust civil society allowed repeated amendments that eroded democracy under Hugo Chávez. In contrast, Colombia and India demonstrate how civil society and judicial action can resist overreach. Indonesia’s vibrant civil society and constitutional safeguards have so far resisted elite-driven amendments, such as proposals for term extensions or system changes justified as necessary for stability. However, increasing media control and elite-driven reforms in Indonesia make public engagement and judicial oversight ever more crucial to prevent potential abuses of democratic principles. Summary and outlook This analysis highlights the risks posed by selected countries’ proposed constitutional amendments, which aim to strengthen the executive branch through measures like extending presidential terms and reintroducing the PPHN of largest country in SEA. These changes mirror trends in Russia, Turkey, and China, where centralizing power fosters a cult of personality, erodes institutional independence, and undermines democratic principles. The amendments could diminish democratic accountability, weaken institutional safeguards, and pave the way for authoritarian rule by concentrating power among political elites. To counteract such risks, these countries must strengthen checks and balances, adopt mechanisms like eternity clauses and the basic structure doctrine, and ensure robust civil society engagement in constitutional processes. A political culture emphasizing pluralism, transparency, and institutional independence is imperative to preserving democratic values and preventing the personalization of power. The analysis concludes that while constitutional reforms may be justified as necessary for progress, history shows their potential to consolidate power and erode democracy, emphasizing the importance of preventive measures against authoritarianism.

Strengthening Indonesia: Prioritizing Domestic Reforms With Diplo...	Indonesia's foreign policy doctrine of Bebas Aktif (independent and active) has been the cornerstone of its diplomacy for decades, reflecting the nation's desire to remain neutral amid power struggles while actively contributing to regional and global peace. This doctrine has enabled Indonesia to navigate evolving geopolitical challenges, particularly in the Indo-Pacific. With President Prabowo Subianto's administration now in place, the nation faces the challenge of addressing domestic issues while safeguarding its sovereignty in an increasingly competitive world. To achieve this balance, a renewed focus on resolving pressing internal problems and entrusting foreign policy to skilled diplomats at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Kemlu) is essential. First introduced under President Sukarno, the Bebas Aktif doctrine emphasizes Indonesia’s neutrality from power blocs and active participation in global and regional affairs. Indonesia's role in ASEAN, particularly in mediating tensions in the South China Sea, showcases its capability to promote regional stability. However, the nation's growing economic dependence on China presents challenges to its neutrality. Major projects, such as the Jakarta-Bandung high-speed rail and significant investments in the nickel industry, illustrate this reliance. Concurrently, cooperation with Western countries, including the United States on defense technology, underscores a strategic balancing act that requires careful management. Successfully managing these relationships without compromising sovereignty will demand experienced diplomacy and thoughtful decision-making. While cultivating international relationships is vital, Indonesia must also confront key domestic challenges that threaten long-term growth and stability. One of the most critical issues is corruption, which has eroded public trust, discouraged foreign investment, and undermined good governance. The Corruption Eradication Commission (KPK), once a symbol of Indonesia’s fight against corruption, has faced significant setbacks. Restoring the KPK’s authority and enhancing anti-corruption laws should be a top priority for Prabowo’s administration, as doing so would rebuild public confidence and lay the groundwork for sustainable economic growth. Another pressing issue is economic inequality. Despite strong economic growth, many Indonesians struggle to access quality healthcare, education, and infrastructure. Millions continue to live in poverty, particularly in rural areas. Addressing this inequality is essential for social stability. By investing in healthcare, education, and rural infrastructure, Prabowo’s government can ensure that economic development benefits all Indonesians. Inclusive growth will not only strengthen the nation internally but also enhance its international reputation. Indonesia's strategic location in the Indo-Pacific positions it as a key player amid the ongoing rivalry between China and the United States. China's increasing influence in Southeast Asia, especially in the South China Sea, raises concerns about territorial integrity, particularly regarding Indonesia’s Natuna Islands. Meanwhile, the United States is promoting its Indo-Pacific strategy to counterbalance China's rise and is seeking stronger partnerships in the region. Indonesia's challenge lies in maintaining neutrality while leveraging economic opportunities with both powers. Strengthening maritime diplomacy, enhancing naval capabilities, and securing the country’s exclusive economic zone are crucial steps to protect its sovereignty. To reduce over-reliance on China, Indonesia must diversify its economic partnerships. Building stronger trade and investment ties with Japan, South Korea, and the European Union can create a more balanced economic landscape. Moreover, modernizing the military and actively participating in regional security frameworks will enable Indonesia to play a more significant role in maintaining regional peace and stability. As ASEAN’s largest member, Indonesia has an important leadership role to fulfill within the bloc. Regional challenges—such as the political crisis in Myanmar and disputes in the South China Sea—threaten ASEAN’s unity and effectiveness. Strengthening ASEAN cooperation and promoting the ASEAN Outlook on the Indo-Pacific (AOIP) can drive Indonesia's sustainable development and economic integration across the region, thereby enhancing Southeast Asia’s resilience against global disruptions and great power rivalries. Maritime security must also remain a priority for Indonesia. As a maritime nation, protecting its waters, particularly around the Natuna Islands, and addressing issues like illegal fishing is essential. Improving naval capabilities and engaging in multilateral maritime initiatives, such as the Regional Cooperation Agreement on Combating Piracy and Armed Robbery against Ships in Asia (ReCAAP), are vital steps. Partnering with countries like Japan, India, and Australia can further enhance regional maritime stability. Additionally, ensuring that maritime development benefits Indonesia’s coastal communities will reinforce the foundation for the country’s long-term maritime goals. A combination of security and socioeconomic initiatives will help Indonesia solidify its status as a maritime power. For Prabowo’s administration to succeed, key measures include restoring the authority of the KPK to combat corruption, investing in public welfare to address economic inequality, delegating foreign policy execution to experienced diplomats at Kemlu, strengthening leadership in ASEAN to enhance regional unity, and advancing maritime diplomacy to safeguard sovereignty and foster cooperation. Indonesia stands at a critical juncture. While domestic reforms are necessary to tackle issues of corruption, inequality, and governance, an active and professional diplomatic approach remains essential for navigating external challenges. Balancing these priorities will enable Indonesia to uphold its Bebas Aktif doctrine and reaffirm its role as a key player in Southeast Asia and the broader Indo-Pacific region. With decisive leadership and a focus on both domestic and international priorities, Prabowo’s administration can ensure Indonesia’s stability, sovereignty, and growth in the years to come.

Cattle Rustling: A Lifeline For Boko Haram In The Lake Chad Basin...	Insurgents fund their activities through stealing cows – making it more difficult to address organised crime and terrorism. By Oluwole Ojewale and Raoul Sumo Tayo In Africa, transnational cattle rustling – the forceful theft of livestock for illicit commercial gain – is increasingly linked to organised criminal and terrorist groups. It is a source of illicit finance, a form of forced governance over local populations and a way to exert dominance. Stolen cattle are sold to fund the purchase of weapons and supplies and to recruit fighters. Rustling has grown in both scale and violence. And when perpetrated across national boundaries by actors such as Boko Haram, it demonstrates the terror-crime nexus in the Lake Chad Basin. A recent assessment carried out by ENACT and the Central African Police Chiefs Committee (CAPCCO) identified cattle rustling as a priority crime affecting the region. This is supported by Armed Conflict Location & Event Data (ACLED) project information, which shows that incidents of cattle rustling by Boko Haram in Cameroon and Chad’s border regions rose from two in 2015 to 131 as of August 2024 (see chart). There have been 390 incidents and 146 deaths in this time. This data relies on local groups and media reports, and many incidents may have gone unrecorded. Lake Chad, the Logone and Chari rivers and surrounding areas play a crucial role in shaping the dynamics of cattle rustling in the region due to the availability of water and grazing pastures. These areas are natural magnets for pastoralist communities, especially during dry seasons when other regions face water scarcity. Pastoralists often move their herds to these fertile valleys during transhumance (seasonal migration) to use the rich grazing lands. This predictable movement and concentration of herders and cattle in a contained area increase the opportunities for cattle rustlers to plan and execute raids and target larger numbers of animals in a single raid. The basin’s marshy terrain and hard-to-patrol areas also provide a haven for criminal groups to operate. Recent ENACT field research found that Boko Haram played a prominent role in cattle rustling activities in Chad and Cameroon’s common border areas due to the proximity of this area to the group’s base. Cattle rustling is one of its key revenue-generating activities and has become a crucial part of its overarching strategy for sustaining its operational capabilities. An expert from Cameroon’s University of Maroua said: ‘Cattle rustling is a major source of funding for armed groups. If we say, for example, that a cow is worth 200 000 CFA, over a short period of time, a group that stole 25 000 head would have amassed 5 billion CFA.’ In regions where Boko Haram has established control or considerable influence, it employs cattle rustling as a means to exert dominance over local populations through interconnected strategies. In Africa, transnational cattle rustling is increasingly linked to organised criminal and terrorist groups The first involves direct violent raids on communities, when cattle are stolen or both cattle and herders are abducted. The militants demand a ransom for the livestock’s return. This approach hits communities economically, compelling them to either submit to Boko Haram’s demands or pay protection fees to avert further attacks, said a former N’Djamena minister and provincial governor. The second includes imposing an illegal livestock tax on pastoral communities. Butchers in Bongor, Chad, told ENACT: ‘Boko Haram has established a tax [system]. They say that each herder must pay such an amount [of money]. If the herders refuse to give them, they kill them and take the cattle. They give to another person to go and sell.’ A new dimension to Boko Haram’s modus operandi is called ‘cattle round tripping’. This cattle-rustling tactic capitalises on deficiencies in legal and market systems, so rustlers profit from stolen cattle through strategic and deceptive practices. Rustlers generally steal cattle from specific communities, often executing raids in areas with weak security, where pastoralism is the predominant livelihood. To elude law enforcement, they transport the stolen cattle to distant locations, frequently crossing state borders where tracking by authorities is significantly hindered. A Cameroon military official said, ‘Sometimes they take those cattle and go into Nigeria to exchange them for other cattle so that they should not be known. And then they bring them back to the cattle market in Cameroon.’ Incidents of cattle rustling rose from 2 in 2015 to 131 in 2024, with 390 incidents and 146 deaths The stolen cattle are predominantly taken to Nigeria as it’s the biggest cattle market in the region, said the former provincial governor. The rustlers sell the stolen cattle at local and regional markets or to unsuspecting buyers. These cattle are mixed with legally acquired livestock and sold at prevailing prices, frequently through informal trading networks. ‘Selling cattle to buy weapons and supplies and recruit fighters creates a symbiotic relationship between cattle rustling and insurgencies,’ a university expert told ENACT. Several opportunities exist in this tri-border region to address this complex organised criminal activity. By improving existing security measures, the state, security forces, Multinational Joint Task Force (MNJTF) and pastoralist communities can develop a comprehensive strategy to reduce cattle rustling and promote stability and economic security in the region. Security forces and the MNJTF can work with local communities to develop early-warning systems that use traditional knowledge and modern technologies (such as cellphone alerts or community radio) to communicate cattle rustling or suspicious movements quickly. Security forces can create specialised units in the police and military focused on cattle rustling. Armed with modern tracking technology, drones and satellite surveillance, these units can monitor cattle movements across borders and apprehend perpetrators in remote areas. Early-warning systems using traditional knowledge and modern tech can counter cattle rustling Pastoralist communities can organise legal, community-based vigilante groups that are officially recognised by the state. These groups should receive proper training in using kinetic military action and non-lethal methods to recover stolen cattle and prevent livestock theft. Adequate oversight mechanisms must ensure they operate within legal frameworks. International development partners can supply advanced technology such as Global Positioning System tracking collars for cattle, drone surveillance and digital registration systems. These will aid security forces and communities in tracking cattle movements and preventing theft. While an Eastern Africa Police Chiefs Cooperation-CAPCCO agreement could provide for cooperation in combatting cross-border crime and enhancing regional security, the MifugoProtocol specifically addresses regional collaboration in addressing cattle rustling and livestock theft across borders. These frameworks offer authorities in the affected countries a strategy for effectively confronting shared challenges while advancing peace, security and development.

The Impact Of Russia Sanctions On Central Asia – Analysis	By Maximilian Hess (FPRI) -- Since Vladimir Putin launched his full-scale invasion of Ukraine and invited the largest international sanctions regime against Russia since the Second World War, Central Asia and the Caucasus have been forced into an uncomfortable position at the front of the accompanying economic war. The region finds itself in a position that its constituent states did not choose, and its countries have engaged in complex and differentiated balancing strategies. Notably, not one has brought the sanctions into its legislation and regulation, though most have quietly pushed for compliance to avoid the significant risks that come with falling afoul of those issued by the West and the United States in particular. The sanctions have undeniably had some costs for the region—particularly for businesses deeply integrated into Russia, or whose leadership is. However, forcing the Kremlin into an economically defensive position has also inadvertently opened up new opportunities for the region, some of which offer potential long-term benefits while others carry significant risks. To more fully understand the impact of sanctions on the region, one must first examine their initial impact within the wider context of the ructions from Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine. These disturbances include the brain drain and population shifts out of Russia that began shortly after and ramped up dramatically, if briefly, following the Kremlin’s introduction of conscription in September 2022. Then, the trade changes that the region has experienced in 2023 and 2024 can be more fully appreciated, and the importance of the region going forward can be understood. The economic battlefield has shifted from managing the fallout of Putin’s weaponization of hydrocarbon supplies to restricting the trade into Russia that the Kremlin depends on to feed its war machine. Finally, examining the attitude and positioning toward the region of sanctions-imposing countries forms a picture of how Central Asia’s position is likely to shift—or be shifted—going forward. Sanctions are not a perfect tool, but they have become, and are likely to remain,the key instrument in the West’s geoeconomic approach to Russia, China, and other geopolitical challenges. They will, therefore, continue to shape Central Eurasia’s economic and political relationships with all of its key markets and regional powers. It may seem counterintuitive, given one of the key aims of the sanctions imposed on Russia has been to restrict trade with Russia, but trade with Russia has boomed for Central Asia and the Caucasus since 2022. Much of this has been driven by trade rerouting as European exports to Russia declined and were instead rerouted through the region. According to a June 2024 Oxford Economics report, export increases to Russia in 2022 amounted to 5 percent in Georgia, 30 percent in Kazakhstan, and a remarkable 193 percent in Armenia, fueled by a marked increase in imports from the EU across all the countries in the region studied in the report as well. Research from the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development has underlined that goods subject to Western export controls imposed on the Kremlin as part of their sanctions regimes have formed an outsize share of such trade so rerouted. Reports of white goods, such as washing machines and refrigerators being shipped through the region so Russia could pick them apart for dual-use components, garnered international headlines within a year of the war. This trade is only part of the picture. far more important for the region was the massive influx of Russian nationals and capital, particularly to Kazakhstan, Georgia, Armenia, and to a slightly lesser extent Uzbekistan and Kyrgyzstan. The flows were so significant that Georgia’s and Armenia’s currencies boomed as demand from Russian capital and those fleeing conscription boomed. They became the world’s best performersagainst the US dollar that year alongside Tajikistan, a particularly remarkable feat given the rise of US and other key central bank interest rates to deal with global inflation largely driven by the energy crisis Putin’s war initiated. It would also be an oversimplification to say that Central Asian and Caucasus countries turned a blind eye to the risks of Russian sanctions. The region’s key banks swiftly ended key 'correspondent banking' relationships with Russian counterparties that came under Western SWIFT sanctions, cutting them off from the global intrabank messaging system. Even governments that took a position of explicitly stating they would not join the sanctions regime because of the perceived risks of Russia’s response have permitted regulatory authorities to issue strict guidance. For example, Georgia’s central bank has repeatedly issued guidance calling on the country’s financial institutions to operate 'in accordance with restrictive measures—financial sanctions imposed by the USA, the European Union, and Great Britain against the Russian Federation.' The sanctions that are most effectively enforced internationally—precisely such financial sanctions—have had the most impact in Central Asia and the Caucasus. Even countries with relatively few connections to the international financial system, such as Tajikistan, have seen broad compliance with measures introduced since 2022, including those targeting the payment systems that the Kremlin has engineered to try and mitigate the impact of such sanctions. Nevertheless, the dichotomy between regulatory actions and those taken by risk-averse compliance teams and the statements and actions of governments in the region is inescapable. In particular for Georgia—which has been the country in the region closest to the West since its 2004 Rose Revolution—this disjunction has caused substantial diplomatic and domestic political strain. That, too, is the case in countries that have less established democratic traditions such as Kazakhstan, whose leader, Kassym-Jomart Tokayev, arguably owes his continued presence in the presidency to Russia’s intervention in the country just a month before it invaded Ukraine. Tokayev has repeatedly pledged to 'follow the sanctions regime' while calling for continued 'comprehensive cooperation with Russia.' Kyrgyzstan—which has drifted closer to Russia since President Sadyr Japarov came to power in 2020—has also sought to avoid accusations that it is turning a blind eye to trade sanctions imposed on Russia. Countries imposing sanctions on Russia have not been blind to the region’s complications and interconnectedness with the Russian economy, however. When the Russian-Uzbek billionaire oligarch Alisher Usmanov was sanctioned in March 2022, the US Office of Foreign Asset Controls (OFAC) simultaneously issued General License 15 as one of its broadest-ever licenses carving out his Uzbek business interests from being automatically subject to the restrictions placed on him. This appears to have been an attempt to convince Tashkent to restrain his influence in the Uzbek economy, which has grownsubstantially under President Shavkat Mirziyoyev—to whom he is related by marriage—though it was relatively unheeded as Uzbekistan lobbied to have sanctions on Usmanov reversed. The license was withdrawn in April 2023 and Usmanov’s facilitators, including some Uzbek nationals, were additionally sanctioned. The US has similarly used its sanctions to warn other regional leaders of moving too close to Moscow. The September 2023 designation of former Georgian General Prosecutor Otar Partskhaladze, a close ally of Bidzina Ivanishvili, the country’s dominant political figure and honorary chair of the ruling Georgian Dream Party, for working together with Russia’s Federal Security Service 'for the benefit of Russia.' Although neither Partskhaladze’s nor Usmanov’s designations have resulted in about-faces from Tashkent or Tbilisi, there are potential other areas of success. One Russian oligarch who was sanctioned by the UK in September 2022—Igor Makarov—was long known to be close to Turkmenistan’s Berdymukhamedov regime. In fact, it is in that country that he was predominantly active since selling his Itera energy trading and hydrocarbons business to Rosneft in 2013. London lifted the sanctions on him this March after he gave up his Russian citizenship. Given Makarov’s purported involvement in the Russian-Ukrainian gas trade of the early 2000s, which was long at the heart of the Kremlin’s strategy of keeping economic influence over Ukraine, and his role as one of the few businessmen to regularly visit the Berdymukhamedovs, the wider as-of-yet-unpublicized details of the deal that was struck for his delisting may prove helpful to Western policymakers seeking to counter regional Russian economic influence in the future. This nuanced approach to the region—and to differentiating between how to apply sanctions to different governments within it—is also clearly evident in two other areas of sanctions. First, there are sanctions on companies that have been set up to avoid and evade sanctions on imports into Russia. Thus far, Western designations of companies in the region have been concentrated on those explicitly established to do so. The Kazakh, Uzbek, and Armenian companies that have been sanctioned thus far are largely such trade facilitators. No financing partners or regional authorities have been designated for overlooking or failing to catch these. The threat of fines and designations for the doing so, however, is increasing as a result of the December 2023 US Executive Order 14114 expanding secondary sanctions and the June 2024 OFAC guidance emphasizing that this encompassed all financial institutions, even those who 'unknowingly' facilitate them. Europe is also taking steps to introduce its own version of secondary sanctions through its 'anti-circumvention measures.' Once again, regional regulators have been taking steps to enhance compliance, for example in Kazakhstan where the Central Securities Depository ordered brokers and managers to divest from Russian securities in July. While financial services sanctions are somewhat easier for regional governments to push compliance with, it will be up to the companies that produce the dual-use and critical technology items or license the underlying intellectual property to take the lead in overseeing compliance for the trade sanctions to be truly effective. Those are predominantly Western firms. Almost none are firms based in Central Asia and the Caucasus. The risk-reward mechanics thus far have failed to achieve this, as Elina Ribakova has eloquently argued in Financial Times. Second, the West’s differentiated approach concerning sanctions on Russia in the region is particularly clear in natural gas markets. While it was Russia that turned off the gas taps to Europe in 2022, as the continent adjusted by turning to alternatives from Algeria, Azerbaijan, and in particular liquefied natural gas (LNG) tanker shipments, Brussels has recently begun to sanction Russia’s gas market. The US has also sharpened its sanctions on Russian LNG in particular, with the designation of the Arctic-2 project in September 2023. However, both Europe and the West have turned a blind eye to the region itself increasing natural gas imports from Russia. This has been the case even in Azerbaijan, which in 2022 agreed to import Russian gas to try and meet commitments to increase deliveries of its own piped gas to Europe. There has been no Western opposition to this, nor has there been public opposition from sanctions-imposing countries to more voluminous deliveries sought by Uzbekistan, which in 2023 agreed to begin importing 2.8 billion cubic meters of natural gas annually from Russia and aims to increase that nearly fourfold by 2030. There is precedent for such regional pragmatism in oil markets as well, particularly in the case of Kazakhstan, which is still dependent on Russian export routes for more than 90 percent of its oil sales. After European sanctions barred most pipeline deliveries of crude from Russia, the EU and other sanctions-imposing countries did not stand in the way of Kazakh oil being shipped through the route instead. This is a remarkable turnaround in Astana’s own position, given that it was itself subject to threats from Russia in 2022 to toggle off its oil exports if it did not take a sufficiently pro-Russian position, a tactic that clearly failed. So, while trade sanctions may still bring more costs to the region, in both oil and gas markets, the impact of the international sanctions regime on Putin’s regime has actually been to tip the balance of interests in regional energy markets away from Russia and toward the Central Asian states. Sanctions will remain a delicate dance for the region. Although the countries themselves have not explicitly joined the regime, they have proven more successful at challenging Russian influence in key markets and potentially through regional elites. The region’s inherent geography means that Russia will continue to seek to use it to evade import sanctions in particular. The West must build on the successes that the regime has had thus far—particularly as sanctions-imposing countries look to navigate divisions among themselves about the approach to Russia following the election of Donald Trump in the US while also seeking to sharpen their own controls and regulations for the accompanying likely increase in trade controls and limitations applied to the region’s other major neighboring power, China.

How Germany Destroyed Its Economy, And How To Fix It – Analysis	By Daniel Lacalle The German economy was once a global industrial powerhouse, showing a strong resilience in times of crisis as well as significant productive growth in periods of expansion. Germany displayed robust industrial activity, solid productivity, and enviably low unemployment levels, which added to real high wages. However, in the past five years the economy has stagnated, and its GDP is 5% smaller than the pre-pandemic growth trend suggested, according to Bloomberg Economics. Even more worryingly, they estimate that four percentage points of that loss may be permanent. Most analyses blame the weakness of the German economy on higher energy costs and the Chinese slowdown affecting its exports. However, the reality is more complex. Germany’s stagnation is self-inflicted. Germany made its first big mistake in 2012, when its leaders accepted the left-wing diagnosis of the European debt crisis, which blamed all problems on nonexistent austerity. Germany embraced inflationism and, in 2014, agreed to the same monetary and interventionist policies that have always destroyed Europe. The German government and the Bundesbank reluctantly agreed to massive ECB monetary expansion and negative nominal rates while allowing the European Commission to abandon its oversight of excessive indebtedness and signing off on back-to-back 'stimulus' packages like the Juncker Plan or the Next Generation EU disasters, all of which have left the euro area in stagnation, with more debt and now, inflation. Germans suffer a cumulative inflation of more than 20% in the past five years. Politicians blame it on Ukraine and Putin, but we all know it is a ludicrous excuse. Money supply growth and constant increases in government spending have obliterated the purchasing power of the euro and fueled inflation. 'An upsurge in money growth preceded the inflation flare-up, and countries with stronger money growth saw markedly higher inflation' (Borio et al., 2023). Keynesians believed that a weaker euro would boost Germany’s exports, but this is a myth. Export leaders rise thanks to high added value, not low cost. In any case, all the interventionist policies adopted by the European Union would leave a weak currency and an even weaker economy. The second lethal mistake was its energy policy. High energy costs are not inevitable. They come from the misguided energy policy that drove German politicians to shut down their nuclear fleet and spend more than 200 billion euros subsidizing volatile and intermittent technologies only to perpetuate the use of coal and lignite, which accounts for 25% of its power production, according to AGEB 2024. In fact, 77% of its energy consumption and 40% of its power production come from fossil fuels. German politicians also embraced the EU agenda that banned the development of domestic natural gas but multiplied the imports of US liquefied natural gas produced from fracking. Fascinating. Furthermore, the enormous subsidies and regulated costs added to consumer bills have made it so that more than 60% of the electricity price paid by consumers comes from regulated costs and taxes, including the CO2 cost, which is a hidden tax. Germans pay more for energy and still depend on fossil fuels because the government destroyed its access to cheap Russian natural gas and replaced it with expensive and unreliable options. Only a group of politicians can decide to enter an energy war and ban the alternatives. The third fatal mistake was to swallow the increasingly damaging policies coming from the EU Commission and the EU Parliament. A slowdown of the Chinese economy does not take a global export leader to stagnation, especially when the Asian giant is growing at 5% per year. A global export leader like Germany was rightly proud of a productive network that allowed its industry to grow thanks to high added-value products, technology, and a global reach that made German companies sell all over the world and navigate any macroeconomic environment. What made the once-mighty German industry stagnate and decline despite robust global growth was the combination of excessive regulation, disincentives to innovation, elevated taxes, and embracing the disastrous 2030 agenda that bans combustion engine vehicles. Politicians demolished the sales potential of the entire industrial complex with a misguided environmental and regulatory policy. Activists used the seemingly innocent 2030 agenda to impose an interventionist and unproductive model, obliterating all of Germany’s industries and farming and agriculture sectors. The wrongly named Nature Restoration Law, which makes it nearly impossible to conduct primary sector activities, further compounded this damage. The European Union’s gradual imposition of excessive regulation and disincentives has also resulted in Germany losing a significant portion of its technological leadership. Germany’s engineering and technology dominance was based on an open, highly competitive, and rewarding system that has been destroyed by bureaucracy and regulation. Germany is a global leader in patent applications but lags the United States, and the translation of patents to businesses is exceedingly poor. German politicians say that all the above challenges will become strengths in the future. I doubt it, because their track record of prediction failures is spectacular. What Germany needs is to abandon inflationism, interventionism, and comic-book activism. If Germany adopts these changes, its economy will experience significant growth. Germany does not have a competitiveness or human capital problem; it has a political problem. Abandon socialist interventionism, and Germany will be back to its trend of growth and leadership.

Ron Paul: What Are We Doing In Syria? – OpEd	My first reaction to news earlier this month that the Syrian government had been overthrown was, how much did we have to do with it; how involved was the CIA; and how much is it going to cost. As with Saddam and Gaddafi before him, we know that Assad was no libertarian hero. But unleashing an army dedicated to establishing an Islamic state in once-secular Syria hardly seems like a good idea to me. As with President George W. Bush’s 'Mission Accomplished' moment after Saddam’s overthrow, getting rid of Assad will prove to be the easy part. Rebuilding Syrian society after the destruction of the country will cost billions and will likely be about as successful as our 'liberation' of Libya, which is still a failed, terrorist-dominated state more than a decade later. In 2017 the Los Angeles Times published an article that, sadly, speaks volumes about the insanity of our interventionist foreign policy. 'In Syria, militants armed by the Pentagon fight those armed by the CIA,' read the headline. How does it make any sense that the Pentagon is fighting a proxy war with the CIA on Syrian soil? What’s worse is that the American people are forced to pay for this Pentagon versus CIA war and then forced to pay again to rebuild the country after all the destruction. The Syrian people will feel the cost in more than just dollars. How involved is the US government in the overthrow of the Syrian government? For the past ten years the US has controlled the areas of Syria oil and wheat production, stealing resources that we have no legal claim on. The combination of resource theft and extreme sanctions hollowed out Syrian society over the past ten years, so when the terrorists sprang forth from Idlib a few weeks ago there was little resistance. Now instead of the relatively benign yet authoritarian rule of Assad, we have rule by the direct inheritors of the people who attacked us on 9/11. I am shocked that the mainstream media and many if not most politicians are cheering this. Ironically, some of the biggest cheerleaders for the al-Qaeda takeover of Syria are the same Members of Congress who finished their daily speeches on the House Floor with 'we will never forget 9/11.' I guess they finally forgot? The implosion of Syria, like the US-engineered implosion of Libya and Iraq, has not led to democracy, peace, and the protection of civil liberties. In each case it has produced the exact opposite. Millions dead, millions more living in misery with many seeking revenge against those who destroyed their families, their lifestyle, and their countries. Are we safer having created millions of new enemies? President-elect Donald Trump made a statement last week about Syria, saying that this is not our fight and we should have nothing to do with it. His sentiment is the correct one, though we have unfortunately to this point had far too much to do with it. Let us hope that as president, Donald Trump will follow through with this sentiment and extract the US – the overt and covert presence – from not only Syria but the entire Middle East. This is not our fight and every single thing we have done there for the past 75 or so years has only made things worse. Time for an America first foreign policy!

The Police State Is America’s New Crime Boss – OpEd	The American police state has become America’s new crime boss. Thirty years after then-President Bill Clinton signed the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act into law, its legacy of mass incarceration, police militarization, and over-criminalization continues to haunt us. It has become the gift that America can’t seem to return. We are now suffering the blowback from the triple threats of the Crime Bill: police militarization, a warrior mindset that has police viewing the rest of the citizenry as enemy combatants, and law enforcement training that teaches cops to shoot first and ask questions later. Too often, that 'triple threat' also manifests itself in deadly traffic stops, the use of excessive force against unarmed individuals, and welfare checks turned fatal. The Crime Bill fueled the rise of the police state by pouring funding into law enforcement agencies, particularly for military-grade weaponry and the expansion of police forces. It also laid the groundwork for mass incarceration by incentivizing the construction of more prisons and enacting harsh 'three strikes' laws that mandated lengthy sentences for repeat offenders. Most critically, the Crime Bill led to the explosive growth of SWAT teams across the country. It’s estimated that more than 80,000 SWAT raids are carried out every year. That translates to over 200 every single day in the U.S. Among the tens of thousands of raids that leave in their wake the wreckage of lives, homes and trust in the nation’s so-called peacekeepers, some are so egregious as to cut through the apathy and desensitization that has settled over the nation regarding police violence. Breonna Taylor was killed when plainclothes police executed a no-knock warrant of her home late at night. Officers used a battering ram to enter the home. Taylor’s boyfriend, believing it was a home invasion, fired a warning shot. Officers responded with a barrage of gunfire, killing Taylor. Such tragedies are not isolated incidents. They are the direct result of a system built on policies like the 1994 Crime Bill. The unfortunate reality we must come to terms with is that America is overrun with militarized cops—vigilantes with a badge—who have almost absolute discretion to decide who is a threat, what constitutes resistance, and how harshly they can deal with the citizens they were appointed to 'serve and protect.' It doesn’t matter where you live—big city or small town—it’s the same scenario being played out over and over again in which government agents, hyped up on their own authority and the power of their uniform, ride roughshod over the rights of the citizenry. These warrior cops, who have been trained to act as judge, jury and executioner in their interactions with the public and believe the lives (and rights) of police should be valued more than citizens, are increasingly outnumbering the good cops, who take seriously their oath of office to serve and protect their fellow citizens, uphold the Constitution, and maintain the peace. Indeed, if you ask police and their enablers what Americans should do to stay alive during encounters with law enforcement, they will tell you to comply, no matter what. In other words, it doesn’t matter if you’re in the right, it doesn’t matter if a cop is in the wrong. If you want to emerge from a police encounter with your life and body intact, then you’d better do whatever a cop tells you to do. In this way, the old police motto to 'protect and serve' has become 'comply or die.' This is the unfortunate, misguided, perverse message that has been beaten, shot, tasered and slammed into our collective consciousness over the past few decades, and it has taken root. This is how we have gone from a nation of laws—where the least among us had just as much right to be treated with dignity and respect as the next person (in principle, at least)—to a nation of law enforcers (revenue collectors with weapons) who treat 'we the people' like suspects and criminals. As a result, Americans as young as 4 years old are being leg shackled, handcuffed, tasered and held at gun point for not being quiet, not being orderly and just being childlike—i.e., not being compliant enough. Americans as old as 95 are being beaten, shot and killed for questioning an order, hesitating in the face of a directive, and mistaking a policeman crashing through their door for a criminal breaking into their home—i.e., not being submissive enough. And Americans of every age and skin color are continuing to die at the hands of a government that sees itself as judge, jury and executioner over a populace that have been pre-judged and found guilty, stripped of their rights, and left to suffer at the hands of government agents trained to respond with the utmost degree of violence. At a time when growing numbers of unarmed people have been shot and killed for just standing a certain way, or moving a certain way, or holding something—anything—that police could misinterpret to be a gun, or igniting some trigger-centric fear in a police officer’s mind that has nothing to do with an actual threat to their safety, even the most benign encounters with police can have fatal consequences. The problem, as one reporter rightly concluded, is 'not that life has gotten that much more dangerous, it’s that authorities have chosen to respond to even innocent situations as if they were in a warzone.' Warrior cops—trained in the worst-case scenario and thus ready to shoot first and ask questions later—are definitely not making us or themselves any safer. Worse, militarized police increasingly pose a risk to anyone undergoing a mental health crisis or with special needs whose disabilities may not be immediately apparent or require more finesse than the typical freeze-or-I’ll-shoot tactics employed by America’s police forces. Indeed, disabled individuals make up a third to half of all people killed by law enforcement officers. (People of color are three times more likely to be killed by police than their white counterparts.) If you’re black and disabled, you’re even more vulnerable. Specifically, what we’re dealing with today is a skewed shoot-to-kill mindset in which police, trained to view themselves as warriors or soldiers in a war, whether against drugs, or terror, or crime, must 'get' the bad guys—i.e., anyone who is a potential target—before the bad guys get them. This nationwide epidemic of court-sanctioned police violence carried out with impunity against individuals posing little or no real threat has all but guaranteed that unarmed Americans will keep dying at the hands of militarized police. Making matters worse, when these officers, who have long since ceased to be peace officers, violate their oaths by bullying, beating, tasering, shooting and killing their employers—the taxpayers to whom they owe their allegiance—they are rarely given more than a slap on the hands before resuming their patrols. This lawlessness on the part of law enforcement, an unmistakable characteristic of a police state, is made possible in large part by police unions which routinely oppose civilian review boards and resist the placement of names and badge numbers on officer uniforms; police agencies that abide by the Blue Code of Silence, the quiet understanding among police that they should not implicate their colleagues for their crimes and misconduct; prosecutors who treat police offenses with greater leniency than civilian offenses; courts that sanction police wrongdoing in the name of security; and legislatures that enhance the power, reach and arsenal of the police, and a citizenry that fails to hold its government accountable to the rule of law. Indeed, not only are cops protected from most charges of wrongdoing—whether it’s shooting unarmed citizens (including children and old people), raping and abusing young women, falsifying police reports, trafficking drugs, or soliciting sex with minors—but even on the rare occasions when they are fired for misconduct, it’s only a matter of time before they get re-hired again. Much of the 'credit' for shielding these rogue cops goes to influential police unions and laws providing for qualified immunity, police contracts that 'provide a shield of protection to officers accused of misdeeds and erect barriers to residents complaining of abuse,' state and federal laws that allow police to walk away without paying a dime for their wrongdoing, and rampant cronyism among government bureaucrats. It’s happening all across the country. This is no longer a debate over good cops and bad cops. It’s a power struggle between police officers who rank their personal safety above everyone else’s and police officers who understand that their jobs are to serve and protect; between police trained to shoot to kill and police trained to resolve situations peacefully; most of all, it’s between police who believe the law is on their side and police who know that they will be held to account for their actions under the same law as everyone else. Unfortunately, more and more police are being trained to view themselves as distinct from the citizenry, to view their authority as superior to the citizenry, and to view their lives as more precious than those of their citizen counterparts. Instead of being taught to see themselves as mediators and peacemakers whose lethal weapons are to be used as a last resort, they are being drilled into acting like gunmen with killer instincts who shoot to kill rather than merely incapacitate. In Barnes v. Felix, a case before the U.S. Supreme Court, the justices have been asked to do away with the 'moment-of-threat doctrine,' which encourages police to act recklessly with impunity, unnecessarily escalating the level of danger in situations involving relatively minor crimes and then responding to the perceived danger with deadly force. Like the Ghost of Christmas Past, the 1994 Crime Bill haunts us with its legacy of injustice. Its Ghost of Christmas Present shows us the ongoing struggles with police brutality and mass incarceration. And its Ghost of Christmas Future warns us of a society where over-policing and surveillance become the norm. So how do we counter the triple threats posed by the Crime Bill? Despite the outcry from those on the left, the answer is not to de-fund the police, although it wouldn’t hurt to loosen the military industrial complex’s chokehold on America. What we really need to do is de-fang the police: de-militarize (reduce the reliance on military-grade equipment and tactics), de-weaponize, and focus on de-escalation tactics (prioritizing communication and conflict resolution skills over the use of force), a shift in mindset (moving away from the 'warrior' mentality towards a guardian or community policing model), and better accountability. As with all things, change must start locally, in your hometown. Remember, a police state does not come about overnight. It starts small, perhaps with a revenue-generating red light camera at an intersection. When that is implemented without opposition, perhaps next will be surveillance cameras on public streets. License plate readers on police cruisers. More police officers on the beat. Free military equipment from the federal government. Free speech zones and zero tolerance policies and curfews. SWAT team raids. Drones flying overhead. No matter how it starts, however, as I make clear in my book Battlefield America: The War on the American People and in its fictional counterpart The Erik Blair Diaries, it always ends the same.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWdGQ6ALRIc3FaiyDL3osMgn	2024-12-16T16:21:29-08:00	
China Baits Indonesia To Soften South China Sea Stance – Analysis	By Jefferson Ng Indonesian President Prabowo Subianto’s state visit to China in November 2024 appears to have implicitly acknowledged the legitimacy of Chinese territorial claims in maritime areas — where its nine-dash line overlaps with Indonesia’s Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) surrounding the Natuna Islands. Though not legally binding, a joint statement produced from the visit mentioned ‘joint development in areas of overlapping claims’. This seemed to depart from Indonesia’s longstanding stance that Chinese claims contradict the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea and have no basis under international law. Indonesia’s apparent shift in position stems from China’s playbook for asserting its South China Sea claims. Chinese maritime ambition combined with Indonesia’s domestic economic imperatives and teething problems within the president’s advisory system to produce this outcome. The joint statement highlighted key features of China’s aim to advance its maritime claims in the South China Sea vis-a-vis other Southeast Asian countries. In particular, the joint development proposal follows similar overtures China has made to other countries like the Philippines and Vietnam. These efforts reflect Beijing’s use of ostensibly neutral joint development proposals to gradually expand its presence in the disputed maritime areas, particularly under new administrations eager to secure investment and growth opportunities. China successfully appealed to Indonesian domestic economic priorities in this instance. Besides fisheries cooperation around the Natunas, China pledged substantial economic support for President Prabowo’s signature initiatives, including the free lunch programme for schoolchildren and an ambitious project to build affordable public housing for low-income families. China also made US$10 billion in additional investments across various sectors. China’s joint development proposal also found a receptive audience among Indonesia’s political leadership, eager for foreign investments to help deliver on political promises. The country faces significant economic challenges as it aims to transition from middle to high-income in line with its 2045 vision. A shrinking middle class, stagnant economic growth and low labour productivity are exacerbated by limited access to higher education which has restricted economic opportunities for Indonesians. To address these challenges, Prabowo pledged to boost the country’s economic growth to 8 per cent a year as part of his election campaign. But Indonesia’s fiscal constraints — stemming from a low tax-to-GDP ratio — complicate this task. Prabowo’s only real option is to boost trade and attract substantial foreign investment. Under the former Jokowi administration, Indonesia benefitted greatly from major foreign investments from cash-rich countries such as China and the United Arab Emirates. Emulating his predecessor, Prabowo visited both China and the United Arab Emirates within a month of his inauguration, securing significant commitments from both countries. Unfortunately, while former president Joko ‘Jokowi’ Widodo largely left the foreign ministry to the stewardship of career diplomats, Prabowo has opted to politicise the ministry by appointing a trusted protege, Sugiono, as foreign minister. This has produced a dual-track approach to foreign policy — career diplomats manage routine foreign affairs issues, while decisions that have a direct bearing on political interests are handled by the president’s inner circle. While this means that the foreign minister is more responsive to the president’s interests, it effectively sidelines traditional institutional safeguards. The resulting China–Indonesia joint statement indicated that career diplomats at the Foreign Ministry had either been sidelined or not consulted. It also highlighted the absence of foreign policy experts in the president’s inner circle. Overall, the joint statement puts Indonesia in an awkward position. It is keen to secure Chinese economic assistance for its developmental objectives and better exploit the resources in its EEZ. As Indonesia’s Foreign Minister put it, ‘50 per cent of zero is still zero’, highlighting Indonesia’s desire for pragmatic economic cooperation with China. But any future cooperation initiative with China in its Natuna EEZ is likely to take reference from this joint statement, which will be interpreted in a manner beneficial to Chinese interests. To avoid giving further credence to Chinese claims, Indonesia will need to exercise a great deal of diplomatic finesse in subsequent negotiations and be prepared to pull the plug on any form of economic cooperation that compromises its sovereign rights in its EEZ. There are broader takeaways from this incident that have implications for Southeast Asian states and their relationships with China. All Southeast Asian states can and should exercise agency in dealings with China. Though economic cooperation with China is attractive, China’s economic carrots are designed to advance its own national interests — as it should. Thus, due diligence and wariness of hidden strings are key when seeking economic cooperation with China. The United States is also conspicuous for its absence. Though Prabowo did visit the United States, few concrete economic commitments were secured, fuelling the perception that the United States is increasingly disengaged from Southeast Asia. According to the latest State of Southeast Asia survey, 59.5 per cent of respondents view China as the region’s most influential economic power, compared to just 14.3 per cent for the United States, which even lags behind Japan. The United States must recognise that offering a robust economic counterweight to China would empower Southeast Asian nations to maintain strategic flexibility without being forced to align definitively. Efforts to support Indonesia’s energy transition, infrastructure needs and other development goals could serve as starting points for deeper engagement. It remains uncertain if the incoming Trump administration will continue Biden-era policies or adopt more mercantilist approach — potentially forcing Southeast Asian countries to pick sides. Without decisive action, the United States risks leaving a critical gap in its Indo-Pacific strategy, relying solely on individual Southeast Asian nations to hedge effectively between superpowers. Indonesia’s joint statement with China is a cautionary tale for Southeast Asian nations navigating the complexities of economic cooperation with China in an era of growing Chinese assertiveness. For Indonesia, the intersection of Chinese overtures, domestic economic imperatives and weaknesses in the president’s advisory system produced an outcome at odds with its longstanding position on the South China Sea and may cause spillover effects for the other Southeast Asian claimant states.

A New Geo-Political Map Is Unfolding: The End Of Syria (And Of ‘P...	Syria has entered the abyss – the demons of al-Qa’eda, ISIS, and the most intransigent elements of the Muslim Brotherhood are circling the skies. There is chaos, looting, fear, and a terrible passion for revenge scalds the blood. Street executions are rife. Maybe Hayat Tahrir Al-Sham (HTS) and its leader, Al-Joulani, (following Turkish instruction), thought to control things. But HTS is an umbrella label like Al-Qa’eda, ISIS and An-Nusra, and its factions have already descended into factional fighting. The Syrian ‘state’ dissolved in the middle of the night; the police and army went home, leaving weapons depots open for the Shebab to loot. The prison doors were flung (or prised) open. Some, no doubt, were political prisoners; but many were not. Some of the most vicious inmates now roam the streets. The Israelis – within days – totally eviscerated the defence infrastructure of the state in more than 450 air strikes: missile air defences, Syrian air force helicopters and aircraft, the navy and the armouries – all destroyed in the 'largest air operation in Israel’s history'. Syria no longer exists as a geo-political entity. In the east, Kurdish forces (with U.S. military support) are seizing the oil and agricultural resources of the former state. Erdogan’s forces and proxies are engaged in an attempt to crush the Kurdish enclave completely (although the U.S. has now mediated a ceasefire of sorts). And in the south-west, Israeli tanks have seized the Golan and land beyond to within 20 kms of Damascus. In 2015 the Economist magazine wrote: 'Black gold under the Golan: Geologists in Israel think they have found oil – in very tricky territory'. Israeli and American oilmen believe they have discovered a bonanza in this most inconvenient of sites. And a big impediment – Syria – to the West’s energy ambitions has just dissipated. The strategic political balancer to Israel that was Syria since 1948, has vanished. And the earlier ‘easing of tensions’ between the Sunni sphere and Iran has been disrupted by the rude intervention of ISIS rebrands and by Ottoman revanchism working with Israel, via American (and British) intermediaries. The Turks have never really reconciled themselves to the 1923 Treaty that concluded World War I, by which they ceded what is now northern Syria to the new state of Syria. Within days, Syria has been dismembered, partitioned and balkanised. So why do Israel and Türkiye still bomb? The bombing started the moment Bashar Al-Assad departed – because Türkiye and Israel worry that today’s conquerors may prove ephemeral, and may soon themselves be displaced. You don’t need to own a thing in order to control it. As powerful states in the region, Israel and Turkey will wish to exercise control not just over resources, but over the vital regional crossroads and passageway that was Syria. Inevitably however, ‘Greater Israel’ is likely, at some point, to butt heads with Erdogan’s Ottomanesque revanchism. Equally the Saudi-Egyptian-UAE front will not welcome the resurgence of either ISIS re-brands, nor the Turkish-inspired and Ottomanised Muslim Brotherhood. The latter poses an immediate threat to Jordan, now bordering the new revolutionary entity. Such concerns may push these Gulf States closer to Iran. Qatar, as purveyor of arms and funding to the HTS cartel, may again be ostracised by other Gulf leaders. The new geo-political map poses many direct questions about Iran, Russia, China and the BRICS. Russia has played a complex hand in the Middle East – on the one hand, prosecuting an escalating defensive war versus NATO powers and managing key energy interests; while, at the same time, trying to moderate Resistance operations toward Israel in order to keep relations with the U.S. from deteriorating utterly. Moscow hopes – without great conviction – that a dialogue with the incoming U.S. President might emerge, at some point in the future. Moscow likely will draw the conclusion that ceasefire ‘deals’ such as the Astana Agreement on jihadist containment within the boundaries of the Idlib autonomous zone in Syria are not worth the paper on which they were written. Türkiye – an Astana guarantor – stabbed Moscow in the back. Likely, it will make the Russian leadership more hard-nosed over Ukraine, and of any western talk of ceasefires. Iran’s Supreme Leader spoke on 11 December: 'There should be no doubt that what happened in Syria was plotted in the command rooms of the United States and Israel. We have evidence for this. One of the neighbouring countries of Syria also played a role, but the primary planners are the U.S. and the Zionist regime'. In this context, Ayatollah Khamenei quashed speculations about any weakening of the will to resist. Türkiye’s proxy victory in Syria nonetheless may prove Pyrrhic. Erdogan’s Foreign Minister, Hakan Fidan, lied to Russia, the Gulf States and Iran about the nature of what was being cooked-up in Syria. But the mess now is Erdogan’s. Those that he doubled-crossed will at some point extract pay-back. Iran seemingly, will revert to its earlier stance of gathering together the disparate threads of regional resistance to fight the Al-Qa’eda reincarnation. It will not turn its back on China, nor the BRICS project. Iraq – recalling the ISIS atrocities of its civil war – will join with Iran, as will Yemen. Iran will be aware that the remaining nodes of the former Syrian Army might well, at some point, enter into the fight against the HTS cartel. Maher Al-Assad took his entire armoured division with him into exile in Iraq on the night of Bashar Al-Assad’s departure. China will not be pleased at events in Syria. The Uyghurs played a prominent part in the Syria uprising (there were an estimated 30,000 Uyghurs in Idlib, under training by Türkiye (which sees Uyghurs as the original component of the Turkic nation). China too, will likely see the overthrow of Syria as underlining putative western threats to their own energy security lines that run through Iran, Saudi Arabia and Iraq. Finally, western interests have been fighting over Middle Eastern resources for centuries – and ultimately that is what lies behind the war today. Is he, or isn’t he, pro-war, people ask about Trump, since he has already signalled that energy dominance will be a key strategy for his Administration. Well, western countries are deep in debt; their fiscal room for manoeuvre is shrinking fast, and bond-holders are beginning to mutiny. There is a race to find a new collateral for fiat currencies. It used to be gold; since the 1970s it was oil, but the petrodollar has faltered. The Anglo-Americans would love to have Iran’s oil again – as they did until the 1970s – to collateralise and build a new money system tied to the real value inherent in commodities. But Trump says he wants to ‘end wars’ and not start them. Does the re-drawing of the geo-political map make some global entente between east and west more, or less, likely? For all the talk of possible Trump ‘deals’ with Iran and Russia, it is likely too early to say whether they will – or can – materialise. Seemingly, Trump has to secure the domestic ‘deal’ first, before he will know whether he has the scope for foreign policy deals. It seems that the Ruling Structures (notably the ‘Never-Trump’ element in the Senate) will allow Trump considerable latitude on key nominations for domesticDepartments and Agencies that manage U.S. political and economic affairs (which is Trump’s key concern) – and will also permit a certain discretion on, shall we say, the ‘warfare’ Departments that targeted Trump over the last years, such as the FBI and the Department of Justice. The putative ‘deal’ seems to be that his nominations will still need to undergo Senate confirmation and must broadly be ‘on-side’ with Inter-Agency foreign policy (notably on Israel). The Inter-Agency grandees, however, reportedly insist on their veto over nominations affecting the deepest structures of foreign policy. And therein lies the crux of matters. Israelis generally are celebrating their ‘victories’. Will this euphoria weigh with U.S. business élites? Hizbullah is contained, Syria is demilitarised, and Iran is not on Israel’s border. The threat to Israel today is of a qualitatively lower order. Is this, in itself, sufficient to allow tensions to ease, or to see some wider understandings to emerge? Much will hang on Netanyahu’s own political circumstances. Should the PM emerge from his criminal Court process relatively unscathed, would he need to take the big ‘bet’ of military action against Iran, with the geo-political map so suddenly transformed?	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWdGQ6ALRIc3FRCIcmNn89c7	2024-12-16T16:19:03-08:00	
Ramifications Of 7/10 Attacks May Be Worse Than 9/11 – Analysis	By Adil Rasheed While some experts claim that the October 7 attacks were worse for Israel than 9/11 was for the US,1 few aver that the Hamas strikes could have more devastating long-term impact for global peace and security than 9/11. There is no denying that 9/11 attacks severely impacted global geopolitics, but the 7/10 Hamas strikes might have serious long-term implications for the world’s security architecture, the Western rules-based order and may engender a Cold War redux leading to a wider conflagration. Tilt in the Geostrategic Keel Undoubtedly, the horrific terrorist attacks of 11 September 2001 shocked millions of people around the world, who viewed the devastation unfold on their television screens in real time. In response, the US achieved initial victories in its global war on terror (GWOT), which marked the acme of its global hegemonic might and influence. However, its protracted wars in Afghanistan and Iraq led to greater instability across West Asia with the onset of Arab Spring in 2011 and the rise of ISIS in 2013. Taking advantage of the US entanglement in West Asia, China and Russia started to rebuild their economic and military might after the virtual collapse of communism and gradually re-emerged as challengers to the Western liberal order, particularly after the 2008 economic meltdown. As the US reluctantly began to withdraw its forces from wars across the ‘larger Middle East’, it ended up ceding power to violent Islamists—Iran-backed Shia parties and militias in Iraq and a resurgent Taliban in Afghanistan. Thus, the chain of events in the decades following 9/11 showed the gradual erosion of US status and influence as the sole superpower of the world, both in economic and political terms, which is now evident in its ambivalent response to the 7 October attacks.2 Cold War Redux: The Shift from Non-State Actors to State Proxies In fact, the 7/10 attacks have shaken global geopolitics in more fundamental ways than 9/11. Terrorist forces seem to have shed off their tag of being violent and irrational non-state actors and have risen to the level of proto-state regimes that insidiously work as proxies for emerging powers out to build an anti-West axis. Unlike the divisive Salafi jihadists, pan-Islamist Shia Iran has started forging alliances not only with Sunni states (the anti-Shia Wahhabis in Saudi Arabia and Qatar) and so-called resistance groups (the Hanafi Hamas and the Zaidi Houthis),3 but also with non-Muslim powers, Russia and China. This has allowed the ‘West vs. Islam’ extremist narrative of the post-9/11 world into becoming a ‘West versus the Rest’ rhetoric, which has the potential of upending the entire global security applecart. Under the banner of a united ‘Global South’, Russia and China are steadily constructing an anti-West geopolitical bloc, thus setting up former colonised states in Asia and Africa against their erstwhile imperialist masters. By keeping the West mired in West Asia and Africa, the emerging challengers are also staving off global attention from their own wars and conflicts in Ukraine and the South China Sea. The Thucydides Trap and West Asia Thus, West Asia has turned into an arena for emerging powers to displace the existing superpower as the regional or international hegemon. In fact, China chose the region for the formal launch of its Global Security Initiative (GSI) last year,4 and has since sought to create a wedge in the US-brokered Abraham Accords of 2020. First, it became the mediator for restoring diplomatic relations between its long-time ally Iran and the new BRICS aspirant, Saudi Arabia. Then, Russia reportedly played its part in bringing the much-reviled Bashar Al-Assad regime back into the fold of the Arab League.5 Finally, China brokered this year a unity deal between all Palestinian factions, including Hamas and Fatah in Beijing, in which the factions agreed to form ‘an interim national unity government’.6 Thus unlike 9/11, which was conducted by largely independent non-state actors like Al-Qaeda, Iran and its proxies (held responsible for the 7/10 attacks) have received both overt and covert support from left-wing groups in the West and new global powers. These strategic alignments might engender more flashpoints for conflict in the rapidly changing Cold War-like global scenario, as exemplified in the recent toppling of Bashar Al-Assad’s regime in Syria.7 Chinks in the Western Armour Add to this the tactics of lawfare, which has divided the Western bloc and riddled it with several internal contradictions. When the US had launched its Global War on Terrorism in 2001 by toppling the then Taliban regime (that had provided a safe haven to Al-Qaeda), much of the world stood united in its condemnation of the terror attacks and a large majority formally supported US-led invasions of both Afghanistan and Iraq. But this time, international organisations have appeared to ignore the terrorist atrocities of 7 October attacks, and seem more focused on Israel’s response in Gaza and Lebanon. In fact, the International Criminal Court has issued arrest warrants against Israeli prime minister and former defence minister and surprisingly, many European countries like Belgium, The Netherlands, Ireland, Lithuania, Slovenia and Spain appear ready to comply with this ruling, while France, Germany and Italy have not rejected it outright. As chinks in the Western bloc continue to widen, the emphasis has shifted from a West-centred ‘rules-based order’ to a supposedly ‘international law-based order’,8which is merely a ruse as few states comply when the ruling goes against them or their allies. Lawfare: Rules-Based Versus Law-Based Order Thus, in February 2024, China told the International Court of Justice, that the Palestinians’ use of armed struggle to gain independence from foreign and colonial rule was 'legitimate' and 'well founded' in international law, thus implicitly legitimising Hamas’ terrorism. In his address to the International Court of Justice in The Hague, Chinese representative Ma Xinmin stated: In pursuit of the right to self-determination, Palestinian people’s use of force to resist foreign oppression and complete the establishment of an independent state is (an) inalienable right well founded in international law.9 Citing resolutions by the UN General Assembly, Beijing’s envoy even asserted that people struggling for self-determination could use 'all available means, including armed struggle'.10 Perhaps, the Chinese diplomat failed to recall at that time the plight of the tortured people in Xinjiang (the mainly Muslim Uyghurs) or the harassed Buddhist Tibetans in his own country, who are also struggling against state oppression. China also apparently used South Africa to file a case of genocide against Israel in the International Criminal Court, banking on that country’s credentials as a former victim of apartheid, as opposed to any Muslim state with a dubious human rights record. It is indeed strange, however, that ANC-led South Africa has denied visit visa to the Dalai Lama thrice in recent years, once stopping him from attending a summit of Nobel laureates in 2014.11 Curiously, the ruling ANC government in South Africa not only has healthy economic ties with China, but even sends its politicians to Beijing for learning non-democratic one party rule.12 This raises questions about South Africa’s own avowed commitment to combat genocide and ethnic cleansing as well as towards its liberal political values. The Narrowing Technological Asymmetry When the US launched its campaign against Afghanistan and Iraq in the aftermath of the 9/11 attacks, the technological asymmetry between the opposing sides was enormous. However, conflicts following 7/10 attacks show a growing parity even on this front, with Houthi militias shooting down advanced US Reaper drones, and Iran launching Russia-developed hypersonic missiles to penetrate Israel’s air defence systems. In the uncertain times ahead, India would have to keep a close watch on the unravelling geopolitical order, particularly the dangerous quartet of growing Chinese cooperation with a theocratic Iran (whose top leadership frequently spews out statements against Kashmir),13 jihadist Taliban in Afghanistan and an increasingly radicalised and restive Pakistan. On India’s eastern front, events unfolding in Bangladesh and lingering extremism in some Southeast Asian states constitute a cause for concern. In these circumstances, the support from India’s minority communities and the empowerment of liberal parties and governments in the neighbourhood could help secure our national goals and larger geopolitical interests.

The Middle Class In The Philippines: Growing But Vulnerable – Ana...	By Jose Ramon G. Albert The middle class plays a crucial role in driving economic growth and development in many countries. In the Philippines, the expansion of the middle class is seen as an important indicator of economic progress, improved living standards, and social stability. As the primary driver of consumer spending and a key source of human capital, understanding and supporting this segment of society is essential for sustainable economic development. Recent data from the 2021 Family Income and Expenditure Survey (FIES), conducted by the Philippine Statistics Authority (PSA), provides valuable insights into the composition, growth, and challenges facing the Filipino middle class. There is no single agreed-upon definition of the middle class. Sociologists often define it in terms of education, occupation, and social values, while economists tend to use income-based measures.[1] In the Philippines, market researchers also cluster households into five socioeconomic classifications based on the quality of consumers (i.e., employment and educational characteristics of family members), as well as household assets, amenities, and facilities.[2] Much of the economic literature, on the other hand, uses monetary measures (e.g., income or consumption) to define the middle class.[3] An approach in the Philippines that is gaining popularity is to define the middle class as those households with per capita incomes between 2 and 12 times the official poverty rate.[4] Using this definition, about 40% of the Philippine population belonged to the middle-income class in 2023. Figure 1 shows that for a family of five in 2021, the monthly family income thresholds for the middle class translate to a monthly income range of approximately PHP 25,000 to PHP 145,000. This definition groups households with incomes substantially above subsistence levels but below those of the upper echelons of society. By this definition, as much as 4 in 10 Filipinos (39.8%) and nearly half (47.4%) of families can be considered middle-income class Figure 1. Who are the Filipino Middle Class? Source: The middle class can be further broken down into three sub-groups: Lower-middle income: those with per capita incomes between 2-4 times the poverty line Middle-middle income: those with per capita incomes between 4-7 times the poverty line Upper-middle income: those with per capita incomes between 7-12 times the poverty line This income-based definition allows for tracking the size and characteristics of the middle class over time using household survey data. However, it is worth noting that income alone does not fully capture all aspects of middle-class status and values.[5] A RISING TIDE: CHARTING MIDDLE CLASS GROWTH The growth trajectory of the Filipino middle class has been remarkable over the past three decades, expanding from 28.5% of the population in 1991 to 39.8% in 2021 (Figure 1). The share of the middle class peaked at 43.5% in 2018 before declining to 39.8% in 2021, likely due to the economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. This recent setback underscores the vulnerability of the middle class to economic shocks. It also highlights the need for robust social protection systems and other strategies.[6] The growth of the Philippine middle class has been relatively slow compared to that in some other countries, especially in the region (i.e., if we adopt cross-country comparable data and thresholds). From 1990 to 2008, the middle class in Vietnam grew by 33 percentage points and in Indonesia by 12 points. The slower expansion of the middle class in the Philippines may be attributed to several factors: Periods of economic and political instability in the 1980s and early 1990s;[7] High levels of inequality that persisted despite economic growth and which led to slower poverty reduction; and Lack of structural transformation in the economy, with limited growth in the high-productivity sectors.[8] The PSA reported that poverty went down from 2021 to 2023,[9] so it is expected that the share of the middle class rose in this period. However actual figures will only be available once the PSA releases the microdata of the 2023 FIES. CHARACTERISTICS OF THE MIDDLE CLASS Several studies have identified several key characteristics that distinguish middle-income households in the Philippines: Urban concentration: As of 2021, three-fifths (60.6%) of urban residents belonged to the middle class, compared to only a third (33.8%) among rural communities. Urban centres often offer more diverse employment opportunities and higher wages, contributing to the expansion of the middle class. However, quality jobs are dependent on high educational attainment and skills. Education: Middle-class Filipinos tend to have higher levels of education compared to low-income groups (Figure 2). In 2021, 40.6% of middle-class Filipinos aged 15 and above had completed a college education, compared to only 14.5% of their low-income counterparts. Figure 2. How Educated are Low-, Middle- and Upper- Income Classes of Filipinos aged 15 and over. Note: Author’s computations from the 2021 FIES, PSA Employment: Middle-class workers are more likely to have stable formal-sector jobs. About 80% of employed middle-income individuals have permanent jobs, compared to 65% among low-income workers. They are also less likely to work in agriculture and are more concentrated in services and manufacturing. Family size: Middle-income households tend to have smaller family sizes, with an average of 4.2 members compared to 5.3 for low-income families. They also have lower dependency ratios. Asset ownership: Middle-class households have higher rates of ownership for consumer durables like refrigerators, televisions, and cars. They are also more likely to own their homes. Access to services: The middle class has better access to electricity, safe water, and sanitation compared to low-income groups. These characteristics reflect the causes and consequences of achieving middle-income status. Higher education and stable employment help households attain middle-class incomes, while smaller family sizes and asset accumulation are often the results of improved economic status. Importantly, many of these middle-class characteristics — especially higher education levels and formal sector employment — are associated with greater economic resilience and upward mobility. ECONOMIC ROLE OF THE MIDDLE CLASS The middle class is often seen as an engine of economic growth and development. Economic theory and empirical research have identified several ways that a robust middle class can drive prosperity: Consumer demand: With higher disposable incomes, the middle class provides a key source of consumer demand for goods and services, helping to drive economic growth.[10] In the Philippines, middle-income households spend more on education, healthcare, and durable goods than low-income families. Human capital investment: Middle-class families tend to invest more in education and skills development for their children, building human capital that fuels long-term economic growth. The high value placed on education is evident in the Philippines, where middle-income families spend much more on education than low-income households. Entrepreneurship: In many countries, the middle class has been an important source of entrepreneurship and small business formation. However, in the Philippines, this effect appears more limited – lower-income groups actually have higher rates of self-employment and entrepreneurship, often out of necessity rather than opportunity. Tax base: A larger middle class provides a broader tax base to fund public goods and services. In the Philippines, the expansion of the middle class has coincided with growth in tax revenues. Demand for institutional quality: Middle-class citizens often push for better governance, institutions, and public services. However, this effect may be limited in the Philippines, where the middle class has shown a tendency to opt for private services rather than pressuring for improved public options.[11] While the Philippine middle class plays some of these positive economic roles, its impact appears more muted compared with other countries. This may be due to the country’s limited size and economic vulnerability. Political Influence of the Middle Class The Philippine middle class has become increasingly influential in shaping political outcomes, but not always in ways that benefit broader development goals: Middle-class voters appear to have strongly supported populist candidates and policies in recent elections (this is in line with observations in other countries).[12] Government policies like free tuition at state universities and recent tax reforms have disproportionately benefited middle-income groups rather than the poor. There are indications that public spending is becoming more aligned with middle-class priorities (e.g., crime reduction) at the expense of pro-poor programmes.[13] These trends suggest that the growing middle class is flexing its political muscle – but not necessarily in ways that promote inclusive development or strengthen democratic institutions. Some analysts argue this reflects the economic insecurity of the Philippine middle class, making them susceptible to populist appeals. Others point to a growing disconnect between middle-class Filipinos and the poor, with the former prioritising their narrower interests. VULNERABILITIES OF THE MIDDLE CLASS Despite its growth, the Philippine middle class remains economically vulnerable in several ways: Economic shocks: Many middle-income households, especially those in the lower-middle segment, remain at risk of falling into poverty due to job loss, health emergencies, or other shocks. The COVID-19 pandemic highlighted this vulnerability. Reliance on remittances: About 13% of middle-income households have a member working overseas, and many rely heavily on remittances. This leaves them exposed to external economic conditions and changes in migration policies. Job insecurity: While middle-class workers are more likely to have formal-sector jobs, many still face concerns about job security and limited opportunities for advancement. Education quality concerns: Although middle-class families invest heavily in education, there are growing concerns about the quality and relevance of education in preparing young people for a vastly changing job market, especially given increased automation. These vulnerabilities help explain why many in the middle class feel economically insecure; this vulnerability appears to be shaping their political behaviour and policy preferences. CONCENTRATIONS OF THE MIDDLE CLASS Regional disparities in middle-class concentration are evident, with areas like the National Capital Region (NCR), Region IV-A (CALABARZON), and Central Luzon having a larger middle-class presence than in others (Figure 3). The recent decline in middle-class share from 2018 to 2021 demonstrates the vulnerability of this group to economic disruptions, with many families, particularly those in the lower-middle segment, at risk of falling into poverty during crises. Figure 3. Distribution of Filipinos by Regions and by Income classes: 2021 Addressing regional disparities through targeted investments in infrastructure, education, and economic opportunities can foster middle-class growth in lagging regions. Expanding access to financial services tailored to middle-class needs can help families build and protect their assets. Improving the quality and accessibility of healthcare services can prevent middle-class families from falling into poverty due to catastrophic health expenses. CONCLUSION: THE MIDDLE CLASS AND NATIONAL PROGRESS The Philippines aspires to become a predominantly middle-class society by 2040[14] Thus, nurturing and expanding this vital segment of the population is key to achieving sustainable and equitable development. The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted both the resilience and the vulnerabilities of the Philippine middle class. Several key challenges and opportunities will shape the future of the middle class in the Philippines: Digital transformation: The rapid pace of technological change and digitalisation presents both opportunities and risks for the middle class. While digital technologies can create new economic opportunities and improve access to services, there is also a risk of job displacement and a growing digital divide. Climate change: The Philippines is highly vulnerable to the impacts of c.limate change,[15] including rising sea levels, more frequent and intense natural disasters, and changing weather patterns. These impacts can disproportionately affect the middle class through damage to property, disruption of livelihoods, and increased costs for adaptation and resilience. Investing in climate-resilient infrastructure, promoting sustainable urban development, and supporting the transition to a low-carbon economy will be essential for protecting middle-class assets and livelihoods. Demographic shifts: The Philippines is experiencing demographic changes, including an ageing population and continued urbanisation. These shifts have implications for healthcare, social services, and urban infrastructure needs. Policies that support healthy aging, lifelong learning, and sustainable urban development will be crucial for maintaining and expanding the middle class as the population ages and becomes increasingly urban. Global economic integration: As a middle-income country with a large overseas workforce, the Philippines is deeply integrated into the global economy. While this integration brings opportunities for trade, investment, and remittances, it also exposes the country to external economic shocks. Strengthening domestic industries, diversifying the economy, and enhancing the skills and competitiveness of the workforce will be important. Inequality and social mobility: Despite the growth of the middle class, inequality remains a significant challenge in the Philippines. Addressing barriers to social mobility, such as unequal access to quality education and healthcare, will be crucial. To address these challenges and harness opportunities for middle-class expansion, policymakers should consider the following priorities: Invest in human capital development: Strengthen the education system at all levels, with a focus on improving quality and relevance to labor market needs. This includes investing in early childhood education, enhancing STEM education, promoting vocational and technical training, and supporting lifelong learning initiatives. Promote inclusive innovation and entrepreneurship: Support the development of a vibrant startup ecosystem and encourage innovation across all sectors of the economy. This can include measures such as improving access to finance for MSMEs, streamlining business regulations, and providing targeted support for high-potential industries. Enhance social protection systems: Develop more comprehensive and adaptive social protection programmes that can support the middle class during economic shocks and transitions. This may include unemployment insurance, portable benefits for gig workers, and expanded healthcare coverage. Improve urban planning and infrastructure: Invest in sustainable urban development and infrastructure that can support a growing middle class, including affordable housing, efficient public transportation, and green spaces. Promote environmental sustainability: Integrate climate change adaptation and mitigation measures into all aspects of economic planning and development to build a more resilient middle class and protect natural resources for future generations. Foster digital inclusion: Expand access to digital infrastructure, devices, and skills training to ensure that all segments of society can participate in and benefit from the digital economy. Strengthen governance and institutions: Improve the efficiency, transparency, and accountability of government institutions in order to build public trust and create a more enabling environment for middle-class growth. By implementing these policies, the Philippines can work towards realising its vision of becoming a predominantly middle-class society by 2040. By fostering a more inclusive, resilient, and dynamic middle class, the Philippines can build a stronger foundation for long-term prosperity and social progress.

Kim Jong Un’s Military First Policy: Militarism As A Symbol Of He...	North Korea’s Military First Policy, or Songun, stands as a fundamental pillar of its governance, intricately interwoven into the nation’s ideological and political fabric. Under Kim Jong Un's leadership, this policy has solidified, merging militaristic ideologies with a strategic emphasis on showcasing nuclear capabilities. Analyzing Kim Jong Un's leadership reveals a clear embodiment of hegemonic masculinity, characterized by a focus on militarism, nuclear capabilities, and an overarching sense of invulnerability. The Foundations of Military First Policy and Hegemonic Masculinity The Military First Policy emerged following the passing of Kim Il Sung in 1994, marked a pivotal moment in the leadership transition to his son, Kim Jong Il. In the wake of international isolation and the disintegration of the Soviet Union, North Korea emerged in a precarious state, grappling with significant vulnerabilities. The policy strategically positions the military at the forefront of state power, elevating it above all other institutions. This framing casts the military not only as the vanguard of the revolution but also as the essential protector of national sovereignty. This strategic pivot underscored the critical importance of military power, not merely as a means of survival, but as a vital assertion of North Korea’s sovereignty in the face of external challenges, especially from the United States and South Korea. Kim Jong Un has prioritized the military-first doctrine by intertwining it with a robust projection of hegemonic masculinity, marking a significant evolution in his leadership strategy. Hegemonic masculinity encapsulates the prevailing social constructs that link male power to characteristics like authority, strength, aggressiveness, and the capacity to exert dominance. Kim Jong Un’s leadership exemplifies a commitment to national defense, positioning himself as the quintessential guardian of the state, while embodying the archetypes of strength and determination. His public appearances—frequently at military parades, missile tests, and weapon exhibitions—strategically underscores his grip on the nation and reinforce his claim to military supremacy. By taking this approach, he establishes himself as a formidable male leader, reinforcing his authority at home while simultaneously crafting a narrative of defiance on the global stage. Militarism and the Nuclearization: A Manifestation of Hegemonic Masculinity Under Kim Jong Un's leadership, the military based on militarism has assumed a progressively pivotal position within North Korean society. The rise of the military serves as both a calculated political manoeuvre and a significant cultural framework. The Songun policy permeates daily life in North Korea, where the military is exalted as the pinnacle of loyalty and patriotism. Within this framework, military service emerges as the pinnacle of masculine obligation, solidifying a gendered hierarchy that positions men as the focal point of national defense and state preservation. The militarization of North Korean society also reinforces the focus on men as the core of North Korea’s strength, where masculinity is equated with power and military service is the highest form of national service. This gendered framing constructs a society where masculine ideals are intertwined with military prowess, placing men in dominant positions while relegating women to secondary roles. Kim Jong Un has adeptly positioned North Korea’s nuclear program as a formidable symbol of national sovereignty and a testament to his own authority. Under his leadership, North Korea has strategically advanced its nuclear capabilities, encompassing tactical nuclear weapons and intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs). The weapons in question transcend their role as instruments of national defense; they represent a clear embodiment of Kim Jong Un’s assertion of hegemonic masculinity. Nuclear weapons in North Korea represent a calculated assertion of power, showcasing resilience and a bold defiance in the face of perceived external threats. The successful tests of North Korea’s nuclear devices under Kim Jong Un, including the miniaturized nuclear device tested in 2013 and the hydrogen bomb test of 2016, underscore the regime’s strategic focus on reinforcing its power through militarization and nuclearization. Nuclear weapons transcend their role as not merely instruments of war; rather functioned as pivotal tools for projecting power and asserting dominance within the global arena. Kim Jong Un has consistently articulated his view that nuclear weapons are crucial to the regime's survival and its broader deterrence strategy. This reflects the principles of hegemonic masculinity, illustrating that dominance and strength are manifested not only through military might but also through the control of weapons of mass destruction. The regime's blatant disregard for international sanctions, exemplified by its nuclear tests and missile launches, underscores a steadfast refusal to retreat from its confrontational stance, thereby bolstering the narrative of invulnerability and dominance. Moreover, the narrative surrounding North Korea’s nuclearization under Kim Jong Un frequently emphasizes themes of self-defense and national sovereignty. Kim Jong Un has unequivocally asserted that North Korea's nuclear status is non-negotiable, firmly indicating that any prospects for denuclearization are categorically dismissed. This position not only bolsters the masculine imagery of strength and dominance but also acts as a strategy for consolidating power within the regime. In asserting his role as the leader of a nuclear-armed state, Kim Jong Un strategically solidifies his image as the paramount guardian of the nation, enhancing his influence on both domestic and international fronts. Nuclear Law In 2022, the North Korean Supreme People’s Assembly enacted a new nuclear law, which solidified the country’s status as a nuclear weapons state. This law outlines the conditions under which North Korea would use nuclear weapons, emphasizing the principle of self-defense and the readiness to retaliate against any perceived external aggression. The law’s provisions underscore North Korea’s commitment to its nuclear arsenal, reaffirming the idea that the military and nuclear weapons are integral to the state’s survival and Kim Jong Un’s personal power. This legal framework also reinforces the hegemonic masculinity at the heart of Kim Jong Un’s rule. The law centralizes nuclear control under the President of the State Affairs, effectively consolidating Kim’s authority over the country’s most powerful weapons. By placing nuclear weapons under his direct command, Kim Jong Un positions himself as the ultimate authority, capable of making life-and-death decisions for the nation. The law’s emphasis on nuclear readiness and self-defense reflects a belief in masculine strength as the defining characteristic of national power. In this sense, nuclear weapons are not only tools of defense but also symbols of the regime’s unyielding power and Kim Jong Un’s personal dominance. Nuclear Diplomacy and Kim Jong Un’s Masculine Leadership Kim Jong Un’s interactions with international leaders further exemplify his reliance on hegemonic masculinity. His engagements with world leaders, particularly with the United States, South Korea, and China, are often framed through the lens of power dynamics. Kim Jong Un has used his country’s nuclear capabilities as leverage in negotiations, emphasizing that North Korea’s strength lies in its nuclear arsenal. This strategic use of military power is a direct reflection of hegemonic masculinity, where strength, defiance, and control are central to the leadership narrative. For instance, Kim Jong Un’s Summit with U.S. President Donald Trump in 2018 was a pivotal moment in international diplomacy, marked by the symbolism of nuclear weapons and military strength. The summit, while largely seen as a diplomatic gesture, was also a way for Kim Jong Un to project his image as a powerful leader, willing to negotiate from a position of strength. Even as diplomatic talks faltered in subsequent years, the possession of nuclear weapons allowed Kim Jong Un to maintain his standing as a leader who could not be easily coerced or intimidated by external powers. In this context, nuclear weapons are more than just instruments of defense; they are tools for asserting masculinity on the global stage. By leveraging his country’s nuclear capabilities, Kim Jong Un projects an image of a leader who is unyielding and unafraid to confront powerful nations, further solidifying his image as a masculine, authoritarian figure. Gun vs Butter The prioritization of military strength and nuclear capabilities over human development has led to widespread economic deprivation. The resources allocated to the military and the nuclear program often come at the expense of social welfare, health, and education. The economic strain caused by this militaristic focus disproportionately affects the civilian population, particularly women and children, who are often the most vulnerable to economic hardship. As North Korea continues to prioritize military power, the potential for a more inclusive, human-centered approach to governance remains limited. The policy of Songun and its emphasis on nuclear strength highlight the limitations of a governance model rooted in hegemonic masculinity, where the needs of marginalized groups, particularly women and civilians, are consistently overlooked. Conclusion Kim Jong Un’s leadership in North Korea is deeply intertwined with the concept of hegemonic masculinity, which plays a critical role in shaping both domestic policies and international relations. Through the Songun policy, the emphasis on militarism, and the development of nuclear weapons, Kim Jong Un has positioned himself as a powerful, masculine leader, willing to assert dominance over both his people and the international community. However, this approach, rooted in militarism and nuclearization, has significant gendered and social consequences, reinforcing patriarchal structures and exacerbating economic hardship for many North Koreans. While Kim Jong Un’s nuclear strategy has reinforced his regime’s survival and enhanced North Korea’s international stature, it has also perpetuated systemic inequalities, deepened the country’s isolation and limited opportunities for broader social and economic development. The intersection of militarism and hegemonic masculinity in North Korea’s governance highlights the limitations and contradictions inherent in a leadership style that prioritizes power, aggression, and control over the well-being of the people.

An ICC Arrest Warrant For Myanmar Junta Chief Is Too Little, Too ...	By David Hutt There’s occasionally something to be said for symbolic gestures, but I struggle to get too worked up over the news that an International Criminal Court (ICC) prosecutor has finally applied for an arrest warrant for Min Aung Hlaing, Myanmar’s junta chief. The Nov. 27 request is specifically over his military’s ethnic cleansing of the Muslim-minority group, the Rohingya, between 2017 and 2018. Human Rights Watch called it a 'major step towards justice for the country’s Rohingya population.' Amnesty International regarded it as a 'decisive step and an important signal.' My disappointment is for two reasons: the local and the global. The ICC hasn’t yet issued an arrest warrant; a prosecutor has applied for one. But even if a warrant is forthcoming, it won’t be acted upon. Min Aung Hlaing won’t be hauled to The Hague while his junta holds power over much of the country and has the backing of Beijing. If his junta defeats the revolutionary forces and ends the civil war, Min Aung Hlaing won’t voluntarily make a sojourn to the Netherlands. If his junta falls and is replaced by a new, federal democratic Myanmar, we should vehemently oppose an international tribunal in favor of a local trial. In that eventuality, Min Aung Hlaing would have much more barbarism to answer to than only the Rohingya genocide. China won’t act Nor will an arrest warrant, if produced, alter the civil war itself. Min Aung Hlaing won’t give a fig; he claims lineage from the generals who for decades happily impoverished the nation and regarded citizens as property of the state. Nor does Min Aung Hlaing have a real desire or need to leave Myanmar for anywhere other than China, which offered him his first invitation since the coup last month. Yet China isn’t a member of the ICC, so won’t act upon an arrest warrant. From Southeast Asia, only Cambodia and Timor-Leste are signatories to the Rome Statute, so Min Aung Hlaing could visit any of the other nine states and probably wouldn’t be touched. One might retort that the importance of the request for an arrest warrant lies in the 'optics.' Certainly it’s a bad look for Southeast Asia. Yet, what optics is this request supposed to change regarding Myanmar? Granted, if the truth isn’t repeatedly stated, it risks being drowned by lies. Yet the military’s crimes against the Rohingya have already been abundantly documented. The UN has called it 'textbook ethnic cleansing.' The United States government called it a 'genocide' in 2022. If anyone needs convincing almost a decade on from the genocide and three years on from the military coup that Min Aung Hlaing isn’t a nice chap they’ve intentionally overlooked the evidence already to hand. It isn’t as though most foreign governments have been sitting on the fence since 2021 waiting for something like an ICC arrest warrant before making up their mind whether they’re pro- or anti-junta. The ICC prosecutor’s decision won’t isolate Min Aung Hlaing and his junta amongst friendly countries, nor motivate any more solidarity for the anti-junta revolutionaries from unfriendly states. Waning global interest Did China – not a signatory of the Rome Statute – even muster a shrug when this news of the warrant request broke? Is the United States – also not a signatory – now going to start supplying the anti-junta militias with proper weaponry because an international court might charge Min Aung Hlaing? The ICC prosecutor failed to request an arrest warrant for Aung San Suu Kyi, who, though now deposed and detained, was head of the civilian government while the military was butchering the Rohingyas — a crime that Suu Kyi herself travelled to The Hague in 2017 to defend. The global aspect of the problem is equally discouraging. In June, Rohingya community members expressed disappointment at an ICC Pre-Trial Chamber that 'enthusiasm for the ICC’s investigation appears to be at an all-time low.' Prosecutors should have started requesting arrest warrants in 2017, but the ICC only started investigations in 2019. It was too late by the time of the February 2021 coup. Bad timing But now the ICC prosecutor’s request for a warrant couldn’t have come at a worse moment. Just weeks earlier, the international court also issued arrest warrants for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and several members of his cabinet. The ICC is now a spent force – a pariah not only in Moscow and other despotic nations but also in some Western capitals. The United States has already rejected the court’s warrant for Netanyahu, and some Republicans want to sanction any country that assists the ICC in its pursuit of him. The French government says it won’t comply with the Netanyahu warrant either because Israel isn’t a member of the ICC. But neither is Myanmar a party to the Rome Statute, so hasn’t Paris just given Min Aung Hlaing a kind of Western-backed immunity? For years the ICC has tried to rid itself of the criticism that it only goes after rulers of poor, internationally-weak nations while ignoring the crimes of first world leaders. Unfortunately, by seeking to prosecute the leaders of Israel and Myanmar in the space of a few weeks, the court may have succeeded in removing that stigma – but at the cost of its credibility and authority.

The Three Aspects Of Understanding The Current World – OpEd	By White Mountain After the fragmentation of global space, there is the emergence of 'regional hegemonic states'. I have previously discussed this topic extensively, noting that countries such as Iran, Turkey, Israel, India, Russia, South Africa, and others being defined as regional hegemonic states. When we first defined 'regional hegemonic states', the world was still embroiled in debates over whether globalization would really lead to de-globalization. Interestingly, regarding Russia, can one consider it a global power today? It would be hard to find many who would deny that now. However, in the past, there were countless mistakes and misjudgments on this matter, especially among Europeans. Of course, Vladimir Putin himself does not wish for Russia to be a regional hegemon; he has always aspired for Russia to be a global power. However, objectively speaking, Russia has become a regional hegemon, and I believe that in the future, this situation could become a geopolitical bargaining chip for the United States. I would like to point out that, in reality, de-globalization is not merely a matter of conceptual definition. It is no longer the case that only regional hegemonic states are emerging. Countries worldwide will increasingly have to engage with numerous 'regional armed organizations', even if they must do so reluctantly. This will be an unavoidable reality, as seen with entities such as Syria's Hayat Tahrir al-Sham. In fact, the greater the number of such groups, the more profound their influence. This brings the theory of de-globalization into three aspects. At the top level are polarized states, such as the United States. The next tier consists of the 'regional hegemonic states' mentioned earlier, such as Turkey, India, Israel, and others. The third level encompasses 'regional armed organizations', which, despite lacking defined borders, governance, or state structures, they possess real existence, organizational systems, and regional influence. Viewed through these three aspects, the world has become more chaotic. Conventional geopolitical scholarship is effectively in disarray, devolving into idle speculation. Universities across the world must now reassess and reorganize their academic content, publishing a new generation of works. I leave this task to the professors, confident that they will perform admirably. Otherwise, a new wave of young professors will rise to replace them. Social science, after all, is a 'science of the battlefield'.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWemupebX1drw-WORjVcR0c0	2024-12-15T16:27:33-08:00	
Approaching National Bankruptcy And The Wisdom Of The Anti-Federa...	The 2024 election is in the rearview mirror. Republicans, for the most part, rejoice at the change of leadership. Democrats, on the other hand, mourn as their functionaries pack bags and leave Washington, D.C. The former celebrate as if they have destroyed the ring of Sauron and returned peace to Middle Earth. The latter fear a big orange Orc plundering Gondor and the end of civilization. Republicans and Democrats should pause from their celebration/lamentation to recognize a fundamental truth: Without structural changes to the Constitution of 1787, no change of personnel in the federal government can pull the American ox cart out of the ditch. Where should we for look for solutions? The Anti-Federalist opponents of the Constitution—written off by modern historians—predicted how sundry constitutional provisions would be abused. The Anti-Federalists were not mere complainers but suggested many amendments and alterations to address the problems they observed. Unfortunately, the First Congress ignored their suggestions when crafting the batch of amendments we call the Bill of Rights. Americans serious about governmental reform should dust off the Anti-Federalist writings and study the thought of these forgotten Americans. The U.S. national debt is $36 trillion. That’s almost $107,000 per citizen. In 2023, the federal government took in $4.4 trillion and spent $6.1 trillion. Such a trend is not sustainable. Interest payments on the national debt will soon be the largest federal expenditure—more than defense, Social Security or Medicare. Anti-Federalists expressed concern about Congress’ power to borrow. A writer using the penname 'Brutus' observed that 'Congress may mortgage any or all revenues of the union, as a fund to loan money upon, and it is probable in this way, they may borrow of foreign nations, a principal sum, the interest of which will be equal to the annual revenues of the country.' Brutus envisioned a substantial national debt unlikely ever to be retired. Hence, he believed it was 'unwise and improvident to vest in the general government, a power to borrow at discretion, without any limitation or restriction.' He suggested that the Constitution require a two-thirds congressional majority to permit borrowing. Although Brutus made this suggestion 237 years ago, it is still not too late to listen to him. Such a constitutional amendment would give fiscally responsible senators and representatives a club to beat back our profligate spending. With our fiscal house in disarray, one might expect that representatives and senators are facing an angry public at the polls. Not so. In 2024, 98.5% of House incumbents won reelection and 90.9% of Senate incumbents prevailed. Incumbency is a tremendous advantage for a candidate. Rotation in office was critical to our first federal constitution’s (the Articles of Confederation) efforts to limit congressional power. According to historian Gordon Wood, motivating factors for term limits under the Articles were fears of establishing an American ruling aristocracy and the belief that public service should be open to men equally talented (or perhaps more so) as the old guard. The Constitution of 1787 is silent on term limits, and this raised the ire of Anti-Federalists. 'ROTATION, that noble prerogative of liberty, is entirely excluded from the new system of government, and great men may and probably will be continued in office during their lives,' predicted 'An Officer of the Late Continental Army.' Similarly, Mercy Otis Warren, writing as a 'Columbian Patriot,' abjured, 'There is no provision for a rotation, nor any thing to prevent the perpetuity of office in the same hands for life; which by a little well-timed bribery, will probably be done, to the exclusion of men of the best abilities from their share in the offices of the government.' Term limits might not be a panacea for the political ailments of the country, but the states should be allowed to impose them on members of their congressional delegations. If the experiment does not produce results, the states can return to the present system of possible perpetual reelection. We should at least give federal rotation in office a chance via a constitutional amendment. Amateurs can do no worse than our professional ruling class has done. A significant impediment to reform is that amendments to the Constitution are controlled by Congress. The Anti-Federalists objected to congressional control over the amendment procedure. 'An Old Whig' observed, 'People once possessed of power are always loth to part with it; and we shall never find two-thirds of a Congress voting or proposing any thing which shall derogate from their own authority and importance, or agreeing to give back to the people any part of those privileges which they have once parted with.' 'The Federal Farmer' also expected Congress would 'be exceedingly artful and adroit in preventing any measures' limiting national power. If such alterations could be obtained, he predicted they would come from 'great exertions and severe struggles on the part of the common people.' The Anti-Federalists would appreciate the following: 'An amendment proposed by one or more of the several states shall be valid to all intents and purposes, as part of this Constitution, when ratified by the Legislatures of three fourths of the several States, or by Conventions in three fourths thereof.' Such an amendment procedure would give the states and the people a fighting chance to defend themselves against a consolidated national government that continuously operates in an extra-constitutional manner. Republicans can cheer the election of Donald Trump and Democrats can plan for 2028. But absent from addressing structural problems in our system, we face national bankruptcy gifted to us by a perpetual ruling class. It is time to give the Anti-Federalists a fair hearing.

Trump’s Economic Policies: The Good, The Bad, And The Uncertain –...	By Jon Wolfenbarger The US economy is ultimately driven by millions of people working hard to create and trade goods and services, but the US federal government can impact the economy in three main ways: 1) fiscal and regulatory policy: impacts production and who benefits and loses; 2) foreign policy and war: impacts production, life, and quality of life; and, 3) monetary policy: impacts inflation/deflation and boom-bust cycles. The key lesson of economic science was articulated well by Adam Smith in 1776 and has been repeated by all knowledgeable economists since then, including Ludwig von Mises and Murray N. Rothbard: free the economy! That means to avoid any counterproductive government interventions in voluntary trade and private property rights. Economic science teaches us that good fiscal and regulatory policy is to minimize government taxes, spending, and bureaucratic red tape. Good foreign policy is to pursue diplomacy, peace, and free trade with all countries whenever possible. Good monetary policy is to prevent artificial expansion of the money supply, which causes price inflation and the boom-bust cycle. Trump’s Economic Policies—The Good Trump has proposed a wide variety of economic policies for his second term, most of which are similar to his first term. Here are the positive ones based on economic science: Tax Cuts: Tax cuts are always good from a free-market perspective. Tax cuts allow hard-working Americans to keep more of their money for spending, saving, and investing. Investing in new equipment and technology raises labor productivity, wages, and living standards. Trump is proposing to extend the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act provisions, which are set to expire after 2025. This includes maintaining lower individual tax rates and a higher standard deduction. He favors reducing the corporate tax rate to 15 percent. He is also talking about eliminating income taxes on Social Security benefits and exempting tipped income and overtime pay from taxation. Deregulation: Deregulation is also always good free-market policy, since it eliminates bureaucratic red tape and frees entrepreneurs to create new businesses and jobs. It also lessens production costs. Trump wants to reduce regulations in the energy sector, in particular, to promote domestic production, which would help lower energy prices and reduce US reliance on Middle Eastern theocracies for energy. Trump’s Economic Policies—The Bad Higher Spending: Spending cuts are also always good from a free-market perspective, since they leave more resources in the private economy and lessen distortions brought about by spending. A good example of how beneficial cutting spending can be is post-World War II, when federal spending was slashed by 45 percent and there was a postwar boom. This is proof that Keynesian economics has everything backward. Trump has proposed spending more on infrastructure. This usually leads to wasteful spending and corruption with lots of money going to favored government contractors. It also distorts the price and capital structure by diverting money and resources to areas of the market where they would not otherwise go. Of course, it would be better to privatize as much infrastructure as possible. Trump has suggested Elon Musk could be 'Secretary of Cost-Cutting,' with a goal of cutting $2 trillion or more from the federal government’s $6.7 trillion budget. However, this will be very difficult to implement, as Trump has promised to not cut Social Security, Medicare, national defense, veterans programs and Federal pensions, which comprise over 80% of spending. Tariffs & Protectionism: Tariffs and protectionism are always bad for living standards, as proven by economists like David Ricardo in the 1800s. Tariffs are a tax on US consumers for buying foreign goods. Tariffs also distort the structure of production, tend to lead to higher prices, and can even make domestic producers less competitive overall. Trump is proposing a 10 to 20 percent tariff on all imported goods and a 60 to 100 percent tariff on Chinese imports. He has also proposed a 200 tariff on automobiles imported from Mexico, as well as a 25 percent tariff on all Mexican imports if Mexico fails to prevent illegal migrants from crossing into the US. Trump’s Economic Policies—The Uncertain Reduce Fed Independence: Trump and Vice President Vance have talked about limiting the Federal Reserve’s independence by allowing presidential influence over interest rates and potentially removing Chair Jay Powell from office. If this means that Trump wants to encourage lower interest rates and more artificial money creation, that would be bad, as it would lead to higher inflation and a more intense boom-bust cycle. If, on the other hand, they could really limit or eliminate Fed 'independence' and put monetary policy in the hands of elected officials rather than unelected bureaucrats like Powell, that could be very positive, though it would still imply that interest rates ought to be politically-determined rather than determined on the free market. Foreign Policy & War: Trump was the only US president in recent memory who didn’t start any major new wars. He says he wants to end the war with Russia, which has cost over one million lives, $175 billion so far in US taxpayer money, could lead to World War III, and even risks nuclear war. However, it is less clear what he wants to do with the conflicts in the Middle East and he is generally antagonistic towards China. Immigration: The US economy needs peaceful hard-working people to grow the economy, but it does not need people who commit crimes and go on welfare paid for by hard-working, taxpaying Americans. It remains to be seen what, if anything, Trump can do to improve the immigration system in the US. The Boom-Bust Business Cycle under Trump? The Fed created 40 percent more dollars in 2020 in response to covid. This caused the highest price inflation rates in over 40 years, not to mention the bubbles and market distortions as a result. That forced the Fed to hike interest rates at the most aggressive pace since the early 1980s. That caused the biggest decline in the money supply and the longest yield curve inversion since the Great Depression of the 1930s. If this does not lead to a recession, it will be the first time in history. The unemployment rate has risen 0.7 percent and every time it has risen at least 0.5 percent, there has been a recession. Housing starts have fallen significantly and leading economic indexes are pointing to recession. Thus, a recession is highly likely over the coming year or two regardless of what Trump does. The big question is inflation and interest rates. If the Fed cuts rates aggressively, as they have been doing in recent months, that could lead to a resurgence of price inflation during a recession. That would be 'stagflation,' which is the worst situation for American living standards. Conclusion One hopes that Trump will implement more free market-oriented policies, rather than interventions that harm the free market. The main near-term problem for the economy is that the Fed has already hiked rates at a pace that will likely lead to a recession and is now cutting rates despite stubbornly high inflation. Thus, we should hope for the best, but prepare for the worst. About the author: Jon Wolfenbarger is Founder and CEO of Bull And Bear Profits, an investment website. Send him email.

The Illusion Of Instant Motivation: How Social Media Short Clips ...	In today's digital age, platforms like Instagram, Facebook, and YouTube are flooded with motivational content, ranging from short video clips to random images adorned with inspirational quotes. With a swipe or a tap, users can consume a quick dose of motivation, promising to transform their mindset, boost their energy, or help them tackle life's challenges. These brief, often superficial pieces of content are designed to offer quick emotional gratification and encourage immediate action. Yet, a closer look at the psychological, philosophical, and neurobiological implications of this phenomenon reveals a darker side: this type of motivation may be impeding the very progress it claims to promote. While these social media motivational tools can create a temporary sense of empowerment, they fail to offer the deep, sustained drive that real motivation requires. To understand why, we need to explore the interplay between psychoanalysis, philosophy, and motivation. The key question is whether the instantaneous gratification provided by these platforms can lead to lasting change or if it ultimately fosters a cycle of dependency on external validation and quick fixes. The Allure of Instant Gratification and the Fragility of Motivational Boosts The human desire for immediate gratification is a well-established psychological phenomenon. According to Sigmund Freud, individuals often seek quick pleasures as a way to reduce anxiety and discomfort, which is part of the human tendency toward the pleasure principle. In modern terms, social media plays directly into this psychological need by providing instant access to motivational content that promises a shift in mindset without requiring the viewer to engage in any real effort. A quick scroll through Instagram or Facebook offers a 'feel-good' moment: a motivational quote, a clip of a speaker's impassioned rhetoric, or an image that invokes a sense of possibility and inspiration. This pattern of behavior fits into what B.F. Skinner would describe as operant conditioning—the idea that people are more likely to repeat behaviors that are immediately rewarded. In the case of motivational quotes and short clips, users experience a brief rush of dopamine, the 'feel-good' neurotransmitter, reinforcing the behavior of seeking out more such content. However, this creates a fleeting sense of fulfillment, one that quickly fades once the effect wears off. Rather than facilitating genuine, long-term motivation, these snippets become a form of pseudo-motivation, offering transient emotional boosts rather than sustainable change. In essence, these short, digestible bursts of content can leave users feeling temporarily inspired but do little to help them build the intrinsic motivation necessary to pursue long-term goals. The Myth of Effortless Change: The Philosophical Critique of Instantaneous Motivation From a philosophical standpoint, the emphasis on short, bite-sized motivation in the digital age challenges the fundamental principles of authentic personal growth. The philosopher Aristotle argued that virtue and excellence are achieved through habitual practice and conscious effort, an idea he elaborated in his concept of eudaimonia or flourishing. According to Aristotle, motivation is not something that can be handed to us in the form of a quote or a viral video; rather, it arises from continuous self-discipline, engagement, and the cultivation of meaningful habits. This view stands in stark contrast to the logic behind social media's motivational content. Instead of promoting the long, arduous process of self-improvement, platforms encourage users to believe that motivation can be delivered in a single moment, neatly packaged in a video or an image. This creates an illusion that change is immediate and effortless, sidestepping the hard work and patience that true motivation requires. As a result, users may experience frustration or even a sense of inadequacy when their efforts fall short of the quick fix they were promised. Furthermore, the existentialist philosophers, such as Jean-Paul Sartre and Friedrich Nietzsche, critiqued the tendency to look for external sources of validation or motivation. Sartre, in particular, emphasized the importance of authenticity in one's actions and choices. True motivation, from an existentialist perspective, must be self-generated, driven by personal commitment and a confrontation with one's own freedom and responsibility. The shallow, externalized motivation offered by social media stands in stark opposition to this notion of authentic self-motivation. It encourages users to externalize their power, relying on quick fixes rather than confronting their own existential freedom to choose and act. Psychoanalysis and the Risk of Narcissistic Validation The social media landscape, particularly through motivational posts and quotes, often becomes a platform for narcissistic self-validation. Donald Winnicott, a prominent psychoanalyst, introduced the concept of the false self—a persona adopted to gain approval from others and to avoid feelings of inadequacy. In the realm of social media, motivational posts contribute to this construction of a false self, where individuals curate a version of themselves that aligns with societal ideals of success, happiness, and motivation. When users post or engage with motivational content, they often receive positive reinforcement in the form of likes, comments, and shares, which temporarily bolsters their self-esteem. However, this external validation does little to foster true, internal motivation. Instead, it reinforces the idea that motivation is something to be sourced externally rather than cultivated from within. This is dangerous because it can lead to addictive behavior, where the individual continuously seeks more motivational content to satisfy an insatiable need for external affirmation. Rather than engaging in the hard work required to develop internal drive and purpose, users become dependent on a steady stream of digital affirmation, further diminishing their ability to motivate themselves in meaningful ways. The Dangers of Dismissing Struggle and Failure Another significant issue with motivational content on social media is its tendency to sanitize the reality of personal struggle and failure. Motivational quotes often present an idealized version of success, where hard work and perseverance automatically lead to achievement. However, this oversimplification ignores the inherent difficulties of personal growth, including the setbacks, frustrations, and moments of doubt that are an essential part of the process. According to Viktor Frankl, the psychiatrist and Holocaust survivor, meaning in life is often forged through suffering and overcoming obstacles. Frankl's concept of logotherapy posits that the search for meaning, rather than the avoidance of pain, is what truly motivates individuals. By focusing solely on positivity and success, motivational content can create an unrealistic view of personal development, one that erases the complexity of human experience. This can lead to feelings of inadequacy or disillusionment when users inevitably encounter the challenges that come with pursuing long-term goals. The pervasive narrative of effortless success found in motivational quotes may thus cause users to overlook the importance of resilience, perseverance, and self-compassion—key elements in building true, lasting motivation. Motivation and the Illusion of Control: A Psychoanalytic Perspective From a psychoanalytic perspective, the influx of motivational content on social media may contribute to a sense of illusionary control over one's life. Jacques Lacan famously argued that the ego is an illusion, shaped by external forces and desires. In the same vein, the constant exposure to curated motivational content can feed into a person's desire for control over their circumstances, promising that they can transcend their limitations by merely subscribing to a particular mindset or set of behaviors. However, Lacan also emphasized the concept of the mirror stage, where individuals come to realize that their identity is never fully their own but is influenced by the external world. In the context of social media, this mirrors the user's relationship with motivational content: they come to see motivation not as a personal, internal drive but as something to be sought externally. This reinforces a cycle of dependency where individuals rely on the approval of others and external sources of motivation, further distancing them from the deeper, internalized motivation that Lacan would argue is essential for true self-realization. Conclusion: Moving Beyond the Illusion of Instant Motivation The proliferation of motivational quotes and short, emotionally charged clips on social media offers a fleeting sense of empowerment that is often mistaken for real, lasting motivation. While these quick hits of inspiration can be enjoyable in the moment, they fail to offer the sustained, deep motivation that comes from hard work, struggle, and the gradual cultivation of one's inner drive. Philosophically and psychoanalytically, true motivation must come from within, nurtured through consistent effort, resilience, and a confrontation with the self. In the age of social media, it is crucial to recognize that motivation is not something that can be packaged in a short video or an inspirational quote. Instead, it is a process—one that requires self-reflection, authentic engagement with challenges, and a commitment to personal growth. While motivational content may serve as a quick distraction or an occasional boost, it cannot replace the genuine, sustained effort that leads to true self-improvement and success.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWemupebX1drw4HRyY6yUCqE	2024-12-15T16:21:03-08:00	
Californians Could Seriously Benefit From DOGE In ‘Trump-Proofed’...	California Gov. Gavin Newsom has set out to 'Trump-proof' California, but in one sense he’s too late. According to NBC News, 38.3 percent of Californians voted for Trump, by some accounts 40 percent, so as people across the country should know, Newsom’s crusade must involve something else. President-elect Trump has placed entrepreneurs Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy in charge of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), tasked to slim down the bloated government. Californians can easily find state agencies that should be eliminated, such as the Coastal Commission. The unelected commissioners recently made news by opposing an increase in Musk’s SpaceX launches from Vandenberg Space Force Base in Santa Barbara County. This was due not to environmental concerns but Musk’s participation in the election. Newsom said 'I’m with Elon,' but the commissioners, some appointed by the governor, are 'friends of mine.' In 2022, the governor’s friends rejected a desalination plant that would have provided arid Orange County with 50 million gallons of fresh water a day. Commissioner Dayna Bochco, president of Steven Bochco Productions explained that 'the ocean is under attack from climate change already.' A CCC commissioner since 2011, Bochco was reappointed last year. The Commission overrides scores of elected city and government officials, all fully capable of handling their own affairs, and runs roughshod over property rights. No governor, including Republicans George Deukmejian, Pete Wilson, and Arnold Schwarzenegger, has attempted to eliminate the CCC, hardly the state’s only wasteful body. Before they reach students in the classroom, Californians’ tax dollars must trickle down through multiple layers of bureaucratic sediment. These include the 58 county offices of education, which serve as 'support systems for their local school districts and as liaisons for the state.' Like the local districts, the county offices employ superintendents, who absorb huge amounts of taxpayer dollars. According to Transparent California, Los Angeles County Office of Education Superintendent Debra Duardo bags an annual pay package of $508,402, more than the president of the United States and more than double Newsom’s $201,553. Deputy County Superintendent Maria Martinez Poulin pulls down $343,887, and 'education officer' Maricela Ramirez is not far behind at $340,458. In the Sacramento County office, Superintendent David Gordon draws a total pay of $447,287 and Deputy Superintendent Masami Herota gets $324,921. This is for services that could easily be performed by the local school districts, whose non-teaching officials are also overpaid. For example, the Ontario-Montclair school district pays Superintendent Phillip Hammond a stunning $743,596, empowered by a 'series of opaque perks' that make Hammond the state’s highest-paid administrator. Chief business official Phillip Hillman bags a not-too-shabby $350,619. Bureaucratic bloat is also evident in the state’s tax system. The Franchise Tax Board (FTB), the California Department of Tax and Fee Administration (CDTFA), and the State Board of Equalization (SBE) are all responsible for the collection of taxes in some form. So is California’s Employment Development Department (EDD) 'one of the largest tax collection agencies in the nation,' collecting more than $81 billion in payroll taxes in 2018-19 alone. How this revenue is spent is another matter. Under the supervision of Julie Su, California’s Labor and Workforce Development Agency (LWDA) boss, the EDD was responsible for $30 billion in unemployment fraud, with convicts and out-of-state fraudsters alike cashing in. Despite that record, Su was the Biden–Harris administration’s choice for Labor secretary, never confirmed by the Senate but still in power at this writing. If Californians believed that four tax agencies are too many it would be hard to blame them. In a similar style, eliminating the costly county offices of education could help more tax dollars to reach students in the classroom. Over in Washington, the federal Department of Education was a payoff to the teacher unions that supported Jimmy Carter for president in 1976. As the 1983 A Nation at Risk report confirmed, the new department did nothing to improve student achievement. Musk and Ramaswamy have a strong case to eliminate the department, one of many expensive and counterproductive bureaucracies. Nothing of the sort is going on in California, and people across the nation should not be fooled. Newsom’s push to 'Trump-proof' California is an effort to reform-proof the state that needs reform the most.

Trump Already Making Waves With His Foreign Policy – OpEd	By Dr. Amal Mudallali President-elect Donald Trump has not been sworn in yet but he is already announcing steps that are reverberating around the globe. He has already threatened a trade war with two allies, one adversary and a powerful Global South group.Trump last month threatened Mexico and Canada with a 25 percent tariff on imports from the two countries unless they take measures to stem the flow of drugs and migrants across their borders with America. The president-elect also threatened China with an additional 10 percent tariff on its imports to the US. These two threats illustrate how Trump is planning to implement his economic agenda through flexing his muscles at friends and foes alike.Less than a week after these two announcements — which rattled both Mexico and Canada, prompting two different reactions — Mexico made a reciprocal threat but also reached out to Trump, while Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau visited Mar-a-Lago in a bid to convince him that such tariffs would hurt both sides.Before the week was over, Trump took to Truth Social again to threaten a 100 percent tariff on the BRICS grouping of nine nations — Brazil, Russia, India, China, South Africa, Egypt, Ethiopia, Iran and the UAE — if they tried to move away from the dollar. He warned that the time when America used to 'stand by and watch is over.' He wrote: 'We require a commitment from these countries that they will neither create a new BRICS currency nor back any other currency to replace the mighty US dollar, or they will face 100 percent tariffs and should expect to say goodbye to selling into the wonderful US economy.'The president-elect knows that the BRICS nations are a long way from having an alternative currency to the dollar. He said there was 'no chance' BRICS would replace the US dollar in global trade and any country that tried to make that happen 'should wave goodbye to America.' The dollar is still the world’s leading reserve currency and is used in 80 percent of global trade. Also, assessments of the dollar as the main global reserve currency indicate that it is 'secure in the near and medium term,' according to the Atlantic Council.The Council on Foreign Relations has doubted, citing experts, that a new BRICS reserve currency 'would be stable or reliable enough to be widely trusted for global transactions.' But this is not the issue for Trump. His goal is to draw a line in the sand and dare the world to cross it. He is telling the world, in no uncertain terms, that you are either with us or against us, and that it is time to choose. But he is also putting out his opening bid ahead of negotiations. Trump’s tactics are straight from his book, 'The Art of the Deal.' He used these negotiating tactics effectively in his first term. And his new threats against his neighbors and adversaries are also meant as a message to America’s European allies, telling them that he means business and they had better shape up. Someone once described Trump’s negotiating style as being like someone who enters a room, throws a bomb and leaves, before coming back to negotiate while the subject of his wrath is stunned and off balance. Tariffs, experts say, are only a negotiating tool for him and are part of his style, which depends on having leverage. This works in both politics and foreign policy.Trump’s newly chosen national security adviser, Rep. Michael Waltz, calls it 'the Trump effect.' He tweeted that 'dictators' in Venezuela, Nicaragua and Cuba were panicking at the prospect of Trump’s return, while adding 'this is what leadership looks like.' Even the ceasefire that was reached between Hezbollah and Israel was, for Waltz, an outcome of this Trump effect. He said: 'Everyone is coming to the table because of President Trump.' He added: 'His resounding victory sent a clear message to the rest of the world that chaos won’t be tolerated. I’m glad to see concrete steps toward de-escalation in the Middle East.'Although his Jan. 20 inauguration is still more than a month away, Trump is making waves internationally. World leaders began reaching out to him even before he was elected and he is casting a long shadow over events from the Indo-Pacific to Ukraine and the Middle East. The Biden administration is not comfortable with President-elect Trump’s moves, with some accusing him of running his own foreign policy and already changing the calculus of many actors on the world stage while President Joe Biden is still trying to solidify his legacy.The Biden administration is also taking actions that could lock Trump and his administration into policies that could derail his agenda. For example, Biden has allowed Ukraine to strike Russia with long-range US missiles, leading to an escalation and threatening Trump’s announced plan to end the conflict even before he is inaugurated.But the transition teams on both sides are painting a rosy picture of cooperation and unity, dismissing any suggestion to the contrary. Waltz said in an interview last month: 'Jake Sullivan (the outgoing national security adviser) and I have had discussions. For our adversaries out there that think this is a time of opportunity, that they can play one administration off the other, they’re wrong, and we are hand in glove. We are one team with the United States in this transition.'Plenty has been written about Trump’s proposed foreign policy team and the possible impact of their hawkish views on policy. But when it comes to foreign policy, there will be only one decider and one policy — the one that President Trump himself will dictate. He does not need to bring out President Harry Truman’s sign, 'The buck stops here,' and display this on his desk to send a message about who will be in charge, as the world already knows. • Dr. Amal Mudallali is a consultant on international affairs and former Lebanese ambassador to the UN.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWemupebX1drw3BLrZUSNRzZ	2024-12-15T16:16:50-08:00	
Trump’s Second Edition Puts Indo-US Relations At The Crossroads –...	For India, Trump is a mixed bag. Some of his policies will help the Modi regime while others will prove to be challenging. With the brash and unpredictable Donald Trump about to be President of the United States, there is anxiety in India about his domestic, foreign and trade policies. Trump's penchant for transactional relationships could mean that India cannot take America for granted or expect help from it without any thought of returning the favour. American scholar Ashely Tellis and Ambassador Eric Garcetti have complained that India has been taking from America but giving virtually nothing that America expects. There is anxiety about Trump's 'Make America Great Again' (MAGA) thrust. Questions that arise are: Does MAGA mean a pushy and aggressive pursuit of American interests at the cost of allies and strategic partners? Would Trump accept India's claim to be a power in its own right, entitled to be treated on par with America's traditional Western allies? Would he allow India to pursue strategic autonomy in its national interest often times running counter to American policies and interests? While these are of vital concern for India, the Indian Establishment is smug. Reflecting the current buoyant mood in India after having become the world's fifth largest economy by nominal GDP, External Affairs Minister S.Jaishankar declared that while other countries may have problems with Trump's re-emergence, India has none. But the reality is that there are multiple issues bedevilling India-US relations. Some of these may get mitigated while others could get exacerbated by Trump's coming back. Downside There is the sticky question of work visas for Indian students. Indian and US tariff issues may crop up. In the past Trump has used tariff has a weapon against China. Illegal immigration from India is an embarrassment. Then there is India's quest for leeway in foreign policy matters, especially in relation to Russia, China and the South Asian neighbourhood. India expects the US to accept its primacy in its neighbourhood (barring Pakistan). In the 1980s, India took exception to America's cultivating the right wing government in Sri Lanka headed by President J.R.Jayewardene. It encouraged the minority Tamils to put up their demands militantly which led to a 30-year war from which the island nation is yet to recover. More recently, India suspected that the US was behind the overthrow of the India-friendly Sheikh Hasina regime in Bangladesh. Indians described the August 5 Bangladesh revolution as a 'colour revolution' engineered by the US to nullify India's influence over Bangladesh. India unofficially dubbed the head of the Interim Administration Dr. Muhammad Yunus as a US plant. India also expects the US, no matter who is President, to avoid interfering in its internal affairs and eschew commenting on issues which it deems internal. It is particularly sensitive about comments on human rights violations, curbs on democratic rights and the treatment of Muslims and other minorities. But being the oldest and the most powerful democracy, the US has institutionalised its watchdog role in the world. Since the end of World War II, it has been describing itself as the leader of the Free World. This irks resurgent India under Modi. Therefore, every time the US State Department or any of the specialised commissions criticises India in its reports, a raw nerve is touched in the Indian Establishment. In angry retort , the US is promptly asked to mind its business. Friction between America's global democratic mission and India's sensitivity and its new found pride will continue to be a feature of Indo-US relations. However, there is an equally popular view that Trump is not committed to human rights like the wokes in the Democratic Party, and that he will turn a blind eye to human rights violations in India. However, this cannot be taken for granted. There are certain enduring features of the American Establishment such as the yearly human rights reports which cannot be stopped. It is these reports which validate America's time-honoured claim to be a torch bearer of democracy. Trump may not act on these reports or order sanctions, but he could use them to embarrass a recalcitrant foreign government. He did this in October when he used the plight of the Hindus in Bangladesh to indicate his support of the Hindus and India. Since winning the Presidential election, charges against Trump about attempting to overturn a previous Presidential election and illegally retaining classified documents at his estate have been dismissed, though two other cases remain. This gives hope to the Indian Establishment that the US$ 265 million bribery charge against Indian billionaire Gautam Adani deemed to be close to Modi, and the case against Indian intelligence agents in a plot to murder American citizen Gurpatwant Singh Pannun in New York, will also be dropped because of Trump's bonhomie with Modi. Trump had described Modi as 'great' and a 'friend'. Indians expect Trump's transactional approach to give India and other countries a chance to negotiate their way out of sticky situations such as the Adani and Pannun cases. Adani has already offered to invest US$ 10 billion in the US to create local jobs, a cause dear to Trump. It is sad that the case relating to Pannun could be dropped if India conducts a credible inquiry and 'punishes the guilty'. India is counting on Trump to counter George Soros, the American billionaire and gladiator for democracy the world over. Trump too hates Soros. The Modi government accuses Soros of funding the opposition Congress party to whip up mass opposition against it and topple it. Trump had also accused Soros of trying to fix him by supporting the Democrats who were investigating his conduct after he was defeated by Joe Biden. India would be hoping that Trump curbs the activities of Soros through investigations into the America's Deep State. Russia, China policies Indians welcome Trump's policy on Russia and his resolve to solve the Ukraine issue, because India can then continue to buy Russian oil at a concessional rate. Trump's China policy is going to be shaped by economic considerations arising from his election pledge to bring back factories to the US to give Americans jobs. For Trump, China's geopolitical expansion is less of a concern than favourable terms of trade. Trump wants a strong economic relationship with China to balance bilateral trade. US goods and services trade with China totalled US $758.4 billion in 2022. Exports were U$ 195.5 billion and imports were US$ 562.9 billion. India's approach to China is not very different from Trump's. India's relations with China may appear to be geopolitical and warlike on the surface but there is an underlying economic content which is preventing an outbreak of war. Both India and China are keen on continuing the booming bilateral trade. India expects China to opens its market to Indian goods more than it does now and narrow the yawning trade gap. In 2023, India's trade deficit with China was U$ 83.36 billion. India has ruled out war with China, though it is strengthening its military with American help. Foreign Minister Jaishankar has said that India cannot go to war with China simply because China's economy is five times India's. However, the downside in Trump's China policy is that a softer US policy on China could reduce India's importance for the US and might enable China to be more belligerent on the Sino-Indian border and in the South Asian neighbourhood. It is reported that Trump intends to invite President Xi Jinping for his inauguration in January. This is certainly not good news for Indian strategic planners. Trump's meeting with Xi in 2017 had resulted in the US-Chinese Phase One trade deal in 2020. Trump acolyte Elon Musk is a strong advocate of rapprochement with China. Tougher immigration policies under Trump could affect India if there is a move to restrict or change the terms of high-skilled or student visas—or to go for large-scale deportation of unauthorized Indian migrants. There were an estimated 725,000 illegal Indian immigrants in the US in 2022. Should Trump attend the Quad summit that is scheduled to take place in India in 2025, Modi will roll out the red carpet for him as it did in 2020. And along with deepening ties with Trump officials or allies, the Indian government will also continue to invest in relationships with other US stakeholders including members of Congress, state and local officials, and companies, an Indian commentator wrote. Therefore, for India, Trump is a mixed bag of the good and the bad, with the good outweighing the bad for the moment.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWemupebX1drwzDFtH9RotFd	2024-12-15T16:14:51-08:00	
Assad’s Fall: The Legacy Of Repression And Foreign Influence Amon...	By Mohammed Sinan Siyech and Celsabil Hadj-Cherif The fall of Assad’s regime, while ostensibly surprising for many, was quite predictable. Syria’s economy had been devastated by more than a decade of war, compounded by sanctions that crippled state infrastructure and left 90 percent of Syrians below the poverty line. Moreover, state subsidies on essentials such as food and fuel were slashed over the last few years, worsening the humanitarian crisis and fuelling renewed public dissent. In addition, the regime’s military backbone had also been hollowed out by years of attrition. The Syrian army, depleted by the loss of over 100,000 soldiers since 2011 due to sustained combat losses, desertions, and defections, severe morale issues and resource shortages, exacerbated by constant Israeli strikes targeting its bases. This contrasted with the rebel groups that were effectively training, mobilising, and recruiting troops over the last few years before they launched their offensive. Hezbollah, a key pillar of support for Assad during the civil war, had also been severely weakened. Even as it maintained its reputation as a capable resistance force, Hezbollah found itself overstretched, diverting resources to assist Hamas in Gaza and countering Israel’s aggressive actions. This decline underscored Iran’s diminishing ability to shield its regional allies as it contended with its own challenges amid escalating tensions with Israel and resource limitations. Meanwhile, Assad’s other primary ally, Russia, found itself embroiled in a prolonged conflict in Ukraine, which drained its military and financial resources. Yet, questions remain on the challenges of putting together a credible post-Assad government with the experience required to reconstruct and repair the war-torn nation. A legacy of repression: The roots of today’s challenges The violence of the Assad dynasty not only obliterated Syria's political life for decades but also laid the groundwork for the challenges faced today. Hafez al-Assad's legacy of systematic repression, epitomised by the 1982 Hama massacre in which 40,000 people were killed, organised dissent by groups like the Muslim Brotherhood—the only existing political opposition to the regime was eradicated, and authoritarian control was established. His policies extended beyond violence, banning the Kurdish language and cultural expressions to enforce Ba'athist unity under the guise of Arab secular socialism. The Mukhabarat, Assad’s feared intelligence apparatus, added another layer of repression, conducting mass arrests, torture, and executions without oversight. Dissent was crushed before it could take root, as emergency laws allowed arbitrary detentions and a climate of fear to prevail. This suppression ensured a smooth transfer of power to his son Bashar in 2000, but left Syria with no infrastructure for meaningful political opposition. Today’s fractured and externally-backed Opposition is a direct consequence of nearly half a century of calculated repression by the Assad regime. By systematically dismantling all forms of political organising and expression, the regime left the Syrian people metaphorically orphaned when it comes to political movements and leadership. Consequently, the Opposition that has emerged is dominated by two key groups: Hay’at Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), an Islamist faction that evolved from the Al-Nusra Front, and the Syrian National Army (SNA), formerly the Free Syrian Army, backed by Türkiye. HTS operated in northwest Syria, where it sought to consolidate its influence, while the SNA focused on combating Kurdish forces along the northern border. Despite tensions and divergent objectives, these groups have temporarily united against the regime. However, due to a lack of domestic infrastructure such as political know-how, finance and experience, any political opposition be it a political party or a rebel group is beholden to affiliating either with extremist groups or will remain vulnerable to being co-opted by international backers to survive. International powers and their engagements in Syria Against the backdrop, it is pertinent to examine several nations' roles regarding how Syria may be governed in the future. Firstly, Türkiye, being Syria’s immediate neighbour and the primary backer of the anti-Assad opposition since the start of the civil war, has announced its intention to play a role in ensuring Syria’s stability. Not only will the rebuilding of Syria give Türkiye new economic opportunities, but it will also allow Syrians displaced in Türkiye to return to their nation—an important win for Erdogan since their presence has led to domestic tensions. Moreover, peace in Syria solves a major security problem for Türkiye, particularly its longstanding Kurdish issue. Türkiye’s motivation to address the Kurdish threat has been so strong that it even sought reconciliation with the Assad regime over the past few years, only to be rebuffed by Bashar and his government. In shaping Syria’s future, Türkiye may also align with Qatar, another key supporter of Arab uprisings, to back the new Syrian regime. Qatar’s history of supporting transitions away from authoritarian rule, coupled with its financial and regional influence, could bolster Türkiye’s efforts in stabilising Syria. Secondly, while Iran has been a close ally of Assad-led Syria, it has suggested that Syria's future should now be determined by Syrians themselves. This stance came in the wake of the rebel group HTS announcing it would not target Shia shrines valued by Iran in Syria. Nevertheless, with US sanctions on Syria unlikely to be lifted, Iran, alongside Russia, may likely continue to back the new government, too. Despite Assad’s fall, Israel has already begun attacking the newly freed Syria, signalling dissatisfaction with the regime change and the regional disruption it creates. This dynamic could lead to a natural alignment between Russia and the rebels. Russia's military bases in Syria could entice it to engage with the new Syrian government to safeguard its interests in the region while offering protection to the rebels from Israel. Iran, meanwhile, could continue arming groups resisting Israeli occupation as it did when Assad was in power. The rebels themselves, especially given their alignment with groups like Hamas, may find ideological common ground with these actors. Khaled Mishal, the leader of Hamas, was notably supportive of the Syrian revolution in its early days, further strengthening this potential connection. This would be dependent on them deciding to engage with Iran and Russia, their former enemies. Examples of the rebels forgiving compulsorily conscripted military personnel suggest that it may take a forgiving/realpolitik approach to its former enemies, including Russia and Iran, to ensure that it continues to have international military backing. Thirdly, for the US and Israel, the fall of Assad presents both opportunities and risks. Israel, which celebrated the fall, may see this as an opening to target Hezbollah and Hamas supply lines, as well as to consolidate its hold over the occupied Golan Heights. However, the rebel factions now in power could pose a renewed challenge to Israel if they strengthen over the medium term. US allies, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) are also closely watching developments. Both nations have used Syria as a cautionary tale against revolutionary change and are likely to take steps to ensure that the situation in Syria does not embolden opposition within their own borders. The US’ interests in Syria itself are twofold; first, it will want to prevent ISIS from resurging, as seen in its bombing of several ISIS bases after the fall of Assad. Second, it will want to ensure that the new government will not attack Israel, possibly preparing for retaliation if they do. On a third, additional possibility, if Russia and Iran were to re-establish their presence in Syria, then the US could potentially look at Syria as a continued challenge. Clearly, historic processes beginning with Hafez al Assad in the 1970s have played a significant role in current-day rebel groups engaging in transnational alliances to survive. As the euphoria of the Syrian people winds down, they now face the dual challenges of rebuilding their nation amidst a fractured political infrastructure and ensuring that external powers do not have disproportionate influence over their future.

Russian Troops Remaining In Syria Lack Food, Water, Says Ukrainia...	(RFE/RL) -- Russian military personnel still in Syria are experiencing a lack of food and drinking water as an evacuation of troops and equipment continues, according to the Main Intelligence Directorate of the Ukrainian Defense Ministry (GUR). The Russian personnel are experiencing the problems at military bases in Tartus and Hmeimim and on ships anchored offshore in the Mediterranean Sea, the press service of the GUR said in a statement on Telegram on December 15. The GUR also said that the remaining Russian service members were waiting for military transport planes involved in the evacuation that were supposed to deliver food. The statement said Russia continues to withdraw its contingent from remote areas of Syria. 'At the same time, on some routes, the Russians are accompanied by armed groups opposing the Assad regime,' the GUR said. The statement added there are rumors circulating among Russian soldiers that Moscow has agreed to maintain its presence at the two bases, where the number of military personnel is up to 3,000. RFE/RL was unable to verify the information from open sources. Russian authorities have not commented on this information. The Russian Foreign Ministry said on Telegram that it had evacuated part of its diplomatic staff from Syria on December 15. It said the withdrawal was carried out by a special flight of the Russian Air Force from the Hmeimim air base. Russian transport planes have departed the Hmeimim air base in recent days as part of the evacuation following the fall of Syrian leader Bashar al-Assad. The longtime ruler was overthrown last week following a lightning offensive led by the Islamist group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS). Assad fled to Russia, which was his regime's main backer. Satellite images taken on December 13 by the space technology company Maxar appeared to show Russia preparing for the withdrawal of military equipment from the Hmeimim air base. The images showed what appear to be at least two Antonov An-124 cargo planes on the tarmac with their nose cones open. Russia also has sent several landing ships and civilian vessels to Syria, according to open-source information. In Damascus, HTS has appointed an interim government, and its leader, Riad al-Asaad, told AFP on December 15 that he is confident the factions that helped topple Assad will unite as one force. HTS and the transitional government have insisted the rights of all Syrians will be protected. U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken spoke with spoke with British Foreign Secretary David Lammy about the situation in Syria, State Department spokesman Matthew Miller said on December 15. Blinken and Lammy discussed the situation 'and the principles endorsed by the United States and countries in the region that should be upheld during the transition process and formation of a new government,' Miller said in a statement. Blinken on December 14 attended an emergency meeting in Jordan of foreign ministers from the Arab League, Turkey, and top officials from the European Union and United Nations. He said afterward the United States had made 'direct contact' with the HTS and other parties. He declined to discuss details of the contacts but said it was important for the United States to convey messages to the group about its conduct and how it intends to govern in a transition period. Blinken said a joint statement had been agreed at the meeting in Jordan that sets out the principles that other countries want to see in Syria's political transition, including inclusivity and respect for minorities and women and ensuring that terrorist groups do not take hold in the country.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWemupebX1drwzwEB3BCQvc6	2024-12-15T16:08:17-08:00	
Incoming National Security Adviser Calls For Explanation Of US Dr...	By Ken Bredemeier U.S. President-elect Donald Trump’s incoming national security adviser says it’s time to figure out where dozens of unexplained drones flying over eastern U.S. states are coming from and whether any ill intent is involved. Republican Representative Michael Waltz, from Florida and set to join Trump’s White House team when the president-elect takes office January 20, told CBS’s 'Face the Nation' on Sunday, 'We need to get to the bottom of it.' For weeks now, residents in the state of New Jersey, which borders New York City, and other states to the north and south along the Atlantic Ocean coastline have reported seeing more than 5,000 supposed drones, a figure U.S. officials have concluded is wildly inflated. All manner of conspiracy theories has been offered for the unexplained sightings, including U.S. government spying and the deployment of Iran-launched drones from a mothership off U.S. eastern coastal waters. Waltz called them 'long-loitering, could-be dangerous' drones. He credited the outgoing administration of President Joe Biden for trying to allay fears and resolve any mystery about the drones but offered no explanation himself. 'We need more transparency,' Minnesota Senator Amy Klobuchar, a Democrat, told the CBS show. 'This can’t be the future.' On Saturday, officials from the White House, the Department of Homeland Security and the Federal Bureau of Investigation stressed that most of the recent purported drone sightings in New Jersey — the state with the most reports — and elsewhere have been manned aircraft and posed no national security threat. An FBI official told reporters that the agency was working with 50 local, state and federal partners and had determined that fewer than 100 of the more than 5,000 reported sightings had turned out to merit further investigation. 'The combination of efforts so far ... to include technical equipment, tip line information and noted consults has ... not found any evidence to support large-scale [unmanned aerial system] activities,' the official said, adding that many of the sightings occurred along regular flight paths. The official said more investigations are under way to look at the remaining cases, including analysis of radar and intelligence. 'We can't ignore the sightings that have been there,' the official said. 'We're doing our best to find the origin of those drone activities, but I think there has been a slight over-reaction' in the number of claimed drone sightings. U.S. officials say they have confirmed drone sightings over military bases in New Jersey, including Picatinny Arsenal, but found no evidence that a foreign government had launched the drones. National security officials, however, have not been able to figure out who has been operating the unexplained drones. State and local officials in eastern seaboard states have expressed concern. Larry Hogan, a former Maryland governor, posted on social media Friday that he had seen 'what appeared to be dozens of large drones in the sky' above his residence in the state. 'The public is growing increasingly concerned and frustrated with the complete lack of transparency and the dismissive attitude of the federal government.' President-elect Trump suggested Saturday that the Biden administration was withholding information about the drone sightings and that the devices should be shot down. Republican Representative Christopher Smith of New Jersey said Friday in a statement that the White House’s attitude toward the sightings had been 'dismissive.' U.S. officials said Saturday the administration had sent New Jersey officials radar technology with an 'electro-optical infrared camera system' to track the devices. Last week, White House National Security spokesperson John Kirby said an investigation of the drone sightings had not turned up any illegal activity. 'To the contrary, upon review of available imagery, it appears that many of the reported sightings are actually manned aircraft that are being operated lawfully,' Kirby said.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWemupebX1drw34RBoSl11hh	2024-12-15T16:05:52-08:00	
Bangladeshi Experts, Officials Call For Support For ‘Mentally Sha...	By Zia Chowdhury Bangladeshi police official 'Amin' (not his real name) had barely slept for months. Even if he popped sleeping pills, 'Amin' said he could only snatch a few hours of sleep and that nightmares always jolted him awake. 'I keep hearing the sounds of gunfire in my dreams. It feels inescapable,' said 'Amin,' who requested that BenarNews not identify him by his real name for fear of reprisals. Police constable 'Mohammad' (also not his real name) faces a similar struggle. 'When I head out for work, the haunting images of our colleagues’ dead bodies pop up in my mind,' said 'Mohammad,' who asked not to be identified out of fear for his safety. 'Even something as simple as going out for tea fills me with anxiety,' he told BenarNews. 'I don’t know how to return to normalcy.' The stories of 'Amin' and 'Mohammad' highlight the psychological struggles faced by members of the Bangladeshi police force following mass protests in July and August that led to the ouster of Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina. More than 1,400 people were killed, including 44 police officers, and thousands of others were injured during violence around the protests. Protesters blamed the police, as well as security agencies and associates of the former ruling party, for the killings. Since Hasina fell from power on Aug. 5, many members of the police force – which has more than 214,000 personnel nationwide – have stayed away from duty, fearing retribution and feeling demoralized. 'The deaths of [their] colleagues and civilians during the [uprising] have left many officers mentally shattered,' said Muhammad Omar Faruq, chairman of the criminology and police science department at Mawlana Bhashani Science and Technology University. One police official said that many members of the police force had yet to recover from trauma following those weeks of unrest in the country. 'But there has been some improvement. Now, more attention is needed to boost the morale of the police,' Habib Palash, deputy inspector-general of the Chittagong Range, said at a public briefing. Dealing with trauma According to one mental health expert, there is an urgent need to help members of the police dealing with trauma. 'If a policeman is afraid to interact with people or hesitates to approach them, how can [he] effectively serve the public?' Dr. Helal Uddin Ahmed told BenarNews. To help restore normalcy in Bangladesh, the government should provide services to police officers to ensure their mental health, police officials and experts said. 'Efforts are needed to rebuild their confidence and help them return to normalcy,' Omar Faruq said, adding that police personnel should also undertake behavioral training. Baharul Alam, the newly appointed Inspector-General of Police (IGP), said he was ready to sit down with members of the force and discuss their various issues, including the state of their mental health. 'We will listen [to] them minute-by-minute: What is their problem [that prevents them from getting] back to normalcy? Is it trauma haunting them or other issues?' Baharul told BenarNews. 'We will arrange mental health or psychological counseling if needed,' he added. 'I would go to the remote areas across the country to hear from the grassroots-level policemen.' Various reforms must also be implemented to rebuild the public’s trust in the police following the political crisis that hit Bangladesh, officials and experts said. Insulating police from political influences These reforms include insulating the police from a political agenda. The police, along with government agencies and the courts, were deeply politicized during Hasina’s 15-year tenure. 'If the politicization of police ends, their morale will improve, and the [trust] gap between the police and public will be decreased,' former police chief Muhammad Nurul Huda told BenarNews. He cited a recent survey conducted by the Ministry of Home Affairs and released this month showing that almost nine out of 10 Bangladeshis (89.5%) wanted the police to be free from political influence and impartial when it came to enforcing the law. Omar Faruq, with the Mawlana Bhashani Science and Technology University, shared a similar view. 'The police must adhere to proper legal procedures and should be kept free from political dominance,' he told BenarNews. In October, the interim government appointed former Home Affairs Secretary Safar Raj Hossain as head of a commission to reform the police force. BenarNews sought comment from the commission, but officials did not immediately respond. Call to abolish Rapid Action Battalion Meanwhile, the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) – the top opposition party during Hasina’s rule – this week called on the police reform commission to abolish the Rapid Action Battalion (RAB), an elite security unit, over its alleged involvement over the years in numerous human rights violations, including extrajudicial killings and enforced disappearances. RAB, a unit of the Bangladesh police that includes members of the military, was a notorious security force during Hasina’s 15-year rule. 'Most of the killings, enforced disappearances, and extrajudicial executions [under Hasina’s term] have been committed by RAB. The force has become notorious by international standards and has turned into a ‘monster’ within the country,' BNP Standing Committee member Hafiz Uddin Ahmed told BenarNews. Ironically, RAB was formed in March 2004, when Bangladesh was under BNP’s rule. It was charged with internal security, intelligence gathering related to criminal activities, and government-directed investigations. The United States had accused RAB of more than 600 enforced disappearances over 12 years, a similar number of extrajudicial killings, and the use of torture. Washington imposed sanctions on the group in December 2021 over its alleged human rights abuses. RAB Director-General A.K.M. Shahidur Rahman acknowledged the allegations against the force and praised accountability for any violations committed by its personnel. 'There are allegations against RAB – disappearances, killings, and abductions. At the same time, I would like to stress that the only way to be free of these ‘wrongdoings’ is thorough investigation and justice,' he told BenarNews.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWemupebX1drw2mqW57PoU7Q	2024-12-15T16:04:19-08:00	
The Horn Of Africa States: An Ethio-Somali Rapprochement – OpEd	December 11th, 2024, was another historic day for the Horn of Africa States region. It was the day the Ankara Declaration was announced by the Turkish Government of President Recep Tayyip Erdogan with respect to an agreement between the Federal Republic of Somalia and the Federal Republic of Ethiopia, wherein the two countries turned away from the brink of war in the region, under the facilitation of Türkiye. The Somali side was represented by President Hassan Sheikh Mahmoud, while the Ethiopian side was represented by Prime Minister Abiye Ahmed Ali, the top leaders of the two countries. On face value the document announced by the Türkiye Government reflects a way forward for both countries to live in peace together, but many pundits on both sides believe that their side have erred in signing to the agreement. On the Somali side, many see that Ethiopia was an aggressor which has moved on to grab part of its territorial lands and sea while retaining a large part of Somali territory, Western Somalia, some 500, 000 square kilometers under the name of Somali State of Ethiopia in general and in the Oromia State of Ethiopia. To them it is like a person coming to claim the sleeve of the shirt one is wearing or a room in one’s own house. There was no need for such an agreement and Türkiye, as a strategic partner of Somalia, should simply have told Ethiopia to abide by international law. The opposition to Prime Minister Abiye Ahmed of Ethiopia are all crywolfing that he has abandoned the dream of Ethiopia to have its own access to a sea, which was within reach through the illegal MoU with a region of Somalia. It would appear, however, that both leaders of Somalia and Ethiopia were put under tremendous pressure by Türkiye’s President Erdogan to reach an accord that would satisfy both. It was, in the main, it appears, an accord to satisfy the needs of Türkiye, Somalia as a strategic partner and Ethiopia as a commercial partner. Prime Minister Abiye Ahmed Ali, in his previous discourses, always mentioned that he would respect Somalia’s sovereignty, but never Somalia’s territorial integrity and unity, which this declaration announces that he has agreed to the territorial integrity of Somalia, while being assured of a commercial access to Somalia’s seas. In essence, Somalia seems to have abandoned its previous rejection of the border between south Somalia and Ethiopia which is so far provisional, or it looks as such by agreeing to the territorial integrity of Ethiopia. This needs to be revisited in the eyes of Somalis, while perhaps, this does not even blink on the Ethiopian side. They take the current border for granted and ignore there is a dispute in this regard. Many Somalis argue that Prime Minister Ahmed Ali is not sincere while President Hassan Sheikh Mahmoud is desperate with a view to the shifting Somali political landscape which does not favor him. Both leaders had to succumb to the pressures of Türkiye, though, to sign on to the Ankara Declaration. A great matter that will come to the forefront in the future will be the negotiations that are planned to start in February 2025 and to be completed within a short period of time, perhaps within months. This seems to be too ambitious as both sides will need more time to prepare themselves, at least, to assemble negotiating teams that have expertise in commercial accessibility of landlocked countries and corridor management, which Somalia does not apparently have at present. The negotiations should not be designed for the current two leaders’ personal agendas. The contracts to be signed and negotiated should be designed to create long-term workable relationships between the two countries and peoples, which have had rough relations involving wars and skirmishes between the two countries over the years. The negotiations should be designed to be completed over a number of years as all agreements put forth in short periods often cause more problems for the issues they were designed originally to solve. The Ankara Declaration involves commercial access to the sea for Ethiopia through the Somali coastline. This should be a good arrangement for both countries after the negotiation processes are completed. The negotiations will have to involve not only the management of the corridor(s) but also the financing of the construction phase of the necessary ports, roads and rail, if necessary and other infrastructures. Ethiopia despite being a landlocked country has been working on establishing a naval force , which makes the Ankara Declaration suspicious as far as Somalis are concerned. They do not want to have a foreign naval force which they do not approve of in their waters and Ethiopia is not yet a country, which Somalia can truly trust. It will take years to earn such trust, and Ethiopia should abandon such naval force. Somalia can offer to purchase the fleet it acquired through the years, and this will be good for Ethiopia instead of wasting them docked in international ports and paying unnecessary demurrage fees. The security, safety and reliability of Somalia’s ports, roads and rail services within the Somali sovereign territory should be the responsibility of Somalia while the safety, security and reliability of the roads and rail service within the territory of Ethiopia should be the responsibility of Ethiopia. The contracts that are to be signed between the two parties should be drafted in that context and no less. The overall context of the Ankara Declaration represents a welcome relief from the difficult environment that was developing in the region, which could have put it back into years of chaos and other disasters, both known and unknown and unexpected. It is also a way forward for the region’s possible economic integration and one must applaud it. It is an opener for a dialogue and engagement between the two neighboring countries, which share a large population, some 164 million, between the two for a prosperous and stable future. The two in peace can also attract the other two countries of the region to a new arrangement, that assures the population of the region a better life ahead.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWemupebX1drw0x3cU0zDwjT	2024-12-15T16:02:18-08:00	
Indonesia’s Path To Peace: Bridging Divides On The Korean Peninsu...	Indonesia, as a prominent member of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) and an influential middle power in the Asia-Pacific region, emerges as a potential bridge-builder in fostering peace between South and North Korea. With its historical significance as a founding member of the Non-Aligned Movement (NAM), a steadfast commitment to dialogue through multilateralism, and a 'free and active' foreign policy, Indonesia possesses both the credibility and the strategic framework necessary to mediate one of the world’s most complex conflicts. This essay posits that Indonesia can leverage ASEAN’s principles of neutrality and consensus-building to facilitate dialogue between the two Koreas, thereby contributing to regional peace and stability. By engaging with the Koreas through ASEAN, Indonesia not only pursues a pragmatic pathway but also enhances its global diplomatic stature and advances its broader regional interests. Indonesia has established a proven track record as a constructive diplomatic actor in conflict resolution. A notable instance is its mediation in the Aceh peace process in 2005, during which Indonesia played a pivotal role between the Free Aceh Movement (GAM) and the Indonesian government, culminating in a historic peace agreement. This accomplishment significantly bolstered Indonesia’s reputation as an effective mediator. As a central player in ASEAN, Indonesia has consistently promoted the bloc’s principles of non-interference, peaceful dispute resolution, and multilateralism, principles that apply to the context of the Korean Peninsula. The ASEAN Regional Forum (ARF), which encompasses both South and North Korea, offers a valuable platform for dialogue. Indonesia could proactively take the initiative within ASEAN to prioritize peacebuilding efforts on the Peninsula, creating opportunities for informal discussions and confidence-building measures between the two Koreas. The geopolitical landscape of 2024 amplifies the urgency for renewed peace efforts on the Korean Peninsula. North Korea's ongoing missile tests and nuclear development, in conjunction with increased military exercises conducted by South Korea and the United States, have exacerbated regional tensions. Recent reports indicate that North Korea conducted over 40 ballistic missile tests in 2023, including intercontinental ballistic missiles capable of reaching the United States. This provocative posture has elicited enhanced military drills between the United States and South Korea, which North Korea perceives as rehearsals for invasion. Amid this cycle of provocation and retaliation, a neutral intermediary like Indonesia could revitalize dialogue by providing a platform independent of the strategic interests of major powers. Indonesia's position within the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) presents distinctive advantages. The foundational principles of ASEAN, as articulated in the ASEAN Charter, underscore the importance of regional peace and stability through non-aggression and dialogue. These principles align with Indonesia's 'free and active' foreign policy, which aims to avoid alignment with any major power bloc while actively contributing to global peace efforts. In addressing the Korean conflict, Indonesia could leverage ASEAN's existing mechanisms, such as the ASEAN Regional Forum (ARF) and the Treaty of Amity and Cooperation (TAC), to promote dialogue. Established in 1994, the ARF is the only regional security forum that includes both Koreas, alongside key stakeholders such as the United States, China, Russia, and Japan. By advocating for the ARF to prioritize issues related to the Korean Peninsula, Indonesia could facilitate gradual confidence-building measures, including military exchanges or agreements designed to prevent accidental clashes. One of ASEAN's strengths lies in its capacity to unite countries with diverse political systems and interests through consensus-based decision-making. Indonesia could capitalize on this strength by spearheading an ASEAN-led initiative to engage both Koreas in dialogue. For instance, it could propose a 'Korean Peninsula Peace Initiative' within the ARF framework, focusing on non-political cooperation in sectors such as disaster management, public health, and environmental protection—areas that are less politically sensitive yet capable of fostering goodwill. ASEAN's experience in managing regional tensions, such as facilitating negotiations concerning the South China Sea, exemplifies its ability to address complex disputes without exacerbating conflicts. As ASEAN's largest and most influential member, Indonesia is ideally positioned to lead such initiatives. Furthermore, Indonesia's soft power and cultural diplomacy can enhance its formal diplomatic endeavours. For example, Indonesia could organize cultural exchanges involving artists, athletes, and students from both Koreas. The 2018 Asian Games in Jakarta and Palembang, during which North and South Korea marched under a unified flag, exemplified Indonesia's capacity to employ sports diplomacy as a means of reconciliation. Expanding these initiatives could foster people-to-people connections and reduce mistrust at the grassroots level. Nevertheless, Indonesia's endeavours face significant challenges. North Korea's entrenched mistrust of external actors, coupled with its reliance on China as its primary ally, may impede its willingness to engage in initiatives led by Indonesia. Furthermore, South Korea’s strategic alignment with the United States could render it reluctant to fully endorse an ASEAN-led framework that lacks substantial U.S. involvement. To navigate these obstacles, Indonesia must ensure that its initiatives are perceived as genuinely neutral and not designed to undermine the interests of either Korea or their allies. This will necessitate careful coordination with other key stakeholders, including the United States and Japan, to foster broad-based support for its efforts. In 2024, Indonesia's active role in ASEAN's diplomatic processes presents a timely opportunity to advance peace-building initiatives on the Korean Peninsula. By incorporating issues related to the Peninsula into ASEAN’s broader agenda, Indonesia can enhance the bloc’s role as a regional peace mediator while addressing one of Asia's most pressing security challenges. Collaboration with the United Nations and other international organizations to align its initiatives with global peace efforts could further strengthen Indonesia’s position. Indonesia’s active participation in United Nations peacekeeping missions reflects its commitment to international peace and security—an assurance that could be extended to the Korean Peninsula. The potential benefits of Indonesia’s involvement are considerable. A stable Korean Peninsula would bolster regional security and economic integration in Northeast Asia, which is crucial for ASEAN’s economic interests. Moreover, successfully mediating the Korean conflict would elevate Indonesia’s diplomatic standing on the global stage, reinforcing its role as a middle power adept at addressing complex international challenges. To achieve this, Indonesia should emphasize building trust through incremental confidence-building measures, rather than attempting to resolve all contentious issues in one fell swoop. This approach aligns with ASEAN’s effective method of gradualism in managing regional disputes. In conclusion, Indonesia’s proactive engagement in the peace process on the Korean Peninsula—leveraging the principles and frameworks of ASEAN—provides a promising avenue for facilitating dialogue and mitigating tensions between North and South Korea. By prioritizing trust-building initiatives and collaborating with key stakeholders, Indonesia can establish itself as a credible and effective mediator. Given the escalating tensions anticipated in 2024, the necessity for neutral actors like Indonesia to assume a more prominent role is increasingly critical. Through its leadership within ASEAN and a steadfast commitment to multilateralism, Indonesia possesses both the resources and the opportunity to make a significant contribution to peace on the Korean Peninsula. Indonesia should propose a formal 'Korean Peninsula Peace Initiative' under the auspices of the ASEAN Regional Forum, focusing on non-political cooperation and cultural diplomacy to cultivate trust and create conditions conducive to sustained dialogue. Such an initiative would not only further the cause of peace but also reaffirm Indonesia's status as a global leader in conflict resolution.

South Korea’s Acting President Moves To Reassure Allies After Imp...	(EurActiv) -- South Korea's acting president, Han Duck-soo, moved on Sunday (15 December) to reassure the country's allies and calm financial markets a day after President Yoon Suk Yeol was impeached and suspended from his duties over a martial law attempt. Han spoke with US President Joe Biden by phone, the White House and Han's office said. 'South Korea will carry out its foreign and security policies without disruption and strive to ensure the South Korea-US alliance is maintained and developed steadfastly,' Han said, according to a statement from his office. In a further attempt to stabilise the country's leadership, the main opposition party announced it would not seek to impeach Han for his involvement in Yoon's 3 December martial law decision. 'Given that the prime minister has already been confirmed as acting president and considering that excessive impeachments could lead to confusion in national governance, we have decided not to proceed with impeachment procedures,' Democratic Party leader Lee Jae-myung told reporters. Han, a longtime technocrat picked by Yoon as prime minister, was elevated to acting president in accordance with the constitution while Yoon's case moves to the Constitutional Court. North Korean threat Yoon's surprise martial law declaration and the ensuing political crisis spooked markets and South Korea's diplomatic partners worried over the country's ability to deter nuclear-armed North Korea. Biden told Han the ironclad US-South Korea alliance remained unchanged and Washington would work with Seoul to further develop and strengthen the alliance as well as trilateral cooperation including neighbour Japan, Han's office said. The White House said in a statement that the US president 'expressed his appreciation for the resiliency of democracy and the rule of law in the ROK and reaffirmed the ironclad commitment of the United States to the people of the ROK,' using the abbreviation for the country's formal name, the Republic of Korea. 'President Biden expressed his confidence that the Alliance will remain the linchpin for peace and prosperity in the Indo-Pacific region during Acting President Han’s tenure.' Han convened his cabinet and National Security Council shortly after Saturday's impeachment vote and vowed to maintain military readiness to prevent any breach of national security. South Korea’s partners wanted to see a credible and constitutional temporary leadership put in place as soon as possible, said Philip Turner, a former New Zealand ambassador to South Korea. 'They will be pleased to see Prime Minister Han take over as acting president,' he said. 'He is capable, experienced and well respected in foreign capitals.' But even with an acting president in place, international partners face months of uncertainty before a new president can be elected and a new government established, Turner added. The Constitutional Court has up to six months to decide whether to remove or reinstate Yoon. If he is removed or resigns, a new elections will be held within 60 days. 'During that time Korea’s highly competent professional bureaucracy can be relied on to keep the country’s foreign policy running, but they will find it hard to provide clear direction,' Turner said. Economic fallout South Korean shares rose for a fourth straight session on Friday on hopes that the political uncertainty would ease after the impeachment vote in parliament, which followed a failed vote a week earlier. Democratic Party leader Lee said the most pressing issue is a slump in consumption caused by insufficient domestic demand and the government's reduction of its fiscal role. He called for a National Stability Council for Governance comprising the government and parliament to discuss finance, economy and public livelihoods. 'To address this, I believe it is necessary to promptly discuss a supplementary budget,' Lee said, adding that a supplementary budget could include funding to support small businesses and investments related to artificial intelligence and infrastructure to try to head off energy shortages. Parliament, controlled by Lee's party, passed a 673.3 trillion won ($470.6 billion) 2025 budget bill on Tuesday that cut the government's 677.4 trillion won proposal, without reaching agreement with Yoon's People Power Party and the government. By law parliament cannot increase government budgets, and at the time the Democratic Party said a supplementary budget could be needed to address spending for people's livelihoods. The party said its cuts were mostly in reserve funds for the government, interest costs and funds allocated to the presidential office, prosecutors and auditors for classified operations. The government accused parliament of delaying projects for small businesses with the cuts. Deadlock over budget issues was one of the justifications Yoon cited for imposing martial law.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWemupebX1drw2R71TIEldhh	2024-12-15T15:54:41-08:00	
Indonesia: Joining BRICS And OECD As A Member – OpEd	As Southeast Asia's largest economy, Indonesia has made significant advancements in both economic and geopolitical stature, prompting discussions about its potential membership in influential international organizations such as BRICS and the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). The BRIC grouping, which includes Brazil, Russia, India, and China, and has been expanded to BRICS with the addition of South Africa, comprises emerging economies that challenge traditional global powers. In contrast, the OECD is a forum for high-income economies to coordinate policies and promote sustainable growth. Membership in these organizations could solidify Indonesia’s status as a global economic powerhouse; however, the journey is not without its challenges, including domestic governance issues, economic inequality, and environmental sustainability. This essay analyzes Indonesia's candidacy by assessing its economic potential, social progress, and the obstacles it must overcome while offering recommendations to enhance its global integration. Indonesia’s Economic Potential and Case for BRICS Membership Indonesia's economic trajectory makes it a prime candidate for BRICS membership. As of 2024, the country's gross domestic product (GDP) is projected to reach $1.43 trillion, ranking it as the world’s 16th largest economy and the largest in Southeast Asia. The nation has consistently experienced GDP growth of 5-6% annually, fueled by domestic consumption, a burgeoning digital economy valued at $77 billion, and abundant natural resources such as coal, palm oil, and nickel—crucial elements in the global supply chain for renewable energy technologies like electric vehicles. Geopolitically, Indonesia's strategic location at the crossroads of the Indian and Pacific Oceans allows it to control vital maritime trade routes. As a founding member of ASEAN and an active participant in the G20, Indonesia has demonstrated its capability to navigate complex multilateral frameworks. Including Indonesia in BRICS would enhance the group's legitimacy as a representative of the Global South, fostering cooperation among emerging economies. Nevertheless, challenges persist. Indonesia’s economy, while robust, is significantly smaller than those of BRICS heavyweights like China and India, whose GDPs exceed $14 trillion and $3.7 trillion, respectively. Additionally, BRIC's occasionally anti-Western rhetoric may conflict with Indonesia’s non-aligned foreign policy, which seeks to maintain balanced relations with both Western powers and the Global South. Indonesia’s Social Progress and OECD Membership Aspiration Indonesia's aspirations for OECD membership demonstrate its commitment to aligning with global standards for economic and social development. Under President Joko Widodo (Jokowi), recent reforms have focused on enhancing the business environment, notably through the landmark Omnibus Law on Job Creation (2020), which streamlined regulations and increased foreign investment. The ongoing construction of the new capital city, Nusantara, further exemplifies Indonesia’s modernization efforts. Social indicators reflect this progress as well—literacy rates have risen to 96%, and the proportion of the population living below the poverty line has dropped to 8.5% in 2024. Indonesia is also committed to sustainability, pledging to achieve net-zero emissions by 2060, backed by a growing renewable energy sector. However, significant challenges remain on the path to OECD membership. Governance issues persist, as evidenced by Transparency International ranking Indonesia 96th in its 2024 Corruption Perception Index. Income inequality is another concern, with a Gini index of 38.2 indicating a considerable wealth gap. Furthermore, while Indonesia has made progress in renewable energy, issues such as deforestation and reliance on coal-fired power plants undermine its environmental credentials. These challenges highlight the necessity for structural reforms to meet the OECD’s rigorous policy standards. Problems and Challenges in Global Integration Indonesia's integration into BRICS and OECD is fraught with obstacles. Domestically, infrastructure gaps continue to exist despite significant investment. Rapid development in urban centers like Jakarta contrasts with the underdevelopment of rural areas, limiting equitable growth. Disparities in education further impede human capital development, with access to quality education skewed in favor of urban populations. Politically, it is essential for Indonesia to ensure the continuity of economic reforms, such as infrastructure development and investment-friendly regulations, alongside a stable foreign policy framework to advance its global integration aspiration. On the international stage, Indonesia faces a delicate balancing act. While BRICS membership could bolster its influence in the Global South, aligning with the bloc's anti-Western stance may strain relations with Western partners. Conversely, joining the OECD may necessitate Indonesia adopting policies that challenge its current economic model, including stricter labor standards and a reduced reliance on resource-based industries. Environmental challenges are significant. Indonesia's deforestation rate, largely driven by palm oil production, is among the highest in the world, leading to biodiversity loss and increased carbon emissions. Meeting the environmental expectations of the OECD and BRICS will necessitate a shift towards sustainable agricultural practices and considerable investment in clean energy. Benefits of Membership in BRICS and OECD Joining BRICS and OECD presents Indonesia with substantial advantages. Economically, BRICS membership would grant access to development funding and technological cooperation, particularly in infrastructure and renewable energy. It would also strengthen Indonesia’s bargaining power in global trade negotiations, providing a more influential voice in shaping international commerce. OECD membership would enhance Indonesia’s reputation as a reform-oriented economy, attracting increased foreign direct investment. The OECD’s policy frameworks could serve as a model for improving governance, education, and environmental sustainability, aligning Indonesia with best practices in these areas. Geopolitically, membership in both organizations would reinforce Indonesia’s role as a bridge between developed and developing nations. As a member of BRICS, Indonesia could advocate for the interests of the Global South, while OECD membership would affirm its status among leading economies, enhancing its diplomatic influence. Recommendations To optimize its chances of successful integration, Indonesia should prioritize the following actions: Strengthen Governance: Enhance transparency and reduce corruption through the digitalization of public services and stricter enforcement of anti-corruption laws. Address Inequality : Expand social welfare programs and invest in rural development to mitigate wealth disparities and improve access to education. Accelerate Environmental Reforms: Implement stricter controls on deforestation, promote reforestation efforts, and expedite the transition from coal to renewable energy sources. Maintain Policy Continuity: Ensure that ongoing economic reforms and infrastructure projects remain stable and consistent. Engage in Multilateral Diplomacy: Balance relationships with both Western and non-Western blocs to uphold Indonesia’s non-aligned foreign policy stance. Conclusion Indonesia’s pursuit of BRICS and OECD membership reflects its ambition to evolve from a regional leader into a global powerhouse. With a robust economy, a strategic geopolitical position, and ongoing reforms, Indonesia has the potential to make significant contributions to both organizations. However, challenges such as governance issues, inequality, and environmental sustainability must be addressed to ensure successful integration. By prioritizing structural reforms, equitable development, and sustainable policies, Indonesia can meet the expectations of BRICS and OECD while setting a precedent for other emerging economies seeking global recognition.

Who Lost The Great Chess Match? – OpEd	Vladimir Putin's strategic gambit in Ukraine produced results far different from what he anticipated. Ukraine, intended as bait in Russia's geopolitical play, became a trap that backfired when NATO provided coordinated support, overturning Putin's plans. Expecting to crush Ukrainian resistance swiftly and return to business as usual, Putin instead found his assumptions thwarted. NATO's extensive assistance to Ukraine—training, weaponry, intelligence, and ammunition—inflicted significant costs on Russia. This backing not only stymied Russia militarily but also imposed severe economic burdens through Western sanctions. The fallout disrupted key Russian projects, including delays in the construction of the Akkuyu Nuclear Power Plant in Turkey. While initially focused on the Syrian conflict, Russia redirected its attention to Ukraine under growing Western pressure. Although it managed to occupy areas in Eastern Ukraine with significant Russian-speaking populations and restricted Ukraine's Black Sea access, the war has come at an enormous cost. To date, an estimated one million soldiers and civilians from both sides have lost their lives in the conflict. Putin's influence in the Middle East has also sharply declined. Russian naval and air bases in Syria have been rendered largely ineffective, and allies like Iran are preoccupied with domestic challenges. Furthermore, Russia's relationship with Turkey has grown increasingly precarious. Once a strategic partner, Turkey now poses potential risks for Putin, with unresolved issues like the fate of the S-400 missile systems further straining ties. These developments have significantly undermined Russia's strategic dominance, leaving its hegemonic ambitions in question. At the same time, Turkey faces new risks, finding itself squeezed between competing global powers. As a result, Ankara must navigate its moves with precision to secure its strategic interests. Putin's loss in this geopolitical chess match extends beyond Ukraine and Syria. It has weakened Russia's position in the global power balance, leaving the future role of countries like Turkey pivotal in shaping the emerging world order.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWemupebX1drw6IpL6WnoxJF	2024-12-15T15:50:26-08:00
