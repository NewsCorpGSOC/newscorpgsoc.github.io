Realigning International Approaches To Myanmar’s Crisis: Supporti...	As Myanmar's struggle for democracy enters its fourth-year post-coup, it is crucial to reassess international diplomatic efforts to ensure they align with ground realities and the aspirations of the Myanmar people. While recent joint press statements from democratic nations reflect genuine concern, a more nuanced and proactive approach is needed to effectively support Myanmar's path to democratic transformation. Recognizing the Complexity of the Conflict The common diplomatic language urging 'all armed actors' to de-escalate violence unintentionally creates a false equivalence between the military junta and resistance forces. A more accurate framing would acknowledge that the People's Defense Forces (PDFs), Ethnic Revolutionary Organizations (EROs), and other resistance groups are primarily engaged in defending civilians against the junta's widespread atrocities. While emphasizing the importance of adhering to international humanitarian law, diplomatic language should reflect this crucial distinction. Amplifying the People's Mandate for Systemic Change It is vital to recognize that the people of Myanmar are striving for fundamental systemic change, not a return to the pre-coup status quo. Their aspirations include: Establishing genuine civilian control over the military Drafting a new constitution enshrining democratic principles and ethnic rights Ensuring accountability for human rights violations Implementing comprehensive security sector reform International statements and policies should reflect an understanding of and support for these deep-rooted desires for change. Reevaluating Regional and International Approaches While ASEAN's Five-Point Consensus was initiated with good intentions, its effectiveness has been limited. It may be time to consider a more robust framework that includes enforceable mechanisms for compliance and broader international support. This could involve: Enhancing engagement with multiple stakeholders, including the National Unity Government (NUG), ethnic political organizations, and civil society groups Implementing more targeted economic measures that impact military-owned enterprises while minimizing harm to the general population Providing diplomatic and material support to initiatives working towards democratic governance Addressing Root Causes and Humanitarian Needs While calls for humanitarian access remain crucial, they should be coupled with efforts to address the root causes of the crisis. Long-term solutions require tackling the underlying political and economic structures that perpetuate conflict and deprivation. Diplomatic Deterrence of Foreign Interference A critical aspect often overlooked in diplomatic statements is the need to deter foreign interference that goes against the will of the Myanmar people. This includes not only countries supporting the military junta but also lobbying efforts by international activists, particularly those advocating for the Rohingya, who may seek to isolate the NUG or EROs without fully considering the complex realities on the ground. The United States Commission on International Religious Freedom (USCIRF) 2024 report, for instance, has been criticized for potentially oversimplifying the situation and inadvertently contributing to the isolation of key actors in Myanmar's democratic struggle. There have been escalated efforts to isolate and disparage the Arakan Army (AA) in particular, a group that many in Myanmar hold in high esteem for their resistance against the military junta. These well-intentioned but potentially misguided efforts can complicate the path to a peaceful resolution and democratic transition in Myanmar. It is crucial for international actors to engage in a more nuanced understanding of the situation, recognizing the complexities of ethnic relations and the evolving political landscape in Myanmar. Conclusion: A Path Forward The courage and resilience demonstrated by the people of Myanmar in their pursuit of democracy deserve robust, principled support from the international community. By aligning diplomatic efforts more closely with the aspirations of Myanmar's diverse population and actively deterring harmful foreign interference, there is potential to foster a path towards lasting peace and genuine democratic transformation. As we move forward, it is crucial to recognize that sustainable solutions must address the fundamental issues that have long plagued Myanmar's political landscape. Only through supporting systemic change, as envisioned by the people of Myanmar, and safeguarding their right to self-determination free from external interference, can we hope to see the emergence of a truly democratic Myanmar where the military is subordinate to civilian rule and all ethnic nationalities enjoy equal rights and representation.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWcVKcTeoxaf12TUo6Khsq2P	2025-01-07T17:18:15-08:00	
Keeping The Spotlight On Africa’s Child Soldiers – Analysis	By Naomi Haupt As violence and instability rise, African countries must reaffirm their commitment to protecting children and support DDR initiatives. Roughly 21 000 children have been recruited as soldiers by government forces and armed groups across Africa in the past five years. In 2020, around 337 million children lived within 50 km of active conflicts worldwide, with 118 million in Africa, where one in six risked being recruited. Africa’s youthful population (40% are under 16 years) has seen rising violence, particularly in the Sahel, where Islamist insurgencies are expanding. A 2021 United Nations (UN) report highlighted West and Central Africa as the regions with the highest verified child soldier recruitment from 2016-20. Globally, in 2021 alone, 6 310 children were drawn into conflict zones, with Africa accounting for 40% of the global child soldier population. And from 2005-22, over 105 000 children were documented as recruited by armed forces and non-state actors in conflict zones worldwide. Minors typically join armed groups through abduction or coercion – recruited as soldiers, lookouts, porters, spies, cooks or sex slaves. Girls are especially vulnerable, compelled to work as spies, cooks and fighters. Some are forced to marry combatants. In 2022, the UN Children’s Fund provided reintegration or protection support to nearly 12 500 former child soldiers and informed over nine million children about avoiding explosive remnants of war. It is estimated that over a billion US dollars were needed to meet the protection requirements of children in armed conflict by 2024, increasing to US$1.37 billion by 2026. The economic impact of using child soldiers significantly hampers national development. Missing out on schooling results in lost human capital and reduced productivity, contributing to long-term economic stagnation, decreased workforce participation, higher poverty rates, and reduced foreign investment due to ongoing instability. Countries also incur increased social service costs related to the healthcare and legal needs of former child soldiers, along with the social instability arising from reintegration challenges. Child recruitment by armed groups and government forces remains a major problem despite international commitments. The Convention on the Rights of the Child has been ratified by 196 countries, and 173 have ratified the convention’s optional protocol that prohibits recruitment of children under 18 years into armed conflict. The economic impact of using child soldiers significantly hampers national development The Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) has taken steps to combat the problem by focusing on prevention, protection and reintegration. The ECOWAS Child Policy (2019-30) aims to prevent recruitment by promoting community awareness, legal reform, and tackling social and economic factors. ECOWAS stands out for its regional approach, its Child Protection Unit and comprehensive disarmament, demobilisation and reintegration (DDR) programmes. Other regions also implement robust DDR initiatives but face hurdles such as logistical and security challenges, often relying on international support. ECOWAS also promotes the enforcement of policies and laws, ensuring that violators face significant consequences. It has established monitoring and reporting mechanisms to collect data on child recruitment and hold perpetrators accountable. However, recent coups and the withdrawal of Burkina Faso, Mali and Niger from the regional bloc have weakened the Child Policy’s effectiveness. Over the past 20 years, there have been DDR programmes in over 30 countries globally – with about two-thirds of these in Africa. These programmes have provided access to education, vocational training and psychological support, enabling former child soldiers to reintegrate into their communities, reducing stigma and re-recruitment risks. Effective DDR is complex – requiring long-term funding and collaboration among governments, non-governmental organisations and international organisations. ECOWAS stands out for its regional approach, Child Protection Unit and comprehensive DDR programmes ECOWAS promotes community-based reintegration that engages local leaders, schools and civil society to ensure former youth fighters are accepted and supported. This involvement is crucial for fostering social cohesion and stability. But ongoing challenges include financial constraints, political instability and cultural norms, which can reinforce child recruitment. Specialised care for trauma and mental health is limited, with few programmes offering combined education, vocational training and mental health support. A lack of accurate data hampers the monitoring and evaluation of DDR programmes. Corruption also undermines child protection, diverting resources from essential services and eroding public trust, which deters communities from reporting abuses. In such environments, legal accountability is weak, allowing child exploitation to go unpunished. To safeguard children, child protection systems must be strengthened at all levels of government and society. National laws prohibiting the recruitment of child soldiers must be prioritised across Africa. High-risk countries must provide comprehensive services for former youth fighters, and help local communities to effectively reintegrate former child soldiers and prevent their re-enlistment. UN Security Council decisions on the issue should be reinvigorated to pressure member states to take greater proactive action. Thomas Lubanga Dyilo’s conviction by the International Criminal Court for using child soldiers in the Democratic Republic of the Congo shows how the international legal system can help curb the problem.

Critical Minerals, Waning Western Influence A Focus Of Chinese FM...	By Kate Bartlett Critical minerals and oil, a renewed focus on the Atlantic coast, and the West’s loss of influence in the Sahel are some of the reasons analysts believe Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi has chosen the Republic of Congo, Nigeria, Chad and Namibia as the stops on his visit to Africa this week. For decades it has been tradition that Beijing’s top diplomat makes his first foreign foray of the year to the African continent, and each time experts try to analyse the reasons behind the specific itinerary. 'It’s always a mix of big states and small ones. The main point of all of this is to show that China is a non-discriminatory partner; that it doesn’t have 'important countries,’ the way Western powers would tend to cherry pick,' Cobus van Staden, an editor at the China Global South Project, told VOA in a WhatsApp voice message. During his first stop in Namibia on Monday, Wang said the 35-year-old tradition of starting the year with an Africa trip shows the world that 'China remains Africa’s most reliable friend' and its 'strongest supporter…on the global stage,' Chinese state news agency Xinhua reported. Namibia and minerals Namibia is Wang’s southern African pit-stop this year. The country 'is China’s major maritime partner on Africa’s Atlantic seaboard, where the largest concentration of China’s port developments are located,' Paul Nantulya, a research associate at the Africa Center for Strategic Studies in Washington, D.C., told VOA. Van Staden echoed this, noting that 'the last year or two there seems to have been an emphasis on the Indian Ocean, this year they seem to be rebalancing towards the Atlantic.' Namibia is also rich in uranium and critical minerals like lithium, cobalt and manganese. Namibia’s president, Nangolo Mbumba, said at his meeting with Wang this week that Chinese investment 'continues to play a significant role in developing Namibia’s uranium sector as one of the biggest global uranium producers.' Mbumba and Wang also spoke about Chinese investments in infrastructure such as a planned desalination plant. Chinese companies are also starting to build Namibia’s largest solar power plant this year. Republic of Congo and oil After Namibia, Wang heads next to the Republic of Congo, another Atlantic seaboard country and the incoming African co-chair of the Forum for China Africa Cooperation or FOCAC. The country, which is next to mineral-rich Congo, has untapped mineral deposits, but its economy is mainly based around oil, which accounts for some 80 percent of its exports, according to the World Bank. Van Staden said 'the diversification of Chinese oil imports' could be part of the reason for Wang’s visit to the country, as well as to the other two oil producers on the agenda: Chad and Nigeria. 'The Republic of Congo used to be a big oil exporter to China, but over the years China’s diversified its oil supplies,' he said. However, the Republic of Congo is trying to increase production and last year Cogo, the Congolese subsidiary of China Oil Natural Gas Overseas, announced a $150 million investment in two oil fields there. A Chinese company also holds a controversial permit to conduct oil exploration near a national park. In a September meeting between Chinese President Xi Jinping and Congolese President Denis Sassou Nguesso in Beijing last year, the Chinese foreign ministry readout stated, 'China supports the Republic of the Congo in developing a diversified economy, and encourages Chinese enterprises to participate in the construction of major infrastructure and regional connectivity projects in the country.' Over the years, China and its companies have been investing in major infrastructure projects in the Republic of Congo, building roads and modernizing the airport. It has gifted the country a new parliament building and construction is set to begin on a $9 billion hydropower dam this month. Chad and security Another country Wang will visit this week is Chad, the Central African nation that saw relations with Bejing elevated to a 'strategic partnership' during last year’s FOCAC. 'Chad and its immediate neighbors play a key role in China’s effort to secure global supply chains of critical minerals in the high-tech and clean energy sectors, including the EV industry which China dominates so far,' said Nantulya. Situated in the volatile Sahel region, which has seen a spate of coups in recent years, oil-rich Chad has been under military rule since a 2021 putsch. Chad is also one of several regional countries that have asked troops belonging to former colonial power France to leave amid rising anti-French sentiment. In December, Chad ordered France to withdraw about 1,000 troops from the country, where it had long been helping to fight jihadist insurgents. The void left by the West could be China’s gain, analysts said. 'It is the fifth former African French colony to remove French forces from its territory,' said Nantulya of Chad. 'China has been showing great interest in ramping up its strategic security engagements with these countries as seen by the sharp increase in Chinese military engagement in Mali, Burkina Faso, Niger, and Senegal in particular, as well as Ivory Coast.' Nigeria and trade Analysts say one of the more obvious stops on Wang’s 2025 tour is Nigeria, Africa’s most populous country and one of its biggest economies. Cliff Mboya, a postdoctoral fellow at the Center for Africa-China Studies at the University of Johannesburg, said trade would be a major item on the agenda. 'Looking at Nigeria, one of the issues that also came out strongly during the last FOCAC was market access for African products into China, and Nigeria was one of the leading countries pushing for this idea,' he told VOA. 'So that will feature more prominently during Wang Yi’s visit to Nigeria.' Security is also a factor, said Oluwole Ojewale, a Nigerian researcher at the Institute for Security Studies. 'If you also look at the things that bind Nigeria and Chad together, one of them is the counter insurgency operations that both countries have been involved in for a while now,' he told VOA. 'Maybe the Chinese foreign affairs minister is also going to talk about security partnerships.' Filling the void Ojewale added that the stops on Wang’s trip can also be seen through the lens of regional geopolitical competition. 'Where the Western alliance and establishment have vacated in Africa, we’re seeing in equal proportion China or Russia in particular occupying those places — supplanting the Western alliance,' he said. And while such trips happen every year, Van Staden said this year’s trip is especially significant given that on Jan. 20th the U.S. will see a change of government when president-elect Donald Trump starts his 2nd term in office. 'I think the main message that [the Chinese are] trying to send is that they’re a constant partner, that they’re not fickle,' he said. 'This message is of course reinforced right ahead of the Trump inauguration, you know, where a lot of people expect a low level of interest in Washington in relation to Africa.'	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWcVKcTeoxaf17J1C6BVB_gm	2025-01-07T16:42:12-08:00	
How Artificial Intelligence Will Affect Asia’s Economies – Analys...	Asia-Pacific’s economies are likely to experience labor market shifts because of artificial intelligence, with advanced economies being affected more. About half of all jobs in the region’s advanced economies are exposed to AI, compared to only about a quarter in emerging market and developing economies. However, as we show in our latest Asia-Pacific Regional Economic Outlook, there are also more jobs in the region’s advanced economies that can be complemented by AI, meaning that the technology will likely enhance productivity rather than replace these roles altogether. The concentration of such jobs in Asia’s advanced economies could worsen inequality between countries over time. While about 40 percent of jobs in Singapore are rated as highly complementary to AI, the share is just 3 percent in Laos. AI could also increase inequality within countries. Most workers at risk of displacement in the Asia-Pacific region work in service, sales, and clerical support roles. Meanwhile, workers who are more likely to benefit from AI typically work in managerial, professional, and technician roles that already tend to be among the better paid professions. As the Chart of the Week shows, we also find that women are more likely to be at risk of disruption from AI because they are more often in service, sales, and clerical roles. Men, by contrast, are more represented in occupations that are unlikely to be impacted by AI at this stage, like farm workers, machine operators, and low-skill elementary workers. How could policymakers address the threat of worsening inequality? First, effective social safety nets combined with reskilling programs for affected workers will be critical to achieve an inclusive AI transition. Second, education and training to help the workforce leverage what AI makes possible will be especially relevant in Asia’s emerging economies, given that they have relatively few jobs in which AI could make workers more productive. It will also help displaced workers transition to new roles and support research and development that enhances innovation. In addition, governments should set regulations that promote ethical AI use and data protection. Doing so can mitigate the risks of AI-induced disruptions and better capitalize on the opportunities for economic growth and improved productivity. —This article is based on Box 1 of the analytical note included in the October 2024 Asia-Pacific Regional Economic Outlook. For more on AI and jobs, see IMF Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva’s blog on labor market implications and the Chart of the Week showing which economies are better equipped for AI adoption.

Europe Isn’t The Real Threat To Ukraine Peace But UK – OpEd	The Biden Administration has not given up on Ukraine war. A meeting of the Ramstein Format Meeting is scheduled to take place in Germany on Thursday, chaired by the outgoing US Defence Secretary Lloyd Austin, to address Ukraine’s defence needs, which the Ukrainian President Zelensky will also address. Meanwhile, Kiev launched an attack in the Kursk region on the eve of the Ramstein Format event as the 'curtain-raiser'. The operation, although played up in the British press, is spearheaded by just 2 tanks and fifteen armoured carriers and will no doubt be crushed by the Russian drones and its highly lethal Ka high-performance combat helicopters with day and night capability, high survivability and fire power. Typically, Zelensky won’t give up on any occasion for grandstanding in front of Western audience. He hopes to display on Thursday that there is still some spunk left in the Ukrainian armed forces. Tragically, he is sacrificing a few dozen Ukrainian soldiers in this melodrama which may distract some attention from the front-line as Russian forces have entered Chasiv Yar and reached the suburbs of Pokrovsk in an operation to surround that city. With the fall of Chasiv Yar and Pokorovsk, the Battle of Donbass is nearing home stretch. It sets the stage for a massive Russian push to the Dnieper River if the Kremlin is left with no other option but to end the war on its terms. (See a recent article on the future map of Ukraine by the top Moscow strategic analyst Dmitry Trenin titled What Ukraine should look like after Russia’s victory.) Indeed, the hopes of Donald Trump bringing the war to an end in the first day of his presidency on January 20 have withered away. The Ramstein meeting is a defiant act by Zelensky and his European associates, as Trump is set to meet Russian President Vladimir Putin soon. On December 18, Zelensky met in Brussels with NATO chief Mark Rutte and huddled with several European leaders to discuss war strategy. His European interlocutors are also seeking to develop their own plans if Trump, who has pledged to bring a swift end to the war, pulls the plug on the Kiev regime or forces it to make concessions. The key topic of the Brussels meeting was security guarantees, Zelensky’s office said. Zelensky highlighted his 'detailed one-on-one discussion' with French President Emmanuel Macron that focused on priorities to further strengthen Ukraine’s position 'regarding the presence of forces in Ukraine that could contribute to stabilising the path to peace.' Prior to the Brussels meeting, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz told reporters that the priority was to secure the 'sovereignty of Ukraine and that it will not be forced to submit to a dictated peace.' But, he cautioned, any discussion of boots on the ground would be premature. Rutte himself counselled that Kiev’s allies should focus on ramping up arms supplies to ensure Ukraine is in a position of strength. Rutte estimated that Ukraine needs 19 additional air-defence systems to protect the country’s energy infrastructure. Interestingly, Rutte announced that the proposed new NATO command in the German city of Wiesbaden is now 'up and running' which will henceforth coordinate Western military aid for Ukraine as well as provide training for Ukraine’s military. Trump is unlikely to preserve the Ramstein Format. Simply put, Europe, including the U.K., lack the capacity to replace the US military assistance to Ukraine. For the EU to replace the US, it would need to double its military aid to Ukraine. But the current political situation in Europe, along with the real military capabilities of individual European countries, makes this an impossible objective. (See an analysis, here, by Samantha de Bendern at the Chatham House.) Germany, Europe’s largest military donor to Ukraine, has plunged into political chaos with the collapse of the Scholz-led coalition. Macron, a staunch defender of Ukraine, has lost control over France’s domestic politics since the June parliamentary elections, where he lost his majority. Elsewhere in Europe, political parties on the far right and far left, with pro-Russian sympathies, are rising. Europeans are running around like headless chicken. The surprise visit of Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni to Florida to meet Trump and watch a movie with him at this critical juncture of the Ukraine war shows that the smart lady has no confidence in the likes of Macron. Meloni has a warm equation with Trump’s close aide Elon Musk and is seeking to strengthen business ties with the US. 'This is very exciting. I’m here with a fantastic woman, the prime minister of Italy,' Trump told the Mar-a-Lago crowd and added expansively, 'She’s really taken Europe by storm.' Italy, an important NATO power that overlooks the Mediterranean is a vociferous supporter of trans-atlanticism, and pursues a nuanced policy on the Ukraine war that may be of use to Trump to build bridges with Europe. Meloni is positioning herself. Italy resolutely condemned the Russian annexation of Crimea and Moscow’s subsequent involvement in Eastern Ukraine and joined the EU sanctions against Russia. It demonstrated its military support for Ukraine with significant military aid packages within the framework of an agreement on security cooperation (under previous government headed by Prime Minister Mario Draghi). That said, Rome has often sought to balance EU responses with its national interests towards Russia. Thus, Meloni’s foreign minister reaffirmed recently, even as Biden authorised Ukraine to deploy long-range American missiles against military targets inside Russia, 'Our position on Ukraine’s use of (Italian) weapons has not changed. They can only be used within Ukrainian territory.' In the final analysis, it is the course of the war that will decide the terms of peace in Ukraine. Europe’s swing toward right-wing governments — Austria is the latest example — may help Russia. However, the crux of the matter is that so long as the spy agencies of Britain and US work in tandem to manipulate the governments in power in White Hall — Labour and Conservative alike — the Trump administration has a serious problem on its hands. Of course, Trump is well aware of the UK’s pivotal role in hatching the 'Russia collusion' plot, which hobbled his presidency. Downsizing Britain’s role can be a game changer for peace in Ukraine. But the MI6’s capacity to influence the Kiev regime is not to be underestimated. Former UK prime minister Boris Johnson played a seminal role in torpedoing the Russia-Ukraine deal negotiated at the peace talks hosted by Turkey in March-April 2022 just weeks into the conflict. Even if Trump strikes a deal with Putin, which in itself is highly problematic as things stand, London is sure to undermine it one way or another at the first available opportunity, given its Russophobic obsession with inflicting a strategic defeat on Russia. Possibly, Trump is savouring Elon Musk’s relentless assault on the British government. 'America should liberate the people of Britain from their tyrannical government,' Musk wrote on X. But British politicians have the skin of rhino. Sir Keir Starmer is giving as good as he gets. Trump’s challenge lies in mothballing the special relationship with the UK.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWcVKcTeoxaf15l7ON-xCkAw	2025-01-07T16:38:15-08:00	
Joe Biden: America’s Worst President? – OpEd	US President Joe Biden had the opportunity to leave a positive impact on America and the world. Unfortunately he was not made of the same stuff as Jimmy Carter. As the clock runs down on Biden's presidency, independent analysis has emerged to examine his record of office, his achievements and failures. One way of assessing Biden's impact is through American feedback following his attempt to run for another term of office. He was rejected by large segments of the American citizenry as unworthy of being reelected. This judgement was not only because of his cognitive decline visible to all, including the most die-hard Democratic party supporters. It was also because of his failure to build a better future for Americans which, in turn, could have had positive ripple effects on the rest of the world. What Biden will be most remembered for by non-Americans around the world is his handling of the war in Gaza. Biden: 'I am a Zionist' In Gaza. and its spillover war in Lebanon, a largely innocent population continues to be subject to the horrors of war beyond anyone’s imagination. Journalists, doctors and nurses, United Nations and neutral NGO workers and volunteers have also been victims of Israel’s killing spree, leading UN Human Rights Chief Volker Türk to say in a statement that 'this unprecedented level of killing, and injury of civilians is a direct consequence of the failure to comply with fundamental principles of international humanitarian law'. Biden and his Secretary of State, Anthony Blinken, have not only been complicit in the illegal and genocidal war in Gaza by providing Israel with unconditional diplomatic and military support for a scorched earth policy. They have also refused to use the clout of the US to bring about a peace settlement. What the world has seen from Biden and Blinken has been pretense, hypocrisy and double talk to give the impression that they have objected to Israeli military action aimed at the collective punishment of the Palestinians. And that they are opposed to the atrocities taking place on a daily basis. The reality has been different. As president, Biden provided Netanyahu with protection and impunity from any international punishment. He has also been responsible for channelling enormous amounts of weaponry and military assistance without which Israel would find it impossible to engage in a prolonged war. It is US influence and pressure that can push Israel to accept a Palestinian state - the primary concern of the Palestinian population and most countries of the world, including in Asia. It is an objective that Biden claims he is in favour of but which his actions indicate to the contrary. According to the Costs of War project at Brown University, the United States provided $17.9 billion in military aid to Israel from October 2023 to October 2024, a record for a single year. Western media reports on this have conveniently omitted to point out that most of this military assistance money has gone back to American companies that make weapons and military equipment for the wars which the US and its proxies have instigated and sustained since the last world war. Not to be forgotten is that a year after the initial Hamas provocative attack, and immediately following Israel's horrific rocket attack on a Gaza strip hospital that killed hundreds of medical staff, patients and visitors, Biden traveled halfway around the world to Tel Aviv to meet with Netanyahu and reiterate his unwavering support for Israel. His supplicatory action and words on the hospital attack carnage serves as a reminder of Biden's moral failings and void when it comes to non American and non Israeli lives. 'I was deeply saddened and outraged by the explosion of the hospital in Gaza yesterday, and based on what I’ve seen, it appears as though it was done by the other team, not you.' How Will History Remember Biden’s Presidency As President, Biden has tried to impress on Americans that he is a man of peace, decency, integrity and honour. However many will remember him as a war merchant extraordinary and a leader woefully deficient in the positive character attributes that his media machine has advertised. There are two other ways to remember Joe Biden, the 44th US president. One is his recent flip flop after repeatedly pronouncing that he would not stand in the way of his son's conviction on tax and gun charges. The full and unconditional presidential pardon he granted for crimes that Hunter Biden committed between January 1, 2014 and December 1, 2024 is unprecedented in US judicial history as it covers offences committed well before Biden's term of office began. It has left an indelible stain on Biden's honor and integrity, and provided critics with ammunition to refute Biden's claim that he has advanced effective and accountable justice and democracy in America. The other way to remember Biden's place in history is by the outpouring of tributes and eulogies from Americans and non-Americans remembering Jimmy Carter following his death. The influential Arab media leader, Arab News, had this commendation: 'The Palestinian people have this week lost one of the most outspoken champions of their cause. Jimmy Carter, the 39th president of the US, died on Sunday at the age of 100. Carter will be remembered as a man of integrity and courage. His readiness to move away from the more orthodox foreign policy line adopted by both Democrats and Republicans back in the 1970s over the Arab-Israeli conflict triggered fundamental shifts in how the world later approached that conflict, with the plight of the Palestinians as its core. 'Carter’s life embodied the American dream, while transcending it through his dedication to global service. His one term as president (1977-1981), even though he was often criticized during his tenure, yielded lasting diplomatic triumphs, most notably the Camp David Accords between Israel and Egypt — an achievement that earned him respect as a peacemaker long after he left office. …. 'His 2002 Nobel Peace Prize recognized his diplomatic achievements and his lifelong dedication to advancing human dignity and peace. Throughout his life, Carter maintained a reputation for integrity that stood as a beacon in American public life. His plainspoken manner and modest lifestyle reflected his belief that true greatness lies in serving others. Even as he faced criticism for his political positions, few questioned his sincerity or commitment to his principles.' Biden had the opportunity to leave a similar positive impact on America and the world. Unfortunately he was not made of the same stuff as Jimmy Carter.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWcVKcTeoxaf1x2gyrfXWndR	2025-01-07T16:36:20-08:00	
The Cost Of Facebook’s Now-Repudiated Censorship – OpEd	History will remember this era as the moment when America’s most sacred principles collided with unprecedented institutional power – and lost. The systematic dismantling of fundamental rights didn’t happen through military force or executive decree, but through the quiet cooperation of tech platforms, media gatekeepers, and government agencies, all claiming to protect us from 'misinformation.' Meta’s sudden dismantling of its fact-checking program – announced by Zuckerberg as a 'cultural tipping point towards prioritizing speech' – reads like a quiet footnote to what history may record as one of the most staggering violations of fundamental rights in recent memory. After eight years of increasingly aggressive content moderation, including nearly 100 fact-checking organizations operating in over 60 languages, Meta is now pivoting to a community-driven system similar to X’s model. In his announcement, Zuckerberg first suggests that the censorship was purely a technical mistake, and then changes his tune near the end and admits what has long been litigated: 'The only way that we can push back on this global trend is with the support of the US government. And that’s why it’s been so difficult over the past 4 years when even the US government has pushed for censorship. By going after us and other American companies, it has emboldened other governments to go even further.' In many court cases costing millions, involving vast FOIA requests, depositions, and discoveries, the truth of this has been documented in 100,000 pages of evidence. The Murthy v. Missouri case alone uncovered substantial communications through FOIA and depositions, revealing the depth of government coordination with social media platforms. The Supreme Court considered it all but several justices simply could not comprehend the substance and scale, and thus reversed a lower court injunction to stop it all. Now we have Zuckerberg openly admitting precisely what was in dispute: the US government’s involvement in aggressive violation of the First Amendment. This should, at least, make it easier to find redress as the cases proceed. Still, it is frustrating. Tens of millions have been spent to prove what he could have admitted years ago. But back then, the censors were still in charge, and Facebook was guarding its relationship with the powers that be. The timing of the shift is telling: a Trump ally joining the board, Meta’s president of global affairs being replaced by a prominent Republican, and a new administration preparing to take control. But while Zuckerberg frames this as a return to free speech principles, the damage of their experiment in mass censorship can’t be undone with a simple policy change. The irony runs deep: private companies claiming independence while acting as extensions of state power. Consider our own experience: posting Mussolini’s definition of fascism as 'the merger of state and corporate power' – only to have Meta remove it as 'misinformation.' This wasn’t just censorship; it was meta-censorship – silencing discussion about the very mechanisms of control being deployed. While tech platforms maintained the facade of private enterprise, their synchronized actions with government agencies revealed a more troubling reality: the emergence of exactly the kind of state-corporate fusion they were trying to prevent us from discussing. As we’ve covered before, we didn’t just cross lines – we crossed sacred Rubicons created after humanity’s darkest chapters. The First Amendment, born from revolution against tyranny, and the Nuremberg Code, established after World War II’s horrors, were meant to be unbreakable guardians of human rights. Both were systematically dismantled in the name of 'safety.' The same tactics of misinformation, fear, and government overreach that our ancestors warned against were deployed with frightening efficiency. This systematic dismantling left no topic untouched: from discussions of vaccine effects to debates about virus origins to questions about mandate policies. Scientific discourse was replaced with approved narratives. Medical researchers couldn’t share findings that diverged from institutional positions, as seen in the removal of credible discussions of Covid-19 data and policy. Even personal experiences were labeled 'misinformation' if they didn’t align with official messaging – a pattern that reached absurd heights when even discussing the nature of censorship itself became grounds for censorship. The damage rippled through every layer of society. At the individual level, careers were destroyed and professional licenses revoked simply for sharing genuine experiences. Scientists and doctors who questioned prevailing narratives found themselves professionally ostracized. Many were made to feel isolated or irrational for trusting their own eyes and experiences when platforms labeled their firsthand accounts as 'misinformation.' The destruction of family bonds may prove even more lasting. Holiday tables emptied. Grandparents missed irreplaceable moments with grandchildren. Siblings who had been close for decades stopped speaking. Years of family connections shattered not over disagreements about facts, but over the very right to discuss them. Perhaps most insidious was the community-level damage. Local groups splintered. Neighbors turned against neighbors. Small businesses faced blacklisting. Churches divided. School board meetings devolved into battlegrounds. The social fabric that enables civil society began unraveling – not because people held different views, but because the very possibility of dialogue was deemed dangerous. The censors won. They showed that with enough institutional power, they could break apart the social fabric that makes free discourse possible. Now that this infrastructure for suppression exists, it stands ready to be deployed again for whatever cause seems urgent enough. The absence of a public reckoning sends a chilling message: there is no line that cannot be crossed, no principle that cannot be ignored. True reconciliation demands more than Meta’s casual policy reversal. We need a full, transparent investigation documenting every instance of censorship – from suppressed vaccine injury reports to blocked scientific debates about virus origins to silenced voices questioning mandate policies. This isn’t about vindication – it’s about creating an unassailable public record ensuring these tactics can never be deployed again. Our Constitution’s First Amendment wasn’t a suggestion – it was a sacred covenant written in the blood of those who fought tyranny. Its principles aren’t outdated relics but vital protections against the very overreach we just witnessed. When institutions treat these foundational rights as flexible guidelines rather than inviolable boundaries, the damage ripples far beyond any single platform or policy. Like many in our circles, we witnessed this firsthand. But personal vindication isn’t the goal. Every voice silenced, every debate suppressed, every relationship fractured in service of 'approved narratives' represents a tear in our social fabric that makes us all poorer. Without a full accounting and concrete safeguards against future overreach, we’re leaving future generations vulnerable to the same autocratic impulses wearing different masks. The question isn’t whether we can restore what was lost – we can’t. The question is whether we’ll finally recognize these rights as truly inviolable, or continue treating them as inconvenient obstacles to be swept aside whenever fear and urgency demand it. Benjamin Franklin warned that those who would surrender essential liberty to purchase a little temporary safety deserve neither liberty nor safety. Our answer to this challenge will determine whether we leave our children a society that defends essential liberties or one that casually discards them in the name of safety. Here is the full transcript of Mark Zuckerberg’s announcement, January 7, 2024: Hey, everyone. I wanna talk about something important today because it’s time to get back to our roots around free expression on Facebook and Instagram. I started building social media to give people a voice. I gave a speech at Georgetown 5 years ago about the importance of protecting free expression, and I still believe this today. But a lot has happened over the last several years. There’s been widespread debate about potential harms from online content, governments and legacy media have pushed to censor more and more. A lot of this is clearly political, but there’s also a lot of legitimately bad stuff out there. Drugs, terrorism, child exploitation. These are things that we take very seriously and I wanna make sure that we handle responsibly. So we built a lot of complex systems to moderate content, but the problem with complex systems is they make mistakes. Even if they accidentally censor just 1% of posts, that’s millions of people. And we’ve reached a point where it’s just too many mistakes and too much censorship. The recent elections also feel like a cultural tipping point towards once again prioritizing speech. So we’re gonna get back to our roots and focus on reducing mistakes, simplifying our policies, and restoring free expression on our platforms. More specifically, here’s what we’re gonna do. First, we’re gonna get rid of fact-checkers and replace them with community notes similar to X starting in the US. After Trump first got elected in 2016, the legacy media wrote nonstop about how misinformation was a threat to democracy. We tried in good faith to address those concerns without becoming the arbiters of truth, but the fact-checkers have just been too politically biased and have destroyed more trust than they’ve created, especially in the US. So over the next couple of months, we’re gonna phase in a more comprehensive community note system. Second, we’re gonna simplify our content policies and get rid of a bunch of restrictions on topics like immigration and gender that are just out of touch with mainstream discourse. What started as a movement to be more inclusive has increasingly been used to shut down opinions and shut out people with different ideas, and it’s gone too far. So I wanna make sure that people can share their beliefs and experiences on our platforms. Third, we’re changing how we enforce our policies to reduce the mistakes that account for the vast majority of censorship on our platforms. We used to have filters that scanned for any policy violation. Now we’re gonna focus those filters on tackling illegal and high severity violations. And for lower severity violations, we’re going to rely on someone reporting an issue before we take action. The problem is that the filters make mistakes and they take down a lot of content that they shouldn’t. So by dialing them back, we’re gonna dramatically reduce the amount of censorship on our platforms. We’re also going to tune our content filters to require much higher confidence before taking down content. The reality is that this is a trade-off. It means we’re gonna catch less bad stuff, but we’ll also reduce the number of innocent people’s posts and accounts that we accidentally take down. Fourth, we’re bringing back civic content. For a while, the community asked to see less politics because it was making people stressed. So we stopped recommending these posts, but it feels like we’re in a new era now and we’re starting to get feedback that people want to see this content again. So we’re gonna start phasing this back into Facebook, Instagram and Threads while working to keep the communities friendly and positive. Fifth, Fifth, we’re gonna move our trust and safety and content moderation teams out of California and our US-based content review is going to be based in Texas. As we work to promote free expression, I think that will help us build trust to do this work in places where there is less concern about the bias of our teams. Finally, we’re gonna work with President Trump to push back on governments around the world that are going after American companies and pushing to censor more. The US has the strongest constitutional protections for free expression in the world. Europe has an ever increasing number of laws institutionalizing censorship and making it difficult to build anything innovative there. Latin American countries have secret courts that can order companies to quietly take things down. China has censored our apps from even working in the country. The only way that we can push back on this global trend is with the support of the US government. And that’s why it’s been so difficult over the past 4 years when even the US government has pushed for censorship. By going after us and other American companies, it has emboldened other governments to go even further. But now we have the opportunity to restore free expression, and I am excited to take it. It’ll take time to get this right. And these are complex systems. They’re never gonna be perfect. There’s also a lot of illegal stuff that we still need to work very hard to remove. But the bottom line is that after years of having our content moderation work focused primarily on removing content, it is time to focus on reducing mistakes, simplifying our systems, and getting back to our roots about giving people voice. I’m looking forward to this next chapter. Stay good out there and more to come soon.' About the authors: Joshua Stylman has been an entrepreneur and investor for over 30 years.

Ireland And The Housing Crisis – OpEd	By Sergio Fernández Redondo The recent general election in Ireland has left a rather divided political scenario wherein no party has reached the required majority to form government. While the pertinent talks and negotiations to make a coalition take place, voters gaze on helplessly and ponder what kinds of policies their votes will eventually enable. Amid the whole spectacle, special attention is given to proposed policies for housing, given the current crisis the sector is experiencing. Not without reason, since this is one of the main concerns in Ireland at present. Soaring prices have made accommodation unfeasible for most young (and not-so-young) people, be it rented, purchased or built. And the cries for so-called 'fair prices,' both from voters and politicians, evidence a lack of understanding of what a price is. Perhaps still crippled by the labor theory of value and its derivations, some tend to think of a price as an a priori characteristic of an asset that depends on the work necessitated for its manufacture. (Surely, a house now is the same as a house five years ago, and they should cost the same.) In reality, a price is a signal that informs us of the scarcity or abundance of an asset. Simply put, if prices go down, that informs us that there is a greater abundance of that asset and/or less demand for that asset (all things being equal). Likewise, when prices go up, there is a scarcity and/or increased demand and resources should be attracted to produce that asset, which would likewise tend to push prices down. Imposing a price on a good by legislation which is artificially below its actual market value always involves someone else paying for the difference, as well as misallocation of resources and consequent scarcity. Essentially it all comes down to the basic supply and demand curve, and there are multiple reasons why demand is skyrocketing whilst supply is somewhat stagnant. Cultural shift plays an undeniable role; as the Irish institution of the traditional family is gradually eroded, more people need to be housed individually. Still, on the cultural note, there seems to be an underlying popular animosity towards owners who have the vision to adapt their rented properties to meet increased demand ('slum landlord' is a moniker I heard frequently in Dublin). This is hardly a clever strategy at a time when we need more creative entrepreneurs to bring new ideas into the market. The government’s peculiar policy of state-subsidizing hotels to host refugees is also creating a shortage of tourist accommodation that drives many private properties to fill in that niche, shifting houses from the long-term rental market to the more profitable short-term tourist one. Rent caps always cripple the rate of entry of new properties into the rental market. The most defining factor, however, is the dramatic demographic surge that Ireland is experiencing recently, with a net migration (immigrants minus emigrants) of some 80,000 people over the last year alone and between 40,000 and 50,000 annually over the previous years (with a population of over five million). These are trends that the government expects to maintain or even increase. Immigration as a method of population increase normally entails more commotion than the natural method of natality, where people join the market in a more gradual and organized manner, and they can rely on support from their families. This ever-tense market rendered recent interest rate hikes ineffectual (whereas their effect was felt in other countries) and it does not offer much hope of stabilization any time soon. To maintain somewhat stable prices we need to either try to reduce soaring demand for houses or match it with an increased supply. The Irish government seems hellbent on continuing inflating artificially that demand by importing legions of new entrants in the market (the reasons I leave for others to elucidate), so the solution has to come from the other side. Ireland will, therefore, have to up her game and propitiate construction of new homes, both from individuals and property developers. As anyone who has tried to build a house in Ireland will know, however, the sheer number of regulations one must comply with and strict planning permission rules, coupled with rising building costs due to price inflation, taxation, and other nefarious measures (like green policies or minimum wage), makes this endeavor nigh unattainable for the majority. Not to mention the irrational phobia of regulators against affordable alternatives like timber houses. As a Spaniard living in Ireland, one of the things that first strikes me when I go back home is the imposing urban architecture of Spanish towns and cities. After gently strolling through the streets of Dublin or Cork—with their Georgian houses of no more than three or four stories, terraced houses and housing estates—I feel overwhelmed by the towering blocks of flats that constitute the backbone of Spanish urban architecture. Spain underwent a rapid industrial and economic development in the 1960s that necessitated a quick turnaround of new and affordable accommodation for the multitudes of rural dwellers seeking better opportunities in towns. And so, aesthetics were sacrificed for the sake of functionality, and unsightly apartments gradually replaced traditional dwellings throughout most of the national geography. Much as I abhor these brutalist monstrosities, they are one of the main reasons why—compared to Ireland—housing accommodations in Spain has managed to remain more or less affordable throughout the ups and downs of crises, recessions, property bubbles, and other vicissitudes (bar high-pressure zones in some big cities). Rapidly-growing cities invariably have to start growing vertically rather than laterally at some point. If Irish people want the population of their country to continue increasing inordinately—much to my chagrin—traditional quaint architecture will have to yield to more functional and economic flats. In any event, Irish people need to be given freedom to resolve their housing issues without coercion. The market should be deregulated and money being given back to them by tax cutting. A freer environment and less government intervention would propitiate new houses built where and when needed by developers, new properties entering the rental market, and many more people being able to afford building their own house on their own terms. The calls from Sinn Féin and other luminaries for public housing and government plans to deliver houses are nothing short of a bad joke. Pretending that the government—the main culprit of our current predicament—should intervene to solve the very problem they initially created bespeaks an unfathomable level of naivety in the best case, or malevolence in the worst. Obliterating the hotel industry, while penalizing Airbnb lettings, or pushing up the cost of self-building with relentless regulations and taxes while prohibiting inexpensive alternatives provided by the market, are but a mere sample of the kind of ignominy we can expect from the political class. No, Ireland does not need more state intervention to tackle this crisis; they have had enough of it. What they need is more liberty and respect for private property rights and less public intervention in societal affairs.

New Orleans Attack: ISIS’s Lone Wolf Terror May Take An Alarming ...	By Srijan Sharma Shamsud-Din Jabbar, a 42-year-old United States Army veteran, crashed a Ford F-150 pickup truck into a crowd of New Orleans residents celebrating New Year’s Day. He then exited the vehicle and opened fire on the crowd, killing 15 people and injuring 30 more. This kind of lone wolf attack on US soil came after almost eight quiet years — the last similar incident was the October 31, 2017, New York City truck attack, which killed eight people and injured another 12. The ISIS terror group took responsibility for the latter. However, in 2025, the terror dynamics have changed. This recent attack perhaps has indicated a dangerous shift in ISIS’s striking patterns. ISIS lone wolf attacks ISIS has a classic pair of striking patterns: Suicide bombings and lone-wolf attacks. The former has been the most frequent type since January 2024, as it was used in the January 3 bombings in Kerman, Iran, and the March 22 Crocus City Hall attack in Moscow, Russia. ISIS has used high-intensity bombings ever since their capabilities began dwindling. The last reported lone wolf attack in a metropolitan city took place last year in Solingen, Germany, where a Syrian ISIS member stabbed three men during a festival. Similarly, two lone wolf attacks took place on October 16 and December 2, 2023 in Brussels, Belgium and Paris, France, respectively. The assessment shows ISIS was not able to execute a deadly lone wolf attack in the West as it did in Nice, France on July 14, 2016, when a truck rammed a crowd celebrating Bastille Day, killing 86 people and injuring 434 more. Most ISIS strikes have been recorded in Africa, Central Asia and the Middle East; these have mostly been suicide bombings or coordinated mass shootings. ISIS attacks in Western countries were fewer and limited to stabbing incidents; these can be viewed as multiple attempts to execute a lone wolf attack or coordinated lone wolf attacks on a large scale, like they did in Paris in the November 13, 2015 strike and Nice in the aforementioned 2016 attack. Capabilities are limited, but resurgence is possible Since 2017, ISIS’s capabilities started declining after the US intensified its counterterror operations. The nation’s ongoing Operation Inherent Resolve has led to some notable success against ISIS, causing the group’s terrorist presence to dip substantially from 2017 to 2019. In 2019, ISIS was defeated in Syria and Libya. That October, US forces killed ISIS Chief Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi in Operation Kayla Mueller. In 2023, the US killed several senior leaders of ISIS and detained around 79 of its terrorists. The greatest blow came when US forces killed Abu Muhammad al-Adnani, the head of ISIS’s intelligence/foreign branch, Emni, on August 30, 2016. Adnani’s death crippled ISIS’s striking and recruitment capabilities. The terror group is now scrambled, with its capability to strike the West destroyed. ISIS’s presence is now limited to Africa, Central Asia and the Middle East. For the past two years, high-intensity attacks have only been recorded in those regions. ISIS is weakened, but perhaps its potential for resurgence has not been meaningfully considered. The patterns also suggest that whenever its influence is seen to be dwindling, it tries to send a message to the West by carrying out major attacks in West African or Middle Eastern countries. The US-led coalition has intensified its operations against ISIS’s limited and fragmented presence for one year, leading to 200 missionsagainst the group since January 2024. According to reports, the US-led forces have killed 44 terrorists and detained around 166 others. Despite an intensified operation, the outfit still holds a tight grip over its fragmented network and has attempted to capitalize on various opportunities to make a comeback. There are arguably three primary reasons why ISIS could see a strong revival: The first is the US’s shifting focus on Iran due to the Israel–Hamas conflict. The second is the increased destabilization in Syria and West Africa, and now the fall of the Syrian government. The third is the increasing freedom ISIS’s Khorāsānis — residents of the Greater Khorāsān area of the Iranian Plateau — are finding to operate in South and Central Asia, especially in Afghanistan. These have facilitated ISIS’s regrouping at the regional level, which has given the outfit occasional opportunities to carry out low-intensity terror strikes across the globe. The fall of Syria’s Bashar al-Assad government and the mobilization of various Islamic coalitions there have given ISIS, especially Khorāsānis, a window to further resurge and increase their striking capabilities. However, the resurgence factor is not the only thing to worry about; a possible shift in the ISIS striking pattern could help ISIS showcase its capabilities as well. A shift in striking pattern ISIS terror strikes can be classified into three patterns. The first is direct: ISIS directly carries out its strikes. The second is indirect: ISIS enables an attack and indirectly carries out its strikes by connecting to attackers through the Internet. An example of this was the Curtis Culwell Center attack in Garland, Texas on May 3, 2015 — one of the attackers who opened fire at the community center was in contact with ISIS through encrypted texts. The third pattern is inspired: Using online propaganda, ISIS inspires self-radicalized individuals to carry out lone wolf attacks on their own. An example is the 2016 Nice attack. Though the perpetrator, Mohamed Lahouaiej-Bouhlel, acted on his own, ISIS later took credit for his actions. Conversely, there is the April 7, 2017 truck attack in Stockholm, Sweden, where a similar vehicle ramming incident took place. In this case, ISIS did not take credit for the self-radicalized man’s attack. The organization was under intense pressure at that time, and its presence and capabilities had been significantly damaged by US-led coalition forces; by the end of the year, ISIS was defeated in Iraq. ISIS is once again under pressure, this time in Syria, thanks to US airstrikes. As it weaves an opportunity to resurge, some believe the group has resorted to enhancing online propaganda and carrying out inspired attacks without direct involvement. The reason for this possible change to its striking pattern is to ensure resurgence and keep limited striking capabilities intact without exposing itself. Additionally, it seeks to avoid instant retaliatory and offensive responses from the US, which could severely damage ISIS’s chances of resurgence in Syria and elsewhere. If left unchecked, a new, lethal wave of inspired ISIS terror could emerge. The views expressed in this article are the author’s own and do not necessarily reflect Fair Observer’s editorial policy.

Narva Becomes Cultural Capital Of Finno-Ugric World – OpEd	Narva has become the cultural capital of the Finno-Ugric world for 2025 and because of its own ethnic heritage has given that title a new and expanded meaning, one likely to encourage the smallest Finno-Ugric peoples in the region and spark Russian anger about what Moscow will seek to present as evidence of Western interference. When people discuss ethnic relations in Estonia, they typically focus on the relative size of the Estonians and the ethnic Russians, ignoring the fact that there are also small percentages of Finno-Ugric peoples (other than Estonians) including Vods, Izhors, Ingermanland Finns and Narva Finns, Ekaterina Kuznetsova says (region.expert/narva2025/). But the designation of Narva as the cultural capital of Finno-Ugric nations this year has the effect of throwing into high relief their role, dispelling myths about them and giving them hope for survival, the head of the Ingria House and director of the Vod Cultural Center in that eastern Estonian border city says 'Many know that in 1641 to 1654, that city was the administrative center of the Swedish province of Ingermandland; some even call Narva the historical ‘capital’ of Ingria; but unfortunately, few recall what took place there before and afer that period, Kuznetsova continues. Few know that the Ida-Virumaa region is 'the historic motherland at one and the same time of five Finno-Ugric peoples' or that there existed in the 20th century both an Estonian Ingermanland and a Soviet version of that region as well, histories that have every chance to affect the future. 'Estonian Ingermanland – Eesti Ingeri in Estonian – is part of the historical district of Ingria located in the western section of present-day Kingisepp Districtof Leningrad Oblast in the valley of the Narva River.' It became part of Estonia as a result of the 1920 Tartu Peace Treaty and included Ivangorod, the Rosson River and 13 villages where some 1800 people lived. The Soviet government annexed it in 1944; but even before that, there had been what may be called Soviet Ingermanland, although many today are convinced that Moscow always denied the existence of such a place. But during korenizatiya in the 1920s, the Soviet authorities promoted Finnish and even Ingrian languages, although they suppressed them in the 1930s. The fact that so few people know about all this, Kuznetsova says, is the result of Stalnist repressions against these minorities and Moscow’s unceasing Russification campaign that led many Ingrians and others to reidentify as Russians and forget their national pasts, even though they would quickly discover it if they could look back a generation or two. Indeed, Kunetsova argues, such people who think they are Russians would soon learn that 'in the first third of the 20th century, the majority of the population of present-day Leningrad Oblast did not know Russian and that the native languages for them were Vod, Izhor, Karelian, Vepsy, and Ingermanland-Finnish.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWcVKcTeoxaf19iqvhxE--L4	2025-01-07T16:20:19-08:00	
Trudeau Announces He Plans To Resign – OpEd	By Patrick Carroll In a subdued press conference on Monday morning, Canada’s Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announced that he plans to step down from his role. The date he would actually leave office was not specified, but it would be before the next election, which is set to take place in the coming months. The announcement comes in the midst of dismal polling for Trudeau’s Liberal Party, with recent numbers putting the party’s support at a mere 16 percent, the lowest it’s been in over ten years. While calls for his resignation have been mounting for months now, the pressure ticked up considerably when Chrystia Freeland—Trudeau’s Minister of Finance and Deputy Prime Minister—unexpectedly resigned from the Cabinet back in December. 'It has become obvious to me with the internal battles that I cannot be the one to carry the Liberal standard into the next election,' Trudeau said. '…Removing me from the equation as the leader who will fight the next election for the Liberal Party should also decrease the level of polarization we’re seeing right now in the House and in Canadian politics.' For many, this decision is long overdue. Whether it’s the 'costly political gimmicks' Freeland complained about in her resignation letter, the numerous scandals, or simply the economic slumpCanada finds itself in, almost everyone is ready to begin a new chapter in Canadian politics. Canada vs US real GDP per capita via @globeandmail pic.twitter.com/pO9NWiHPBE— Jon Hartley (@Jon_Hartley_) January 16, 2024 But before we leave the past behind completely, we should take a moment to reflect on Trudeau’s nearly 10 years in office and the lessons we can learn from it. Unfit to Lead From the very beginning, both Trudeau’s competence and his character have been called into question. He sailed into power with a thin CV, but a cool haircut and a well-known surname (his father was Pierre Trudeau, Canadian PM from 1968 to 1979, and again from 1980 to 1984). When asked why he selected a gender-balanced Cabinet in his first term—with 15 of 31 posts held by women—he famously answered, 'Because it’s 2015.' That may have played well with his progressive base, but it was a flimsy case for his personnel choices. Many other cabinet and policy decisions have likewise raised eyebrows regarding his aptitude. Trudeau’s character flaws have been even more apparent. 'Trudeau clearly has narcissistic personality characteristics,' said Jordan Peterson in a recent podcast episode, echoing criticisms he has been making for years. '[He] runs the country, what, as a testament to his own grandeur, it’s something like that…The Trudeau government has skated through at least half a dozen scandals that under normal circumstances would have provoked an honorable government to resign.' Whether it was appearing in blackface at parties, or accepting gifts from a foreign magnate, his judgement seemed poor, to say the least. In addition to the scandals, Trudeau and his wife Sophie separated in August 2023, after 18 years of marriage. This isn’t to say that was entirely his fault, of course, but it does tarnish his 'family man' image in the public eye. Why the Worst Get on Top All of this is reminiscent of F. A. Hayek’s chapter in The Road to Serfdom titled 'Why the Worst Get on Top.' In the chapter, Hayek explains that positions of power in totalitarian regimes tend to attract the worst kinds of people because of the very nature of the system. Others have pointed out that a similar problem exists with non-totalitarian governments as well. As Trudeau’s tenure illustrates, the kind of people who tend to gain power are precisely those who shouldn’t have it. '…[I]t is a well-known fact that those people who most want to rule people are, ipso facto, those least suited to do it,' writes Douglas Adams. '…anyone who is capable of getting themselves made President should on no account be allowed to do the job.' Or as Frank Herbert put it, 'All governments suffer a recurring problem: Power attracts pathological personalities. It is not that power corrupts but that it is magnetic to the corruptible.' The propensity of people like Trudeau to acquire and maintain positions of power underscores the importance of limiting government power in every possible way. And this goes far beyond 'checks and balances.' This means asking serious questions—at a constitutional level—about how much authority the government should have to tax us and interfere with our lives and businesses. Imagine a world where the government had so little power that no one even particularly cared who the Prime Minister was. Maybe, instead of putting our hopes in a new ruler, that would be a better path for Canadians to pursue.

India’s Expanding Footprint In Africa: Naval Diplomacy And Mariti...	India and Africa share a deeply rooted historical connection, forged through their mutual struggles against colonialism and a shared vision for independence. Leaders like Mahatma Gandhi, who began his activism in South Africa, and African luminaries like Julius Nyerere highlighted the importance of solidarity between the two regions. This bond laid the groundwork for India’s long-standing partnership with Africa, spanning political, economic, and cultural dimensions. In the modern era, this relationship has evolved into one of shared aspirations for a multipolar world order. India’s consistent advocacy for African representation on the United Nations Security Council (UNSC) and its successful push to include the African Union in the G-20 during its presidency in 2023 exemplifies this commitment. These achievements highlight India’s role as a champion of the Global South and its desire to elevate Africa’s voice in global governance structures. India’s Naval Strategy and Its Role in Africa The Indian Navy plays a central role in India’s engagement with Africa, acting as a critical tool of the country’s SAGAR (Security and Growth for All in the Region) policy. This policy emphasises India’s commitment to ensuring maritime security, promoting economic growth, and fostering stability across the Indian Ocean Region (IOR). In 2024, the Indian Navy significantly expanded its footprint in Africa. Ships like INS Sunayna, INS Talwar, and INS Gharial conducted extensive deployments, showcasing India’s maritime capabilities and strengthening partnerships with African nations. These engagements included professional exchanges with African navies, joint exercises to improve interoperability, and the transfer of naval technology, such as Fast Interceptor Crafts to Mozambique, to bolster regional security. Moreover, India’s support for regional Maritime Domain Awareness (MDA) has been instrumental in empowering African nations. Through the establishment of radar networks in Mauritius and Seychelles, India has enhanced the capacity of these countries to monitor and secure their maritime zones. The Role of the Indian Navy in Maritime Security Maritime security is a cornerstone of India’s African strategy, with the Indian Navy addressing key challenges such as piracy and armed robbery at sea. The Gulf of Guinea, a notorious hotspot for maritime crime, has been a focal point of these efforts. Indian naval patrols in the region have provided critical security for international shipping lanes and ensured the safety of vital trade routes. In addition to counter-piracy operations, the Indian Navy has conducted joint surveillance missions with African navies, offering expertise in managing large maritime zones. Training programs for African naval officers have further strengthened regional capacity, focusing on areas such as anti-piracy, search and rescue (SAR) operations, and maritime law enforcement. These initiatives demonstrate India’s commitment to serving as a net-security provider in the Indian Ocean and a preferred partner for African nations seeking to safeguard their maritime interests. Humanitarian Assistance and Disaster Relief: India’s Soft Power in Action The Indian Navy’s ability to deliver swift and effective humanitarian assistance has cemented India’s reputation as a reliable partner in Africa. A recent example is the response to Cyclone Hidaya in Kenya in 2024. The devastating floods caused by the cyclone left thousands displaced and in urgent need of aid. INS Sumedha, initially deployed for anti-piracy operations off Somalia, was redirected to deliver food, medical supplies, and other relief materials to affected regions. Such missions highlight the versatility and responsiveness of the Indian Navy. Beyond immediate relief, these efforts build long-term goodwill, positioning India as a humane and dependable partner for African nations in times of crisis. The Geopolitical Context of India’s Engagement with Africa Africa’s growing geopolitical significance makes it a strategic priority for global powers, and India is no exception. The continent’s abundant natural resources, youthful population, and rapidly expanding markets offer immense opportunities for economic and strategic partnerships. India has leveraged these opportunities by increasing its investments in Africa, which averaged $26.39 billion annually between 2018 and 2022, making India one of the continent’s top investors. However, India faces competition from other global powers, particularly China. Through its Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), China has established a dominant presence in Africa, building infrastructure, securing natural resources, and hosting regular high-level summits with African leaders. While India’s approach emphasises sustainability and local empowerment, its limited resources and administrative constraints have often hindered its ability to match China’s scale and speed of engagement. Challenges in Strengthening India-Africa Relations Despite the progress made, several challenges impede the realisation of the full potential of India-Africa relations. One of the most significant issues is the long delay in hosting the India-Africa Forum Summit, last held in 2015. Although logistical challenges like the Ebola outbreak in 2019 and the COVID-19 pandemic contributed to this delay, the absence of this flagship event has created a perception that Africa is not a priority for New Delhi. Additionally, India’s Ministry of External Affairs (MEA), despite receiving consistent budget increases, remains understaffed and overstretched. With its focus divided among South Asia, the Indo-Pacific, and partnerships with Western powers, the MEA often struggles to allocate sufficient resources to Africa. This lack of capacity limits India’s ability to launch new initiatives, deliver on existing commitments, and sustain high-level political engagement with African nations. The Way Forward: Leveraging Naval Diplomacy India’s naval diplomacy offers a unique opportunity to address these challenges and deepen its engagement with Africa. By building on the successes of the SAGAR policy, India can pursue several key strategies: Expanding Naval Cooperation: Increasing the frequency and scope of joint exercises with African navies will enhance interoperability and trust. This could include trilateral and multilateral exercises involving other regional partners. Enhancing Capacity Building: Providing advanced training and technology transfers to African naval forces can strengthen their ability to tackle maritime threats independently. Reinvigorating Political Engagement: Hosting the fourth India-Africa Forum Summit, accompanied by substantive deliverables, would signal a renewed commitment to the partnership. High-level visits by Indian leaders to African countries would further reinforce this message. Additionally, India can leverage its private sector to complement government-led initiatives. Indian companies, particularly in technology, healthcare, and renewable energy, have shown significant interest in Africa, offering a pathway to sustainable development and economic growth. A Brave New World India’s relationship with Africa is a testament to its vision of a multipolar world where partnerships are built on mutual respect and shared aspirations. The Indian Navy, as a cornerstone of this engagement, exemplifies India’s commitment to fostering security, stability, and prosperity across the continent. By addressing capacity constraints, enhancing diplomatic efforts, and leveraging its naval strengths, India can transform its aspirations for Africa into tangible outcomes, ensuring that this partnership becomes a defining feature of its global strategy in the years to come.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWcVKcTeoxaf1_st5oEluJtX	2025-01-07T16:05:35-08:00	
Trump Says Ukraine Peace Talks Could Begin Soon After Taking Offi...	(RFE/RL) -- U.S. President-elect Donald Trump has said again that he is eager to see negotiations with Russia on ending the war in Ukraine begin soon after he returns to the White House but gave no specifics on when they would take place. Trump said he wants to see negotiations soon because 'Russia is losing a lot of young people and so is Ukraine.' Trump, who spoke with reporters at a news conference at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida, didn’t say whether or how soon he would meet with Russian President Vladimir Putin but said such a meeting would not be appropriate until after he is inaugurated on January 20. 'I can't tell you that, but I know Putin would like to meet,' Trump said. At the end of December, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said there were no preconditions for a meeting between the U.S. and Russian presidents. The president-elect said during his election campaign he could end the conflict in Ukraine within 24 hours of taking office. At the news conference Trump said he hoped to end the fighting within six months. 'I hope long before six months,' Trump said, when asked if he could solve the war within half a year. Trump’s return to the White House brings with it uncertainty on what impact it will have on the nearly three-year-old conflict and whether negotiations can take place. But Trump told the news conference he is determined to get it 'straightened out,' adding that it is 'a tough one.' Ukrainian officials are concerned that any hastily arranged negotiations could allow Russia to hold on to Ukrainian territory it has seized and would also give Russian forces time to rest and reorganize. The Ukrainians also want to encourage Trump to continue U.S. military support for their country. Ukrainian Foreign Minister Andriy Sybiha announced on January 7 that a trip to Ukraine by Trump's special envoy for Ukraine and Russia had been canceled and would have to be rescheduled. The envoy, Keith Kellogg, has been tasked with leading negotiations to end the war. Kellogg has said that potential cease-fire talks could begin once Trump takes office and, in a December interview with Fox News, said the war could 'be resolved in the next few months.' The planned meetings between Kellogg and Ukrainian officials are 'extremely important,' Sybiha said during a news conference with his visiting Icelandic counterpart. 'I am confident that this meeting will take place in due course,' he told reporters in Kyiv. 'We are in contact to clearly define the timeline for its organization and to ensure that the meeting is as meaningful as possible.' Ramstein Meeting Trump was not asked about a report that the administration of U.S. President Joe Biden is set to announce a massive final military aid package for Ukraine as part of Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin’s visit to Germany on January 9. Austin is scheduled to meet with representatives of about 50 partner nations in the Ukraine Defense Contact Group at an air base in Ramstein, Germany. The package is expected to be 'substantial,' according to two officials who briefed reporters on Austin’s trip. The officials did not provide an exact dollar amount. Austin's trip will be his final meeting with the contact group, which he organized after Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. Together those nations have provided more than $126 billion in weapons, military training, and assistance since the war started. The U.S. portion of the total is $66 billion. The package to be announced later this week will draw from existing U.S. stockpiles with a goal of getting most of the weapons to Ukraine by the time Trump is sworn in, one of the officials said. Trump also urged NATO members to increase their defense spending to 5 percent of GDP, up from the current 2 percent target, reinforcing his long-held claim that they are not paying enough for U.S. protection.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWcVKcTeoxaf1w1P34nwDl3k	2025-01-07T16:03:36-08:00	
Tibet: Dozens Killed After 7.1-Magnitude Earthquake Strikes	By Tashi Wangchuk, Dolkar, Tenzin Pema, and Taejun Kang At least 126 people were killed and 188 others were injured after a powerful earthquake hit Tibet on Tuesday morning, according to Chinese state media, with the tremors felt in multiple regions in neighboring countries of India, Nepal, Bhutan and Bangladesh. The 7.1-magnitude earthquake struck at 9:05 a.m. local time in Dingri county of Shigatse prefecture in the Tibet Autonomous Region, located close to the border with Nepal, according to the United States Geological Survey. The China Earthquake Networks Center recorded a magnitude 6.8 quake. Multiple aftershocks of magnitudes of more than 4 struck the region, the most powerful of which was 4.4. magnitude. More than 3,000 buildings were destroyed in one county alone, Chinese state media reported. Rescue teams have been deployed, Chinese media reported earlier. Many Tibetans from around Tibet are rallying together to provide aid to the hundreds of affected Tibetans in Dingri, with videos as seen by Radio Free Asia showing individuals leading donation drives for shoes, blankets, food, water and other basic necessities such as tissue rolls, and loading these in trucks for distribution. Sources told RFA that freezing temperatures in the region have exacerbated challenges, after the earthquake destroyed homes and forced people out in the open. Temperatures in January in the region plunge as low as minus-16 degrees Celsius (3 degrees Fahrenheit). Dalai Lama offers prayers Tibetan spiritual leader, the Dalai Lama, who is currently in South India, expressed deep sadness over loss of lives, property and homes in the earthquake. 'I offer my prayers for those who have lost their lives and extend my wishes for a swift recovery to all who have been injured,' he said in an official announcement. In video footage sourced by RFA, significant damage can be seen, with many buildings reduced to rubble. In one video, a Tibetan woman can be heard crying out for trapped family members. Dingri County has a population of about 60,000, according to a 2020 census. Within 5 kilometers (3 miles) of the epicenter are the villages of Tangren, Xuezhu, Garegoji, and Meiduo, while Tsosang and Chulho townships are within 20 kilometers (12 miles) of the impact zone, Chinese state media reported. The earthquake was felt strongly in Cogo, Chulho, and Chamco townships, said a source in India who has family members in Chamco. 'I was able to connect with my family this morning and got to know they were all safe at the time but was not able to connect in the afternoon,' he told RFA. Tremors were also felt in Nepal’s capital Kathmandu some 400 kilometers (250 miles) away, where residents ran from their houses, Reuters news agency reported. 'We felt a very strong earthquake. So far we have not received any report of injuries or physical loss,' said Anoj Raj Ghimire, chief district officer of Solukhumbu district in Nepal, quoted by Reuters. The earthquake also hit Thimphu, the capital of Bhutan, and the northern Indian state of Bihar which borders Nepal, Reuters said. CTA extends condolences Penpa Tsering, president of the Tibetan government-in-exile, expressed his condolences and announced a prayer service to be held on Wednesday at the Thekchen Choeling Tsuglakhang complex in Dharamsala, India. 'The Central Tibetan Administration deeply mourns the devastating 6.8-magnitude earthquake that struck the Dingri region and surrounding areas in Tibet this morning,' he told RFA. 'The CTA, along with Tibetans around the world, extends our heartfelt condolences and prayers to all those affected by this tragedy. …We will continue to monitor the situation inside Tibet.' China’s official Xinhua news agency said the Chinese government dispatched a rescue team of 198 people and 35 ambulances, and that President Xi Jinping ordered authorities to ensure that those affected by the quake were protected from the harsh winter. 'However, the locals were left with no sign of help at the site even about three hours after the earthquake,' said a Tibetan resident in Nepal, who has been in touch with those affected since the earthquake struck in Dingri. An unusually large number of photos and videos about the earthquake have surfaced online, including one in which a Tibetan woman can be heard taking the name of the Dalai Lama, referring to him as 'Gyalwa Rinpoche' in Tibetan. 'May His Holiness bless us,' her prayer can be heard in the WeChat video. Many Tibetans inside and outside Tibet have also taken to social media to express their solidarity. 'Dingri, may you recover soon from the effects of the earthquake and stand tall like a mountain once again,' said a social media user named Phakchen. 'May all brothers and sisters be free from the sufferings caused by the earthquake.' Another user, named Tsowo, expressed solidarity with Tibetans affected by the disaster with a post of a traditional Tibetan butter lamp, a symbol of driving away darker times. Frequent earthquakes Southwestern parts of China and Nepal have been hit frequently by earthquakes. A huge earthquake in China’s Sichuan province in 2008 killed almost 70,000 people, while in 2015, a magnitude 7.8 quake, Nepal’s worst, hit near Kathmandu, killing about 9,000 people and injuring thousands. A 7.1 magnitude earthquake can cause extensive structural damage, severe ground shaking, landslides and fatalities, particularly in densely populated or poorly constructed areas, with risks of power outages, gas leaks, and tsunamis if near the coast. There have been 29 earthquakes with magnitudes of 3 or higher within 200 kilometers (124 miles) of the epicenter of Tingri in the past five years, according to China’s state-run broadcaster CCTV. According to the U.S. Geological Survey, an earthquake of a magnitude 6 or higher has struck only 10 times in the last 100 years within 250 kilometers (155 miles) of the epicenter in Dingri county.

Robert Reich: Advice And Consent Or Total Submission? – OpEd	The cast of characters Trump has chosen to populate his second term are a Star Wars cantina of fanatics, extremists, conspiracy theorists, sexual harassers, and disreputable no-goods. They have little or no experience running government, let alone expertise in the issues confronting the agencies and departments Trump wants them to lead. Over the next two weeks, the Senate will hold confirmation hearings on them. As soon as they’re completed and Trump takes the oath of office on January 20, the Senate will vote on them. Most if not all Senate Democrats will vote against them, so Trump can afford to lose the votes of only three Senate Republicans. The question, therefore, is whether at least four Senate Republicans have enough integrity to refuse to confirm the worst of them. The worst of the worst are: Pete Hegseth, Trump’s pick for secretary of defense. Hegseth has a reputation for sexual harassment, including an allegation of assault in 2017. (His own mother accused him in writing of repeatedly abusing women but subsequently disavowed the statement.) According to a recent report, Hegseth was ousted from leadership roles in two military veterans organizations following allegations of financial mismanagement, aggressive drunkenness, and sexist behavior. Nonetheless, Hegseth has appeared to win over key Senate Republicans. Iowa Senator Joni Ernst, an Armed Services Committee member and the Senate’s first female combat veteran, has been deeply concerned about sexual harassment and assault in the military (where she says she was assaulted). But Trump Republicans have threatened to run a primary challenger against her if she doesn’t support Hegseth —which seems to have changed her attitude toward him. Of all Trump’s nominations, Hegseth is probably closest to Trump in character and temperament, which should be damning enough to stop his confirmation. He’s scheduled to appear before the Senate Armed Services Committee for his confirmation hearing on January 14. Stay tuned. Kash Patel, Trump’s pick to direct the FBI. He has called for firing the top ranks of the FBI, prosecuting leakers and journalists, and replacing the national security workforce with 'people who won’t undermine the president’s agenda.' Patel has even created a list of whom he dubs 'government gangsters' — headlined by outgoing FBI Director Christopher Wray and Attorney General Merrick Garland — who he says 'must be held accountable and exposed in 2024.' He has pledged to investigate Trump’s political opponents and 'come after the people in the media who lied about American citizens who helped Joe Biden rig the presidential election.' Of all Trump’s picks, Patel may be the most dangerous. Tulsi Gabbard, Trump’s pick for director of national intelligence. She has publicly called for the U.S. to allow Syrian President Bashar Al-Assad to remain in power and traveled to Syria to meet with him. She even challenged U.S. intelligence that found Assad’s forces had used chemical weapons. Gabbard is close to Russian President Vladimir Putin and a favorite on Russian propaganda. In 2022, she used her platform to amplify a Russian talking point that the U.S. had somehow provoked Putin to invade Ukraine. Why in the world would Trump want her to head national intelligence — unless, of course, Trump himself is compromised? Robert F. Kennedy Jr., Trump’s pick for heading the Department of Health and Human Resources. Kennedy Jr. is a well-known anti-vaxxer who has made the baseless claims that COVID-19 was 'targeted to attack Caucasians and Black people' and that 'the people who are most immune are Ashkenazi Jews and Chinese.' Kennedy Jr. keeps repeating the long-debunked claim that vaccines cause autism in kids, along with his insistence that the COVID vaccine has killed more people than it’s saved, which is another lie. He’s a wacko. Nonetheless, his critiques of corporate influence over food and drugs might possibly gain the votes of two Democrats: Bernie Sanders and John Fetterman. ** The Constitution (Article II, Section 2, Clause 2), gives the Senate the power of 'advice and consent' over a president’s key appointments. Advice and consent requires careful screening, not outright submission to the will of an incoming president. If you live in a state with Republican senators (or in Sanders’s Vermont or Fetterman’s Pennsylvania), you might remind them that they have a constitutional duty to not allow the U.S. government to fall into the hands of unqualified and potentially dangerous people like the four mentioned above.

Understanding The Vatican’s Novel Leadership Structure Of A Pro-P...	By Andrea Gagliarducci In a move that raised eyebrows among Vatican observers, Pope Francis on Monday created an unprecedented leadership structure at the Dicastery for Institutes of Consecrated Life and Societies of Apostolic Life by appointing both a nun as prefect and a cardinal as pro-prefect — a solution that begs clarity in law and theology. The unusual decision to appoint Sister Simona Brambilla as prefect and Cardinal Ángel Fernández Artime as pro-prefect has sparked discussion about the intersection of traditional Church hierarchy and Pope Francis’ vision for reform. Understanding the pro-prefect role The office of pro-prefect of the Dicastery for Institutes of Consecrated Life and Societies of Apostolic Life is not provided for in the constitution Praedicate Evangelium, which regulates the functions of the Roman Curia. However, Pope Francis instituted the office ad hoc when he appointed the cardinal as pro-prefect and the nun — the secretary until now — as prefect of the dicastery. It has not been stated how there will be a balance of power between the new prefect and the pro-prefect. However, speaking of a relationship of subordination with a cardinal who would be the 'second in rank' to the prefect does not seem to be a correct reading. What is the logic that pushed Pope Francis to make this choice? Power and authority in the Church Throughout history, there has been a broad, complex, and sometimes controversial reflection on the relationship between the power of orders, which is received with ordination and which enables one to administer certain sacraments — such as presiding over the Eucharist — and the power of governance, which gives authority over a part of the people of God, such as a diocese, a religious order, or even a parish. For a long time, it was believed that the two powers were distinct and that it was possible to exercise them separately — St. Thomas Aquinas shared this position, too. As regards the Roman Curia, it was believed that all those who carried out their service in it received their power directly from the pope, who conferred authority on them regardless of whether or not they were ordained. This also applied to cardinals, whose authority derived from papal creation — ​​which is not a sacrament. The pope chooses the cardinals as collaborators and advisers of the pope in the government of the Church. This approach has characterized the history of the Church for a long time, so much so that there have been cardinals who were not priests — for example, Cardinal Giacomo Antonelli, Vatican secretary of state from 1848 to 1876, was ordained deacon but was not a priest. Further back in time, there were cardinals appointed at a young age who only received orders after a long time, and even popes who were only deacons at the time of their election to the papal throne. In the past, some abbots had not even been ordained priests and governed an ecclesiastical district, or there were figures who seem strange to us but who responded to this logic, such as the so-called bishops-elect, who governed dioceses without receiving episcopal consecration but did so because of their election. Other examples include the so-called mitered abbesses, 'women with the pastoral staff,' who exercised their authority over a territory and the faithful. Vatican II’s impact on Church governance Over time, however, another approach has emerged that goes back to the Church of the first millennium: The power of government is closely linked to the sacrament of holy orders, so it is not possible to exercise one without the other except within certain limits, which are rather narrow. Hence, Pope John XXIII in 1962 decided that all cardinals should be ordained archbishops with the motu proprio Cum Gravissima. This is the approach of the Second Vatican Council, which is found, for example, in Lumen Gentium, No. 21, in the Explanatory Note at No. 2, and in the two Codes of Canon Law, the Latin and the Eastern one. Vatican II authoritatively reiterated that the episcopate is a sacrament and that by episcopal consecration, one becomes part of the College of Bishops, which, together with and under the authority of the pope, is the subject of supreme power over the entire Church. This approach was followed in the two Curia reforms that followed the Second Vatican Council: Pope Paul VI’s constitution Regimini Ecclesiae Universae (1967) and Pope John Paul II’s Pastor Bonus (1988). John Paul II delineated the Curia into congregations and pontifical councils, which in lay terms might be defined as 'ministries with portfolio' and 'ministries without portfolio.' The congregations had to be governed by cardinals because they participated in the decisions of the universal Church with the pope and, therefore, their heads had to have the rank of first advisers to the pope. The pontifical councils, on the other hand, could also be led by archbishops, but in any case, by ordained ministers because they still had to be in collegiality with the bishop of Rome — that is, the pope. Francis’ Curia reform: breaking new ground The apostolic constitution Praedicate Evangelium, with which Pope Francis reformed the Curia in 2022, departed from this approach. There was no longer a distinction between congregations and pontifical councils, which were all defined as dicasteries. Therefore, there was no longer a difference in who could be the head of the dicastery, a position that could also go to a layperson. However, when presenting the reform of the Curia on March 21, 2022, the then-Father Gianfranco Ghirlanda — created cardinal by Pope Francis in the consistory of Aug. 27, 2022 — explained that there were still some dicasteries in which it was appropriate for a cardinal to lead and noted that the 'constitution does not abrogate the Code of Canon Law, which establishes that in matters that concern clerics, clerics are the ones to judge.' In practice, the canonical mission was no longer given by order but by the pope’s decision. This is why a layman like Paolo Ruffini could be at the head of the Vatican Dicastery for Communication. This is the heart of the debate: Are there offices that can be exercised only by papal appointment, or are there offices that, despite papal appointment, can be exercised only if one is ordained? The question arises when a pro-prefect supports Sister Brambilla. The Dicastery for Institutes of Consecrated Life and Societies of Apostolic Life has various competencies, but all competencies are generic acts of government that can be exercised without priestly ordination. There are situations of clerics’ judgment, though, and likely it was thought that these decisions cannot be managed without an ordination. Thus, the figure of the pro-prefect was created. The definition of pro-prefect seems, however, to be used improperly. The document Praedicate Evangelium describes two pro-prefects who are the heads of the two sections of the Dicastery for Evangelization. That is because these two pro-prefects lead the sections of the dicastery 'in place of' (i.e., pro-) pope, who is considered the prefect of the dicastery. In other cases, a prelate who did not yet have the rank to hold the office formally was appointed pro-prefect. For example, when Angelo Sodano was appointed Vatican secretary of state on Dec. 1, 1990, he was still an archbishop. He was thus appointed pro-secretary of state because the Apostolic Constitution Pastor Bonus provided that the secretary of state was always to be a cardinal. Sodano retained the title of pro-secretary of state until the consistory of June 28, 1991, when he was created cardinal and formally took the title of secretary of state starting July 1, 1991. Pro-prefect Artime, however, is already a cardinal and does not exercise jurisdiction in place of the pope. If anything, he works alongside the prefect, Sister Brambilla. His role is more co-prefect, and it remains to be seen whether the pope will appoint a secretary for the dicastery to understand the organizational chart. A Jesuit model for Church governance? The choice to place an ecclesiastic alongside the prefect reflects some religious orders, which have 'brothers' (consecrated laypeople) at their helm but are appointed alongside figures with sacramental authority. Therefore, Pope Francis would have chosen to follow a path already followed by religious congregations for the governance of the Church. This is not new. Pope Francis, for example, also intervened in the governance crisis of the Order of Malta precisely by operating on the order as if it were only a religious and monastic entity, authoritatively imposing the new constitutions in September 2022 and establishing that the Holy Father needs to confirm the election of the grand master of the order. Even the Council of Cardinals, established by Pope Francis at the beginning of his pontificate in 2013, resembles the general council that supports the government of the Jesuit General. Many of these settings are given by Pope Francis’ main legal adviser, Cardinal Ghirlanda, also a Jesuit, who personally followed the reformof the Order of Malta and the reform of the Curia — as well as various other reforms, such as that of the statutes of the Legionaries of Christ. Looking ahead: implications and questions Pope Francis established an innovation in the Roman Curia without outlining it with a precise law, leaving the management of the competencies to subsequent decisions, not using the criteria of the government of the Curia but rather those of the religious congregations. It seems 'inside baseball.' However, it speaks of a small revolution — or potentially a misuse of terms that could cause some confusion in the future.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWcVKcTeoxaf169UjjLtOOEa	2025-01-07T15:49:00-08:00	
Future Of Jobs Report 2025: 78 Million New Job Opportunities By 2...	The Future of Jobs Report 2025, published by the World Economic Forum, reveals that job disruption will equate to 22% of jobs by 2030, with 170 million new roles set to be created and 92 million displaced, resulting in a net increase of 78 million jobs. Technological advancements, demographic shifts, geoeconomic tensions and economic pressures are the key drivers of these changes, reshaping industries and professions worldwide. Drawing on data from over 1,000 companies, the report finds that the skills gap continues to be the most significant barrier to business transformation today, with nearly 40% of skills required on the job set to change and 63% of employers already citing it as the key barrier they face. Technology skills in AI, big data and cybersecurity are expected to see rapid growth in demand, but human skills, such as creative thinking, resilience, flexibility and agility, will remain critical. A combination of both skill types will be increasingly crucial in a fast-shifting job market. Frontline roles and essential sectors like care and education are set for the highest job growth by 2030, while advances in AI and renewable energy are reshaping the market – driving an increase in demand for many technology or specialist roles while driving a decline for others, such as graphic designers. 'Trends such as generative AI and rapid technological shifts are upending industries and labour markets, creating both unprecedented opportunities and profound risks,' said Till Leopold, Head of Work, Wages and Job Creation at the World Economic Forum. 'The time is now for businesses and governments to work together, invest in skills and build an equitable and resilient global workforce.' The Job Market in 2030 Frontline roles, including farmworkers, delivery drivers and construction workers, are poised to see the largest job growth in absolute terms by 2030. Significant increases are also projected for care jobs, such as nursing professionals, and education roles, such as secondary school teachers, with demographic trends driving growth in demand across essential sectors. Meanwhile, advances in AI, robotics and energy systems – notably in renewable energy and environmental engineering – are expected to increase demand for specialist roles in these fields. Meanwhile, roles such as cashiers and administrative assistants remain among the fastest declining but are now joined by roles including graphic designers as generative AI rapidly reshapes the labour market. The Skills Gap The skills gap continues to be the most significant obstacle to business transformation in response to global macrotrends, cited by 63% of employers as a main barrier to future-proofing their operations. If the global workforce were represented by a group of 100 people, 59 are projected to require reskilling or upskilling by 2030 – 11 of whom are unlikely to receive it; this translates to over 120 million workers at medium-term risk of redundancy. While technology skills in AI, big data and networks and cybersecurity are expected to see the fastest growth in demand, human skills such as analytical thinking, cognitive skills, resilience, leadership and collaboration will remain critical core skills. A combination of both skillsets will increasingly be required by many growing jobs. AI and Upskilling AI is reshaping business models, with half of employers globally planning to reorient their business to target new opportunities resulting from the technology. The most common workforce response to these changes is expected to be upskilling workers, with 77% of employers planning to do so. However, 41% plan to reduce their workforce as AI automates certain tasks. Almost half of employers expect to transition staff from roles exposed to AI disruption into other parts of their business, an opportunity to alleviate skills shortages while reducing the human cost of technological transformation. Given the rapid growth of emerging technologies, business leaders, policy-makers and workers will need to work together to ensure workforces are ready while reducing risks of unemployment across sectors and geographies. Beyond technology: Economic, demographic and geoeconomic shifts The rising cost of living is another key factor driving labour market change, with half of employers expecting it to transform business models. While global inflation has eased, price pressures and slower economic growth are projected to displace 6 million jobs globally by 2030. These challenges are increasing demand for resilience, agility, flexibility and creative thinking skills. Demographic shifts are reshaping labour markets, with ageing populations predominantly in higher-income countries driving demand for healthcare roles and expanding working-age populations in lower-income regions fuelling growth in education professions. Workforce strategies focused on improving talent management, teaching and mentoring skills are essential to bridging these gaps. Geopolitical tensions are a top concern for 34% of businesses, while trade restrictions and industrial policy shifts transform many more, with some companies planning to adapt through offshoring and reshoring strategies. These pressures are also increasing demand for skills such as cybersecurity. A need for urgent action Addressing the sweeping changes outlined in the report requires urgent and collective action across government, business and education. Key priority areas include bridging skills gaps, investing in reskilling and upskilling initiatives and creating accessible pathways into fast-growing jobs and skills that are seeing fast growth in demand.

The Festivus Airing Of 2024’s Federal Spending Grievances – OpEd	If you were a fan of the Seinfeld television show in the 1990s or the reruns that still air and stream today, you know that Festivus is an alternative holiday celebrated by George Costanza’s father with some unique traditions. Perhaps the most notable tradition is the 'airing of grievances' during the Festivus meal, in which each person tells the others all the ways they disappointed them during the past year. (Below is the clip featuring Jerry Stiller’s immortal performance introducing the practice) One of the joys of covering the federal spending beat comes during the year-end holidays when Senator Rand Paul embodies the spirit of Festivus and catalogs examples of wasteful spending so you can hear about them in his annual Festivus report. It’s a lot of fun to read, and the 2024 report captures over $1 trillion worth of taxpayer dollars that U.S. government bureaucrats badly spent. Here are my favorite three wasteful spending examples from this year’s report: A Florida man named Patrick Parker Walsh scammed $8 million in COVID-19 Relief funds from the Paycheck Protection Program and Economic Injury Disaster Loans. While that alone makes him one of many thousands of fraudsters who exploited these programs in a huge failure of government oversight, what makes him special is he used the money to buy himself an island. That’s almost supervillain stuff! The IRS blew $15 million when it tried to get into the business of preparing and filing tax returns for Americans without congressional approval, duplicating a service that already exists in the private sector and is even free of charge for many to use. This one stands out to me because of personal experience. The IRS tried to do my taxes in 2022, bungled the job by hallucinating income I never earned, and then demanded I pay tens of thousands of extra income taxes for the make-believe money they claimed I made. It took months to get them to realize their mistake and drop their claim. What I learned from the experience is that they are simply not up to the job of preparing and filing anybody’s tax returns. You can always tell when supposedly creative people have run out of any good ideas. They will take the titles of their intellectual property and add words like 'on ice' to the end. Because doing whatever it is they’ve been doing, but now on ice skates, offers that one chance for a last cash grab. The only thing that’s worse is when the government subsidizes the cash grab, as happened with the Bearded Ladies Cabaret’s performance of Beards on Ice. The National Endowment for the Arts gave up $10,000 to the Bearded Ladies Cabaret because they pledged to call attention to climate change through the ice-skating performance of cabaret’s drag queens. There are dozens of more examples in the 2024 Festivus Report. What other examples of wasteful government spending do you suppose it’s time to hear more about?

Jean-Marie Le Pen, Former Leader Of French Far-Right, Dead At 96	By Laurent Geslin and Nicholas Wallace (EurActiv) -- Jean-Marie Le Pen, the far-right French politician who founded the Front National and led it for almost four decades, died on Tuesday at the age of 96. Le Pen was succeeded as leader of the nationalist party in 2011 by his daughter, Marine. Four years later she expelled him for being too extreme, and rebranded the party as the Rassemblement National. In 1999, a German court convicted him of minimising the Holocaust, having in 1987 dismissed the use of gas chambers as 'a detail' in the history of World War Two. He was later convicted in France of incitement to hatred, discrimination and violence for comments he made about Muslims. The far-right leader was also accused of torture during his time as a French army officer in the Algerian war of 1954-1962. Le Pen's obstinance earned him the nickname of 'The Menhir' in France, a reference to ancient standing stones built by Celtic cultures – including in the French region of Brittany, where he was from. AFP first reported Le Pen had died on Tuesday, citing a statement from his family. 'A kind of UFO' in Brussels Before facing Jacques Chirac in the second round of the 2002 presidential election, Le Pen built the foundations of his political career in the European Parliament. In 1984's European elections, the Front National achieved 11% of the vote, enabling the party to send ten MEPs to Strasbourg for the first time. Le Pen would remain an MEP for almost 35 years, with some interruptions, until 2019. Still marginalised in France in the 1980s, the far-right party – founded in 1972 by former Waffen-SS members, neo-Nazi sympathisers, and nostalgic supporters of French Algeria –took advantage of the powerful platform provided by the European institutions its broaden its electoral base. From the parliamentary rostrum, Le Pen frequently launched attacks and insults. Accused of antisemitism by a German socialist in September 1988, the National Front leader retorted that his accsuser 'is a pro-Arab paedophile with sadistic tendencies.' 'For European parliamentarians, Jean-Marie Le Pen was long seen as a kind of UFO, a nationalist from the early 20th century who occasionally shouted in the corridors,' remarked sociologist Erwann Lecoeur, a specialist in the far right. 'He was rarely present in Strasbourg, never worked on any projects, didn’t understand English, and refused to speak it. He merely used European institutions to keep his party alive.' Unable to make electoral gains in France due to the majority voting system, the Front National's successes on the European stage in the 1980s enabled to establish a cadre of professional politicians and secure financial resources. In his early years in Strasbourg, Le Pen was far from a critic of what was then called the European Economic Community (EEC). He supported a 'Europe of nations' and the defence of 'European civilisation' against the Soviet threat. As Libération points out, Le Pen even advocated in his first presidential manifesto in 1974, for the 'Europeanisation of armed forces,' writing that 'the Soviet threat makes isolated French defence unrealistic and an unconvincing disparate coalition.' The ideological shift of the far-right leader occurred with France's referendum on the Maastricht Treaty, which established the European Union and the political integration of its member states. On the evening of the results in 1992, he declared that the 'proponents of the foreign party' had won. From then on, he consistently criticised the 'European contraption,' attacking Brussels’ bureaucracy for allegedly seeking to 'destroy the nations' of the continent. Le Pen’s time in the European Parliament was also marked by numerous financial scandals. Indicted in the parliamentary assistants’ case alongside his daughter Marine – whose verdict is expected on 31 March – he was also accused by the European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF) of misusing €300,000 in parliamentary funds between 2009 and 2018. 'An historic figure of the far right, he... played a role in our country’s public life for nearly seventy years, a role that now falls under the judgment of history,' stated the Élysée in a communiqué, noting that President Macron extended 'his condolences to his family and loved ones.' Le Pen is survived by his three daughters, Marine, Marie-Caroline and Yann, and his second wife Jany.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWcVKcTeoxaf10XW-_SfuINs	2025-01-07T15:45:02-08:00	
What To Know About HMPV, The Virus Causing An Outbreak In China	China has reported a rise in human metapneumovirus (HMPV) cases in its northern region in recent weeks, raising concerns on social media that there could be another outbreak like COVID-19. Beijing has acknowledged the rise in HMPV cases and attributed it to the winter season, but the spike should not raise fears or worries about a bigger, more fatal, global health threat, according to international health experts. 'China’s reported levels of respiratory infections are within the usual range for the winter season,' Dr. Margaret Harris, spokeswoman for the World Health Organization (WHO), said on Tuesday. 'It is not a new virus.' Other health experts agree. 'There’s no need to be panicky. But for those folks who are in higher-risk groups, this is a time to be careful, [to] be cautious,' William Schaffner, an infectious disease physician and a professor at Vanderbilt University Medical Center, told the Scientific American on Monday. What is HMPV? A common respiratory virus, HMPV is known to spike every winter and spring, health officials said. The virus has circulated among humans for at least six decades, experts added. Common symptoms include fever, cough, and nasal congestion. In severe cases, symptoms may result in bronchitis and pneumonia. HMPV usually spreads among people through coughing, sneezing, shaking hands, or touching virus-laden objects. After being exposed from the virus, a person usually falls ill within three to six days. Young children, adults who are over 65 and those that have weakened immune systems are considered to have a higher risk for serious illness. Currently, there are no vaccines to treat HMPV. Doctors usually recommend fever or pain relievers for those sick with the virus. Preventive steps include following basic hygiene measures such as washing hands with soap and water, according to the U.S.-based Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). The CDC also advised the public against touching their eyes, nose, or mouth with unwashed hands. As of Tuesday, here were how various governments across Asia have responded to the HMPV situation. MALAYSIA Malaysian health officials said HMPV cases were not new and that they were monitoring the developments. Last year, the country recorded 327 HMPV cases compared with 225 the previous year. 'The increase in acute respiratory tract infections at the end and beginning of the year is a phenomenon that is fully expected, in line with the rise in respiratory infections that have also been reported in other countries, especially those with cold seasons such as China,' the health ministry said on Saturday. INDONESIA Indonesia has HMPV cases, all involving children, according to the health ministry on Monday, without specifying a figure. 'HMPV has been in Indonesia for a long time,' health minister Budi Gunadi Sadikin said in a statement on Monday. Although the HMPV is not a deadly virus, he advised the public to maintain a healthy lifestyle and seek medical help if needed. THAILAND Thailand has no HMPV cases present, health minister Somsak Thepsuthin said on Tuesday. But he said the ministry is ready to identify and respond to any cases should the virus be detected in the country. He urged the public to take preventive measures. PHILIPPINES Manila health officials said they were also monitoring the situation. 'Reliable sources currently do not support circulating posts on social media about an alleged international health concern. There is no confirmation from either the cited country or the [WHO],' the health department said on Jan. 3. BANGLADESH Bangladesh has not yet recorded any HMPV cases at present, news outlets quoted local health officials as saying. But the virus has always been present in the country, public health expert Mushtuq Husain told news portal bdnews24.com.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWcVKcTeoxaf18oUOrk3WyH_	2025-01-07T15:41:34-08:00	
Take Your Money And Shove It: The Second Long Telegram, US Aid, A...	It was as if the West’s central philosophical commitment to limited government was extirpated by a crude economic determinism that insisted on no government in Russia.' -- Peter J. Stavrakis, Kennan Institute Occasional Papers, 1993 Diplomatic advisors and analysts are a funny breed. They can be lauded as sages, called upon to clarify the complex and offer the odd lapidary statement. Such advice is often ignored and, if implemented, done selectively. The politicians back home are bound to foul things up. The National Security Archive of George Washington University, as it so often does, performed a fabulous service for historians of diplomatic history prior to Christmas by publishing an insightful cable on US-Russian relations. The 70-paragraph telegram from the US Embassy in Moscow, which has assumed the status of legend, came from analyst E. Wayne Merry in March 1994. Critical of Washington’s obsession with shock economic reform for a post-Communist Russia, the cable is now publicly available because of the Archive’s successful lawsuit under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA). When authored, its content was deemed so hot it had to be sent via the Dissent Channel, limiting circulation within government circles. One historical parallel regarding Merry’s cable stands out, up to a point. As the Briefing Book put together by Svetlana Savranskaya and Tom Blanton suggests, George F. Kennan’s Long Telegram authored in April 1946 is an obvious contender. Then the chief of mission to the Secretary of State in Moscow, Kennan’s assessment ('without yielding to what I feel would be dangerous degree of oversimplification') came to shape Cold War policy. From his suggestions spawned a costly, expansive global machinery based as much on astrological whim as on ideological delusion. While some of this can be laid at the feet, and mind of Kennan, it would be churlish to avoid the more tempered assessments he offered to superiors who simply picked what was expedient and useful at the time. In terms of 'practical deductions' for US policy, Kennan underlined the perceived threat: Washington faced 'a political force committed fanatically to the belief that with the US there can be no permanent modus vivendi'. Soviet power, to be secure, would disrupt, destroy 'our traditional way of life' and break 'the international authority of our state'. To combat this, Kennan offered a menu list. Soviet power would, for instance, retreat when faced with 'the logic of force'. The Soviets remained, vis-à-vis the West, 'by far the weaker force.' The durability of the Soviet system had yet to prove itself. Soviet propaganda would be 'relatively easy to combat' by means of 'any intelligent and really constructive program.' In full swing as lecturing sage, Kennan urged understanding with 'courage, detachment, objectivity' of what the US was facing; educate the public about Russia while placing US dealings 'entirely on realistic and matter-of-fact basis'; ensure societal health and vigour on the home front, seeing as communism fed, 'like a malignant parasite […] on diseased tissue'; guide other nations rather than impose responsibilities; and avoid allowing 'ourselves to become like those whom we are coping.' The end of the Soviet Union, which did show parts of the Kennan assessment to have been accurate, presented an opportunity for addressing the new post-Cold War realities. The Soviet Union had ceased to exist as a political entity, with communism in harried retreat. Merry’s long telegram of March 28, 1994 echoes Kennan’s guiding tone, though it has a rather gamey taste and would never receive the tutored readership it deserved. The title is instructive: 'Whose Russia is it Anyway? Toward a Policy of Benign Respect.' It enabled Merry to furnish own warnings about US policy till that point, which had failed to consider the effects economic shock therapy was having, fed and encouraged by the swarm of US aid specialists indifferent to necessary, accompanying political reforms. Terms such as 'democracy' and 'the market', treated as synonymous, if not 'mutually dependent' terms in American rhetoric, resisted replication in the Russian context. 'Russians (and most non-Americans) are simply baffled by this vision of a societal double helix of political and economic decisions leading to a higher moral and material state of being.' It was a central contention of Merry that what was contributing to an increasingly cooling relationship between Moscow and Washington at that point was the role of foreign aid and an increasing suspicion in the country of the radical 'marketeers'. Russia had been turned into a gargantuan charity case, flooded by ignorant charity workers – of the highly specialised sort – described by local officials as 'assistance tourists'. This also meant an utter neglect in terms of reforming the civil institutions necessary for stability, including training a new civil service to supplant the command economy bureaucrats. Unlike the post-Second World War Marshall Plan that directed aid into clearly stipulated channels to stimulate growth in a devastated Western Europe, these 'assistance tourists' rarely thought of asking 'their hosts for an appraisal of Russian needs'. US assistance, he warned, had become 'a net detriment to the bilateral relationship'. Three reasons were offered: the overselling of assistance comprised primarily of 'financial intangibles and technical assistance'; the failure of much of the assistance to ever leave US shores or enter Russian hands; and the 'friction' caused by the intrusiveness of the programs and 'linking assistance with Russian actions in other spheres.' On a tart note, Merry suggests that the point had been reached 'where it is arguable that the best service our aid program could now serve could be to permit [Russian President] Boris Yeltsin publicly to tell America to take its money and shove it.' US policy towards an ailing, then moribund, and eventually extinct Soviet Union, is not a glorious tale. Promises, to be frequently broken, were made to placate and sooth the Russian psyche that eastward expansion on the spear of NATO, incorporating former Warsaw Pact states, would not take place. Russia, as vulnerable economic patient, was assured that capitalist fed prosperity was just around the corner, even as communism’s hammer and sickle, with its proletarian promise, repaired to the historical museum. While historical forces, local conditions and cultural idiosyncrasies will always guide the development of any state and community, there is something to be said that post-Cold War Russia might have taken something of a different path had Merry’s sharp words found their mark. But a hubristic atmosphere had infected Washington, heated by such neoliberal dogmatists as Larry Summers, Undersecretary of the Treasury for International Affairs between 1993 and 1995. Officials in his department went so far as to shield him from Merry’s observations, claiming they would give him 'a heart attack.' Far better to let the Russian economy suffer a cardiac arrest instead and wait for the consequences we see today.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWff6d27ytMDttIDDLdLiH_m	2025-01-07T09:20:50-08:00	
Plenitude Doubles Installed Capacity In Spain Thanks To Organic G...	Plenitude has expanded its installed capacity from renewable sources in Spain by 400 MW, reaching nearly 950 MW of photovoltaic and wind power projects, more than double compared with 2023. In particular, Plenitude has recently completed the installation of 150 MW of the Caparacena project in Granada, consisting of three photovoltaic plants nearly accounting for 50 MW capacity each. The electricity connection to the national transmission grid is ensured by a 400 kV substation, the construction of which has just been completed, and another 200 kV substation and line shared with other operators. Moreover, Plenitude also completed the construction of other plants totalling nearly 250 MW in the solar parks of Renopool, in Extremadura, and Guillena, in Andalusia. Thanks also to these operations, the company has reached its target of 4GW of installed capacity globally in 2024. 'During 2024 Plenitude has registered significant organic growth in Spain with the completion of several renewable projects realized also thanks to the good relationships we have developed locally. Spain is a strategic country for our company and we want to have a positive impact in the areas where we operate, not only economically, but also on the communities that host us' said Mariangiola Mollicone, Head of Western Europe Renewables and Managing Director of Plenitude in Spain. In addition, Plenitude in Spain has a pipeline of further nearly 820MW of plants already under construction. It is expected that this portfolio of projects will be completed between 2025 and 2026, in line with the company's long-term strategy in the renewable business and in the country. Plenitude, a company controlled by Eni, is present in more than 15 countries around the world with a business model that integrates the production of electricity from 4 GW of renewable capacity, the sale of energy and energy solutions to 10 million European customers, and an extensive network of nearly 22,000 charging points for electric vehicles. By 2027, the company has the objective to reach 8 GW of installed renewable capacity globally.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWff6d27ytMDtpBoB-mSaVzK	2025-01-07T09:19:11-08:00	
Global Cooperation At A Crossroads: Possibility Amid Rising Geopo...	The World Economic Forum's Global Cooperation Barometer offers a critical assessment of the state of global cooperation, showing a world grappling with heightened competition and conflict, while also identifying various areas where leaders can drive progress through innovative collaboration. Released amid geopolitical, technological and sociopolitical upheaval, the Forum's flagship annual report underscores the urgency of addressing shared challenges and offers leaders guidance on what cooperation can look like in a shifting world. The Global Cooperation Barometer 2025, developed in collaboration with McKinsey & Company, uses 41 indicators to measure the current state of global cooperation. The aim is to offer leaders a tool to better understand the contours of cooperation broadly and along five pillars: trade and capital flows, innovation and technology, climate and natural capital, health and wellness, and peace and security. Now in its second edition, the Barometer draws on new data to provide an updated picture of the global cooperation landscape, with a particular focus on the impact of the new technological age. 'The Barometer is being released at a moment of great global instability and at a time when many new governments are developing agendas for the year, and their terms, ahead,' said Børge Brende, President and CEO of the World Economic Forum. 'What the Barometer shows is that cooperation is not only essential to address crucial economic, environmental and technological challenges, it is possible within today's more turbulent context.' 'This second edition of the Global Cooperation Barometer focuses on where cooperation stands today and what it can look like in the new technological age,' said Bob Sternfels, Global Managing Partner, McKinsey & Company. 'Advancing global innovation, health, prosperity and resilience cannot be done alone. Leaders will need new mechanisms for working together on key priorities, even as they disagree on others, and the past several years have shown this balance is possible.' The latest edition of the Barometer highlights that global cooperation is at a critical juncture. The report's analysis reveals that after trending positively for a decade and surpassing pre-pandemic levels, overall cooperation has stagnated. This has been driven by a sharp decline of the peace and security pillar of the Barometer over the past seven years, caused by mounting geopolitical tensions and competition which have significantly eroded global collective security. Levels of conflict and attendant humanitarian crises have increased in the past year to record levels, driven by crises including, but not limited to, the Middle East, Ukraine and Sudan. As the largely stable cooperative order that defined the post-Cold War period is giving way to a more fragmented landscape, solutions to pressing challenges – from climate action to technological governance – require collaboration. And despite the global security crises, the new findings indicate that collaboration has continued in various areas including vaccine distribution, scientific research, renewable energy development, and more – offering models for future cooperation. Notably, peace and security have declined sharply in recent years, but other pillars of the Barometer have remained resilient and reveal emerging opportunities for international cooperation: Innovation and technology: While geopolitical competition is rising in regard to certain frontier technologies such as semiconductors, overall global cooperation on technology and innovation advanced in 2023, in part due to digitization of the global economy. This helped drive the adoption of new technologies, a strong ramp-up in the supply of critical minerals – and a related drop in price of lithium batteries – and a rebound in student mobility. However, rapid disruption from emerging technologies such as AI is reshaping the global landscape, raising the possibility of a new frontline of geostrategic competition or even an 'AI arms race'. Cooperative leadership and inclusive strategies will be key to harness its vast potential while tackling risks. Climate and natural capital: Cooperation on climate goals improved over the past year, with increased finance flows and higher trade in low-carbon technologies such as solar, wind and electric vehicles. Yet, urgent action is required to meet net-zero targets as global emissions continue to rise. Greater global cooperation will be essential to scale up technologies and secure the financing needed to meet climate goals by 2030. Health and wellness: Some health outcomes, including life expectancy, continued to improve post-pandemic, but overall progress is slowing compared to pre-2020. While cross-border assistance and pharmaceutical R&D have declined, and cooperation on trade in health goods and international regulations stalled, various health metrics including child and maternal mortality remain strong. Given rising health risks and ageing populations, leaders should invest in global cooperation to bolster public health and sustainable health systems. Trade and capital flows: Metrics related to the flow of goods and services, trade, capital and people had mixed outcomes in 2023. Goods trade declined by 5%, driven largely by slower growth in China and other developing economies, while global fragmentation continued to reduce trade between Western and Eastern-aligned blocs. Despite this, global flows of services, capital and people showed resilience. Foreign direct investment surged, particularly in strategic sectors like semiconductors and green energy, while labour migration and remittances rebounded strongly, surpassing pre-pandemic levels. Looking ahead, leaders will need to find ways to work together, even as competition increases, as tangible results will be crucial to maintain public trust and support. The report concludes by underscoring the urgent need for adaptive, solutions-driven leadership to navigate a turbulent global landscape. By pivoting towards cooperative solutions, leaders can rebuild trust, drive meaningful change and unlock new opportunities for shared progress and resilience in the complex years ahead.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWff6d27ytMDtlJB1Dgb_-Yx	2025-01-07T09:17:50-08:00	
Armageddon 2025: Fear Vs. Tawhid Hope – OpEd	People around the world suffered an average of 41 extra days of very dangerous heat this year because of human-caused climate change, according to a group of scientists who also said that climate change worsened much of the world's damaging weather throughout 2024. The past 10 years have been the warmest 10 years since record-keeping began. The fearful news is that the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research said: 'Even if CO2 emissions were to be drastically cut down starting today, the world economy is already committed to an income reduction of 19% until 2050 due to climate change. These damages are six times larger than the mitigation costs needed to limit global warming to two degrees. And health and economic costs from three toxic chemicals used in plastics is estimated at $1.5 trillion for a single year. The study, published December 16, 2024 in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, analyzed data from 38 different countries, representing one-third of the total global population. Bisphenol A (BPA), commonly found in food packaging, is an endocrine disruptor associated with cardiovascular diseases, diabetes and reproductive disorders. BPA exposure was associated with 5.4 million cases of heart disease and 346,000 strokes, leading to 431,000 deaths. But the good news is that the 'world's largest' vacuum to suck climate pollution out of the air just opened. The challenging news is even when air pollutant concentrations decrease, health risks posed by these pollutants remain consistently high. A global research network examined data from 380 cities to assess how the effects of air pollution on mortality have changed between 1995 and 2016. The central finding: although concentrations of air pollutants such as particulate matter and nitrogen dioxide have decreased, the associated health risks have hardly changed. The study was published in The Lancet. The majority of Christians, Jews, and Muslims do not believe that all of humanity is moving closer and closer to a catastrophic Judgement Day. The minority who do think that Judgement Day is coming soon share the usual negative, fear-filled views of most end-times thinkers: Christians, Jews and especially Muslims, who do believe that: 'The hour (of Judgement) is near' (Qur'an 54:1); and ˹The time of˺ people's judgment has drawn near, yet they heedlessly turn away.' (Qur'an 21:1) According to a 2012 poll by the Pew Research Center, at least half of Muslims in nine Muslim-majority countries believe that the coming of the Mahdi is 'imminent,' and could happen in their lifetime. Sadly these end-times thinkers always see pre-ordained threats of cataclysmic world wide doom; and not just warning of the consequences if we humans do not repent and change our behavior. The Greek word Armageddon is a transliteration of the Hebrew har məgiddô which means a mountain near Megiddo, a hilltop fortification built by King Ahab, that dominated the Plain of Jezreel. Har Magedon is the symbol of a battle in which, when the need is greatest and believers are most oppressed, God suddenly reveals His power to distressed peoples and the evil enemies are destroyed. Armageddon is a warning of humanity's need to change to avoid Armageddon. Because temperatures in the Middle East have risen far faster than the world's average in the past three decades. Precipitation has been decreasing, and experts predict droughts will come with greater frequency and severity. And major wildfires in Europe are starting earlier in the year, becoming more frequent, doing more damage and getting harder to stop. In Africa, where 70% of livelihoods rely on nature in some form, the report showed a two-thirds fall in wildlife populations. Like Judaism and Christianity, Islam has a powerful eschatological strain. It anticipates the end to the world as we know it; a final historical confrontation between good and evil (Armageddon); after which, with God's help, human life will be rewarded and transformed. As the Qur'an states: 'Verily! Those who believe and those who are Jews, Christians, and Sabians, whoever believes in Allah and the Last Day, and do righteous good deeds, shall have their reward with their Lord, on them shall be no fear, nor shall they grieve.' (2:62 and 5:69) Notice that the Qur'an specifically stresses religious pluralism applies on God's judgment day. And Pope Francis said: 'All Religions Are Paths To God' This is a new and very strong support for religious pluralism. Yet a Pew Research Center poll found that in South and Southeast Asia 55-60% of all Muslims believe in the Madhi's imminent return; and in the Middle East and North Africa 51% do. A hadith says that Jesus will return to a place east of Damascus and will join forces with the Islamic messiah, the Mahdi, in a battle against the false messiah, the one eyed Dajjal, Armilos in Jewish tradition. As ibn Babuya writes in Thawab ul-A'mal, 'The Apostle of God said: `There will come a time for my people when there will remain nothing of the Qur'an except its outward form, and nothing of Islam except its name, and they will call themselves by this name even though they are the people furthest from it. The mosques will be full of people but they will be empty of right guidance. 'The religious leaders (Fuqaha) of that day will be the most evil religious leaders under the heavens; sedition and dissension will go out from them and to them will it return.' This sounds, and indeed is, terrible. But, those who trust in God know that the night is coldest in the last hours before sunrise. Secularists believe that these apocalyptic visions of a future (Armageddon) are absurd, although many secularists themselves fervently believe that runaway genetic modification of food and/or extreme climate change is going to doom human civilization in future generations. The basic difference between the pessimistic, humanist secularists and the religious optimists is that those who believe in the God of Abraham also believe that God's inspiration and guidance guarantees that the spiritual forces of good, will overcome all the world's evils at the end of days; and justice, peace and religious pluralism will prevail. Or as Prophet Micah envisions it: (4:1-5) 'In the end of days the mountain of the Lord's Temple will be established as the highest mountain; it will be exalted above the hills, and peoples will stream to it. Many (not all) nations will come and say, 'Come, let us go up to the mountain of the Lord, to the Temple of the God of Jacob. who will teach us his ways, so that we may walk in his paths. 'Torah will go out from Zion, and the word of the Lord from Jerusalem. God will judge between many (not all) peoples and will settle disputes among powerful nations far and wide. They will beat their swords into ploughs, and their spears into pruning hooks. Nation will not take up sword against nation, nor will they train for war any more. 'Everyone will sit under their own vine and under their own fig-tree, and no one will make them afraid, for the Lord Almighty has spoken. All the nations will walk in the name of their gods, and we (Jews) will walk in the name of the Lord our God for ever and ever.' Thus, the Bible and the Qur'an's final judgement is the self-destruction of violent, hate filled, religion twisted terrorism and narrow 'my way or death' philosophy (Armageddon); and the victory of kindness, love, democracy and religious pluralism. The Qur'an refers to Prophet Abraham as a community or a nation: 'Abraham was a nation/community [Ummah]; dutiful to God, a monotheist [hanif], not one of the polytheists.' (16:120) If Prophet Abraham is an Ummah then fighting between the descendants of Prophets Ishmael and Isaac is a civil war and should always be avoided. If all Arabs and Jews can live up to the ideal that 'the descendants of Abraham's sons should never make war against each other' is the will of God; we can help fulfill the 2700 year old vision of Prophet Isaiah: 'In that day there will be a highway from Egypt to Assyria. The Assyrians will go to Egypt, and the Egyptians to Assyria. The Egyptians and Assyrians will worship together. On that day Israel will join a three-party alliance with Egypt and Assyria, a blessing upon the heart. The LORD of Hosts will bless them saying, 'Blessed be Egypt My people, Assyria My handiwork, and Israel My inheritance.' (Isaiah 19:23-5) Finally, if one believes that God inspired prophets are able to describe scenarios of various developments in the distant future then one has to accept that the understanding of these passages should change and improve as we come closer and closer to the times they describe.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWff6d27ytMDtu4Ciss7nVo3	2025-01-07T09:15:09-08:00	
Pakistan’s Christian Voices Of Suffering: Debt, Sexual Abuse, And...	Despite Pakistan outlawing bonded labor decades ago, the practice continues, hidden in the shadows and exacerbated by economic crises and poor enforcement. For hundreds of thousands of families, brick kilns have become places of generational enslavement, where debts are passed from parent to child, binding them to a life of harsh labor. In Pakistan, approximately 4.5 million workers in around 20,000 kilns remain unheard. The debt cycle in these brick kilns is crushing. Workers often borrow small amounts for urgent needs, but these loans, compounded by corruption and unforeseen illnesses, spiral into lifelong bondage. Sexual abuse, trafficking, and severe human rights violations further compound the injustices faced by these workers. In response to this crisis, permanent minority rights activist Joseph Janssen recently embarked on a mission to Pakistan, aiming to free Christian families trapped in brick kiln slavery and to seek justice for young girls and women who had been abducted and forcibly converted. Collaborating with local organizations, the team successfully rescued 100 individuals, including children, elderly family members, and five women who had endured over a decade of sexual enslavement. Among those rescued are individuals whose stories reveal unimaginable torment. One such survivor, Safia Khuram, endured over a decade of sexual enslavement. Born into a life of hardship at a brick kiln, Safia began working alongside her parents as a young child. Her family was bound to the kiln by her father's debt of approximately 100,000 rupees (around 800–900 euros), a burden that kept them enslaved. After marrying a fellow worker, she continued the relentless labor, enduring scorching temperatures each day while producing bricks. However, her hardships didn't end with physical labor. The brick kiln owner, Haji Abdul Gafoor, along with others, began sexually abusing her from the age of 12 years old. The sexual abuse continued after her marriage, exploiting moments when her husband was away. This abuse, which lasted 10 to 12 years, came with threats of violence if she resisted. The physical and emotional scars were deepened by the daily demands to produce 2,000 bricks in temperatures reaching 48 degrees Celsius. When she couldn't meet these demands, beatings and withheld wages became routine. Another rescued woman, Mehwish Shouqat, recalls a similarly harrowing experience. Born in Faisalabad and married into kiln labor, she and her husband, burdened by debt, were forced to work beyond their physical capacities. The owner demanded she terminate a pregnancy to remain in the labor force, and she ultimately lost one child under his pressure. For years, her family faced violence, and she endured repeated assaults, trapped by debt and unable to escape. Following these rescues, Joseph Janssen is providing legal aid to establish identity documents for the survivors, as many, including children, had no official identification. Additionally, the campaign is offering shelter, food, and skills training to help them start anew. This support brings hope for a life free from enslavement, a life in which they can work toward independence and regain control of their destinies. However, the stories of Safia, Mehwish, and others highlight a deeper issue—the urgent need for Pakistan to enforce its laws, end sexual abuse and exploitation in these industries, and protect its most vulnerable workers, Janssen added. Pakistan is a signatory to several international treaties and conventions that obligate it to eliminate bonded labor and human trafficking. Under the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) and the International Covenant on Economic, Social, and Cultural Rights (ICESCR), Pakistan is required to ensure the protection of fundamental rights, including the right to freedom from forced labor. Pakistan must not only strengthen the enforcement of its domestic laws but also fulfill its international obligations, provide adequate protection and rehabilitation for victims, and take concrete steps to meet these commitments while upholding the dignity and rights of its citizens.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWff6d27ytMDttORlbs475ok	2025-01-07T09:14:14-08:00	
Biden Succumbs To Pressure On Moral Issues – OpEd	For the past four years, the Catholic League has been fighting an array of public policies initiated by the Biden administration that touch on serious moral issues. We are happy to report that they have finally succumbed to pressure and are dropping four of their most morally bankrupt policies. On December 23, Biden’s Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) announced that it has withdrawn a rule change that would have barred religious non-profits from claiming an exemption to the HHS mandate that was initiated by the Obama administration; it would require employers to provide abortion and contraceptive coverage in their healthcare plans. This means that the Little Sisters of the Poor, and other religious social service agencies, have cleared another bar in their pursuit of maintaining fidelity to their mission. Even though the U.S. Supreme Court twice granted religious exemptions to the HHS mandate, the Biden team still sought to deny them; they have finally backed off. We have been fighting the HHS mandate from the get-go. It was added to the Affordable Care Act, known as Obamacare, in August 2011 (it became law one year later). On September 19, 2011, a month after it was announced, we registered the first of a long series of objections. We noted that the HHS mandate 'made an exception for religious employers,' but we hastened to add that 'when looked at closer, it became apparent that the exception was flatulent. To wit: a religious employer was defined, in part, as one that primarily employs, and serves, persons who share its religious tenets.' This was meant to cover houses of worship, but would extend no further. For example, it would punish the Little Sisters, and Catholic schools and hospitals, because they serve non-Catholics. But they wouldn’t be Catholic if they were forced to discriminate on the basis of religion! Over the next four months, we issued six additional public statements on the flawed HHS mandate. Then, on January 23, 2012, we made our first comment noting that the mandate was meant to force these Catholic agencies to provide for abortion-inducing drugs in their healthcare plan. Though the HHS mandate does not mention these drugs, per se, it was cleverly inserted in the provision that said 'contraceptives' covered 'emergency contraception (ulipristal acetate), and any additional contraceptives approved, granted, or cleared by the FDA.' In other words, abortion-inducing drugs such as ulipristal (known as 'Ella')—which is similar to the abortion pill RU-486—was to be included in Catholic employee healthcare plans. We subsequently issued more than a dozen public statements condemning the HHS mandate. Now, finally, this intolerant policy has been scrapped. The second policy change made by the Biden administration prohibits the Department of Defense (DOD) from covering transgender drug prescriptions of minors. But it was not done for principled reasons. This provision was part of the huge defense spending bill that Biden wanted, but due to Republican resistance on including transgender drug coverage for minors, he had to nix it. In Biden’s first year in office, we released a three-part series on the physical and psychological damage that transgender health procedures can cause; we also addressed how young people are being indoctrinated into thinking this is normal. So we are delighted that Biden had to kill the drug prescription provision in the DOD budget. The third policy change that Biden made at the end of December was its decision to withdraw a rule that would force schools that receive federal funds to allow boys and young men to compete in girls’ and women’s sports. On his first day in office, Biden issued an executive order saying that children 'will not be denied access to the restroom, the locker room, or school sports' on the basis of their declared sex. This was a perverse reading of Title IX, the 1972 law that mandated that women could not be discriminated against in sports. It has nothing to do with males competing against females. From 2019 to the present, we issued nearly 50 public statements and reports warning of the dangers of men crashing girls’ and women’s spaces, including sports. We also published over 40 articles on this subject in our monthly journal, Catalyst, and I included a chapter on transgenderism in my 2024 book, Cultural Meltdown. To say we are delighted with this outcome would be an understatement. We are most proud of our role in getting the Biden administration to withdraw a proposed rule that would have rescinded a rule initiated when Trump was president that secured the right of religious student organizations at public colleges and universities to maintain their beliefs and practices, free from administrative interference. The Department of Education said it made the change because during the period when public comment was allowed, it received 58,000 comments, and many expressed opposition to rescinding the Trump rule. On February 28, 2023, we detailed how the rights of religious students were being decimated on campus. More important, we called for Catholics to register their objections, providing them with directions on how to make their voice heard. Resistance matters, and we are happy to have participated.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWff6d27ytMDtpksEsZ2uwv0	2025-01-07T09:12:40-08:00	
2025 Declared As The ‘International Year Of Peace And Trust’ In T...	2025 has been declared as the 'International Year of Peace and Trust' in Turkmenistan. Turkmenistan is a Turkic state located in Central Asia. It is bordered by Uzbekistan to the north, Iran to the south, and Afghanistan to the southeast. Turkmenistan declared its independence from the Soviet Union in 1991. In the 1990s, Afghanistan was in a critical situation. Therefore, Turkmenistan made a smart move and declared its permanent neutrality. The United Nations recognized this on December 12, 1995. Since then, Turkmenistan has become a symbol of peace and is celebrating the 30th anniversary of its permanent neutrality this year. The Embassy of Turkmenistan in Brussels, thanks to the support of Ambassador Sapar Palvanov and diplomat Maral Rahymova, preparatifs are organized for the year 2025. A speech was given by Derya Soysal, Central Asia expert and graduate of the Free University of Brussels, highlighting Turkmenistan's significant achievements in ensuring stability in the region and world peace. Turkmenistan has become an exemplary country in international relations with its policy of permanent neutrality. December 12 is celebrated as 'Neutrality Day' in Turkmenistan, and this year marks the 30th anniversary of the United Nations' official recognition of this Central Asian country's neutral status. This neutrality status is tightly integrated into Turkmenistan's constitutional order. For example, Article 2 of the Constitution states, 'The permanent neutrality of Turkmenistan forms the basis of its national and foreign policy.' Additionally, Article 68 states that the president is 'the guarantor of Turkmenistan's independence and permanent neutrality status.' UN Secretary-General António Guterres has highlighted Turkmenistan's significant role in international relations, praising the country's contributions, especially in cooperation with the UN and regional integration. Guterres expressed his satisfaction with the deepening cooperation among Central Asian countries and noted that Turkmenistan plays a central role in this process. He also mentioned that Turkmenistan has made significant progress towards the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and that the UN will continue to support the country's development processes. Turkmenistan adopted the concept of neutrality as a fundamental element of its political culture and used it as a strategic tool both in the process of breaking away from Russian influence and in its integration into the international community as a post-Soviet state. Although neutrality is generally a policy adopted to avoid wars, Turkmenistan stands out as the only country to choose this status during peacetime. This policy has been shaped in line with the country's goals of strengthening its national identity and making a positive contribution to the international community. Former Turkmenistan leader Saparmurat Niyazov defined the main principles of the neutrality policy as follows: The sovereignty and territorial integrity of all states must be preserved. There should be no interference in the internal affairs of other states. The use of force in interstate conflicts should be prevented. The role of the UN in maintaining global peace should be recognized. National interests should be fairly protected… Turkmenistan's neutrality policy has been appreciated by the international community with many concrete examples, such as its mediation role in the Tajikistan civil war and its contribution to providing humanitarian aid corridors in Afghanistan. According to former UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan, the country has been 'a turning point in the process of producing peaceful solutions.' In conclusion, Turkmenistan's neutrality policy has allowed the country to effectively defend its national, regional, and global interests and has played an important role in maintaining stability in Central Asia. The neutrality status has further strengthened the country's constructive role in regional peace, international cooperation, and economic development. Thanks to this policy, Turkmenistan is recognized as a strong advocate of peace and cooperation on the world stage.

Fall Of Syrian Regime And Regional Implications – Analysis	By Amb. Assoc. Prof. Dr. Arben P. Cici While the world's eyes and attention were focused on the new Trump administration, the consequences of its policies after January 21 in Ukraine, and the raging fires of the Middle East, a new fire flared up and died down in the blink of an eye in Syria. A pending issue took suddenly an unexpected turn. On December 8, 2024, the fall of the Bashar al-Assad regime marked a historic and decisive turning point in the Syrian civil war, after nearly 14 years of conflict. This sudden defeat, despite the regime's growing difficulties, was accelerated by the rapid and coordinated advance of rebel groups, in particular Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), which launched a determined offensive from Idlib province, in the northwest of the country. The offensive, which began on November 27, 2024, benefited from the strategic and military support of Turkey, a regional power directly involved in the Syrian dynamic for several years. A. A POST-ASSAD SYRIA The offensive enabled the rebels to quickly take control of the main cities and strategic urban centers of 'useful Syria' – including Aleppo, Hama, Homs and eventually Damascus. The capture of the Syrian capital was the final blow to the regime, which had been weakened by years of bloody fighting, international sanctions and significant military and economic exhaustion. Assad's overthrow was further facilitated by the gradual withdrawal of his main international supporters: Russia and Iran. These two powers, which had actively supported the regime since 2015, notably through military interventions and financial aid, gradually reduced their support for various political, strategic and economic reasons, including their reorientation towards other regional or international priorities. 1. A fragile hope for the Syrian population The fall of the regime offers oppressed Syrians, who have suffered for more than a decade under the authoritarian rule of Bashar al-Assad, a new breath of hope. Protesters, opposition groups and civilians have all too often seen their democratic aspirations suffocated, their cities destroyed and their loved ones sacrificed in the context of a brutal war. The overthrow of this regime could pave the way for a more inclusive reconstruction of the country, challenging the political status quo that has perpetuated social and economic inequalities. However, this hope remains fragile in the face of an uncertain political and security reality. Syria remains a deeply fragmented state, with multiple factions, militias and foreign powers vying for influence. The divisive landscape is not limited to rebel and loyalist groups: it also includes ethnic, religious and ideological dynamics, as well as ongoing foreign interference. 2. A fragmented Syria and areas of security vacuum The regime's failure leaves the country in a worrying security vacuum. The Syrian army, weakened by years of war, desertions and targeted Israeli attacks, is struggling to maintain stability in areas now beyond the control of loyalists. Large areas in the south, east and centre of the country are now devoid of state authority, creating fertile ground for the emergence of armed groups of all origins. Some of them risk taking advantage of this instability to strengthen their positions, exacerbating the already violent dynamics in the region. Furthermore, the withdrawal of major support from Russia and Iran has left a strategic vacuum. This could allow new foreign actors or local armed groups to play a role in Syria's political future. Israeli strikes, which have regularly attacked targets linked to Iran and its militias in the country, have also left unhealed wounds, with destroyed infrastructure and militias scattered across different regions, further complicating stability in the territory. 3. Regional consequences: a new geopolitical dynamic The fall of Assad and the overthrow of his regime have direct consequences for the regional geopolitical dynamics. Several foreign powers, including Turkey, Iran, Russia, the United States and Israel, are adapting their strategies in the region. Turkey, which supported the rebel offensive, is now seeking to increase its influence in northern Syria by consolidating its border against Kurdish influence. For their part, Iran and Russia may be forced to reconsider their strategic priorities in the region. The impact of their withdrawal from the Syrian conflict opens the door to a realignment of regional alliances, especially with powers such as Saudi Arabia or the United States, which may seek to strengthen their positions in the vacuum left by the two great powers. Israel, for its part, is likely to continue its military operations to curb Iranian influence in the region. The United States, although less directly involved in the fights for several years, must also navigate this new environment. The fall of the Syrian regime risks changing US strategic objectives, particularly in terms of counterterrorism, countering Iranian influence, and supporting opposition groups. 4. A period of uncertainty for the future While the regime's overthrow offers a historic moment, this military victory has not resolved domestic political challenges or issues related to foreign powers. Syria's future therefore remains uncertain. The prospect of rebuilding a country devastated by more than a decade of war, given the ethnic, religious, and political diversity of its population, remains complex. Many challenges remain: restoring state institutions, reconciliation between different ethnic and religious groups, the reintegration of millions of internally displaced people and Syrian refugees in their areas of origin, and the need to curb foreign interference in the country's internal affairs. Therefore, the fall of the Assad regime, while a major turning point in the history of the region, is also a period of fragility, where any political or military decision could redefine the contours of Syria and the geopolitical dynamics in the Middle East. B. IRAN: AN ACCENTUATED EXISTENTIAL CRISIS The fall of Bashar al-Assad's regime constitutes a major strategic shaking for Iran, which sees the collapse of one of its key regional alliances. This alliance was created during the Iran-Iraq War (1980-1988) and was based on strong geopolitical and ideological foundations, aimed in particular at countering Western influence and establishing an axis of resistance against Israel and the United States in the Middle East. The loss of this alliance would mean for Tehran a significant reduction of its influence in the region and a questioning of its ability to influence regional dynamics through its relations with the Syrian regime and its allied militias. 1. Weakening of the axis of resistance The fall of the Syrian regime weakens the axis of resistance led by Iran, which had played a key role in supporting groups such as Hezbollah in Lebanon. This axis represented not only a military strategy, but also a political lever to thwart the ambitions of Israel and the Western powers in the region. With the loss of Damascus as a key strategic ally, Iran finds itself facing a situation of increasing vulnerability, both on the security and political levels. This new reality poses a major challenge for Iran, whose influence in Syria had allowed it to monitor the movements of its adversaries, control certain flows of allied militias, and strengthen its ambitions in the regional war against its rivals. With the collapse of the Assad regime and the withdrawal of foreign supporters such as Russia, Tehran must redouble its efforts to maintain control in this part of the Middle East, while trying to manage its relations with other rival powers. 2. The issue of succession and the rise of internal disputes The crisis is also internal. The issue of the succession of Ali Khamenei, the Supreme Leader of the Revolution, is at the center of all concerns. Khamenei, in office since 1989, is aging, and his imminent departure risks creating a power vacuum with critical consequences for the stability of the Iranian regime. This moment of political transition comes in a context characterized by a surge in domestic protests, which reflect the population's fatigue facing the economic hardship, international sanctions, and political restrictions. In front of this situation, the reformist wing of the regime, represented by political figures in favor of the dialogue with the West, is returning to the forefront. These reformists are calling for a review of Iranian foreign policy, in particular through the resumption of negotiations with Western powers over Iran's nuclear program and economic sanctions. However, their credibility has been seriously weakened since the United States withdrew from the nuclear agreement (JCPOA) in 2018, plunging Iran into a period of increasing international isolation and under significant economic pressure. This fragile situation is pushing the Iranian regime to reactivate its nuclear policy, in the faint hope of strengthening its position in the upcoming negotiations with the new US administration. The aim would be to demonstrate both its capacity to resist international pressure and its strategic ambitions in the always unstable regional context. 3. A cautious approach to avoid escalation To maintain their influence while minimizing risks, pro-Iranian militias must act with increased strategic caution. They are seeking to move in this complex balance, strengthening their positions along the Iraq-Syria border without provoking new clashes with Israel or Western powers. The goal would be to consolidate their military and political capabilities while maintaining some stability in their operations. This strategy also includes strengthening their relations with the Iraqi government, which remains divided on the issue of the militias' position within the Iraqi state. The willingness and steps to secure the border could allow the militias to prove their usefulness in the fight against regional threats, including residues of the Islamic State and smuggling, positioning themselves as key players in Iraq's national security. 4. A period of strategic uncertainty The combination of the collapse of the Syrian regime, domestic protests, regional instability, and international pressures puts Iran in an extremely vulnerable position. The regime must now navigate across a complex situation where any decision – whether on nuclear negotiations, regional stability or internal crisis management – could have significant consequences. In this context, the revival of Iranian nuclear policy seems to be a way for Tehran to reposition itself on the international chessboard, while seeking to compensate for its domestic and regional weaknesses. The outcome of this strategy remains uncertain, as it will depend not only on Iran's ability to consolidate allies and strategic objectives, but also on the willingness of Western powers, especially the United States, to engage in dialogue and negotiations with the Islamic Republic. Thus, Iran's existential crisis is multidimensional: it is geopolitical, economic, domestic and nuclear. Faced with this situation, Tehran will probably have to adopt a pragmatic approach while maintaining its strategic ambitions to avoid an irreversible weakening on the regional and international stage. C. GULF MONARCHIES FACING REGIONAL THREATS 1. Gulf monarchies: new dynamics The fall of Bashar al-Assad's regime marks an important strategic turning point for the Gulf monarchies, which now find themselves facing new geopolitical and strategic challenges in their approach to Syria. This situation, caused by the collapse of a key regional actor, is forcing these states to review their priorities, alliances and strategies for preventing prolonged instability in the region, while seeking to protect their national and regional interests. The relations between Iran and the Gulf monarchies have been for a long time characterized by geopolitical, religious and economic conflicts. The fragile balance between these powers is now being tested, with Assad's fall as a new disruptive element. In front of potential threats, these monarchies have maintained an uncompromising stance, seeking to strengthen their military capabilities and international alliances to counter Tehran's influence. The regional dynamics do not stop there. The Gulf monarchies, including Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, and Qatar, continue to closely monitor Iranian expansionism. These countries, often in opposition to Tehran, remain steadfast in their security and diplomatic approaches. Any Israeli attempt at escalation, or any Iranian initiative aimed at exploiting the vacuum left by Assad's fall, would be considered as a direct threat by these states. 2. A period of strategic reassessment Since the beginning of the Syrian civil war, the Gulf monarchies have adopted different stances regarding the conflict. The differences between them – particularly between Qatar and its neighbors such as Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) – are reflected in their different approaches to foreign policy, security, and alliances. However, with the fall of the Assad regime, these differences may change, prompting the Gulf countries to consider more cooperative approaches to ensure regional stability and their strategic interests. 3. Qatar's potential role in reconstruction Qatar is in a particular position. After breaking diplomatic relations with Damascus in 2011, the country had distanced itself from the Syrian regime due to its support for moderate opposition groups and opposition to Assad's policies. However, with the fall of the regime, Qatar could position itself as a key player in the reconstruction phase of Syria. By seeking to play a central role in the reconstruction, Qatar hopes to limit the risk of 'protracted chaos' that could have negative consequences for the region as a whole, particularly in terms of migration flows or political instability. This move also aims to strengthen the country's regional influence by repositioning itself as a diplomatic actor capable of promoting stability and reconciliation. Qatar could invest in humanitarian aid programs, infrastructure reconstruction initiatives, and economic projects aimed at restoring stability in areas devastated by the conflict. This approach would offer Qatar not only a way to contribute to the reconstruction, but also to improve its relations with the various opposition groups and international powers involved in the reconstruction process. 4. Saudi Arabia: Preserving regional stability and Syria's sovereignty For Saudi Arabia, the priority is clear: preserving Syria's sovereignty and preventing any destabilization that could have negative consequences for the entire Middle East. Riyadh remains concerned about Iran's influence in the region, especially in the context of the Syrian crisis. The fall of the Assad regime, while seen as an opportunity to limit Iranian influence, also raises concerns about the potential spread of militias or armed groups into unstable areas of Syria. Saudi Arabia may thus seek to balance its relations with Syria with a strategic objective of stabilizing the region, while continuing to exert pressure on Iran through political and economic means. At the same time, Riyadh may play an active role in diplomatic mediation, to strengthen its relations with the various Syrian factions while working with Western powers to stabilize the country. 5. United Arab Emirates: a pragmatic and balanced approach The United Arab Emirates (UAE), for its part, is adopting a more pragmatic and balanced approach in responding to the fall of the Syrian regime. The Emirates restored relations with Damascus in 2018, marking a change in regional dynamics and a willingness to contribute to regional stability by working towards a dialogue approach with Syria. This strategy allows them to maintain a certain influence in the Syrian political game, while seeking to limit the expansion of Iranian influence in the region. The Emirates are thus continuing diplomatic, economic and strategic efforts to strengthen their position in the regional game without engaging in direct clashes with their regional rivals. This more measured approach also aims to strengthen relations with the major Western powers and their regional partners. 6. Towards increased cooperation despite differences Despite the historical and political differences that have sometimes hindered unity within the Gulf monarchies, the fall of Assad seems to create a favorable dynamic for increased cooperation between these states. The common challenges posed by Syrian instability, the fight against Iranian influence and the need to stabilize the region are pushing these countries to put aside their differences for creating a common front. This new dynamic could take the form of dialogue mechanisms, joint economic projects, or even new diplomatic initiatives aimed at promoting Syrian reconciliation and reconstruction. However, it remains to be seen whether these efforts will be able to overcome internal tensions, particularly between Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the Emirates, and create a coherent and stable regional framework. 7. A new regional balance is emerging The fall of the Assad regime is thus leading to a reassessment of the political dynamics in the Persian Gulf, with each state seeking to navigate across this new geopolitical environment while protecting its own interests. For the Gulf monarchies, the objective is clear: to stabilize the region, avoid the spread of Iranian influence, support Syrian reconstruction and strengthen their respective positions in a context of regional strategic renewal. The coming period will be crucial, as it could allow the Gulf monarchies to play a greater role in the Syrian dynamics, reaffirming their capacity to resolve their internal disputes and to impose themselves as key actors in reconstruction and diplomacy. D. IRAQ: PRO-IRANIAN MILITIAS FACING A NEW EQUILIBRIUM The instability in Syria, especially with the fall of Bashar al-Assad's regime, opens a new geopolitical chapter for Iraq and its pro-Iranian militias. These groups, especially those integrated within the Hashd al-Chaabi (or Popular Mobilization Units), could take advantage of this situation to consolidate their positions in the region, secure their supply routes, and strengthen their political and military legitimacy by increasing operations along the Iraq-Syria border. However, this dynamic is accompanied by many challenges and risks, especially due to the presence of Israel and the American stance on Iranian influence. 1. Pro-Iranian militias and their strategy in Iraq Pro-Iranian militias, particularly those that are part of the Hashd al-Shaabi, played a crucial role in the reoccupation of Iraqi territories that fell under the control of the Islamic State between 2014 and 2018. Their effectiveness in these operations consolidated their status as military and political actors in Iraq, giving them legitimacy among certain Shiite political factions. Faced with domestic and regional challenges, these militias now see the Syrian situation as an opportunity to strengthen their capabilities. By securing the Iraqi-Syrian border, they aim not only to prevent the return of terrorist groups, but also to create a strategic corridor that allows them to facilitate trade with their regional allies, particularly Iran. Such efforts could increase their control in the region, consolidating their interests in an unstable regional context. However, their strategic ambitions must be balanced by broader political and security stances. The increased interference in the Syrian dynamic risks attracting negative reactions from rival powers and Western states, especially Israel. 2. Iraq in a new regional order The impact of the Syrian situation on Iraq goes beyond simple militia dynamics. The new regional balance, marked by the collapse of the Assad regime, the rise of rival powers, and Tehran's desire to strengthen its influence, places Iraq at the center of new strategic maneuvers. Therefore, pro-Iranian militias could not only increase their military prerogatives, but could also play a key role in the internal political dynamics in Iraq, strengthening their partnership with Iran to operate in this new environment. Shortly, while pro-Iranian militias have the opportunity to expand their legitimacy and capabilities through Syrian instability, they also face major challenges: Israeli actions, the Trump administration's stance, domestic pressures in Iraq, and regional uncertainties. The ability of these militias to adapt and avoid an escalation in their actions could determine their future in the region and beyond their role in the new strategic balance in the Middle East. E. TURKEY: A KEY PLAYER ON THE RISE The fall of Bashar al-Assad's regime represents a major strategic turning point for Turkey, with consequences that extend to its domestic politics, regional strategy and international relations, as well. In front of this new regional configuration, Ankara finds itself facing several major challenges, particularly the management of the Syrian refugee issue, the intensification of its military operations in Syria and its relations with Western and regional powers. 1. The case of Syrian refugees at the heart of the domestic debate Since the beginning of the Syrian conflict, Turkey has hosted around 3 million Syrian refugees on its territory, due to its geographical proximity to Syria and its initial 'open door policy'. However, this situation has created internal, economic and political tensions in a country that is already facing structural economic challenges. The fall of the Assad regime has revived this debate. The question of the possible return of these refugees to Syria is now at the heart of political and social concerns in Turkey. For a long time, a divisive issue, it now enjoys broad consensus among both the Turkish population and political leaders, particularly due to the need to disengage the country from this humanitarian crisis and reduce social pressures. Ankara hopes now to facilitate the return of refugees as part of a reconstruction plan in Syria, with the support of the international community. However, these projects face several obstacles, including the ongoing insecurity in many Syrian regions, the lack of adequate infrastructure, and political rivalries between local groups and foreign powers. Turkey will therefore have to navigate a delicate balance between the domestic imperatives related to integrating and resettling these refugees and its international obligations, seeking to avoid any rush in the return process. 2. Turkish military operations and ambitions in Syria The fall of the Syrian regime also gives new impetus to Turkey's military ambitions in northeastern Syria. For several years, Ankara has supported rebel groups and conducted military operations to secure its borders and weaken groups it considers threats to its national security, namely groups linked to the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) and Syrian forces allied with the United States. On the ground, the advance of Turkish army auxiliary troops in northeastern Syria, often composed by Syrian opposition groups, could intensify after the fall of Assad. These maneuvers are intended to create a security buffer zone to counter Kurdish threats and to ensure the potential stability of the Turkish-Syrian border. However, these actions are not without friction. The United States and Iraq have expressed concerns about regional stability, especially in the Iraq-Syria border area, where Turkey is seeking to expand its influence. The intensification of these operations may also be criticized by the international community, especially because of the risks of a resurgence of extremist groups such as the Islamic State (IS) in these destabilized areas. Therefore, Turkey will have to manage these operations with increased caution to avoid a new surge of extremism in a region already ravaged by multifaceted conflicts. 3. Expanding the buffer zone: a risky strategy In this context, Ankara is considering strengthening its buffer zone in Syria. The strategy aims to create a safe region under Turkish control where refugees can be resettled, preventing the expansion of hostile groups such as Kurdish militias or ISIS. However, this expansion would involve new negotiations with Western powers, especially the United States, and with other regional players such as Iran.Managing such a buffer zone is complex, requiring not only military cooperation but also broad diplomatic and economic support. Western powers, especially the United States, may see these actions as a challenge to their influence in the region, while Iran remains a key player with its own strategic ambitions in Syria. Therefore, Turkey will have to maneuver skillfully in this strategic game, balancing its security interests, its relations with its international partners, and its ambitions to stabilize the region through mechanisms of military control. 4. The resurgence of the Islamic State: a major concern The possible resurgence of the Islamic State in this new regional balance remains a major concern for Ankara. Although ISIS has lost most of its territory in Syria and Iraq, the current security vacuum, especially in northeastern Syria, could allow the terrorist group to rise from the ashes. Thus, Turkey faces a dual challenge: securing its borders by preventing the resurgence of ISIS, while managing its relations with Western powers in this context of security fragility. In this context, Turkish military operations in the region can be seen as a means of preventing attacks by the Islamic State and assuring the presence of its authority in an increasingly complex environment. 5. Towards a strategically reoriented Turkey The fall of the Assad regime and the new dynamics in Syria require Ankara to reorient its strategy on several levels: managing refugees, securing its borders, consolidating its military operations in northeastern Syria, and expanding its buffer zone. At the same time, Turkey will need to maintain a delicate balance with its Western allies, especially in the context of its regional ambitions and tense relations with the United States. In this new environment, Turkey emerges as a key and central, but rapidly growing, player seeking to strengthen its regional influence while avoiding international isolation. The evolution of its strategy in this context will determine not only its role in the reconstruction of Syria, but also its important positioning in the new geopolitical balance of the Middle East. F. KURDISH TERRITORIES OF NORTHEASTERN SYRIA: AMONG STRATEGIC THREATS AND CHALLENGES The Kurdish regions in northeastern Syria, mostly grouped under the name 'Rojava', after the fall of the Syrian regime find themselves at the heart of a complex game of geopolitical dynamics. These territories, already weakened by the multi-year conflict, are facing additional major threats, due to the advancement of auxiliary troops of the Turkish army, which are pursuing their security objectives in this strategic region. 1. A potentially destabilizing Turkish military advance In the context of the fall of the Assad regime and the ongoing geopolitical recompositions, Turkey is intensifying its operations in northeastern Syria. These operations rely on the use of local proxies (Syrian rebel groups supported by Ankara) and aim to create a safe defensive zone to limit the influence of Kurdish groups in the region. Since the start of its military operations in 2016, Ankara has consolidated its presence in key regions, seeking to weaken the armed wing of the Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) and its local allies. The 1998 agreement with Hafez al-Assad, often referred to as the Adana Agreement, allowed Turkey to create a de facto buffer zone on the Syrian border, weakening the PKK's capabilities in southeastern Turkey. With the collapse of the Assad regime and the creation of a security vacuum, Ankara sees opportunities to expand this buffer zone, based on its military operations and its support for local rebel groups. But, intensifying these operations could also be dangerous, especially taking into consideration the emergency of maintaining stability in the Iraqi-Syrian border area, required by Baghdad and the United States. This stability is essential to prevent regional instability from creating new spaces that could be exploited by groups such as the Islamic State (IS), which is seeking to regroup and re-emerge in the context of a deteriorating security situation. 2. The Kurds' position in the face of these challenges The Kurds, especially those of the Rojava Autonomous Administration, face major challenges with this Turkish advance. Indeed, their autonomy in northeastern Syria is constantly threatened by Ankara's ambitions, which seeks to dismantle their territorial control. This dynamic places Kurdish forces in a particularly vulnerable position, due to their dependence on Western powers such as the United States, but also because of their fight against the Islamic State. The Kurds managed to impose themselves as a key force in the fight against the Islamic State in the years 2014-2019, particularly thanks to the help of the international coalition. However, their relationship with Western powers is complex, characterized by ad hoc cooperation but also strategic divergences with the United States and its allies in the region. This factor has left the Kurds in a delicate situation in front of Turkish operations, which are aimed not only at neutralizing the PKK but also at weakening the political and military autonomy of Rojava. 3. Western interests in the region: a precarious balance Turkey is seeking to consolidate its position in northeastern Syria by exploiting the security vacuum to increase its influence. However, it must deal with Western strategic interests in the region, especially in the context of a Syrian context that remains unstable and is likely to favor the reemergence of the Islamic State. The United States and its Western partners have provided military support to Kurdish forces in their fight against ISIS, helping to contain the group in several key regions. This dynamic creates pressure on Turkey, which wants to weaken Kurdish capabilities while limiting the risk that regional instability could pave the way for the resurgence of ISIS. The desire to maintain stability while respecting strategic alliances with Turkey remains a difficult balance for Western powers to maintain it.The dynamic is further complicated by the fact that Turkey and its Western allies sometimes have different visions on the stabilization strategy in the region, particularly to the importance that Ankara attaches to military operations against Kurdish militias, while the West remains focused on the fight against ISIS and political stabilization. 4. The future of Rojava and its strategic challenges Faced with Turkish threats, the Kurds must carefully navigate between several emergencies: preserving their political autonomy, strengthening their cooperation with the United States and the international coalition, and resisting Ankara's military advances. The future of Rojava will depend on their ability to balance their relations with their Western allies and strengthen their governing and defense capacities in front of security challenges and political ones. The situation in northeastern Syria therefore remains unstable, characterized by competing ambitions, geopolitical rivalries, and internal militant dynamics. The Kurds, while continuing to fight the Islamic State, must also prepare a more political and less military response to Turkish expansionist ambitions while seeking mechanisms for dialogue with their Western partners to avoid strategic isolation in an increasingly unstable environment. Turkey, for its part, will need to navigate within the same dynamic with clear strategic calculations, integrating pressure from the United States, Iraq, and its own internal security objectives into a delicate balance. G. JORDAN: GROWING CONCERNS Jordan, located on Syria's western border, remains a key player in the current regional dynamic. Faced with the turmoil caused by the fall of the Syrian regime and the rise of groups such as Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) in several regions, Amman sees this situation as a potential risk factor for its internal stability. 1. Growing Islamist influence Jordan is particularly concerned about the growing Islamist influence in Syria. HTS, which is a group that emerged from Syrian jihadist groups and is strongly rooted in Idlib province, represents a destabilizing factor in the region. This increase in power is seen as a worrying signal for Jordan, which has faced internal challenges related to Islamist dynamics in the past. There is also concern that these groups could expand their influence into border areas or encourage factions of their followers within Jordan itself. Such a dynamic would have significant political and security implications, especially given the historical ties and existing cross-border networks in the region. 2. Legislative elections and the strengthening of the Islamic Action Front Another important factor is the political growth of internal Islamist groups in Jordan. In the September 2024 legislative elections, the Islamic Action Front (IAF), the country's main Islamist party, won a significant number of seats. This victory is largely attributed to popular discontent generated by the war against Hamas, growing economic difficulties, and the perception that the current government's policies have failed to meet the social aspirations of the population. Even if political stability remains globally ensured by the traditional weight of Jordanian tribes in the internal balance, this electoral dynamic indicates increased polarization and a rise in Islamist influence, which, according to some analysts, could weaken state control in some regions. The potential impact of these changes could disrupt the kingdom's internal political balances, especially in the western region bordering Syria. 3. Pressures on the Syrian Border Jordan faces increasing security and migration pressures on its western border, with the continued flow of Syrian refugees and the dynamics of the constant evolving regional conflict. The fall of the Syrian regime has brought new security uncertainties along this border, particularly with the increased presence of Islamist groups and their potential efforts to infiltrate the region. In this context, Jordan will need to strengthen its control capacities while avoiding compromising its relations with foreign powers, particularly the United States and members of the international coalition. At the same time, the kingdom must continue to balance its efforts to limit migratory pressures while maintaining its domestic political stability. 4. Towards a precarious balance The combination of growing Islamist influence in Syria, domestic concerns over the election results, and cross-border dynamics places Jordan in a delicate position. The authorities must carefully maneuver between preserving their domestic political interests, securing their borders, and managing their relations with regional and international actors. Thus, while Jordan remains a key player in regional stability, it must also navigate this complex context with caution, where rising tensions in Syria, combined with domestic challenges, could compromise its fragile balances. H. ISRAEL: A DECISIVE PLAYER IN A SHAKEN MIDDLE EAST The fall of Bashar al-Assad's regime represents a major strategic upheaval for Israel, defining a turning point in the regional dynamics to which the country must adapt. Israel remains one of the most attentive actors to developments in Syria, particularly due to its security concerns, geostrategic ambitions, and its rivalries with Iran. After the overthrow of the Assad regime, Israel's position, in this new context, appears on several geopolitical axes. 1. A security opportunity: weakening Iran For several years, Israel has considered Iran one of its main strategic threats, due to Iranian support for Shiite militias in Syria, Lebanon and other parts of the Middle East. The collapse of the Syrian regime, along with the withdrawal of some of Assad's traditional military support capabilities, weakens Iran's position in the region. Israel has undertaken uninterrupted military operations in Syria to paralyze Iranian influence. The strikes have targeted weapons depots, military positions and arms transfers destined for Hezbollah, which enjoys Tehran's support. This dynamic has helped weaken the Iran-Syria-Hezbollah axis, while giving Israel strategic space to maneuver for countering Iranian influence. With the collapse of the Assad regime and the resulting security vacuum, Israel may seek to strengthen this dynamic by consolidating its positions on the ground and maintaining constant pressure on Iranian-backed groups. However, this strategy carries risks, especially due to the complexity of regional dynamics and the ongoing instability in some Syrian regions. In his recent statements, following the ceasefire agreement with Hezbollah, Benjamin Netanyahu has promised to maintain constant pressure on Iran and its militias in order to prevent any military or strategic reinforcement in the region. This strategy of destabilization and deterrence has exacerbated Iranian vulnerability, which will now have to maneuver between internal and external pressures simultaneously. 2. An opportunity to control the Iran-Syria axis The fall of the Assad regime also weakens the traditional axis of cooperation between Iran and Syria. Israel sees this dynamic as an opportunity to limit the expansion of Tehran-backed groups in Syria, strengthening its ability to operate militarily in the region without having to face a resilient and consolidated Syrian regime. By controlling the situation in key regions, including through targeted military strikes, Israel is seeking to prevent the creation of a land corridor connecting Iran to Lebanon, which would be an important strategic lever for Tehran. This corridor is seen as a key factor in Iran's regional expansion strategy, and its neutralization remains one of Israel's strategic priorities. In this context, the fall of the Assad regime gives Israel a better opportunity to strengthen its military position and relations with regional partners, such as Turkey or even some moderate Arab countries, while continuing its actions against Iran. 3. Relations with the United States and Western allies Israel's strategic position is also influenced by relations with the United States and its policies towards the region after the fall of the Syrian regime. The United States, with its partial withdrawal and pragmatic approach to the region, supports Israel in its determination to contain Iran while seeking to stabilize the situation in Syria through diplomatic and military means. Israel is now recalibrating its priorities in this new environment. With the Iranian threat as a backdrop, Israel wants to maintain a strategic balance in cooperation with the United States and other Western powers, while demonstrating its ability to take independent military action for protecting its interests. 4. Domestic challenges: maintaining security and responding to regional tensions The situation following the fall of the Assad regime also presents domestic challenges for Israel. The security vacuum in Syria, especially in some regions near its borders, could allow a resurgence of extremist groups or new hostile factions. Israel will need to closely monitor developments in the Golan Heights, a strategic region bordering Syria, where extremist groups could benefit from the regional chaos. Israel will also need to remain vigilant to internal dynamics within its Arab neighbors. The fall of Assad could open up new spaces for extremist groups or cross-border conflicts. This situation, combined with Iran's ambitions to maintain a regional presence, forces Israel to strengthen its surveillance and military capabilities to meet new security challenges. 5. Israel: A player to watch Israel remains one of the main obstacles to pro-Iranian militias in Iraq. For several years, the Jewish state has undertaken military operations aimed at weakening Iranian influence in the region, including striking Iranian-linked military targets in Syria. However, these operations are not limited to Syria. Israel has already carried out strikes in Syria, targeting weapons depots, militia centers, and military infrastructure attributed to groups backed by Tehran. The buffer zone is no longer taboo because the Israeli forces have crossed the border into the Golan Heights, moving significantly closer to the capital, Damascus. In this context, the collapse of the Syrian regime and the resulting instability could encourage Israel to intensify its military operations in Iraq, given that the Iran-Syria-Iraq axis poses a strategic threat. The Trump administration, while more aggressive towards Iran than some of its predecessors, has also shown determination towards a gradual US disengagement and support for actions aimed at containing Iranian influence in the region. This dynamic creates a particularly fragile environment for pro-Iranian militias. Their desire to secure their strategic objectives could conflict with Israeli and American positions, which remain determined to limit the expansion of Iranian influence. In this new regional environment marked by the collapse of the Syrian regime, Israel is adapting a pragmatic strategy, combining targeted military actions with enhanced diplomatic cooperation. Israel's objective remains clear: to contain Iran, weaken its regional backers, and maintain its military and security superiority, while taking advantage of the vacuum created by Assad's fall for reshaping its strategic positions.This strategy, however, faces uncertainties in the region. Israel will have to manage not only the rise of Islamist groups like HTS, but also the broader dynamics of regional competition, including powers like the United States, Russia, Turkey, and Iran. Through its capacity for foresight, military preparedness, and alliances, Israel remains a key player in this complex context, determined to secure its strategic interests in a Middle East in full restructuring. CONCLUSION: A NEW REGIONAL EQUILIBRIUM The fall of Bashar al-Assad's regime marks the end of a political era in the Middle East and paves the way for an extremely complex geopolitical recomposition. This major upheaval, which resulted through a combination of internal efforts, foreign intervention, and regional dynamics, has profoundly altered the balance of power in the region. However, despite this symbolic shift, stability is still precarious and many challenges remain. The demise of the Syrian regime, as it was known, does not mean the end of conflicts or the solution of historical crises. Syria remains a fragmented country, with rebel groups, militias, foreign powers, and sectarian dynamics that will continue to shape its future. In this sense, Assad's fall is not an end point, but a new chapter in a civil war that remains marked by diverse interests and multiple geopolitical ambitions. More broadly, this situation is leading to a repositioning of regional and international players. Turkey, Iran, Israel, the United States, Russia, and other powers all have overlapping and sometimes conflicting interests, generating new tensions and new alliances in an already unstable regional context. This dynamic is redrawing the boundaries of influence, while placing the fight against extremist groups such as the Islamic State at the center of strategic priorities. Moreover, it seems that the fall of the Assad regime could have consequences for the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, even if the latter risks falling into the background in a context where regional stability remains fragile. The priorities of many powers are now oriented towards reconstruction, militia management, and security stabilization, reducing attention to the Palestinian issue. This situation underscores the need to remember the historical dimensions of the conflict while taking into account new geopolitical realities. In short, while the fall of the Syrian regime represents a decisive turning point, it constitutes neither a solution nor a new established order. On the contrary, it creates a new regional equilibrium, where ambitions, alliances, power struggles, and political aspirations will continue to shape the Middle East. Stability and peace in the region will depend on the ability of regional and international powers to manage these dynamics with pragmatism, cooperation, and long-term strategic vision.

Bracing For Hurricane Trump In 2025 – Analysis	By Yves Tiberghien Over the past five years, the Indo-Pacific has witnessed intensifying great power competition and a series of social and political disruptions, including the COVID-19 pandemic and the ripple effects of conflicts in Ukraine and the Middle East. The coming of an unconstrained and revolutionary Donald Trump 2.0 administration is likely to trigger even more disruption. Ultimately, it will be the choices made by China in response to the opening salvos of the Trump 2.0 administration, as well as the constraining and balancing choices made by large middle powers in the region that will define the outcomes in 2025. Events are driven by the confluence of three trends — the shift from a unipolar world to a hybrid bipolar and multipolar world; the exhaustion of the liberal globalisation experiment; and the disruptive pressures stemming from the shocks of climate change, green tech and the AI revolution. These trends have turned the United States — the superpower at the heart of the current global order — into an insurgent against the system it created. After seven decades building a tight economic and security order that delivered prosperity and freedom for an ever-growing majority, the United States is now bent on destroying key pillars of that order. The policy fireworks following 20 January 2025 in Washington DC will not be minor adjustments. Rather, Trump’s promised wholesale trade war and US withdrawal from international institutions represent a frontal attack on the post-1919 efforts to promote peace and prosperity through international law, institutions, norms and cooperation. Trump’s calls for massive increases in military spending and threats against friendly countries represent a return to 19th century might-is-right diplomacy. Institutional inertia may initially constrain the Trump administration’s efforts, as they did in 2016–20. In Trump’s first term, the US–China trade war did not lead to the unravelling of globalisation because of the critical role played by connector countries. But the president-elect is certain to have a lot more leeway this time around. The more serious constraint will be the core divide at the heart of the incoming administration between trade and burden-sharing hawks and bipolar security hawks who are considering a Ronald Reagan-like military surge to defeat China. US policy toward key allies such as Japan and South Korea and toward strategic middle players such as Vietnam, will be fiercely disputed between the two groups. Incoherence may well hamper the thrust of revolution in US strategy. Elites in Indo Pacific countries struggle to predict and wrap their heads around the coming Trump storm. Most leaders in the Indo-Pacific remain committed to a liberal and rules-based order. They seek stability and only incremental policy change, even in the face of a Chinese revisionist agenda. US allies in the region wish to push back against Chinese threats, but in a way that maintains a global rules-based order. Leaders in the region are struggling to adjust psychologically to what is coming as it goes against decades of known interactions with the United States and habits of US leadership in building international institutions. Policy elites around the region are puzzled as to why the United States would want to destroy the greatest system of institutional and soft power that the world has seen. For the Indo-Pacific, the question is whether the region can hold on to its extraordinary gains from prosperity in the face of a US insurgency and a dangerous escalation in US–China relations. Clearly, the incoming US administration will be the first mover with salvos of trade tariffs, additional technology embargos against, demands to lift military spending by reluctant allies and possible new military deployments. Trump and some of his core business supporters, such as Elon Musk, Stephen Schwarzman or Peter Thiel could ultimately seek a deal with China. But given his foreign and security team and the positioning of the US system relative to China, this is unlikely The second mover will be China. China has three options — deflect, escalate or hedge. China’s ultimate choice is hard to predict, and may evolve according to the intensity of threat perceptions. The first option would be to take a page from Sun Tzu, the famed Chinese strategist, and avoid taking the bait. Instead, China could absorb the punches, lie low, stand for the liberal economic order and pursue diplomatic options. There would be tactical and political costs, but potential long-term strategic gains. Second, China could do what it did in 2018–22 and face off with the United States at every move. This would include security confrontation around key hot spots, more trade measures on critical minerals and key technologies and an escalation of diplomatic confrontation. Under Trump 1.0, this approach played well politically at home in the short-term but led to disastrous diplomatic outcomes. Indeed, through its wolf-warrior diplomacy, aggressive maritime deployments in the region and a senseless border war with India, China’s soft power was diminished greatly. Third, China could take indirect risk management actions through alternative institutions and bilateral engagement around the region, backed by a vast fiscal expansion at home to protect its economy. China’s recent actions, including the critical breakthrough in the border standoff with India, indicate that this might be the dominant approach that China is currently pursuing. China’s choice will be critical, as will be the response of third movers, namely the increasingly powerful middle powers of the Global South, such as India, Indonesia, Vietnam, and others in Central Asia, Africa, and the Middle East. Meanwhile, allied middle powers such as Japan, Korea, Australia and Canada will face great constraints under Trump 2.0 given their security dependence on the United States. But they may find ways, collectively, to restrain the more extreme impulses of the new administration. The stakes are high. Major unconventional moves by the United States or pre-emptive moves by China could well trigger a mega crisis in the South China Sea, the Taiwan Strait, East China Sea or on the Korean Peninsula. The outcomes are unknown. The United States will call the opening shots. China will set the nature of the game through its response. But third countries, as well as financial markets, will have a big influence on the shape of the post-Trump world, should they choose to use the leverage they now have.

Reevaluating Jimmy Carter’s Presidency – OpEd	The consensus among historians, journalists, and analysts has long been that President Jimmy Carter’s four-year presidency was a low point in a decent man’s century-long life. In fact, the implicit rap on Carter was that he brought a naïvete to public office that, at best, required a certain moral flexibility. Now that Carter has passed at the age of 100, this simplistic and conventional narrative of his presidency should be reassessed. Let’s not forget that the voters chose Carter’s principled approach in the 1976 election because of the long national disillusionment surrounding the JFK and MLK assassinations, LBJ and Nixon’s dishonest debacle in Vietnam, Nixon’s criminal activities during Watergate, and Gerald Ford’s trashing the rule of law by pardoning his predecessor even before charges were filed. Voters yearned to bring back some semblance of morality and honesty to government. Upon arriving in office, Carter was so squeaky clean that he refused to intimidate lawmakers or horse-trade with Congress to adopt policies on his agenda. If Republican Richard Nixon is regarded as the last progressive president before Barack Obama, Democrat Carter was the first conservative president since Calvin Coolidge. Carter laid the basis for more conservative policies before Ronald Reagan perfected the sales pitch. In addition to opposing interest groups feeding at the public trough, Carter championed limiting the federal government, cutting the federal budget, deregulating industries, and greater local and personal responsibility. He believed welfare eroded the family and the work ethic. In a herculean effort, Carter fully or partially deregulated four sectors of the economy: finance, communication, energy, and transportation, making them more efficient. At first, Carter contributed to the inflation left over from the Vietnam War and Nixon’s permissive monetary policy. However, Carter then appointed inflation hawk Paul Volcker as Fed chairman, who slammed on the monetary brakes, which caused a soft economy and then a recession but made possible the economic growth during Reagan’s administration. Analysts have rightly claimed that Reagan defeated Carter in the 1980 election because of stagflation (a sluggish economy and inflation) and the Iran hostage crisis. In the long term, Carter helped solve both of those crises, but at election time, the results weren’t in yet. In the hostage crisis, he didn’t fall victim to the hawks’ criticism that he should attack Iran, which would have gotten the hostages killed. Of course, at election time, this made him look weak. Reagan apparently succeeded in delaying the release of the hostages until after he was elected president, but Carter had negotiated their release. Even Carter’s substantial domestic achievements were eclipsed by his foreign policy successes. His negotiation of the Camp David peace accords and Israeli-Egyptian peace treaty is one of the few lasting peace agreements in the Middle East (even the later Oslo accords have failed). Disregarding the hawks, Carter ended the embarrassing U.S. colonial presence in the Canal Zone in the middle of sovereign Panama. Furthermore, Richard Nixon’s opening to China got all the attention, but the improvement of relations between the United States and China languished until Carter formally recognized China. Finally, Carter signed the SALT II agreement with the Soviets, which limited nuclear arms but was never ratified by the Senate. Nonetheless, both countries abided by its terms. In my book, Recarving Rushmore: Ranking the Presidents on Peace, Prosperity, and Liberty, which ranks the presidents on the end results of their policies, I found that no president was perfect. Carter was no exception. He overreacted to the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, believing that the Soviets were making a play for Persian Gulf oil. In reality, Moscow was trying to support its client government in Kabul and prevent a potential Islamist revolution from spreading into the Soviet Union. Yet, Carter boycotted the Olympics in Moscow, instituted a grain embargo that merely hurt American farm exports, and proclaimed the 'Carter Doctrine,' which stated the United States would use military force to secure its vital national interests (read: oil) in the Persian Gulf against an outside power trying to control it. In the end, although subsequent presidents could have disavowed the doctrine, especially after the Cold War ended, they unfortunately and eagerly embraced it by building up U.S. forces around the Gulf. This included the needless meddling in the Iran-Iraq War, including conducting the 'tanker war' in the Gulf against Iran and two Gulf Wars later against Iraq. Yet Carter and subsequent presidents should have realized that the best and cheapest way to obtain oil is by paying the world market price. Finally, Carter was so scarred by the Iranian Revolution’s oil price hikes that he fully embraced the canard of the need for U.S. energy independence and attempted to popularize expensive synthetic fuels via the boondoggle of the failed Synfuels Corporation. However, in sum, Carter can rightly be celebrated for his many heroic deeds after leaving the White House. Still, his presidential accomplishments in foreign and domestic policy should not be neglected—which they often are—because they vastly outstripped his more limited failures.

Capturing The Counterculture – OpEd	In a previous article, we traced the development of structures of oversight from Edison’s physical monopolies through Tavistock’s psychological operations, witnessing how corporate and banking interests and intelligence agencies converged to shape public consciousness. Now we’ll see how these methods reached new sophistication through popular culture, beginning with the British Invasion of the 1960s, which demonstrated how thoroughly orchestrated music movements could reshape society. The Beatles and Rolling Stones weren’t just bands—as researcher Mike Williams has extensively documented in his analysis of the British Invasion, their emergence marked the beginning of a systematic and profound cultural transformation. Williams notes that even the term ‘British Invasion’ itself was telling—a military metaphor for what was ostensibly a cultural phenomenon, perhaps Tavistock telegraphing its operation in plain sight. What seemed like playful marketing language actually described a carefully orchestrated infiltration of American youth culture. Through hundreds of hours of meticulously documented research, Williams builds an overwhelming case that the Beatles served as the spearhead of a broader agenda that used albums like Sgt. Pepper’s Lonely Hearts Club Band and the Rolling Stones’ Their Satanic Majesties Request to deliberately steer youth culture away from traditional values and family structures. What seems tame by today’s standards represented a calculated assault on social norms, initiating a cultural transformation that would accelerate over the following decades. Williams’ research goes further, presenting compelling evidence that the Beatles were essentially the first modern ‘boy band’—their image carefully crafted, their music largely written and performed by others. This revelation transforms our understanding of the British Invasion: what appeared to be an organic cultural phenomenon was in fact a meticulously orchestrated operation, with professional musicians and songwriters behind the scenes while the Beatles served as appealing frontmen for the massive social engineering project. As a lifelong music fan and Beatles devotee, confronting this evidence initially felt like sacrilege. Yet the pattern becomes undeniable once you allow yourself to see it. While debate continues over specific details like the Frankfurt School’s Theodor Adorno’s alleged involvement in crafting Beatles songs—a claim that has both passionate proponents and critics—what’s clear is that the operation bore all the hallmarks of Tavistock’s social engineering methodology. The deliberate crafting of a 'good boys/bad boys' (Beatles/Rolling Stones) dialectic offered controlled choices and allowed 'both sides' to advance the exact same desired cultural shifts. Andrew Loog Oldham masterfully crafted the Stones’ ‘bad boy’ image using public relations techniques reminiscent of Edward Bernays’ methods (the ‘father of public relations’ who pioneered mass psychological manipulation)—creating desire through psychological insight and manufacturing cultural rebellion as a marketable commodity. As Oldham himself acknowledged in his autobiography, he wasn’t just selling music but rather ‘rebellion, anarchy, and sex appeal wrapped up in a neat package’—deliberately creating a myth for people to buy into. His sophisticated understanding of cultural branding and mass psychology reflected the broader methods of influence that were reshaping media and public opinion during the era. Behind Mick Jagger’s rebellious persona lay an education at the London School of Economics, suggesting an insider with a deeper understanding of power systems at play. This assiduous development of image extended to the performers’ inner circle—notably Jagger’s girlfriend Marianne Faithfull, herself a successful singer and socialite, whose father was an MI6 officer who interrogated Heinrich Himmler and whose maternal grandfather had Habsburg Dynasty roots. The Stones’ finances were managed by Prince Rupert Loewenstein, a Bavarian aristocrat and private banker whose noble lineage and financial circles intersected with the Rothschild dynasty—another example of establishment figures behind seemingly anti-establishment movements. Even the record label itself fit the pattern: EMI (Electric and Musical Industries), which signed both the Beatles and the Rolling Stones, began as a military electronics company. During World War II, EMI’s research and development contributed significantly to Britain’s radar program and other military technologies. This fusion of military-industrial interests with cultural production was no coincidence—EMI’s technical expertise in electronics and communications would prove valuable in both warfare and the mass distribution of cultural content. These carefully managed British experiments in cultural control would soon find their perfect laboratory in America, where an unlikely convergence would reshape youth culture and the family unit forever. Britain had pioneered these methods of cultural orchestration through music, embedding intelligence ties into the British Invasion, but America would refine and scale these techniques to unprecedented levels. The Laurel Canyon Laboratory In the hills above Hollywood between 1965-1975, as journalist Dave McGowan first documented, an extraordinary phenomenon: the emergence of a new music scene centered in Laurel Canyon, where an improbable concentration of military and intelligence family connections converged to reshape American youth culture. This convergence was no accident—as anti-war sentiment grew strongest in academic circles, this military-intelligence nexus helped redirect potential resistance into a drug-saturated counterculture focused on ‘dropping out’ rather than organized opposition to the war. The military/intelligence connections within Laurel Canyon were striking. Jim Morrison’s father commanded the fleet during the Gulf of Tonkin incident that launched the Vietnam War. Frank Zappa’s father was a chemical warfare specialist at Edgewood Arsenal, a key human experimentation research site. David Crosby, scion of the Van Cortlandts and Van Rensselaers—American royalty—descended from a lineage of political power that included senators, Supreme Court justices, and Revolutionary generals. James Taylor, a descendant of Massachusetts Bay Colony settlers, grew up in a family shaped by academia and military service, including his father’s role in Operation Deep Freeze in Antarctica. Sharon Tate, daughter of Army intelligence officer Lt. Col. Paul Tate, moved through these circles before her death. Dennis Hopper, whose father was OSS, directed Easy Rider and starred in it with Peter Fonda, packaging counterculture rebellion for mainstream consumption. The transformation was systematic—from the post-war optimism and unity embodied by JFK’s New Frontier to the calculated fragmentation that followed his assassination. This mass shared public trauma, perfectly suited to Tavistock’s methods of social engineering through psychological shock, marked the end of genuine optimism. The Boomers, raised with unprecedented prosperity and inspired by Kennedy’s vision of a New Frontier, saw their potential for authentic social and political transformation redirected into carefully crafted cultural movements that would shape subsequent generations. These pervasive connections between military-intelligence figures and countercultural leaders—from Morrison’s admiral father to Zappa’s chemical warfare specialist parent to Crosby’s political dynasty—reveal a clear pattern: the systematic co-opting of youth culture by establishment powers. The timing of Laurel Canyon’s emergence as a counterculture hub coincided with the CIA’s MK-Ultra’s mind control program’s peak years of operation. This was no coincidence. The same organizations experimenting with consciousness control through chemical methods, such as LSD, were simultaneously embedding themselves in cultural programming efforts. The convergence of these strategies in Laurel Canyon laid the groundwork for what would soon become the full-scale fusion of music and psychedelics—a calculated effort to thwart organically arising political resistance by channeling it into a movement centered on personal transcendence rather than effective collective action. Programming the Revolution Building on the psychological and cultural groundwork established in Laurel Canyon, the fusion of music and psychedelics marked the apex of consciousness manipulation. This phase of mass cultural programming strategically redirected genuine political resistance into artificially managed cultural channels, steering dissent away from organized movements and into fragmented, drug-fueled withdrawal. Even the Grateful Dead, the quintessential embodiment of California counterculture, which cultivated a devoted following that defined a generation’s search for community and meaning, were intricately tied to mechanisms of societal control. Their manager Alan Trist, was not only the son of Tavistock founder Eric Trist but was also present at the pivotal car accident that killed Jerry Garcia’s childhood friend, Paul Speegle—a tragedy that set Garcia on the path to forming the band. Garcia’s military connection adds another layer of intrigue: after stealing his mother’s car in 1960, he was offered the choice between prison or military service. Despite repeatedly going AWOL from Fort Ord and the Presidio of San Francisco, Garcia received only a general discharge—an unusually lenient outcome that raises questions about potential official connections. Meanwhile, the band’s lyricist, Robert Hunter, participated in government-funded LSD experiments tied to the broader psychedelic research of the era. Serving as the house band for the CIA-connected Merry Pranksters, the Grateful Dead played a key role in steering anti-war sentiment toward psychedelic retreat, aligning the counterculture with state-sponsored agendas in ways that warrant deeper scrutiny. This alignment of counterculture and establishment interests proved wildly effective. As anti-war sentiment grew strongest in academic circles—where genuine resistance could threaten structural power—the emergence of the hippie movement effectively redirected opposition into a youth counterculture saturated with drugs and focused on escapism rather than organized resistance. As the war machine escalated operations in Vietnam, young Americans were guided toward cultural dissolution—a perfect formula for neutralizing meaningful peace movements. The same military-intelligence complex that drove the war was simultaneously molding the culture that would prevent effective resistance to it. Timothy Leary’s role in this transformation was crucial. Before becoming the psychedelic movement’s most influential voice, he had been a West Point cadet and would later serve as an FBI informant. His advocacy for psychedelics emerged alongside the CIA’s own exploration of substances like LSD during the MK-Ultra era. John Lennon later reflected on this confluence with biting irony: ‘We must always remember to thank the CIA and the Army for LSD. That’s what people forget…They invented LSD to control people and what they did was give us freedom.’ This seeming backfire of the program masked a deeper success—dismantling potential resistance through the promotion of chemical disengagement. By popularizing the mantra 'Turn on, tune in, drop out,' Leary advanced this agenda. This redirection not only fragmented youth opposition, but weakened their ties to traditional support systems such as families and communities—exactly the kind of social atomization that would make future control easier. The overlap between government-funded LSD research and the emerging music scene was far from coincidental. While MK-Ultra explored chemical means of consciousness control, the music industry was simultaneously perfecting cultural methods—with bands like the Grateful Dead bridging both worlds through their ties to government-backed LSD experiments and the rapidly growing counterculture. Redirecting Resistance Patterns of government leadership connections to musical movements weren’t limited to the psychedelic era. As popular music evolves through new genres and decades, the same underlying relationships continue between establishment power and cultural influence. In the hardcore punk scene, figures like Ian MacKaye (Minor Threat, Fugazi) whose father was in the White House Press Corps and present at JFK’s assassination, would ironically become one of the most fiercely independent figures in music, pioneering the DIY ethic through his label Dischord Records. His autonomous approach seemed to resist the system, yet his establishment connections highlight a broader pattern. Even in alternative rock, Dave Grohl’s father served as special assistant to Senator Robert Taft Jr. during the Reagan administration. Madonna, who became the defining pop star of the 1980s, was the daughter of Tony Ciccone, an engineer who worked on military projects for Chrysler Defense and General Dynamics Land Systems. Having parents involved in government, defense, or intelligence work doesn’t imply wrongdoing by these artists; however, these examples represent just a fraction of the documented connections between counterculture figures and power structures. The pattern extends across decades and genres, with hundreds of similar cases suggesting not coincidence but systematic design—from jazz musicians backed by banking families to punk rockers with government connections to mainstream pop stars from defense industry families. These pervasive ties raise fundamental questions about the relationship between ruling class power and cultural influence. Perhaps no single family better exemplifies the deliberate fusion of intelligence operations and cultural production than the Copelands. Miles Copeland Jr., who helped found the CIA and orchestrated coups across the Middle East, detailed the psychological strategies behind this integration in his book The Game of Nations. In that revealing text, Copeland explicitly outlined the manipulation methodology that would shape both intelligence operations and popular culture: 'In the world of covert operations, nothing is what it appears to be. The key is not just controlling actions, but controlling the perception of actions.' His son Miles Copeland III became a key figure in the music industry, managing influential acts like The Police (with brother Stewart as drummer) and founding I.R.S. Records. Through I.R.S., Copeland would shape alternative music’s mainstream emergence, managing acts like R.E.M. fronted by Michael Stipe, another military child. The Copelands represent a crucial bridge between covert operations and cultural production, demonstrating how intelligence methodologies evolved from direct intervention to subtle influence through entertainment. Their success in blending counterculture appeal with commercial viability became a template for future narrative sculpting. This pattern of cultural engineering follows historically consistent principles. Artists and movements aligning with intelligence objectives receive overwhelming promotion, while genuine resistance faces suppression or elimination. The tragic ends of figures like Phil Ochs and John Lennon, both under documented FBI surveillance for their direct challenges to state power, contrast notably with the career trajectories of those who presented rebellion within more conventional bounds. Manufacturing Gender While music proved to be the perfect laboratory for testing mass consciousness control, these methods would soon extend far beyond entertainment. Nowhere was this more evident than in the deliberate reshaping of gender roles and family structures, with the goal of transforming intimate aspects of human identity and relationships. The strategic calibration of feminist narratives emerged as a particularly powerful example, with intelligence agencies actively shaping gender politics through media and organized activism. Gloria Steinem, who acknowledged working with CIA-funded organizations like the Independent Research Service during the 1950s and 1960s, exemplifies this intersection. Her Ms. Magazine, launched in 1972, merged feminist ideals with carefully curated messaging, while Steinem later admitted to participating in CIA-funded events aimed at influencing feminist movements during the Cold War. Nicholas Rockefeller’s candid admission to his friend Aaron Russo underscored how women’s liberation was strategically funded to expand state and corporate control—doubling the tax base through workforce participation, weakening family bonds through increased divorce rates, and increasing state influence over children via state-run childcare. During this same period, influential shows like That Girl and The Mary Tyler Moore Show helped normalize these very changes, popularizing the archetype of the independent, career-focused woman in ways that notably aligned with systemic objectives. This transformation was systematic. Women’s magazines shifted from primarily domestic content to increasingly career-focused messaging. Cosmopolitan’sdramatic evolution under Helen Gurley Brown’s editorship in the 1960s exemplified this transformation, normalizing not just women’s workforce participation but also promoting sexual liberation outside traditional marriage—a dual agenda that aligned perfectly with corporate interests in expanding both the labor pool and consumer base. This deliberate shaping of gender movements extends to the present, with Tavistock Institute continuing to form modern narratives. From shifting women’s magazines toward career messaging in the 1960s to today’s relentless promotion of evolving gender narratives, these movements consistently align with agenda-driven objectives. Commodifying Resistance The techniques perfected in Laurel Canyon for transforming genuine resistance into profitable cultural products would evolve into increasingly complex frameworks of control. From the Grateful Dead’s pioneering of festival culture to modern corporate music festivals like Coachella, authentic counterculture spaces would be systematically converted into commercial enterprises. By the 1990s, these methods had evolved into systematic co-option of authentic resistance. While the Boomers experienced the shift from optimism to disillusionment, Generation X faced a more highly refined mechanism that commodified alienation itself. Kurt Cobain’s trajectory from authentic voice of generational discontent to MTV commodity demonstrated how the apparatus of influence had evolved—no longer just redirecting resistance but transforming it into profitable cultural products. This commodification extended beyond music—brands like Nike transformed anti-establishment street culture into global marketing campaigns through figures like Michael Jordan and Charles Barkley. The era’s 'alternative' culture became so thoroughly commercialized that mall retailers like Hot Topic emerged to sell pre-packaged 'rebellion' to suburban teens, turning countercultural symbols into standardized retail offerings. The comprehensive hijack of underground music scenes demonstrates how thoroughly the power structure perfected cultural manipulation. Just as intelligence agencies had redirected 60s counterculture, corporations developed advanced methods for capturing and commodifying organic dissidence. The Vans Warped Tour transformed punk rock—once a genuine expression of youth rebellion—into a traveling corporate marketing platform, complete with sponsored stages and branded merchandise. Red Bull’s music academy program went further, creating what amounts to an early warning system for potentially disruptive cultural movements. By identifying emerging underground genres and artists early, they could redirect authentic cultural expression into commercial channels before it developed genuine revolutionary potential. Even the most fiercely independent scenes proved vulnerable to this system. Major labels created fake indie imprints to maintain underground credibility while controlling distribution. Tobacco companies specifically targeted underground clubs and raves, understanding that subcultural credibility could be converted into market share. The pattern established in Laurel Canyon—of transforming authentic resistance into profitable products—had evolved into a science of cultural capture. Just as the Grateful Dead’s government connections helped establish templates for controlled cultural spaces, modern music festivals serve as data collection points and behavioral laboratories. The evolution from Acid Tests to algorithmically curated festival lineups demonstrates how thoroughly the framework of influence has digitized. The Celebrity Machine The approach perfected through Gloria Steinem—channeling authentic social movements through carefully managed spokespersons—would evolve into today’s meticulously crafted model of celebrity activism. This algorithmic management extends beyond content to talent itself, with platforms increasingly determining not just what succeeds but which voices rise to prominence. The strategic positioning of celebrity activists demonstrates how thoroughly institutional interests have penetrated entertainment. George Clooney’s involvement with the Council on Foreign Relations, continuing a multigenerational family connection to power that began with his father Nick Clooney’s Cold War-era journalism, exemplifies how these entertainment-establishment ties often span generations. Angelina Jolie’s evolution from Hollywood rebel to UNHCR Special Envoyexemplifies how countercultural appeal can be redirected toward state objectives. Similarly, Leonardo DiCaprio’s environmental advocacy—promoted through WEF platforms while maintaining a private jet lifestyle—shows how even legitimate concerns are shaped to align with elite frameworks. Similarly, Sean Penn’s pattern of high-profile crisis interventions—from Hurricane Katrina to Haiti, Venezuela’s Hugo Chávez, and most recently Ukraine—raises questions about selective platform access. While establishment-aligned celebrities receive endless amplification, those questioning official narratives often find themselves swiftly marginalized or silenced. Like Steinem’s CIA-backed feminist organizing, modern celebrity activism often aligns remarkably well with ruling class objectives. The path from counterculture figure to establishment voice has become a repeatable template. Marketing Modern Culture Modern equivalents of countercultural programming demonstrate how these systems remain highly effective. From the entertainment industry to luxury fashion houses, today’s cultural engineers craft narratives that align with elite interests under the guise of progress. This pattern of coordinated societal restructuring extends across multiple industries and platforms. The fashion industry’s role became explicit through incidents like Balenciaga’s controversial 2022 campaign featuring children with bondage imagery. While public outrage focused on the immediate controversy, the incident revealed how fashion houses increasingly push narratives about gender, sexuality, and social norms. Just as the Stones and Beatles channeled rebellion into acceptable forms, today’s cultural architects craft carefully calibrated resistance. Billie Eilish’s themes of alienation provide Gen Z with a commercially viable outlet for discontent, while Lizzo’s challenge to conventional beauty standards align with corporate interests in promoting pharmaceuticals, wellness products, and consumer goods tailored to diverse audiences. Even the most commercially successful artists reflect these establishment connections—Taylor Swift’s family ties to banking dynasties, including her grandfather’s role in the Federal Reserve, demonstrate how thoroughly embedded these relationships remain. As researcher Mike Benz has documented, NATO’s own training materials identify Swift as a key figure for message amplification, revealing how bureaucratic influence operates in the digital age. When Health Becomes Ideology The promotion of unhealthy lifestyles serves multiple systemic purposes. A population focused on ‘body positivity’ while struggling with obesity and chronic health conditions becomes both more profitable for pharmaceutical companies and more dependent on institutional systems. This agenda manifests in how unhealthiness is celebrated as progressive and inclusive. Corporate campaigns and media portray obese body types and unhealthy lifestyles as empowering, normalizing behaviors that in most cases will lead to poor long-term health. For example, Cosmopolitan featured a February 2021 cover proclaiming, 'This is Healthy!' alongside imagery of unconventional body types, while Nike introduced plus-size mannequins in their flagship stores, generating significant media buzz. These efforts were celebrated as milestones of inclusivity, solidifying the ‘body positivity’ movement as a cultural touchstone. At the same time, fitness and working out are increasingly framed as symbols of extremism. Articles and think pieces link workout culture and physical health with dangerous ideologies, painting personal discipline as a marker of political radicalization. This patently absurd narrative subtly reframes exercise not as wellness and personal discipline, but as symbols of far-right extremism. This deliberate inversion mirrors Orwell’s dystopia: health becomes harmful, while unhealthiness becomes virtuous. By reframing physical well-being and self-improvement as forms of deviance, these narratives distort societal values, aligning them with complacency as a moral ideal. The seeds of this shift were planted during the Covid-19 pandemic, where public health policies largely ignored foundational wellness practices. Instead of promoting sunshine, exercise, proper nutrition, or weight loss—despite obesity being the highest risk factor—official messaging emphasized isolation, masking, and compliance. In the post-pandemic era, these themes have evolved further, reframing personal health and discipline as not just unnecessary, but as politically dangerous. The treatment of health and fitness reveals a calculated agenda—promoting unhealthy lifestyles while demonizing physical discipline serves the same end: creating a more dependent and controllable population. This isn’t contradiction but convergence: both approaches push people away from self-reliance and toward institutional dependence. This isn’t random contradiction but calculated deception: just as Tavistock learned to use psychological vulnerability to reshape consciousness, modern organizations deploy health narratives to create new forms of social control. ​​This systematic reshaping of health consciousness parallels an even broader transformation: the redefinition of citizenship and national identity itself. Just as physical fitness was reframed as extremism, traditional notions of patriotism and national pride would be carefully reconstructed to serve power structures. The entertainment industry, having perfected techniques for modifying health narratives, would deploy these same methods to reshape public understanding of loyalty and national purpose. Shaping Patriotism From the fitness industry to Hollywood, narratives are crafted to ensure compliance with systemic ideals, often echoing tactics first developed to reshape public sentiment during the isolationist era discussed earlier. Just as J.P. Morgan’s acquisition of newspapers in 1917 helped frame America’s reluctant entry into global conflicts as a moral imperative, television series, streaming shows, and films all shape public perceptions of military action by glamorizing its necessity and heroism. Modern blockbusters like Top Gun: Maverick demonstrate how studios must submit scripts to the Department of Defense for approval, with military-mandated changes required to access essential equipment and filming locations. The Pentagon’s influence extends deep into the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Captain Marvelrequired extensive script revisions to secure military support, transforming the protagonist from a civilian pilot into an Air Force officer. Similar military oversight shaped Iron Man, with the Pentagon demanding script approval in exchange for access to bases and equipment. These aren’t just product placement deals—they represent systematic narrative control at the heart of modern entertainment. Other films, such as Zero Dark Thirty and Argo, have been produced in direct collaboration with the CIA, promoting narratives aligned with military interests. The NFL provides another striking example of how sports leagues function as extensions of the entertainment network, leveraging emotional narratives to shape public sentiment. Military flyovers, player tributes to soldiers, and Super Bowl advertisements are often presented as organic celebrations of national pride. However, these moments frequently stem from paid partnerships with the Department of Defense, blurring the lines between authentic patriotism and orchestrated messaging. Just as blockbuster films glamorize military action, sports leagues normalize the connection between patriotism and military service, reinforcing regimented narratives under the guise of entertainment. While it is true that genuine patriotism and respect for service members reflect authentic American values, the entertainment industry’s careful curation of military narratives serves a deeper purpose: normalizing perpetual foreign interventions without encouraging deeper understanding of these conflicts and their terrible consequences. By conflating support for troops with unquestioning acceptance of military action, these cultural products manufacture consent for engagements most citizens neither understand nor meaningfully debate. The transformation of complex geopolitical realities into simplified hero narratives helps ensure public compliance without public comprehension. Even ostensibly critical movies like The Bourne Films and Charlie Wilson’s War blend fact and fiction in ways that subtly glorify intelligence work and interventionist policies. This narrative crafting ensures that skepticism of these organizations remains constrained, reinforcing a sense of patriotism tied to state ideals and policies. Alongside these cinematic examples, the video game industry has become a powerful tool for behavioral influence strategies. Franchises like Call of Duty have embedded pro-military narratives in their immersive gameplay, serving as advanced recruitment tools for the armed forces. While Hollywood and gaming recruit audiences into the machinery of war, contemporary music has been weaponized in a way similar to the examples of jazz diplomacy in the 1950s, the 'British Invasion,' and Laurel Canyon musicians discussed before. Nowhere is this more striking than in hip-hop, where the genre’s transformation from protest music to ‘gangsta rap’ illuminates how power brokers co-opt authentic voices to align with the very corporate and political interests that are actively working to subjugate them. Prison Profit Pipeline Hip-hop’s rise in the 1980s coincided with the crack epidemic, a devastating chapter in American history exacerbated by the CIA’s involvement with Contra rebels in Nicaragua—a link exposed by journalist Gary Webb in his groundbreaking investigation. What began as a genre documenting the effects of systemic oppression and the scourge of drugs in Black communities soon became commodified. The raw narratives of survival and resistance were transformed into glamorized depictions of drug culture, aligning neatly with authority-driven interests that perpetuate profitable cycles of incarceration and control. The music industry’s real agenda becomes explicit through figures like hip-hop icon Ice Cube, who revealed how record labels and private prisons deliberately aligned their interests. 'It seems really kind of suspicious,' Cube noted, 'that the records that come out are really geared to push people towards that prison industry.' His assertion that 'the same people who own the [record labels] own the prisons' exposed the strategic development of content to feed incarceration systems. As Cube explained, 'a lot of dope songs people like are made by a group of people telling rappers what to say,' replacing organic artistic expression with carefully developed narratives. This deliberate shift funneled anger and discontent into self-destructive behaviors, perpetuating cycles of incarceration that aligned neatly with corporate interests. The prison-industrial complex demonstrated how systemic control could merge profit motives with social programming. This fusion of surveillance, behavioral modification, and economic coercion would become the template for digital oversight framework, where algorithms track behavior, shape choices, and enforce compliance through economic penalties—just at global scale. What record labels achieved manually in hip-hop—identifying, redirecting, and commodifying authentic expression—would become the template for digital control. Just as executives learned to transform street culture into profitable products, algorithms would soon automate this process at global scale. The transformation from protest to profit wasn’t limited to music—it became the blueprint for how all cultural resistance would be managed in the digital age. In the next article, we’ll see how these cultural shaping techniques have been automated and perfected through digital systems. The methods of cultural control evolved from physical to psychological, from local to global, from manual to automated. What began with Edison’s hardware monopolies and reached its analog peak in the manipulation of popular culture would find its ultimate expression in digital systems. The transformation from mechanical to algorithmic control represents not just a technological evolution, but a quantum leap in the capability to shape human consciousness.

China Could Test Limits Of Hungary’s Foreign Policy Of ‘Principle...	Trump has nominated three officials with ties to Hungary for key national security posts, but the anti-China bent of his team could still pose a problem as the Orban administration tries to deepen cooperation with Beijing. By Marc Roscoe Loustau The list of Donald Trump nominees with ties to Hungary includes three men set to play key roles in setting the new US president’s national intelligence strategy: John Ratcliffe is Trump’s pick for director of Central Intelligence, Matthew Whitaker is the nominee for ambassador to NATO, and Sebastian Gorka will fill a senior counterterrorism position. All three have ties to Hungary, while Ratcliffe and Whitaker have said Orban’s 'principled realism' is a model for US foreign policy under Trump. In October 2022, Ratcliffe (with his protogé Cliff Sims) published a Wall Street Journal op-ed castigating the Biden administration’s current ambassador to Hungary, David Pressman, for criticising Orban’s ties to Russia. Ratcliffe pointed out that Orban was only trying to keep Russian natural gas flowing to Hungary; after all, the Fidesz government had taken in large numbers of Ukrainian refugees and strengthened NATO deployments in the country. Ratcliffe also criticised a US State Department funding program to promote diversity, which he called 'woke ideology'. Instead, he urged the State Department 'to affirm Western values'. Ratcliffe praised Orban’s 'principled realism' approach, a foreign policy guided by both national interests as well as the moral values espoused by both Orban and Trump. In April 2024, Whitaker headlined the international edition of the Conservative Political Action Conference in Budapest, a gathering of US Republicans and right-wing politicians from around the world. He used a primetime interview to praise the notion of principled leadership, which he said the CPAC host Orban embodied. Whitaker commended politicians who 'stand up for something', according to a report in the government-friendly hirado.hu news outlet, because the principle they represent is part of their identity. Sebastian Gorka, the child of Hungarian emigres to the UK, has the strongest ties to Hungary. He moved back to Hungary for his graduate studies. In the wake of 9/11, he wrote a controversial thesis that, according to critics, equated Islam with terrorism. But Orban’s hyper-masculine governing style – the Hungarian prime minister likes referring to himself as a 'street fighter' – has also won Gorka’s praise. Gorka first gained notoriety in 2017 for declaring that 'alpha males are back' and arguing that American foreign policy should be used to project hyper-masculine power. On China, however, these potential Trump administration officials do not see eye to eye with Orban, particularly Ratcliffe who is set to be the Trump administration’s chief China hawk. Belt up After the EU threatened to cut off funding to Hungary over concerns about the state of the rule of law since the Orban government took power in 2014, the prime minister compensated for this by inviting Chinese infrastructural and industrial investment. In 2014, Hungary announced with much fanfare that China’s government would build a Budapest-Belgrade high-speed rail line as part of China’s Belt and Road infrastructure financing initiative (BRI), which Beijing is using to extend its influence internationally. In 2015, following a meeting with high-ranking Chinese officials in Beijing, the Prime Minister’s Office issued a statement declaring that the BRI 'coincides entirely with Hungarian national interests'. The investment cooperation has continued over the last decade. In May 2024, Chinese President Xi Jinping visited Budapest to sign bilateral agreements to expand green energy investments, on top of an EV battery manufacturing plant that’s already under construction in Debrecen. But the same Trump administration officials who have praised Hungarian values also see China’s BRI as a threat to US interests. During a 2020 hearing before the US Senate, Ratcliffe raised the alarm that the BRI was an economic and security threat. Legal provisions written into BRI contracts, Ratcliffe warned, require Chinese construction companies to collect intelligence. 'These are all spokes of the same initiative and that is for China to supplant us as the world’s superpower,' Ratcliffe testified. While Hungary is trying to advance China’s economic involvement in Europe, Ratcliffe prefers policies that isolate China in response to such threats. For example, Ratcliffe led a Heritage Foundation panel that produced a July 2024 report pushing a controversial theory that Chinese government-run labs produced the COVID-19 virus. Regardless of the report’s factual credibility, the commission, with Ratcliffe as chairman, advocated isolating China on a number of fronts. The report recommended passage of the BIOSECURE ACT that would decouple supply chains from Chinese state-backed companies and better enforcement of Executive Orders restricting US biotechnology research investment into China. Limited power and influence? Small states like Hungary rarely receive knowledgeable recognition from officials at the top levels of America’s national intelligence establishment, but it’s unclear how much influence Ratcliffe, Whitaker and Gorka will have. Gorka had been angling for the influential position as deputy national security adviser, which has a broader purview than the position of counterterrorism chief. His designated role could be a symbolic slap in the face; at best, it’s a lateral move for someone who has wanted to expand beyond counterterrorism work. As for Whitaker, Trump seems to have only one NATO agenda: to weaken the military alliance. Whitaker’s main role will be to play debt collector, since Trump is singularly obsessed with member states being in arrears. Ratcliffe’s CIA will not have the autonomy that it enjoyed when the George W. Bush and Obama administrations were focused on counterterrorism. Threats posed by Russia and China have redirected attention to state actors. In this arena, the CIA shares authority and expertise with the State Department, the Pentagon and the Director of Intelligence. It’s unclear how much direct influence Hungary could exert on a friend in the CIA if, by definition, Ratcliffe’s decision-making will require working with other top officials who may not have his positive view of Orban’s foreign policy approach. Orban’s 'principled realism' might well become US foreign policy doctrine, but the Trump team’s hawkish China policy could test the contradiction – between values and interests – contained in this term.

Ron Paul: D.O.G.E. End The Global Engagement Center – OpEd	In the book Crisis and Leviathan, libertarian thinker Robert Higgs pointed out that the state uses crises to ratchet up its power and control over citizens. With each new 'crisis' – often directly or indirectly caused by the state itself – government grows and our freedom shrinks. The root cause of the September 11, 2001 attacks was US interventionism, for example. As I said in a presidential debate a few years later, they came over here because we were over there. But instead of looking to that root cause it was determined that the real problem was not enough government. So, taking advantage of the crisis, Congress created a Director of National Intelligence, a Department of Homeland Security, and passed the Patriot Act. The 'Russiagate' crisis was invented by the Hillary Clinton campaign as a dirty trick to use against Donald Trump in the 2016 election campaign. It may not have defeated Trump, but it hobbled his presidency. The result of this manufactured claim that the Russians (and Chinese and Iranians, etc) are meddling in our affairs and manipulating our elections is that the federal government determined that the First Amendment no longer applies to us. They have decided that consuming certain media should not be allowed – for our own safety – so they have denied Americans the right to access media from countries the US government considers 'enemies.' In the name of fighting imaginary foreign meddling in our elections, it’s Americans who find their rights curtailed. They even created an entire government entity within the State Department – the 'Global Engagement Center' (GEC) – right after the phony 'Russiagate' operation was launched to 'recognize, understand, expose, and counter foreign state and non-state propaganda and disinformation efforts aimed at undermining or influencing the policies, security, or stability of the United States…' As it turned out, this 'Center' was not at all about countering foreign 'bad actors' but about silencing Americans who held views the powers-that-be in DC do not like. As Roger Kimbell wrote in a recent article about the GEC, 'Because the GEC could not operate against Americans directly, it did so indirectly by funding entities like the British-based Global Disinformation Index, which compiled a list of publications and individuals that said things the regime did not like. That list was consulted by advertisers wary of winding up on the wrong side of the government…. Result? Millions of dollars of ad revenue dried up, imperiling the future of those outlets.' And, as Kimbell further points out, even when they were caught red handed violating our rights they just hid the beast within leviathan. Thus, even though funding for the GEC was cut from Speaker Johnson’s 1,500 page omnibus spending bill, the beast lives on. The Biden Administration has re-named the Center the 'Counter Foreign Information Manipulation and Interference (R/FIMI) Hub' and retained the same old GEC employees. Now that this switch has been exposed, however, there is a chance – for once – to finally kill a bad government program. Elon Musk was one of the first to expose the evil of the GEC and as it turns out he is now working with the Department of Government Efficiency (D.O.G.E.) to cut this exact kind of government overreach. No more hiding government censorship programs with new names and new branding. Not another dollar should be spent censoring Americans!

Stock Market And Budget Projections: Do The Numbers Add Up? – OpE...	It’s been a while since we’ve had Mr. Arithmetic here, but with Donald Trump coming back to the White House, we may need him around. The immediate reason for consulting his expertise is the projections for big stock market gains in 2025. It seems the median forecast is for the S&P 500 to rise by roughly 10 percent over the course of 2025 from its year-end 2024 level. Many are forecasting considerably larger gains. Basically, the story is that all the good news for corporate profits in recent years will continue and the stock market will keep going higher at close to the pace it has been rising. There is a problem in this story that seems to be getting little attention. The price-to-earnings (PE) ratio for the S&P 500 is already near the peaks that it hit in the 1990s bubble. Robert Shiller’s cyclically adjusted level stands at more than 38 to 1. (The cyclical adjustment compares current prices to inflation-adjusted profits over the last decade.) This is more than twice the long-period average and only slightly below the peaks hit in the late 1990s bubble. The question I asked Mr. Arithmetic is whether we can expect to see 10 percent returns in 2025, like the median analyst projected. He immediately suggested that we have to look to profit growth. While no one knows exactly how much profits will grow in 2025, we can look for forecasts. A good starting place here is the Congressional Budget Office (CBO). Its most recent projections showed corporate profits growing 3.5 percent in 2025. This means that if we’re starting from a PE ratio of 38 to 1, with a 10 percent stock rise and 3.5 percent profit growth, we will have a PE ratio of over 40 at the end of 2025, even closer to the peak of the nineties bubble. The picture doesn’t look any better going further out. The CBO projections show average profit growth over the next decade of just 2.7 percent annually, only slightly higher than the 2.3 percent average projected inflation rate, using the Consumer Price Index. This means that, assuming the projections are right, if the PE ratio were to just remain at its near record high, and not reach new records, the average real increase in stock prices would be just 0.4 percent annually. Even adding in 2.5 percent for dividends and share buybacks, this would still give a real return of around 3.0 percent, less than a percentage point above the 2.2 percent return investors would get on an inflation-indexed government bond. It’s possible that investors would be willing to hold stocks for returns that are only slightly higher than an entirely risk-free asset, but historically that has not been the case. The returns from stock have averaged more than 4.0 percentage points higher than the returns on government bonds. It may also be the case that we will see the PE ratios rise to new records and just keep rising. Anything is possible, but that scenario also does not seem likely. What If the Projections are Wrong? CBO projections deserve to be taken seriously, but they are not written in stone. CBO has been wrong in the past and they will surely be wrong in the future. It is worth noting that CBO is rarely an outlier. While their projections are model driven, they try to produce numbers that put them near the middle of professional forecasts. The point is to produce numbers that can reasonably be taken as a basis for policy. CBO is not trying to stake out an outlier position. With this in mind, it is still possible that profits will grow considerably more rapidly than CBO has projected, but that means the consensus in the profession is likely off the mark, not just CBO. There are two ways that profits can grow more rapidly than CBO projected. The first is if there is a redistribution from wages to profits. (There can also be a redistribution from the government sector to higher after-tax profits, as a result of lower corporate tax rates. I’ll come back to this.) There already has been a redistribution from wages to profits of more than 4.0 percentage points since the turn of the century. Roughly half of this has been since the pandemic. The CBO projections show some shift back to wages, with the profit share of national income being 1.2 percentage points lower in 2034 than it was 2024. Perhaps this reversal won’t take place and the profit share stays roughly at the current level. In that case, profits will rise at an average nominal rate of 3.0 percent over the next decade. That would make the real return from holding stock, assuming a constant PE ratio, of 3.2 percent, roughly a percentage point above the rate on inflation-indexed government bonds. That still doesn’t sound very attractive. It is possible that we will see a further shift from wages to profits, but this seems unlikely barring major changes (i.e. much higher unemployment) in the shape of the labor market. It seems the possibilities for much more rapid profit growth due to a redistribution from wages are limited. The other way that profits can grow more rapidly is if the economy grows considerably more rapidly than CBO projects. CBO currently is projecting an average annual growth rate of 1.8 percent over the next decade. This is lower than the historical rate because CBO projects very slow labor force growth due to the retirement of the baby boom cohorts. With immigration likely to be restricted for the foreseeable future, any substantial increase in GDP growth above CBO’s current projections would almost certainly have to come from faster than expected productivity growth. This is not impossible given the impact of AI and other recent innovations. Also, we have been seeing faster than projected productivity growth in recent quarters, although these data are highly erratic so that may not tell us much about the future. Suppose that productivity growth averaged 1.0 percentage points higher than CBO now projects and that translates into 1.0 percentage point more rapid annual GDP and profit growth. That would translate into 3.7 percent annual profit growth or 1.4 percent real growth. Assuming the PE ratio stays constant at its near-record high, this would mean real returns from holding stock of roughly 3.9 percent annually, 1.7 percentage points above the return on inflation-indexed government bonds. That still is well below the historic gap, but we’re getting closer. However, it is also worth noting that if we sustain this more rapid pace of productivity growth for a decade, the economy would look very different in 2034 than is currently projected. Most immediately, wages would be considerably higher in 2034 than is now projected. Instead of real wage growth of 1.2 percent annually, assuming income shares are constant, real wages would grow at a rate of 2.2 percent a year. In 2034 the average worker in 2034 would have a real wage more than 26 percent higher than the average worker does today. This would amount to the most rapid sustained real wage gains since the Golden Age from 1947 to 1973. That would be a pretty positive story. It would also mean that, barring major changes in policy, the debt-to-GDP ratio and the interest burden of the debt would not be rising. If this more rapid rate of real wage growth was sustained, it would eliminate most of the projected long-term (75-year) shortfall in the Social Security trust fund. This also would show clearly that funding Social Security is a political problem, not an economic problem. Suppose real wages are 26 percent higher than in 2034 than they are today. Would anyone really say that workers in 2034 would have much grounds for complaint if the Social Security tax was 1.0 percentage point higher than it is now, leaving their after-tax real wage 25.0 percent higher in 2034, rather than 26.0 percent higher? Politicians may not want to ever talk about taxes (we did raise the tax repeatedly from the founding of the program until 1990), but it is hard for serious people to see grounds for complaint. It would also be a small matter in terms of living standards to divert a portion of these gains from faster growth towards accelerating the transition to a green economy. If we diverted one percentage point more of GDP in 2034 towards reducing greenhouse gas emissions, we would still have 9.0 percent more in that year than CBO current now projects to spend on other things. Anyhow, if we really want to say that we think profits will grow far more rapidly than CBO is now projecting, it would be worth filling out this picture. Either we will see a substantial further redistribution from wages to profits or we can anticipate that we will be far richer in the future than we currently expect, and many of the issues that seem like major problems today will seem trivial. Reducing Corporate Income Taxes What shareholders ultimately care about is after-tax profits, not profits. After-tax profits can rise more than profits if we reduce the effective tax rate on corporate income. There is some room for this. According to CBO’s data, corporate income tax payments increased from 10.2 percent of profits in 2019 to 15.3 percent in 2023. Some of this rise is likely random timing factors, however some of it likely stems from increased enforcement. The Biden administration made it clear that it expected the I.R.S. to enforce the tax law on wealthy individuals and large corporations and even secured additional funding for this effort. By contrast, Trump and Republicans have called these enforcement efforts 'harassment' and seem fine with a situation where the wealthy and large corporations don’t have to pay their taxes if they choose not to. It seems likely that corporate income tax payments will fall as a share of profits under the Trump administration. This is partly due to an occasionally stated desire by Trump to lower the corporate income tax rate further (he reduced it from 35 percent to 21 percent in his first administration) and also the result of lax enforcement. For purposes of these calculations, we can assume that the effective tax rate falls back to the 2019 level of slightly over 10.0 percent. This would mean that after-tax profits would grow by roughly 6.0 percentage points more than the amount projected by CBO. This would allow for an annual real return that is 0.6 percentage points higher than would be implied by the profit growth projection from CBO, or 3.6 percent annually. That is still well short of the 6.2 percent annual return that would be needed to maintain a 4.0 percentage point gap between returns from equities and returns on government bonds. Stock Returns and Profit Growth: Summing Up The table below shows the stock returns that would be consistent with the various scenarios discussed above and both a stable PE ratio and the 2034 PE ratio in markets if the returns on stock matched their historic premium of 4.0 percentage points over the return on government bonds. In the base case, as noted the real return consistent with a stable PE ratio would be 3.0 percent, just 0.8 percentage points above the return on inflation-indexed government bonds. If we assume that stocks pay their historic 4.0 percentage point premium, the PE ratio will rise to 54 by 2024. If we assume that the profit share remains stable, rather than income shifting back somewhat to wages, as projected by CBO, then the return consistent with a stable PE is 3.2 percent. Alternatively, if we assume that stocks pay their historic 4.0 percentage point premium, the PE will rise to 53 by 2024. The faster growth scenario discussed above would allow a 4.0 real return on stocks in the constant PE scenario. If stocks delivered their historic premium, then the PE ratio will rise to 49 by 2034. In the lower taxes scenario, the real return consistent with a stable PE ratio would be 3.5 percent. For stocks to deliver their historic premium the PE ratio would have to rise to 51 by 2034. This analysis implies that in all these scenarios either investors will have to accept a much lower equity premium than they have received historically, or that PE ratios will rise far above previous records. While there is no limit in principle to how high the PE ratio can go, a higher PE means that returns going forward will be even lower. If PE ratios near or above 50 are not impossible, they do at least seem implausible. There is also the possibility that we will see even more extreme scenarios than outlined above. Perhaps growth will be even more rapid than the 1.0 percentage point boost shown here, or maybe corporate taxes will be eliminated altogether. These scenarios, while possibly far-fetched, are not impossible. For those who want to ascribe to such scenarios, it would be useful if they would at least be explicit in their assumptions so that the implications can be drawn out for the economy. For example, if stock projections are based on the assumption that growth will be 2.0 percentage points above the numbers projected by CBO, then the implication is that we will be almost unimaginably wealthy in the not very distant future. In that world concerns about deficits and Social Security solvency would be incredibly silly. And we certainly should have no fear spending considerably more money to avert global warming. If people expect to be taken seriously in their projections for stock gains, they should at least be able to etch out the economic scenario that would go along with it. The reporters who write down stock projections should keep this in mind.

Can We Have Health Care Without Health Insurance Companies? – OpE...	In the aftermath of the senseless murder of the CEO of UnitedHealthcare, responsible commentators were quick to condemn the act. 'Murder is bad, and so are murderers,' wrote the liberal economist Paul Krugman. 'Neither should be celebrated.' But then Krugman went on to offer an admittedly 'somewhat ... caricatured' view of U.S. health care: 'It’s a system in which taxpayers bear the cost of major medical care, but this taxpayer money flows through private companies that take a cut, spend a lot on administration, and do their best to deny care to people who need it.' What service do private insurers provide in return for the fees they collect? Americans, Krugman wrote, 'may not realize the extent to which they are exposing themselves to the delay-and-deny strategy private insurers often use to avoid paying for care.' For many years, Krugman has been an advocate of single-payer health insurance—often pointing to Canada as a model to be emulated. In Canada, there are no health insurance companies. When Canadians get health care, the cost is paid by the government—often with few questions asked. If Canadians can get by without health insurance companies, could something like that work in the United States? Not in a way people would find desirable. All Developed Countries Face Some Health Care Problems There are three problems with the doctor-patient relationship in all developed countries—regardless of the way the payment system is organized. First, when a third party is paying the bill, neither the doctor nor the patient has any incentive to apply the kind of cost/benefit analysis that is normal in the purchase of any other good or service. In considering whether to obtain an expensive test (an MRI scan, e.g.), the incentive is to consider only the benefit. Since cost is irrelevant to the patient, a tiny benefit—no matter what the cost—is viewed as desirable. Second, in a fee-for-service arrangement (such as exists in both the U.S. and Canada), the more services doctors perform, the higher their incomes. So, just as patients have an incentive to over-consume, doctors have an incentive to over-provide. Third, there is malpractice liability, which is especially a problem in the U.S. A doctor who orders an unnecessary MRI scan faces no real penalty. But no matter how improbable, there is always a chance that a scan not ordered will fail to detect a problem that grows worse through time. Our legal system, therefore, provides incentives for too many tests and too many procedures, compared to a system in which costs would have to be justified by comparable benefits. What we are describing are three perverse incentives. If they are not checked in some way, medical care becomes unreasonably expensive. That means higher premiums or higher taxes or both. Canada Rations Care Canada checks these incentives by limiting resources. The typical Canadian general practitioner, for example, does not have radiology equipment and must send patients to a hospital for simple x-rays. The hospitals, in turn, operate under global budgets tht limit spending, no matter what the level of demand. Canada ranks 25th of 29 countries on the number of MRI scanners per person. As a result, the wait for a scan is almost three months, and the wait until final treatment is more than six months. The government has decided to prevent overuse of MRI scanners by severely restricting the number of scanners that are available. Canada’s system of limiting heath care resources and forcing doctors to ration care has many undesirable characteristics. The system favors high-income over low-income patients. It favors white patients over racial minorities. It favors city dwellers over rural residents. It favors the politically connected over those without connections. Arguably, there is more inequality in access to health care in Canada than there is in the United States. How Aggressive Are Private Insurers? Although there are complaints about preauthorization requirements and denials, one could argue that the private insurers are not being aggressive enough. One oft-quoted estimate is that one-third of U.S. health care spending is wasted. If we could magically eliminate all that waste, we could give every American almost $5,000 each year. You might suppose that in countries that impose rationing, such as Canada and the U.K., doctors are forced to be more efficient—prioritizing resources so that the most promising procedures are done first. But studies by the RAND Corporation found that this isn’t so. In Canada and Britain, for example, scholars found just as much unnecessary care (as a percent of the total) as they found in the United Staes. Then there is fraud, which is a special problem in government-administered programs. In Medicare and Medicaid, for example, fraud is estimated to consume at least $100 billion a year. Hospital upcoding (claiming a higher level of patient severity in order to obtain a higher insurance payment) is another problem. One study estimates that increased upcoding (relative to a decade earlier) was associated with $14.6 billion in hospital payments. Although doctors are the biggest critics of claim denials, hospitals are by far a bigger problem. Suppose a patient’s condition is stabilized in an ER. Then the medically correct procedure is usually to send the patient home and let further care be outpatient. Yet some hospitals will keep the patient for a night or two and try to bill an insurer for that cost. Suppose a patient’s condition warrants keeping the patient in an 'observation bed' for a night or two. Some hospitals will treat the patient as a full admission instead and try to bill the insurer at a much higher rate. These are just two of hundreds of ways some hospitals try to add unnecessary costs to our health care system. When insurers deny these claims and refuse to pay the bills they are performing a socially useful function. And the price of that function is not unreasonable. Despite claims that insurers put 'profits before people,' profit margins for health insurers are well below those of the average company in the S&P 500. The Role of Preauthorization An important tool private insurers use to avoid unnecessary spending and inappropriate care is to require preauthorization for a particular drug, therapy, or procedure. Doctors tend to regard these procedures as burdensome and irksome. Yet only 7.4% of requests by patients in Medicare Advantage and Medicaid managed care plans are denied. Moreover, in the vast majority of appeals (83.2%), the initial denials are overturned. If you follow the health policy literature, you might be led to believe that the denial rate is a special problem in Medicare Advantage. In fact, the denial rate in Medicaid is twice that of the Medicare Advantage rate. Some policymakers have decided to take aim at the use of AI in generating denials. At the same time, some doctors are using AI to file their appeals—greatly reducing the time to file and increasing the success rate. Yet both trends should be applauded if the desire is to make the entire process more efficient. Overall, our health insurance system can be improved, and scholars associated with the Goodman Institute have proposed many ways to do that. But we cannot have a system that works well without companies that perform the functions health insurers are performing today. The public seems to understand this. Despite occasional complaints, more than two-thirds of Americans rate their health insurance as 'good’ or 'excellent.' And that holds for all kinds of insurance: employer plans, (Obamacare) marketplace plans, Medicare and even Medicaid. Even among people who say they are not in good health (and who, presumably, need medical care), a substantial majority give positive ratings to their health plans. Only a tiny percent rate their insurance as 'poor.' And that is good news.

Pakistan: Rekindling Terror In Punjab – Analysis	By Tushar Ranjan Mohanty On January 2, 2025, the Punjab Police (Pakistan) released its annual performance report for 2024, highlighting significant achievements in apprehending criminals and ensuring public safety. Over 137,000 fugitives and proclaimed offenders involved in serious crimes were arrested across the province, including Lahore. Among them, 104 dangerous fugitives evading justice abroad were extradited to Pakistan. The report reveals that more than 26,000 A-category and over 111,000 B-category criminals were apprehended in 2024. Furthermore, over 66,000 judicial absconders were arrested, comprising 6,907 in the A-category and 59,373 in the B-category. Intelligence-based operations (IBOs) also led to the arrest of over 35,000 habitual offenders, including 15,154 from the A-category and 20,485 from the B-category. While Police in the province were racking up achievements relating to crimes and criminals, terrorism-related incidents in Punjab, Pakistan’s heartland province, recorded a rise in 2024, after a continuous decline over the preceding seven years, since 2017. According to partial data compiled by the South Asia Terrorism Portal (SATP), Punjab recorded a total of 59 terrorism-linked fatalities [Nine civilians, four Security Force (SF) personnel and 46 terrorists] in 27 terrorism-related incidents of killing in 2024, as against 48 fatalities (Seven civilians, four SF personnel and 37 terrorists) in 15 terrorism-related incidents of killing in 2023. Overall fatalities thus registered a 23 per cent increase. It is useful to recall, however, that the highest terrorism-related fatalities in the province were reported in 2013, at 1,656. Year 2022 registered just 11 terrorism-related fatalities (10 civilians and one terrorist), the lowest in the province since the commencement of its tryst with terrorism. The highest terrorism-related fatalities in the province were reported in 2013, at 1,656. While terrorism-related fatalities in 2024 increased, as compared to the previous year, terrorism-linked incidents in 2024 remained low, with 54 incidents recorded, as against 82 in 2023. However, the number of major incidents of killing (each involving three or more fatalities) increased from 12 fatalities in two incidents in 2023, to 28 fatalities in five incidents in 2024. The most prominent major incidents in 2024 was reported on October 24, when 10 terrorists were killed during a clash with the Counter Terrorism Department (CTD) of Punjab Police during an Intelligence based Operation (IBO) in the hilly area of Makadwala in the Mianwali District of Punjab. The operation was launched following intelligence reports of the presence of 10 to 15 terrorists in the region. Other prominent major terrorism-linked incidents in the province in 2024 included: December 1: Four militants were killed and two Policemen sustained injuries during a clash, when a group of militants attacked the Chapri Police Station in Mianwali District. According to Police officers, almost 20 militants attacked the Chapri Police Station on the provincial border with Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. The Police were on a high alert; as a result, the attack was successfully repulsed and four militants were killed. Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) claimed responsibility for the attack. November 23: On November 23, the CTD killed three terrorists during an intelligence-based operation (IBO) in Chakri village, Rawalpindi District. The three were killed in the exchange of fire, while another two managed to escape. October 6: At least seven TTP terrorists were killed in an IBO by CTD near the Makarwal area of Mianwali District. Eight other terrorists managed to escape. May 12: Four terrorists, involved in the killing of a Policemen, were shot dead during firing by their own accomplices in the Karol Jungle of Lahore, the provincial capital of Punjab. Alarmed at the rising incidents of terrorism in different parts of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP) and Balochistan, Punjab CTD identified 25,432 suspected terrorists in the province, according to an April 9, 2024, report, quoting sources. A report had also been compiled in which details of affiliations of these individuals with different banned organizations, as well as other particulars, were given. The CTD also started conducting surveillance of these persons. Sources elaborated, further, that, of the 25,432 identified persons, 8,926 were affiliated just one organization. Further, the report noted, 'There are 968 such persons in Punjab who are inspired by the ideology of Daesh (Islamic State), a militant outfit designated as a terrorist organization by several countries of the world.' Moreover, by April 15, 2024, the Punjab CTD had completed geo-tagging of over 19,000 seminaries (madrassas) in the province and over 9,000 suspected terrorists were put on a watch list. The list included 65 individuals who had returned from Syria in recent years. Besides, CTD was monitoring 22 people, who had returned home after their release from Guantanamo Bay. According to the CTD record, there were 2,298 youth in Punjab who had received terrorist training in Afghanistan, while 1,566 individuals were identified as having trained within the country. Similarly, the record showed that 540 persons, who were released from Afghan jails, were also under the scanner. As the mainstream Islamic militant outfits assert their presence, blasphemy cases continue to occur in the province, and radicalisation remains rampant. Blasphemy has been used by the Islamist fundamentalists and extremists as a weapon to target minorities. According to partial data compiled by SATP, eight blasphemy related incidents of violence were recorded during 2024, in which five persons were killed, while three persons sustained injuries. There were only three such incidents in 2023 resulting in one fatality and one injury. Three persons were killed in two blasphemy related incidents in 2022, and another three in such violence in 2021. In the most recent incident of a blasphemy attack, a 40-year-old Ahmadi man was killed in the Dhamial Police Station area of Rawalpindi (Rawalpindi District) in Punjab on December 5, 2024. According to a statement by Jamaat Ahamddiya spokesperson Aamir Mahmood, Tayyab was visiting his brother’s shop where he was fatally attacked. The attacker allegedly shouted anti-Ahmadi slurs while he carried out the attack. 'Some days ago, extremists had also attacked his brother’s shop by throwing stones at it and were issuing constant threats. Tayyab’s brother was constantly receiving threats and very recently moved his family out of Rawalpindi,' the Jamaat Ahamddiya statement noted. According to the Lahore based Center for Social Justice (CSJ)’s March 2024 report, at least 329 persons were accused of blasphemy under the law in 2023, out of which Punjab accounted for the highest number (179), followed by Sindh (79). According to CSJ, 2,449 persons have been accused of blasphemy between 1987 and 2023, among who Punjab registered the highest number of 1,770 cases, followed by 471 in Sindh. CSJ cited data from the Punjab Prison Department, indicating that, as of February 13, 2024, there were 587 prisoners in jail for blasphemy under sections 295-A, B and C of the Pakistan Penal Code, across the province. Among these, 515 were under trial, including 508 males, six females, and one juvenile prisoner. Despite the Police and other law enforcement agencies in Punjab reporting a declining trend of crime, a recent report indicated a 5 per cent increase in criminal cases in 2024, as compared to 2023. Statistics published by Geo News on December 30 reflected a 5 per cent spike in criminal cases in Punjab, with 1,067,000 cases registered, as against 1,010,000 in the preceding year, an increase of 57,000 cases. According to Police records, a total of more than 1,067,000 cases were registered in the province during 11 and a half months, including 233 cases of murder during robbery, 1,262 cases of gang rape of women, and 3,880 cases of sexual assault against minors. Records also included 85 cases of kidnapping for ransom and 504 murders. While the Police and CTD large operational claims, several reports suggest that TTP is strengthening its base in Punjab. According to a January 29, 2024, report, TTP has launched a new wing, Ustarana (or Ustrani), comprising highly-trained, well-equipped and motivated cadres, to specifically target Punjab Police personnel and make inroads into the territory. At least three Dera Ghazi Khan (DG Khan) check posts — Lakhani, Jhangi and Triman — situated in the tribal areas along the provincial borders, have become especially vulnerable because of the emerging threat of TTP’s new Ustarana wing. A senior official told Dawn that the TTP, after launching Ustarana, has increased its influence, striking fear among the local tribal people. TTP also demonstrated its presence in the capital city, Lahore, where a Policeman, Ghulam Rasool, was posted in the Police Lines, was shot dead by terrorists near the Tibbi Police Station on May 1, 2024. 'It’s the third incident of targeted killing in a week’s time', the Police stated. A TTP- affiliated channel claimed responsibility for the attack. On the same day, seven Policemen were injured in an overnight attack by terrorists at the Jhangi Check Post in the Taunsa District of Punjab. A TTP-affiliated channel claimed the attack. Further on May 5, two terrorists were killed in 'friendly fire' when a group of TTP cadres attacked CTD personnel in Rawalpindi city (Rawalpindi District), Punjab. The slain terrorists, Naseebullah and Ehsanullah, were identified as TTP fighters. On May 30, 2024, the Provincial Police heightened the security level in the city following a terrorism threat to the headquarters of the Crime Investigation Agency (CIA), as well as four Police Stations and Police units in Lahore. The threat was issued by the Khurasani group of TTP, after which the Police leadership held a meeting to devise a strategy to counter any possible terrorist activity in the city. 'It has been learnt reliably that the defunct TTP (Khurasani network), operating under its commander, Ali Zar, has planned terrorist activities to target the Police units in Lahore,' the special information report of the Punjab Police noted. The Police Stations the terrorist outfit allegedly intended to target included Mozang, Badami Bagh, Racecourse and Batapur. Similarly, the Liberty Market Facilitation Centre, the CIA Kotwali and the CIA headquarters, were among the targets of the terrorist organisation, according to the Police report. On January 4, 2025, the Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) released videos showing its cadres patrolling areas in southern Punjab. These visuals indicate the TTP's growing presence and expansion into Punjab, despite the security establishment’s claims of decimating terrorist groups in the province. With escalating TTP operations across the Afghan border into Pakistan and a significant deterioration in the security situation in the adjacent KP province, a spike in terrorist violence in Punjab is likely as well.

Why Washington Still Pretends January 6 Was An Attempted ‘Coup’ –...	By Ryan McMaken It’s been four years since the January 6 riots of 2021, and with each passing year it becomes more clear that the event was not an insurrection, and it certainly wasn’t a 'coup' of any sort. The legacy media and the Washington ruling elite—two groups united in their loathing for ordinary Americans—cling to the 'insurrection' narrative because it allows them to play victim, and to portray the unorganized populist opposition as dangerous. Thus, we are to believe that an 'insurrection' led by powerless working-class activists from the countryside posed a threat to the nuclear-armed machine that is the federal government. The fruits of this narrative—from the elites’ perspective—are already evident. For four years, the FBI—which can’t be bothered with hunting down rapists and real criminals—has relentlessly pursued the 'insurrectionists.' Virtually all of these 'criminals,' which the FBI would have you believe are violent felons, have been convicted of petty crimes like trespassing. Others have been convicted of 'crimes' that were perfectly legal throughout the first hundred years of American history, but became 'crimes' as the federal government gradually destroyed the Bill of Rights after the Civil War. These newly invented 'crimes' include unconstitutional thoughtcrimes like 'seditious conspiracy.' Among those convicted of actual violence, only a handful were convicted of possessing firearms on capitol grounds. Those convicted of actually using weapons against police were using weapons like crutches and bear spray. No one was convicted of any sort of violence that can seriously be compared to any type of real-life coup or insurrection. The hysteria over this 'coup' has also served to vastly increase the power of the tax parasites known as the Capitol Police. Since the January 6 riots, the Capitol’s top costumed police bureaucrat, Tom Manger, has attempted to turn the police force into a national spy agency of sorts. As Politico reports: Capitol Police Chief Tom Manger has sought to shift the agency’s identity as a traditional police force with a focus on Capitol Hill to a 'protective force' built on intelligence gathering, threat assessment and flexing its nationwide authority and jurisdiction. It now has an intelligence bureau with dozens of agents, as well as field offices in Florida and California, with more possible in Massachusetts, Wisconsin and Texas. Already saddled with the FBI, the NSA, the BATF, and a half dozen other heavily armed federal spy and police agencies, America, it seems, now requires yet another agency to spy on Americans. The Capitol Cops have done their best to put forward plenty of theater designed to make themselves out to be the victims, even though the only homicide committed on January 6 was committed by trigger-happy Capitol cop Michael Byrd. Byrd shot protestor Ashli Babbitt who was 'armed' only with a pocket knife—a knife that was in her pocket when Byrd shot her. What Would a Real Coup Looks Like? So fact that the January 6 riot was nothing that we might call a coup is made clear by the fact that the alleged insurrectionists had no plan to replace the existing regime with something else. In the real world, a coup requires the existence of some group of elites in the wing waiting to replace the status quo elites. This clearly was not the case on January 6, 2021. Indeed, the rioters in the Capitol enjoyed no support from any group of elites at all. It was simply a disorganized riot. Put another way, the January 6 riot was not an attempted coup because it simply wasn’t the sort of event that historians and political scientists—the people who actually study coups—generally define as a coup. Comparing the events of January 6 to those of, say, the 1973 Chilean coup, or the attempted Japanese coup of 1937 shows just how far from a coup the January 6 riot was. So how do we know a coup when we see one? In their article 'Global Instances of Coups from 1950 to 2010: A New Dataset,' authors Jonathan M. Powell and Clayton L. Thyne provide a definition: A coup attempt includes illegal and overt attempts by the military or other elites within the state apparatus to unseat the sitting executive. There are two key components of this definition. The first is that it is illegal. Powell and Thyne note that this 'illegal' qualifier is important to include 'because it differentiates coups from political pressure, which is common whenever people have freedom to organize.' In other words, protests, or threats of protest don’t count as coups. Neither do legal efforts such as a vote of no confidence or an impeachment. But an even more critical aspect of Powell and Thyne’s definition is that it requires the involvement of elites. This can be seen in any stereotypical example of a coup d’etat. This generally involves a renegade military detachment, military officers, and others from within the state apparatus who can employ knowledge, skills, influence, and coercive tools gained through membership in the regime’s elite circles. The attempted coup in Japan in 1937, for example, was carried out by more than fifteen hundred officers and men of the Japanese imperial army. They nonetheless failed, likely because they miscalculated the amount of support they enjoyed among other officers. More recently, in the 2009 Honduran coup, the bulk of the Honduran army turned on the president, Manuel Zelaya, and sent him into exile. That was a successful coup. More famously, Chile’s 1973 coup was successfully led by Augusto Pinochet, the commander-in-chief of the army, and his position enabled him to shell the Chilean executive palace with military hardware. Contrast this with nameless MAGA hat–wearing flag wavers, and the inappropriateness of the term 'coup' in this case should be blatantly obvious. With real coups, power is seized by a faction of the elite which has the ability to take control of the machinery of the state indefinitely. Although some of Trump’s critics claim he was somehow responsible for Wednesday’s mob, it is clear that Trump was not coordinating or directing any sort of military operation through Twitter posts. There was no plan for holding power. Had those who invaded the Capitol building managed to take control of the building for a time, there’s no reason to think this would have somehow translated into control of the state. How would it? The real coercive power remained well ensconced within an apparently undivided military apparatus. Must the military be at the center of any coup attempt? The answer is no. But, even in these other cases, it is clear that what happened on January 6 was no coup. For example, Powell and Thyne emphasize that military involvement at early stages is not necessary: [Other definitions] more broadly allow non-military elites, civilian groups, and even mercenaries to be included as coup perpetrators. This broad definition includes four sources, including [a definition stating that coup] perpetrators need only be 'organized factions'. We take a middle ground. Coups may be undertaken by any elite who is part of the state apparatus. These can include non-civilian members of the military and security services, or civilian members of government. However, in the case of January 6, the rioters had no institutional backing, military or otherwise. The had no promises of help from elites, and no reason to assume they had access to any coercive tools necessary to seize and hold control of a state’s executive apparatus. Nor was Donald Trump even in a position to promise such things. As noted by Elaine Kamarck at the Brookings Institution: We now know that Trump did not even have the support of his own family and friends nor his handpicked White House staff. To pursue his plans, he had to rely on a close group of advisors known as 'the clown show' led by Rudi Giuliani, a pillow manufacturer, and a dot-com millionaire—none of whom was in government and none of whom controlled the most important 'assets' (guns, tanks, planes etc.) needed to take over a government. In contrast to most successful coups in history, Trump had no faction of the military, no faction of the National Guard, and no faction of the District of Col[u]mbia Metropolitan Police at his disposal. In other words, the rioters had no avenue to call upon any faction of the state or any group of elites for backing. Kamarck continues: As we learned in some of the most recent hearings, it was Vice President Mike Pence who was in contact with the military and the police, and most importantly, the military and the police were taking orders from Pence not Trump, the commander in chief! Given that Trump didn’t actually attempt to secure power for himself, we can guess Trump knew that no branch of the federal government was about to step in to illegally extend his tenure as president. 'Coup' Now Means 'Thing I Don’t Like' Since 2021, the media has decided to use terms like 'coup' and insurrection selectively for political effect. This phenomenon was examined in a November 2019 article titled 'Coup with Adjectives: Conceptual Stretching or Innovation in Comparative Research?,' by Leiv Marsteintredet and Andres Malamud. The authors note that as the incidence of real coups has declined, the word has become more commonly applied to political events that are not coups. But, as the authors note, this is not merely an issue of splitting hairs, explaining that 'the choice of how to conceptualize a coup is not to be taken lightly since it carries normative, analytical, and political implications.' Increasingly, the term really means 'this is a thing I don’t like.' It’s clear the January 6 panel in Congress, and countless anti-Trump pundits, use the term in this way to express disapproval and also to justify regime crackdowns against pro-Trump opponents of the regime. It’s easier to justify harsh prison sentences for a disorganized group of vandals if their acts can be framed as a nearly successful coup and therefore a threat to 'our democracy.' Moreover, if the situation were reversed, and if protestors had invaded the Capitol to support a left-wing, proregime candidate, we can be sure that the vocabulary used to describe the event in the mainstream press would be quite different.

How Assad’s Failures Fueled Syria’s Collapse – OpEd	By Abdulrahman Al-Rashed When Bashar Assad lost control of the oil-rich areas in eastern Syria, most of which came under the control of the Syrian Democratic Forces, he turned to Iran for oil and its derivatives to enable his forces to continue fighting and to maintain services in the areas under his rule.His weak economy was collapsing and the government was in a state of bankruptcy as it waged war without any revenues. He relied on drugs and terrorism, which became the regime’s most significant exports.Some might think this is an exaggeration or propaganda against a fallen regime incapable of defending itself. However, the regime itself did not hide this reality and even used it as leverage in negotiating its regional and international relations.No Saudi ambassador arrived in Damascus despite the agreement reached in May 2023. Diplomatic representation was limited to operating out of the Four Seasons Hotel and Saudi Arabia did not send its ambassador to the Syrian capital for the first time until the entry of the new leadership and its forces.Relations slowed as the regime failed to fulfill its promises, including halting the smuggling of Captagon. Assad, as usual, delayed delivering on the promised reconciliation and expected billions of dollars in compensation to stop the smuggling operations. Riyadh was not pleased with this, especially since rewarding drug traffickers for halting their activities would encourage further extortion. Assad acted like Colombia’s infamous drug lord Pablo Escobar, earning, according to Western estimates, more than $5 billion annually from Captagon sales — more than his oil revenues before the war.I met the ousted president at least five times in direct sessions, where we talked for hours. Even so, I cannot claim to truly know him. I published most of the discussions from those meetings in Asharq Al-Awsat at the time but stopped after the assassination operations in Lebanon, as his threats began targeting journalists. I was also blacklisted from entering Lebanon. I met him again shortly before the revolution against him, in a group session, where he appeared confident and assured of his safety. In any case, despite the horrifying revelations about him after his downfall, which added to what we already knew about his terrifying regime, he always seemed polite in person, ready to listen and respond. Rarely did he lose his composure. This was his demeanor with all his guests.This left many puzzled about his true nature. Was there a sinister group behind the atrocities in Syria and Lebanon? Was it his brother Maher, his officer Ali Mamlouk, his wife Asma or the Iranian Qassem Soleimani?The truth is that he was behind it all, orchestrating and managing it — not the image he projected. He compensated for his failure to govern the state by wielding brute force. The impoverished country became even poorer, contrary to his claims of being targeted by hostile nations.The truth is, Assad received widespread regional and international support after assuming power. There was hope he would move Syria beyond Hafez Assad’s legacy toward openness and modernization. Instead, he increased the number of prisons, surpassed his father in terms of assassinations and bombings, and hosted terrorist organizations.Thus, the Syrian revolution against Bashar was no surprise, even though it erupted three months after Tunisia’s uprising. Having failed economically, Assad resorted to drug trafficking and hosting armed groups during the Iraq war in coordination with Iran, repeating the same approach during his decade-long war. I cannot recall him ever discussing economic development, modernization or improving citizens’ livelihoods before the revolution.Today, Syria and its new leaders need to reflect on the history of the Assad regime. It is no surprise that a regime collapses when a soldier guarding it or a university professor, who represents the societal elite, earns about $20 a month. The profound lesson is that the risks of economic failure are greater than those of security failure.Economic failure preceded the war by years, as well as America’s Caesar Act sanctions, the freezing of state assets abroad and the collapse of the currency. It was the result of Assad’s mismanagement, rampant corruption, weak governance and the regime’s reliance on a shadow economy fueled by drugs and foreign wars.Despite their severe hardships in the countries in which they sought refuge, Syrians have achieved success in every field. Today, a great opportunity lies ahead. The government of Ahmad Al-Sharaa must first bring together all Syrians in their diversity to become part of the state and open up to the world to attract investment.

A Comparative Analysis Of Regime Survivability: Iran (2025) Vs. S...	The Value of Comparative Analysis Predicting the near future of Iran’s regime in 2025 requires a methodical approach grounded in historical parallels. Comparative analysis offers a powerful lens to assess how authoritarian regimes collapse when exposed to converging pressures such as economic strain, geopolitical isolation, ideological disillusionment, and domestic unrest. The Soviet Union’s dissolution in 1991 remains a critical case study, demonstrating how systemic vulnerabilities can unravel even the most entrenched regimes. As historian John Gaddis observes, 'The Cold War ended not with a bang but a whimper, as the Soviet system imploded under its own contradictions' (Gaddis, The Cold War: A New History, 2005). By examining these parallels, we can identify patterns that might illuminate the survival odds of Iran’s regime, which is facing mounting crises today. Iran’s challenges bear striking resemblance to those that contributed to the Soviet collapse. Escalating economic hardships, the loss of regional influence, and growing public disillusionment mirror the conditions that unraveled the USSR. As political scientist Mark Katz notes, 'Authoritarian regimes rarely fall solely from external pressure; it is the internal cracks that determine how long they last' (Katz, Revolutionary Regimes, 2019). Using a weighted framework to evaluate key survival factors—geopolitical isolation, economic strain, ideological collapse, and internal dissent—this analysis compares the Soviet Union’s final years to Iran’s current trajectory. The findings highlight that worsening economic conditions and any external military strike will further accelerate Iran’s decline, significantly reducing its chances of survival. Methodology: Factors Influencing Survival The analysis employs a weighted framework to evaluate the survival prospects of Iran and the Soviet Union. Four key factors are assessed for their impact on regime stability: 1. Geopolitical Isolation (30% weight): Loss of allies and external influence, compounded by adversarial forces. 2. Economic Strain (30% weight): Financial deterioration and the regime’s capacity to manage economic crises. 3. Ideological Collapse (20% weight): Erosion of public belief in the regime’s foundational principles. 4. Internal Dissent and Repression (20% weight): Grassroots opposition, elite defections, and the effectiveness of state suppression mechanisms. Each factor is scored on a scale of 0-100% for severity, with the weighted average determining the probability of survival. 1. Geopolitical Isolation Soviet Union (1991): • The USSR experienced rapid geopolitical isolation as Eastern European communist regimes collapsed (e.g., East Germany, Poland, Hungary), and independence movements swept through its republics. The Soviet withdrawal from Afghanistan in 1989 symbolized its diminishing global reach (Gaddis, 2005). • The U.S. and NATO expanded their influence in Eastern Europe, leaving the Soviet Union cornered and weakening its ideological claim to global leadership. Score: 20%. The Soviet Union’s loss of alliances and territorial control severely weakened its geopolitical position. Iran (2025): • Iran’s regional isolation has intensified with the collapse of key proxies: Syria, Hezbollah, and potentially the Houthis in Yemen. The loss of Syria disrupts Iran’s logistical support to Hezbollah, while Hezbollah’s neutralization weakens Iran’s military deterrence in the Levant (Al Jazeera, 2024). • Escalating tensions with Gulf states, Israel, and Western powers compound Iran’s isolation, while international sanctions continue to restrict its global engagement. Score: 25%. While Iran retains limited influence in Iraq and Yemen, its growing isolation mirrors the Soviet Union’s geopolitical decline. 2. Economic Strain Soviet Union (1991): • The Soviet economy stagnated due to inefficiencies in central planning, a bloated military budget, and declining industrial productivity. The collapse of global oil prices in the 1980s further depleted revenues (Kotz & Weir, Revolution from Above, 1997). • Gorbachev’s reforms, including perestroika, inadvertently exacerbated economic instability by exposing systemic inefficiencies without providing effective solutions. Score: 15%. Economic collapse undermined the Soviet regime’s ability to sustain itself financially. Iran (2025): • Iran’s economic decline is accelerating due to U.S.-led sanctions, inflation, and currency devaluation. Rampant corruption and financial mismanagement exacerbate the crisis. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) warns that Iran’s GDP growth is stagnant, while inflation exceeds 40%, pushing millions into poverty (IMF Report, 2024). • Funding for regional proxies like Hezbollah and the Houthis places additional strain on Iran’s resources. Unlike the Soviet Union, Iran lacks an industrial base, making it more vulnerable to prolonged economic crises. Score: 10-15%. Iran’s worsening economic crisis is a critical vulnerability, and further deterioration will significantly reduce its odds of survival. 3. Ideological Collapse Soviet Union (1991): • Marxism-Leninism lost credibility as living standards stagnated and the system failed to deliver on its promises. The collapse of communist regimes in Eastern Europe further discredited the Soviet Union’s ideological foundation (Suny, The Soviet Experiment, 1998). • Nationalist movements within Soviet republics, including the Baltics and Ukraine, undermined Moscow’s ideological control. Score: 10%. The ideological collapse of Marxism-Leninism was a central factor in the Soviet Union’s demise. Iran (2025): • Iran’s theocratic ideology is increasingly rejected by its secular, youthful population. Widespread protests over women’s rights and personal freedoms reflect growing public disillusionment with the regime’s foundational principles (BBC Persian, 2024). • The fall of proxies like Hezbollah and the Houthis undermines Iran’s claim to leadership of the 'Axis of Resistance,' further eroding its ideological legitimacy. Score: 15%. While ideological collapse is slower than in the Soviet case, public rejection of Iran’s theocratic system continues to deepen. 4. Internal Dissent and Repression Soviet Union (1991): • Anti-regime protests erupted across Soviet republics, driven by nationalist movements in the Baltics, Ukraine, and Central Asia. Elite defections, including Boris Yeltsin’s opposition to Gorbachev, fractured the regime (Plokhy, The Last Empire, 2015). • Gorbachev’s reluctance to use force allowed dissent to grow unchecked, accelerating the USSR’s collapse. Score: 15%. Widespread dissent and weak repression mechanisms destabilized the Soviet Union. Iran (2025): • Iran faces persistent protests over economic grievances, women’s rights, and political repression. Ethnic separatist movements (e.g., Kurds, Baluchs) exacerbate instability (HRW, 2024). • The regime’s security forces (IRGC, Basij) have shown a willingness to use force to suppress dissent, providing short-term stability but risking long-term fragmentation. Score: 20%. Iran’s stronger repression tools provide temporary stability, but mounting dissent reduces its long-term survivability. Final Survival Probabilities Factor Weight (%) Soviet Union (%)Iran (%)CommentGeopolitical Isolation (30%)20%25%Iran retains limited influence in Iraq and Yemen.Economic Strain (30%)15%10-15%Iran’s worsening economic crisis is a critical factor.Ideological Collapse (20%)10%15%Both regimes face growing ideological disillusionment.Internal Dissent (20%) 15%20%Iran’s repression tools are stronger than the USSR’s Iran Survival Probability (2025): Comparative analysis reveals that Iran’s regime faces pressures strikingly similar to those that led to the Soviet Union’s collapse. Economic deterioration, worsening geopolitical isolation, and growing public disillusionment significantly reduce its survivability. Further economic decline or military strikes by Israel or the U.S. will likely reduce Iran’s survival odds to 10-15%, paralleling the Soviet trajectory. As history demonstrates, no authoritarian regime can withstand the simultaneous collapse of its economic, geopolitical, and ideological foundations.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWf-aJvzXPOcy7wW2N6rpCd5	2025-01-06T16:25:37-08:00	
India: Irritants Persist In Andhra Pradesh – Analysis	By Deepak Kumar Nayak Andhra Pradesh's excellent performance in dealing with the Communist Party of India-Maoist (CPI-Maoist) menace remained visible through 2024. In order to push the Maoists further back in the state, the Andhra Pradesh Cabinet decided, on August 7, 2024, to renew the ban on rebel outfits in Andhra Pradesh for another year. Addressing the media at the state secretariat, Information minister Kolusu Parthasarathy explained the Cabinet decision, 'The cabinet has approved proposals to extend the existing ban on organisations of the Communist Party of India (Maoist) and Revolutionary Democratic Front (RDF) for another year under Section 3 (a) of the AP Public Security Act - 1992.' Meanwhile, according to partial data collated by the South Asia Terrorism Portal (SATP), one civilian was killed through 2024 in Andhra Pradesh. There was one such killing in 2023, as well as one each in 2022 and 2021. A total of 33 such killings have been registered since June 2, 2014, when Andhra Pradesh was split, to carve out the new state of Telangana. A high of five civilian fatalities were documented in 2015, 2016, 2017 and 2019, while a low of one fatality was registered in 2021, 2022, 2023 and 2024. There were three fatalities in 2018 and four in 2020. Significantly, since March 6, 2000, when SATP started documenting Left Wing Extremism (LWE)-related violence across the country, undivided Andhra Pradesh [including Telangana] has recorded 549 civilian fatalities till date (January 5, 2025), including a high of 132 civilian fatalities in 2005. In the fight against the Naxalites, the Security Forces (SFs) have not suffered any losses over the past seven years. The last fatality registered in this category was on May 5, 2017, when a Home Guard, Sheikh Valli, was killed in a landmine blast triggered by CPI-Maoist cadres on the Lothugedda Junction-Balapam stretch in Visakhapatnam District. This was the lone SF fatality documented in Andhra Pradesh after its split on June 2, 2014. Since March 6, 2000, undivided Andhra Pradesh [including Telangana] has registered 133 SF fatalities (January 5, 2025), including a high of 41 in 2001. The Maoists did not suffer any loss through 2024, as well in 2023 and 2022. Six Maoists were killed in 2021. A total of 32 such killings have been documented since June 2, 2014. A high of nine Maoist fatalities was documented in 2019, while a low of one fatality was documented in 2020. Significantly, since March 6, 2000, a total of 916 Maoist fatalities (January 5, 2025) have been documented in undivided Andhra Pradesh [including Telangana], including a high of 165 in 2003. While SF ascendency in the state had been significantly consolidated on the ground before the split of the state in June 2014, it has been further reinforced thereafter. Meanwhile, no Naxalites were arrested in 2024, though SFs arrested 10 Naxalites in 2023, according to the SATP database. Since June 2, 2014, the total number of arrests stands at 159. Continuing SF pressure also resulted in the surrender of 45 Naxalites in 2024, in addition to nine in 2023. Since June 2, 2014, surrenders total 550. On October 11, 2024, two Maoists, Muchika Aitha (20) and Madakam Hinge (20), surrendered to Superintendent of Police (SP) Amit Bardar in Alluri Sitarama Raju District, expressing disillusionment with the party’s ideology and a desire for a peaceful life. Aitha and Hinge both hail from the Sukma District of Chhattisgarh and had been active in the Maoist ranks for several years. Both the cadres cited several reasons for their surrender: increasing Police presence, the government’s developmental initiatives, and the effective rehabilitation policies offered by the state, which include financial rewards and job opportunities for surrendering cadres. Other parameters of violence also suggest diminishing Maoist activities in the state, as in all other Maoist-affected regions in India. The Maoists did not exchange fire with SFs in 2024, while there was at least one such incident in 2023. The State did not record any incident of explosion in 2024, as in 2023. No incident of explosion was recorded in 2022 and 2021 either. The last incident of explosion was recorded on August 3, 2020, in which two civilians were killed. The Maoists could not issue any bandh (shutdown strike) call in 2024 or in 2023 and 2022. The last bandh call was given on April 26, 2021, but drew poor response, with peaceful prevailing almost across the tribal areas of Andhra Pradesh. The bandh call had come from the CPI-Maoist, in protest against alleged harassment and torture of innocent people, especially tribals, and social and civil rights activists, by SFs. An analysis of overground and underground Maoist activities in Andhra Pradesh confirms their diminishing impact in the state. According to the SATP database, Maoist activities were reported from four districts in 2024 (Andhra Pradesh has a total of 26 districts). Only the Kurnool District fell in the ‘moderately affected’ category, while the remaining three districts – Alluri Sitharama Raju, Parvathipuram Manyam, and Visakhapatnam – were ‘marginally affected.’ In 2023, Maoist activities were reported from four districts, with Alluri Sitharama Raju District falling into the 'moderately affected’ category, while the remaining three districts – Visakhapatnam, Prakasam, and Sri Sathya Sai – were in the 'marginally affected’ category. Realisation of the futility of the Maoist ‘movement’ is increasingly widespread among the people. On May 30, 2024, tribals organised a rally against the CPI-Maoist at the Maddigaruvu weekly market in G Madugula Mandal (administrative sub division) in the Alluri Sitarama Raju District. As many as 500 people from Killamkota, Boithili, Injari, Ginnelakota, Jamiguda, and Kuntarla Panchayats (village-level local self-government institutions) participated in the rally and raised the slogan 'Maoists don’t come to the Alluri district.' They claimed that development programmes were now taking place, which was not the case during the earlier era of Maoist dominance. Images of various development projects in their areas were displayed on placards. The tribals said that since the past year, the establishment of cell towers and the construction of roads in the Maoist-affected areas had been ongoing, and hoped that such development work would be carried out on a large scale by the government. However, on December 10, 2024, CPI-Maoist cadres set a private car on fire on the Bhadrachalam-Chintoor Highway near Sirivella village under the Chinturu Police Station limits in Alluri Sitharamaraju District. According to sources, the Maoists forced the passengers in the car to get out of the vehicle and set it on fire. SFs have recovered arms on at least three occasions in the current year, as compared to four such incidents in 2023. A total of 48 incidents involving the recovery of arms has been recorded in the state since 2014. Meanwhile, taking action against the Maoist rebels, on October 1, 2024, the National Investigation Agency (NIA) has taken up an investigation to probe supply of weapons and explosives to the CPI-Maoist, with the objective of targeting Police officers in Andhra Pradesh. The case is linked to the arrest of two persons – Naka David Raj (from Odisha) and Vijay Viswas (from Dantewada, Chhattisgarh) in the Chinturu area of Alluri Sitharama Raju District in February 2024. The duo was travelling on a two-wheeler, when intercepted by Police officers. They were found in possession of fuse wire, detonators, gelatin sticks, and handwritten sheets in Hindi and Telugu. Further, on March 29, 2024, the NIA charged a suspect for his role in radicalising vulnerable youths using CPI-Maoist ideology. The probe agency filed its original charge sheet in the Munchingput conspiracy case in Andhra Pradesh in May 2021. Ramakkagiri Chandra is the eighth accused to be charged in the case related to the radicalization of 'vulnerable youths towards the Maoist ideology and extension of support to the banned CPI-Maoist.' Chandra was a ‘state committee member’ of the Pragathisheela Karmika Samakhya (PKS), a frontal outfit of the CPI-Maoist. The NIA's investigation has revealed that Chandra conspired with underground leaders of the CPI-Maoist to promote the activities of the organisation. The Andhra Pradesh successes against the Maoists on the ground are astonishing in view of the fact that this was the epicentre of the movement in the country, as well as that they are overwhelmingly the result of State Police initiatives. However, the Maoists cannot be written off as yet. Further, the existing and significant shortages of resources in the State Police raise concerns. According to the latest Bureau of Police Research and Development (BPR&D) data, as on January 1, 2023, the State Police continues to face critical gaps in capacities and deployment. As against the sanctioned strength of 106,368 policemen in Andhra Pradesh, only 88,054 were in position, creating a deficit of 17.21 per cent, indicating that, as against the sanctioned police-population ratio (police personnel per 100,000 population) of 200.40 in the state, only 165.89 were in position. The Police/Area Ratio (number of policemen per 100 square kilometres) in Andhra Pradesh was just 54.05, against the national average of 65.14. Both the State and national averages on the Police/Area ratio were well below their sanctioned strengths, at 65.29 and 82.82, respectively. In addition, the sanctioned strength of the apex Indian Police Service (IPS) Officers in the State was 144, but just 128 officers were in position, creating a deficit of 11.11 per cent, substantially weakening the executive command of the Force. Andhra Pradesh has led an exemplary campaign to degrade the Maoist threat in what was at one time the Maoist heartland. Residual elements of the movement in the State, nevertheless, persevere. SF dominance has pushed the Maoists, and it is unlikely that the rebels will be able to rebuild their strength. Nevertheless, it is imperative for the Governments, both at the Central and State levels, to address critical security deficits and strengthen the administrative, developmental and security outreach to eliminate the remaining influence of the rebels.

The Second Trump Presidency And NATO’s Nuclear Approach – Analysi...	By Shravishtha Ajaykumar In February 2024, then-Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump voiced dissatisfaction with the 2 percent of the gross domestic product (GD) defence spending target set by the European members of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), urging them to increase it to 3 percent. He also threatened not to extend protection to those members unwilling to fulfil this requirement. Trump’s first term was dominated by a United States (US)-centric approach and the same is expected to define his upcoming second term. During the Russia-Ukraine war, Trump frequently criticised the Biden administration’s level of involvement. In his speech in February 2024, Trump used the issue of NATO defence spending to bolster his argument to withdraw the US from being a primary supporter of Ukraine. Old wars, old presidents As of November 2024, Trump’s speech is no longer just a possibility but a recollection of his previous term’s actions. In 2019, the Trump administration withdrew from the INF Treaty (1987 Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty), leaving only the New START treaty to address US-Russian agreements on deploying nuclear weapons. The New START treaty has also been criticised by many experts and by Trump himself, who wants to negotiate a new treaty altogether, maintaining that the New START treaty alone is insufficient to limit the use of nuclear weapons. Earlier this year, Russian President Vladimir Putin had claimed that Western support in Ukraine, in the form of long-range missiles, may see a Russian nuclear response. While many US policy experts have criticised this as a near-impossible outcome, Putin’s rhetoric may have shaped the US sentiment of wanting to withdraw. US’s potential withdrawal from Ukraine would directly impact European powers, forcing countries like Germany to take a more prominent role and contribute more to their defence budget, something they have hesitated to do thus far, which would strain alliances within Europe and cohesion within NATO. Russia’s nuclear posturing will exacerbate tensions within NATO and between the European Union (EU) and the US. The previous Trump administration threatened to withdraw from NATO. While this did not materialise, the fear around the withdrawal indicated to competing global powers, like China and Russia, that NATO and the US do not function independently. The EU and NATO could come under growing pressure to strengthen their militaries, which could then heighten geopolitical differences, both within Europe and with the US. At its 75th anniversary Summit in July 2024, NATO tried to address its stance against Russia. However, its continued reliance on the US and hesitation to make Ukraine a full member has dampened these efforts. Nuclear posturing and NATO At the 2024 Summit in Washington D.C., NATO reaffirmed its status on nuclear weapons and development, identifying nuclear weapons as an instrument of international security and deterrence, especially in reaction to the Russia-Ukraine war. As mentioned earlier, Russia has also reaffirmed its willingness to use nuclear weapons. Both Russia and the NATO countries gesturing to potential nuclear weapons use only indicates that the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) and its attempt to contain nuclear proliferation is far from being successful. Furthermore, Finland and Sweden joining NATO may also impact the NPT. So far, these countries have opted out of alliances with nuclear weapons. Although neither of them possesses nuclear weapons, they are now a part of NATO and are under the protection of its nuclear umbrella. This inclusion will require these new members to strictly adhere to the required 2 percent (of GDP) defence spending. Trump's long-standing criticism of NATO and Europe’s military expenditure has had a lasting impact on transatlantic relations. States such as France and Germany may further develop autonomously operatedmilitary systems, potentially leading to different approaches in how NATO responds to security threats. Furthermore, Trump's support for a more hawkish posture towards the European military may induce reappraisals of Europe's reliance on the United States for military deterrence. Reaffirming NATO and strengthening nuclear security Rather than withdrawing or reducing its involvement in NATO, The US can approach the region more practically to reinvigorate the alliance’s defence posture, ensuring that its nuclear deterrence capabilities remain robust and relevant to the modern security environment. The next presidential term presents an opportunity to reactivate relationships with NATO partners and reiterate collective defence and nuclear security guarantees. Further, the US also can and should be at the forefront of supporting arms control, particularly due to the nuclear risk to Europe and West Asia. While Trump’s 'maximum pressure' campaign against Iran has led to significant tensions, especially with Türkiye, a more balanced approach that combines deterrence with diplomacy would be more successful. The US can thus tackle the nuclear threat posed by Tehran, by maintaining its relationship with Britain, France and Germany, who are already addressing the problem, thereby helping restore stability in the region. The United States must continue its adherence to arms control treaties, including the aforementioned New START Treaty between the US and Russia, and continue to spearhead efforts to stop the proliferation of nuclear weapons through international mechanisms. In a changed geopolitical landscape in which new nuclear powers are emerging and state and non-state actors are challenging alliances, NATO must not only relaunch its nuclear posture, but also mobilise its members based on shared security, diplomacy, and arms control. The US must continue to engage with NATO and its allies, reaffirming the importance of collective defence and nuclear deterrence, while simultaneously advancing efforts to prevent further nuclear proliferation and reduce the risk of catastrophic conflict. Trump’s policies in his first term perceptibly altered NATO’s strategy for defence and nuclear security, by essentially enfeebling the alliance. The foundations of a stable, secure international order call for NATO to remain firm, steadfast, and able to respond to traditional and nuclear threats. Rather than withdrawing, the United States should seek to reaffirm its commitment to NATO, enhance nuclear security efforts, and work collaboratively with its allies to address emerging threats.

Setback In Sino-Indian Relations Due To Fresh Territorial And Wat...	Recent cartographic changes by China and its decision to dam a river in Tibet have raised the hackles in New Delhi putting recent arrived détente under strain. Last year, regional rivals India and China reached an agreement on border patrolling, reducing tension in the Eastern Ladakh sector. Prior to that in July, the Indian government'sEconomic Survey said that 'to boost Indian manufacturing and plug India into the global supply chain, it is inevitable that India plugs itself into China's supply chain. Whether we do so by relying solely on imports or partially through Chinese investments is a choice that India has to make.' The border détente and the idea to allow Chinese investments were interpreted as early signs of a rapprochement between the two countries that were involved in an interminable border dispute and relentless jostling for supremacy in South Asia. But as 2025 dawned, cracks appeared in the relationship. China decided to form two 'Counties' called He'an and Hekang, in the Xinjiang province, parts of which fell in the Indian territory of Ladakh. India conveyed its protest to China about the establishment of these Counties on its territory. For India this was yet another case of China's cartographic aggression. China had earlier given its own names to various places in the Indian State of Arunachal Pradesh which it claims is 'Southern Tibet' and, therefore, a part of China. Controversial Dam China also announced that it would build a gigantic dam, the biggest in the world, on the Yarlung Zangbo river in Tibet, which flows into Arunachal Pradesh and Assam in India and then into Bangladesh. The Yarlung Zangbo of Tibet becomes Brahmaputra in India and Jamuna in Bangladesh. China's dam project is seen in India as threatening the livelihood of people in Arunachal Pradesh and Assam whose farmers depend on assured flows in the Brahmaputra. It is feared that China could weaponize water from the dam by withholding or releasing water in ways that could harm these Indian States. Similarly, Bangladeshi farmers will be affected by changes in the flow in the Jamuna due to manipulations at the dam in Tibet. The dam, which will cost US$ 137 billion, is located on the lower reaches of the Yarlung Zangbo river at the U bend in Medog Country in Tibet. It will have the capacity to generate 300 billion kilowatt-hours of electricity annually. China says that the project is expected boost engineering industries and create employment in Tibet. But given the low industrialization in Tibet, the bulk of the beneficiaries will be in the already industrialised parts of China east of Tibet. India Protests Disturbed about the possible deleterious effects of the dam, the Indian External Affairs spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal said last Friday: ' As a lower riparian state with established user rights to the waters of the river, we have consistently expressed, through expert-level and diplomatic channels, our views and concerns to the Chinese side over mega projects on rivers in their territory. There is a need for transparency and consultation with downstream countries. The Chinese side has been urged to ensure that the interests of downstream states of the Brahmaputra are not harmed by activities in upstream areas. We will continue to monitor and take necessary measures to protect our interests.' In response, China's foreign ministry spokesperson, Mao Ning, said that China had always been responsible for the development of cross-border rivers and the hydropower development in Tibet had been studied in an in-depth way for decades and safeguard measures had been taken for the security of the project. She added that China will continue to maintain communication with countries in the lower reaches through existing channels and step up international cooperation on disaster prevention and relief. Indian commentators point out that there is an India-China Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) that requires China to provide hydrological information on the Brahmaputra River during monsoon season from May 15 to October 15 each year. Data includes water level, discharge, and rainfall. The data helps India with flood control and disaster mitigation. The MoU was renewed in 2008, 2013, and 2018, but expired on June 5, 2023. The two countries are currently renewing the MoU through diplomatic channels. Differing Views Be that as it may, views differ on the impact of the dam on India. The general Indian nationalist opinion is that it will be disadvantageous and harmful to India both economically and strategically. The matter was reportedly raised with US National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan by his Indian counterpart Ajit Doval in their meetings in New Delhi on January 5 and 6. News reports said that on March 1, 2012, the Brahmaputra had run completely dry at Pasighat in Arunchal Pradesh. But after a few hours, Pasighat got inundated! It indicated that water in the upper reaches was first released and then suddenly shut at a dam in Tibet. Nilanjan Ghosh of the Observer Research Foundation, recalled that in 2020, there was an increase in turbidity and blackening of the water in the Tsiang river, as the Yarlung Tsangpo is called in Arunachal Pradesh. There was also a temporary stoppage of data sharing by China over the high season flows during the 2020 Doklam military standoff between China and India. Hence the need for an agreement and strict adherence to it. Geologists point out that the Chinese dam projects are very close to the geological fault line where the Indian Plate collides with the Eurasian Plate. The area is therefore prone to earthquakes. Indeed, a study conducted by the China Earthquake Administration found that in the six years after the construction of the giant 'Three Gorge Dams' over the Yangtze river in the Hubei province in 2003, there were 3,429 earthquakes along the reservoir. But between 2000 and 2003, before the dam was constructed, there were only 94 earthquakes. Eighty large cracks appeared on the Three Gorges Dam's concrete face, just days after the reservoir was filled for the first time in 2003. These raised concerns about the dam's safety. In 1975, 62 dams had collapsed in Henan due to heavy downpours during a typhoon. That event killed more than 26,000 people by the official count – though other estimates were several times higher. Contrary View However, some experts on water resources management feel that the Chinese dam will not make a difference to Assam because the water in the Brahmaputra is not so much from Tibet but from tributaries and rainfall on the Indian side. The tributaries which contribute significantly to the Brahmaputra are Luhit, Dibang, and Dihang, near Sadiya on the Indian state of Assam. The rainfall on the Tibet side is less than on the Assam side. A large part of the Tibetan component of the basin, i.e. the longer stretch of the Yarlung Zangbo river is located in the rain-shadow north of the Himalaya, and is therefore a recipient of much less rainfall as compared to the south. While the average annual precipitation in the trans-Himalaya is around 300 mm, the average annual precipitation (that includes mainly rainfall) touches 3,000 mm in the south. The foothills are frequently fed by anomalous precipitation of a magnitude that is capable of causing great floods, experts note. While the peak flows at Nuxia and Tsela Dzong measuring stations at the great bend in the Tibetan plateau are about 5,000 and 10,000 cubic metres per second (cumecs), the peak flow at Guwahati in Assam is approximately 55,000 cumecs. The lean season flow in Nuxia is in the range of 300-500 cumecs, while the lean flow at Pasighat in India is to the tune of 2,000-plus cumecs, the one at Guwahati is around 4000-plus cumecs. According to Dr. Nilanjan Ghosh, Director at the Observer Research Foundation (ORF) in India, given the precipitation, run-off and sediment flow regimes, it is unlikely that any intervention on the Yarlung Zangbo in Tibet by China will cause any substantial harm for downstream economies in India and Bangladesh.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWf-aJvzXPOcyy19VPxQfGs8	2025-01-06T16:19:26-08:00	
Stalemate With Rebels Grips Cameroon’s Anglophone Region – Analys...	Every February 14 in a remote part of northwestern Cameroon, the people of Ngarbuh village gather to pray around the graves of the 21 civilians killed in 2020 by a group of soldiers and militiamen in one of the worst atrocities of the still-simmering civil war. After initially denying responsibility, the army investigated and released a statement calling it 'an unfortunate accident, the collateral result of security operations in the region.' Ma-Shey Margaret survived, but all of her neighbors were killed, including an uncle and his entire family. A row of five burned-out homes stands nearby as a haunting reminder of the massacre. 'I weep each time I set eyes on the mass graves of the innocent people,' the 49-year-old told HumAngle Media for a September 2024 article. 'Right now, we are still not safe. The military wants us to report the presence of the separatist fighters to them, which is a risky thing to do. We live in constant fear.' The roots of the conflict trace back more than 100 years, to the aftermath of World War I, when the country was split into British and French colonial control. Today, English-speakers account for nearly a fifth of Cameroon’s population of 24 million, the majority of whom speak French. What began in Cameroon’s two Anglophone regions as a series of peaceful protests against marginalization in 2016 has escalated into a devastating civil war. In the Northwest and Southwest regions, years of grievances at perceived discrimination coalesced into a 2017 declaration of independence and resulted in a military crackdown. After eight years of fighting, Cameroon is stuck in a festering conflict, unable to quell the tension and violence between its French- and English-speaking people. More than 6,000 have died at the hands of separatist and government forces, and at least a million people are homeless. 'Violence in the entire Anglophone region has been building in 2024,' Dr. Ladd Serwat of the Armed Conflict Location & Event Data project (ACLED) said during a September 10 webinar. 'The second quarter of 2024 was actually the most violent of the conflict so far.' Reporting for the Nigerian media site HumAngle, Nalova Akua visited both Anglophone regions and said reprisal killings between separatists and security forces are a regular occurrence. 'The government has intensified its pursuit of a military solution to the conflict, hoping to take advantage of widening fragmentation between the armed separatist groups,' she wrote. Serwat said ACLED data shows a rise in infighting between separatist groups often trying to control small areas. Coupled with their increased illicit economic activity, kidnapping for ransom and targeting of civilians, the separatists appear to be moving further from the goal of independence and closer towards self-preservation, he believes. 'We certainly have seen the interests of armed groups become more and more localized,' he said. 'I think there’s less and less espoused interest in creating an entire separate country. The fragmentation of this conflict is increasing the levels of violence, but it’s also weakening the bargaining position of the separatist movement, which I think makes peace negotiations more difficult. There are more groups with more competing interests, so bringing those groups to the table can be quite challenging.' Simon Munzu, retired chair of the Coalition of Cameroon Federalist Groups and Activists steering committee and a former United Nations assistant secretary-general, has criticized Cameroon’s attempts at dialogue and peace-making, which have fizzled in recent years. 'All those measures have failed because the government is acting in bad faith,' he told HumAngle. 'It refuses to acknowledge the exact nature of the Anglophone problem. It therefore refuses to adopt real solutions that could resolve the problem and end the crisis. The measures it has taken so far are purely cosmetic.'	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWf-aJvzXPOcy9p67zXoM_VI	2025-01-06T16:15:08-08:00	
Join The Army; Travel To Exotic, Distant Lands; And Radicalize – ...	It has been popular to see political and religious radicalisation as something oddly separable from institutions of state. State institutions are meant to cope and cure the condition, not foster it. Like some errant form, it takes place because of popular trends, messages floating in the detritus of the internet and the disrupting buzz and slurry of social media. It catches in conversation like a cold, inspiring the estranged, confused and lonely to take action. Of late, the righteous types in the military have been confronted by the prospect that their citadel of honourable service and upstanding behaviour could be a foundry for extremism and mental mutilation. Is there any more extremist act than killing someone, often nameless to the killer, and being lauded for it? Anything more horrific than enlisting thousands to fight and die in a war inexplicable, incomprehensible, or even illegal? Anyone who goes to war is normalised for the task of killing and rendered abnormal for the tragic aftermath of living. The conclusion of hostilities for the combatant becomes a cruel suspension of one reality and its replacement by another. Having engaged in legalised murder and maiming in battle, the recruits who fight for a country return to a state that repudiates their experiences as situationally quaint while demanding their smooth assimilation. Killing is no longer excusable or legal. A life of domestic, suburban decay before numbing screens and dulling consumption is. The recent events of death and mayhem in New Orleans and Las Vegas, both taking place on New Year’s Day, involved US military personnel, former and current. Shamsud-Din Jabbar, from Houston, killed 14 people and injured 35 others in New Orleans after driving a pickup truck into a crowd on Bourbon Street. He was subsequently killed by police. Between 2007 and 2020, he had stints in the US Army as a human resource specialist and information technology specialist, a period which also included deployment to Afghanistan between February 2009 to January 2010. Master Sgt Matthew Alan Livelsberger was serving as a soldier in US Army Special Operations, using his time for approved leave to detonate a Tesla Cybertruck at the Trump hotel in Las Vegas. He left a note expressing a need to 'cleanse' his mind of the lost lives he had known and 'the burden of the lives I took.' These incidents have supplied the usual candy floss to seekers of the consultancy fee and the Oedipal school of mother-father-son confusion, scarring family collapse and economic stress. This is the clipboard assessment of Jabbar from Heidi Beirich of the Global Project Against Hate and Extremism: 'the collapse of his family background, his multiple divorces, financial problems' are given a thick underlining. She authoritatively states that 'mass attackers' tend to have sundered family lives. 'And then there’s the issue of him being a veteran and if that might have played a role.' Whenever the military is mentioned, cautionary notes are appended. Clinical and forensic psychologist Joel A. Dvoskin warns against pointing an accusing finger against the glorious institution that is the US Army. 'The Army is a vast organization with all kinds of different people and all kinds of different training experiences,' he observes. Dvoskin adopts an intellectually curious approach: If a link between military service and mass casualty attacks could be found, it should only be used constructively. The material on military experience stimulating radicalisation is becoming a merry pile. Academics seek tenure for work on this subject. Think tanks are gibbering for grants and scratching for influence in this field. All are wondering about the links between the uniformed experience and the socially calamitous meltdown that results in suicide, homicide or both. Much of this jolting fascination can be put down to the background of those with military blooding who were arrested for participating in the January 6, 2021 storming of the US Capitol. The Profiles of Individual Radicalization in the United States (PIRUS) has also become a source of interest, being a dataset of over 3,500 violent and non-violent extremists of various persuasions in the US, from the far left to the far right, Islamist beliefs, or single burning issues between 1948-2022. Those working for the national consortium for the Study of Terrorism and Responses to Terrorism (START), note in a research brief from June 2023 that 170 individuals with US military service records plotted 144 mass casualty terrorist attacks on US soil, representing a quarter of all those who plotted mass casualty extremist attacks between 1990 and 2022. The researchers argue that a military service record is a more reliable way of classifying mass casualty offenders identified in the PIRUS dataset than other more common considerations such as mental health issues, lone or small group offending, and having a criminal history prior to radicalisation. Those with US military records were '2.41 times more likely to be classified as mass casualty offenders than individuals who did not serve in the armed forces.' Those with such records were also abundantly linked to far-right domestic extremist groups and movements (73.5%), while 15%, or 24 offenders, 'were inspired by or connected to foreign Islamist extremist groups' such as al-Qaeda and the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria. Rich Groen, Jabbar’s former commander, has not twigged to the vicissitudes his own sacred line of work entails. He reflected on Jabbar being 'a great soldier, someone who showed discipline and dedication', a point made as if to preclude the possibility that violence in civilian life might ever be out of order. 'To think that the same individual who once embodied quiet professionalism could harbor so much hate, leading to such unspeakable atrocities, is incomprehensible and heartbreaking.' Heartbreaking, yes; incomprehensible, hardly. The unfashionable and unpopular lesson here would be to cut back on that most extremist of phenomena: the business of war and the military racket that feeds it. Don’t needlessly place personnel in conditions that will torment their being and deprive them of a moral compass. Could there be any better prevention to this than peace itself?	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWf-aJvzXPOcy07HwURIRBmD	2025-01-06T16:12:53-08:00	
Zelenskyy Calls For US Security Guarantees, Seeks Early Trump Mee...	(RFE/RL) -- Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy says any security guarantees for his country to end the war with Russia would only be meaningful if they were provided by the United States and that he hopes to meet with President-elect Donald Trump soon after his January 20 inauguration. 'Without the United States, security guarantees are not possible,' he said in a three-hour interview published on January 5 with U.S. podcaster Lex Fridman. 'I mean security guarantees that can prevent Russian aggression.' In the interview, which took place in Kyiv and in English, Ukrainian, and even Russian at times, Zelenskiy stressed his belief that any cease-fire without security guarantees for Kyiv would be used by the Kremlin as an opportunity to resupply and reorganize for new offensives. As the third anniversary of Russia's unprovoked, full-scale invasion approaches on February 24, the death and destruction continues in many Ukrainian cities -- mainly in the east and in territory occupied by Kremlin forces -- and across the border in Russia's Kursk region. Uncertain times lie ahead for Kyiv, with Trump set to reclaim the White House on January 20. Trump, who has vocally criticized the volume of U.S. aid to Ukraine, has repeatedly vowed to bring the conflict to a quick end, though he has provided few details. Many Ukraine supporters are concerned he will press terms unacceptable to Kyiv. A push for a cease-fire is almost certain, however, in light of Trump's promises to end the war quickly. The outgoing administration of President Joe Biden shepherded some $60 billion to Ukraine in weapons, equipment, and other aid over the past four years. Zelenskiy has a long, difficult history with the incoming president. Trump's first impeachment as president in 2019 was sparked by a phone call between Trump and Zelenskiy in which Trump appeared to condition U.S. military aid on Zelenskiy ordering a criminal investigation of Biden. Trump has taken aim at Zelenskiy several times. During his presidential campaign, he repeated his description of the Ukrainian president as 'the greatest salesman in the world' -- a reference to the tens of billions of dollars in aid that lawmakers from both sides of the aisle have approved since the start of Russia's full-scale invasion. However, in the interview, Zelenskiy said he is confident Trump will help bring a fair, sustainable peace deal, along with the required security assurances. 'Trump and I will come to an agreement and...offer strong security guarantees, together with Europe, and then we can talk to the Russians,' Zelenskiy said. 'We and Trump come first, and Europe will support Ukraine's position,' he said. 'I think that President Trump not only has the will, he has all these possibilities, and it's not just talk,' Zelenskiy added. 'I really count on him, and I think that our people really count on him, so he has enough power to pressure him, to pressure [Russian President Vladimir] Putin.' Asked what he would need to consider a cease-fire, Zelenskiy said security guarantees, preferably within the NATO alliance -- something Putin has vehemently opposed. NATO membership was one of the Kremlin's original grievances used to justify the February 2022 invasion of Ukraine. In any settlement, Zelenskiy said, Western partners should, at the least, guarantee security in Ukrainian territory not now occupied by Russia, continue to supply military assistance, and to keep in place the economic sanctions that have devastated Russia's economy. 'If we do not have security guarantees, Putin will come again,' he said. Zelenskiy said Putin's goals are to bring about 'a weak NATO' and a 'Ukraine which cannot survive on the battlefield,' and to 'prevent me from building a strong relationship with Trump.' Zelenskiy also relayed what he said was a phone conversation with close Kremlin ally Alyaksandr Lukashenka, the authoritarian ruler of neighboring Belarus. Zelenskiy said that in the first days following Russia's full-scale invasion, Lukashenka apologized for the missiles that were fired from Belarus territory. 'He said that 'it was not me. Missiles were launched from my territory and Putin was the one launching them.'' Zelenskiy said the Belarus strongman told him: 'Volodymyr, this is not me. I'm not in charge.... I’m not in charge. These are just missiles. This is Putin.' 'I told him, 'You are a murderer, too, I’m just saying.' He told me, 'You must understand, you can't fight the Russians.''	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWf-aJvzXPOcy2UTva45hBOi	2025-01-06T16:11:08-08:00	
Ex-Malaysian PM Najib’s House Arrest Bid Gets Boost Through Court...	By Iman Muttaqin Yusof, Muzliza Mustafa, and Noah Lee A Malaysian court has boosted incarcerated former Prime Minister Najib Razak’s attempt to serve the remainder of his six-year sentence at home, saying the government didn’t adequately challenge the bid. This means the case goes back to the High Court, which now has to hear Najib’s application to review his sentence. It refused to do so last year, citing a lack of evidence. Najib, 71, has claimed since April that the king issued a decree on Jan. 29, 2024, a day before the monarch’s term ended, permitting house arrest but that the government did not announce it. The Court of Appeal, in a 2-1 decision on Monday that overturned the earlier one, said the applicant 'only needs to show that he or she has a good arguable case premised on the fact that his interests or rights have been aggrieved' and he had demonstrated that. '[W]e are therefore minded to allow the appeal. We hereby order the matter to be remitted to the High Court to hear the [case] but before a different judge,' the appeals court said. 'The fact that there is no rebuttal evidence from the respondents challenging the [decree’s] existence ... is rather compelling. This court cannot simply ignore the existence of the order.' The appeals court also allowed Najib to present what his lawyer said was new evidence to the High Court – a hearing is set for Jan. 13. ‘Valid and authentic’ The new evidence is a Jan. 4 letter to Najib’s eldest son signed by the office of the ex-king stating that the royal did issue a decree permitting Najib to finish his sentence under house arrest. Sultan Abdullah Sultan Ahmad Shah, the former king, is the ruler of Pahang state, from where Najib hails. In a rare response to a media request, the sultan’s palace confirmed to BenarNews that the letter and its contents were authentic. 'Please be informed that the letter dated Jan. 4, 2025, signed by [the royal administrator] … is valid and authentic,' the email response from the Pahang palace stated. In its judgment, the appeals court said there was 'no justification for ignoring the existence of this order.' BenarNews contacted the Attorney General office for comment, but did not immediately hear back. In July 2020, the Kuala Lumpur High Court found Najib guilty of illegally receiving 42 million ringgit (U.S. $9.3 million), in a case linked to the scandal-ridden Malaysian sovereign fund 1MDB. After a series of appeals, the country’s highest court in August 2022upheld his conviction from two years earlier and ordered he be sent to prison to serve his 12-year sentence, which was later reduced to six years. Najib has several cases against him related to the plunder of state fund 1Malaysia Development Berhad. Investigators estimate that more than $4.5 billion was stolen from 1MDB through fraudulent shell companies for corrupt government and bank officials and their associates. Hours after Monday’s court’s ruling, the government reiterated that it had no knowledge of the decree permitting house arrest. Najib claims this royal directive was issued as a 'supplementary decree,' adding to the one the king issued halving his 12-year sentence. Home Minister Saifuddin Nasution Ismail said the prison department had not received any directive for Najib’s house arrest when it was informed about his sentence reduction. 'It is important to clarify any misconceptions about the Home Ministry, especially the prison department, for not obeying the order,' he said. 'How can we execute an order that does not exist in the letter?' Meanwhile, the Anwar Ibrahim government was criticized for what was perceived as yet another occasion that it failed to prepare for a big case. Najib’s United Malays National Organization (UMNO) is a key partnerin Prime Minister Anwar’s ruling coalition. And recent legal victories for the ex-PM, his associates and his party members, have raised questions about the government influencing the judiciary. Anwar has consistently denied such charges. Commenting on the recent acquittal of former first lady Rosmah Mansor – Najib’s wife – local media quoted him as positing a theory for cases that saw charges being dropped, and acquittals. According to Anwar, after UMNO’s historic election defeat in 2018, prosecutions, driven and rushed by 'venom, enmity, and political vengeance,' led to them being 'flawed.' Political analyst Azmil Mohd Tayeb said the appeals court’s ruling had set a 'dangerous precedent' that reinforced perceptions of impunity for the elite. 'This [ruling] signals [there are] two sets of laws – one for the elites and another for ordinary citizens,' Azmil, a political scientist at Universiti Sains Malaysia, told BenarNews. Another analyst, Syaza Syukri of the International Islamic University Malaysia, noted that Malaysia’s elites have often avoided accountability. 'Just that Najib got attention because he was a Prime Minister and of course due to [the scale of the scandal],'she told BenarNews. 'This is nothing new in the grand scheme of things.'	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWf-aJvzXPOcy7zHazzVaGnc	2025-01-06T16:09:31-08:00	
Italy: Opposition Press Meloni Over Musk’s Alleged SpaceX Deal	By Nicoletta Ionta (EurActiv) -- Italian opposition parties have challenged Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni’s alleged €1.5 billion security deal with Elon Musk’s SpaceX, demanding clarification in parliament. The parties are voicing concerns over a reported five-year contract between the government and Elon Musk's SpaceX, aimed at creating a secure telecommunications system for government use. Initial reports by Bloomberg on Sunday suggested the Italian government is in talks with SpaceX, with the project already receiving approval from Italy's Intelligence Services and the Defence Ministry. Touted as the largest project of its kind in Europe, the reported plan is for SpaceX to provide secure internet via its Starlink system for Italian government operations, communication services for the military in the Mediterranean, and direct-to-cell satellite services for emergencies like terrorist attacks or natural disasters. In a statement on Monday, the Italian government denied that any contracts or agreements had been signed with SpaceX. The statement did not clarify whether the government was engaged in ongoing negotiations with SpaceX over such a deal. Instead, the government said that the talks are 'part of the normal consultations that State institutions have with companies.' Musk also did not confirm the reports, but stated on X that he is ready to 'provide Italy with the most secure and advanced connectivity!' The news shook the opposition ranks, which united in calling out the alleged deal and demanding clarification from Meloni. 'The statement does not clarify whether talks are ongoing with Starlink,' said members of the centre-left Democratic Party (S&D) in a joint statement. Democratic Party leader Elly Schlein deemed the denial 'completely insufficient' and called on Meloni to provide clarification from the government in Parliament. 'Italy is not selling out,' she added. Former Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte, head of the opposition Five Star Movement (The Left), accused the government of handing national security to Musk for 'the modest sum of €1.5 billion in public funds.' 'Can all of this be decided based on personal ties between our Prime Minister and one of the aspiring 'masters of the world'?' Conte said. 'Nobody has abolished Parliament,' former liberal Prime Minister Matteo Renzi said. 'The government cannot give one and a half billion to a private entity without a tender or any public transparency.' The news came shortly after Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni's unexpected visit to Mar-a-Lago, US President-elect Donald Trump's residence, on Sunday. The Italian government however, clarified that the matter of SpaceX was not discussed during the visit, describing such claims as 'simply ridiculous'.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWf-aJvzXPOcyycTq3AwOrFJ	2025-01-06T16:07:43-08:00	
The Horn Of Africa States: The Tragedy Of Non-Application Of Soma...	The Somali Xeer is often said to be the soul of the Somali nation, a people who live across many countries today, but mostly in Somalia proper, the Republic of Djibouti, the Federal Republic of Ethiopia and the Republic of Kenya. Many critics of the Somali Xeer limit its application and applicability to Somalia only and ignoring the fact that the Somali nation and territory was divided during the colonial times into these four countries. Although the Somali Xeer, was largely replaced by state legal and court systems, it still remains the core legal system, which governs the Somali way of life. The Somali Xeer is wide and covers many aspects of life including conduct of marriages, festivals, sharing, facing calamities, wars, crime, and many others. However, the Somali Xeer is said to fall short of addressing some issues including the issue of individual responsibility, where a perpetrator of a crime is not individually responsible for his transgression, exclusion of women from the Tree or the court, and the unfair treatment of marginalized groups and minorities. The Somali Xeer is a framework which keeps communities to live together. Communities are often families and protection of family honor was and is the basis of a typical Somali way of life. If a member of a family commits an error, it is treated as a collective error of the family, and they all bear responsibility together. The Somali is the only insured person in the world not by an insurance company but by his family or clan affiliation. It is a sword with two edges, where on the one hand, the individual receives help of the whole family, while a family shares the benefit or compensation received as a result of a member being a victim. However, as state-building resumes and state-legal systems develop, this collective responsibility can and will be transformed into individual responsibility. The Somali Xeer is not static but adaptable and handles all issues. The core system of an issue is first to check whether a situation has occurred before or is new. This is called the Curad (Precedence) or Ugub (New) issue of matters. Similarly the issue exclusion of women is not as generally presented. Women were always involved in Somali affairs and even played prominent roles in determining the life systems of the Somali people. However, issues of women modesty and honor was also respected but they were and still are allowed to participate through giving evidence or observe discussions and hearings under the Tree. There is nothing that prevents them from participating in a Somali court system today and the Somali Xeer can easily adapt a renovation in this regard. As noted earlier, it is an adaptable system which accepts new situations and conditions, and which creates solutions for these new situations and conditions. One should note that it is man-made, and that, therefore, it is not perfect. There is no reason, why it should not address all aspects of modern life systems. Contrary to defining the Somali Xeer as a system of addressing only peace issues and conflict resolution mechanisms, it is much wider and covers all aspects of life. Unlike more modern legal systems, it protects the interests of all, without undue pressure on an individual and provides a healing process for a community. The Somali Xeer or the Laws of Somalis is an effective way of providing justice and is said to be superior to democratic laws in many ways. One could read the book 'The law of the Somalis: A Stable Foundation for Economic Development in the Horn of Africa – January 1, 2012, by Michael Van Notten) for more details. The Somali Xeer addresses property rights, laws of contracting, and delivers justice and this was done much earlier than modern democratic societies. It has, indeed, no foreign words in the delivery of its processes and procedures evidencing that it was developed locally in the very Horn of Africa in the Somali language. It would appear that there is a need for applying the Somali Xeer with respect to settling the current ongoing civil conflict in the country. This would be good for both Somalia and the countries interested in it. Its geostrategic location, its resources which include its resilient population and others, in terms of minerals, agriculture, blue economy, all need a peaceful place and not the turbulent country, it currently presents itself. It is clear the political class of Somalia today, both in governance and in the opposition, is corrupt and unpatriotic and would not bring forth a stable, peaceful, and developing country. It is why the silent majority, the really good people of Somalia, should come forward to reclaim their country and reform it through the application of its traditional legal systems and conflict resolution mechanisms, which have kept the Somali way of life for millennia before. This does not mean that the current political class should be punished as in non-Somali legal systems. Offenders of the system according to the Somali Xeer, are not generally punished but rehabilitated and victims are compensated. Perhaps an innovation could be added where the wrong gains they made at the expense of the nation can be recovered to build schools and medical facilities and roads for the people, but allowing them enough to live off comfortably, as previous leaders of the country, who erred. We should not ignore the fact that a Somali is insured under the Somali Xeer through the clan or family infrastructure, who collectively assume the wrong doings of one of theirs. It was considered shameful for a clan member to cause such distress for the clan. This should still be the case under the current circumstances, if the nation has to recover from the chaos and its shameful situation. The Somali Xeer or the Law of the Somalis was and is perfectly capable of making and maintaining peace and always protected the Somali nation from within and from without. But it appears that democratic processes which the Somalis hardly understand have been imposed on the people, which divides them even more – to differing classes, which Somalis have no experience of handling – ruling and ruled classes. No wonder there is chaos in the country and in the political system. The Somali people are a people who learned how to live in peace through consensus and compromise throughout history in the harsh environment in which they live. They lived and thrived through this system. Even the greetings among Somalis is 'Ma Nabadbaa?' or 'Is it Peaceful?' when one encounters another. They attached a lot of importance to peace among themselves to even call the title of their chieftains the 'Nabad-doon' or the 'Peacemaker.' It is when there is peace that life grows, and people go about their normal daily chores like farming, animal husbandry, fishing, building, irrigation, drilling for water wells and so on. The beauty of the system is that it is acceptable from one corner of the Somali territories to the other, i.e., from Djibouti to the Estuary of Tana River in Kenya to Moyale and Haadamo in Ethiopia to Ras Asyer in the very Horn of Africa and everywhere in between – some 1.3 million square kilometers of land. Complimented by the singularity of their faith, Islam, and their tongue, Somali, there was no reason to have been divided. However, divided now, they are and we are dealing only with present day Somalia, which should revisit the application of the traditional legal system of the country and people, the Laws of the Somalis or the Somali Xeer. It is the system which enables Somalis to survive through situations many other nations would have by now succumbed and perished. Somalis still look after each other through this system across the globe and this solidarity is the basis of the Somali Xeer, which should be deployed to solve the seemingly intractable political chaos of the current political class.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfBQcmBWoRa7mZUeETBuXim	2025-01-06T16:03:18-08:00	
Dalai Lama Gets Stirring Welcome In South India For Extended Stay	By Pema Ngodup, Dickey Kundol and Tenzin Dhonyoe The Dalai Lama on Sunday received a stirring welcome in South India, where more than 10,000 ethnic Tibetans lined the streets to greet the Tibetan Buddhist spiritual leader as he arrived for an extended stay at the Tashi Lhunpo Monastery in Bylakuppe. It was his first visit to the Bylakuppe Tibetan Settlement in the Indian state of Karnataka — the largest Tibetan settlement in the world outside Tibet — in over seven years. An estimated 70,000 Tibetans live in the community, which was established on land leased by the state government for Tibetans who resettled in India after 1959. That was the year the 14th Dalai Lama fled to India alongside thousands of Tibetans after a failed uprising against Chinese rule. The trip also marked the Dalai Lama’s first domestic travel within India after his return to his residence in Dharamsala in the northern part of the county in late August 2024, following a two-month stay in the United States, where he underwent a successful knee replacement surgery in New York. The visit comes as the Dalai Lama, 89, tries to allay concerns over his general health amid questions about his successor. The Chinese government insists it will select the 15th Dalai Lama, though Tibetan Buddhists believe in the reincarnation of their spiritual leaders.The Dalai Lama, who has said he expects to live to be over 100 years old to fulfill the wishes of the Tibetan people, has stated that his incarnation could be found in India. 'Today, I have come to Tashi Lhunpo Monastery which was founded by Gyalwa Gendun Drub, the First Dalai Lama,' he said, at a reception ceremony in the monastery. 'As his successor, I feel happy and honored to be here today,' The Tashi Lhunpo Monastery, known as the seat of the Panchen Lama, was founded in 1447 in Shigatse, Tibet, by the first Dalai Lama, Gyalwa Gendun Drub. After China’s occupation of Tibet, the monastery was re-established in Bylakuppe, South India, in 1972 by senior monks under the guidance of the Dalai Lama. 'In Tibet, the Tashi Lhunpo Monastery was renowned for the quality of the monks’ studies of Buddhist philosophy and logic,' he said. 'It is one of Tibet’s most important monasteries,' the Dalai Lama said. The exact duration of the Dalai Lama’s 'extended stay' in South India has not been disclosed. Local Tibetan officials told RFA that the primary purpose of his visit is to rest and enjoy the warmer climate of South India in the winter, and that, as such, no major teachings have, as yet, been planned. However, from Wednesday onwards, public blessings for the Tibetan people are expected to be held three times a week — every from Monday, Wednesday and Friday — with the initial rounds to focus on Tibetans aged 80 and above, according to the Dalai Lama’s office. Rousing welcome The Dalai Lama left his residence in Dharamsala on Jan. 3 for an overnight stay in the Indian capital New Delhi, from where he made a journey to Bangalore the following day. There, hundreds of Tibetan professionals, students and businessmen dressed in their traditional best greeted him with incense, flowers and silk scarves. On Jan. 5, the Dalai Lama flew by helicopter from Bangalore to the Bylakuppe settlement. All along the more than 5-kilometer (3-mile) stretch of road leading to the Tashi Lhunpo Monastery, thousands of Tibetans carrying traditional silk scarves and incense welcomed him amid the sounds of cymbals, drums and horns, as monks and nuns chanted. 'All of us residents of the Tibetan settlements in South India are very fortunate that His Holiness is here,' said Namgyal, who hails from the Doeguling Tibetan Settlement in Mundgod, about 400 kilometers (250 miles) north of Bylakuppe. 'Even though I’m old, I’ve made the journey to be here to satisfy my heart’s desire to see His Holiness,' he said. Tsewang Dolma, an elderly woman from the Tibetan settlement in Hunsur, over 40 kilometers (25 miles) east of Bylakuppe, said she was elated about the visit. 'I feel very emotional and am almost tearing up,' she told Radio Free Asia, while holding a bouquet of flowers to welcome the Dalai Lama. 'All I pray for is that he lives a long, long life.' Role of Buddhist monasteries The Dalai Lama’s last visit to Bylakuppe was in December 2017, during which he gave Buddhist teachings at Sera Jey and Sera Mey monasteries. In his address at Tashi Lhunpo Monastery, where the heads of all the different Tibetan monastic institutions were gathered, the Dalai Lama emphasized the critical importance of monasteries in serving as 'centers of learning' for Buddhist study and practice. 'As I have always advised, the principal purpose of a monastery is to serve as a center of learning where monks and nuns have the opportunity to study and put into practice the Buddha’s teachings,' he said. 'Members of all the monastic institutions should strive to uphold the Buddha’s teachings, particularly in this degenerate age,' the Dalai Lama said, while noting the growing interest in Buddhism in China and other regions. 'Today, many people around the world who are not Buddhists are taking an interest in the Buddha’s teachings,' he added. 'These include scientists who value the Buddhist tradition’s emphasis and use of reason and logic.'	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfBQcmBWoRa7ro9nDtGbizL	2025-01-06T16:00:53-08:00	
Pentagon Announces Transfer Of 11 Yemeni Detainees From Guantanam...	The Department of Defense announced Monday the resettlement of 11 Yemeni detainees from the detention facility at Guantanamo Bay to the Government of Oman. The 11 detainees are: Uthman Abd al-Rahim Muhammad Uthman (ISN 27), Moath Hamza Ahmed al-Alwi (ISN 28), Khalid Ahmed Qassim (ISN 242), Suhayl Abdul Anam al Sharabi (ISN 569), Hani Saleh Rashid Abdullah (ISN 841), Tawfiq Nasir Awad Al-Bihani (ISN 893), Omar Mohammed Ali al-Rammah (ISN 1017), Sanad Ali Yislam Al Kazimi (ISN 1453), Hassan Muhammad Ali Bib Attash (ISN 1456), Sharqawi Abdu Ali Al Hajj (ISN 1457), and Abd Al-Salam Al-Hilah (ISN 1463). Tawfiq Nasir Awad Al-Bihani (ISN 893) was deemed transfer eligible by the process established by the 2009 Executive Order 13492, 'Review of Disposition of Individuals Detained at the Guantanamo Bay Naval Base and Closure of Detention Facilities.' The other 10 Yemeni GTMO detainees transferred to the Government of Oman were determined eligible for transfer under the Periodic Review Board process established by Executive Order 13567, 'Periodic Review of Individuals Detained at Guantanamo Bay Naval Station Pursuant to the Authorization for the Use of Military Force.' Although different processes, each of the 10 Yemeni detainees underwent a thorough, interagency review by career professionals who unanimously determined all detainees as transfer eligible consistent with the national security interests of the United States. On Sept. 15, 2023, Secretary of Defense Austin notified Congress of his intent to repatriate these 11 Yemeni detainees to the Government of Oman and, in consultation with our partners in Oman, we completed the requirements for transfer. The United States appreciates the willingness of the Government of Oman and other partners to support ongoing U.S. efforts focused on responsibly reducing the detainee population and ultimately closing the Guantanamo Bay facility. The PRB process was established by the President’s March 7, 2011, Executive Order 13567. It is consistent with section 1023 of the National Defense Authorization Act for fiscal year 2012 and affirmed in Executive Order 13823 (Jan. 30, 2018). The PRB panel consists of senior career officials from the Departments of Defense, Homeland Security, Justice, and State, along with the Joint Staff and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence. The PRB determined by consensus that continued law of war detention was no longer necessary to protect against a continuing significant threat to the national security of the United States and that any national security risk from these 10 Yemeni detainees could be adequately mitigated. Pursuant to Executive Order 13567, that determination became final after all Principals concurred. As of today, 15 detainees remain at Guantanamo Bay: 3 are eligible for transfer; 3 are eligible for a Periodic Review Board; 7 are involved in the military commissions process; and 2 detainees have been convicted and sentenced by military commissions.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfBQcmBWoRa7m-QV7RMz2i-	2025-01-06T15:59:31-08:00	
Iran To Station New Air Defense Systems At Sensitive Sites	The commander of the Khatam al-Anbia Air Defense Base -the central headquarters of Iran’s Air Defense- said a series of new and secret air defense systems have been installed near the country’s sensitive locations. Brigadier General Qader Rahimzadeh announced on Monday that the air defense forces from the Army and the Islamic Revolution Guards Corps (IRGC) will stage a joint large-scale war game in coming days. He noted that the Army and the IRGC air defense units have stationed a series of new systems, which are unknown to the enemies, near the sensitive centers of Iran, adding that the equipment will be employed in the forthcoming exercise. The forces participating in the drill will be practicing the skills they have been trained in during the past year, the general stated, saying the exercises are designed considering the enemies’ movements and the Iranian air defense needs. In remarks in 2018, Leader of the Islamic Revolution Ayatollah Seyed Ali Khamenei described the air defense base as a very crucial part of the Armed Forces that is at the frontline of confronting enemies of Iran. The Leader also stressed the importance of accelerating the capabilities of the base and the Air Forces' staff.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfBQcmBWoRa7t1siAvHAKPk	2025-01-06T15:56:00-08:00	
Protected Areas Provide Habitat For Threatened Lynx, But Wildfire...	Canada lynx are specialized hunters, able to travel in deep snow and spot prey in the darkness from 250 feet away. Keen hearing and vision make them excellent trackers, but what do we learn by turning the tables and tracking them? Scientists are using GPS data and advanced modeling to refine maps and identify important habitat characteristics, particularly in the forests of western Colorado, southern Wyoming, and northern New Mexico, the southernmost extent of its range. New research and updated maps show that more than half of lynx habitat in the southern Rocky Mountains overlaps protected areas like wilderness and national parks. The maps also show that lynx habitat is sparse, patchy, and poorly connected, existing only in narrow bands due to Colorado’s complex mountainous terrain. These maps can identify corridors where habitat loss affects animal movement, which is important for healthy populations. Updated maps help managers focus conservation efforts and pinpoint places to promote new habitat, especially given the frequency of human development, fire, and forest insect outbreaks near the edges of lynx range. Lynx in the western US prefer high elevation spruce-fir forests with tree branches hanging close to the snow or ground surface, providing dense horizontal cover. This forest structure supports the cat’s favorite prey, snowshoe hares, which can make up 90 percent of their diet in winter. Lynx were reintroduced to the southern Rockies over two decades ago, after populations had fallen below a self-sustaining level. Several generations of females and kittens have successfully established here, allowing these populations to bounce back. Researchers used GPS collars to track lynx within the study area, focused on the southern extent of its range. They also considered over 40 habitat or environmental characteristics, such as the amount of precipitation as snow versus rain, the month with the coldest temperature, road density, vegetation, and slope position. Combining GPS and habitat data and using state-of-the-art statistical tools and modeling methods, these scientists identified which characteristics best predicted where lynx were found and used this information to map 'likely' lynx habitat where cats have a high probability of living, breeding, and successfully raising young. Then they took this information one step further, comparing 'likely' habitat with disturbances like insect outbreaks, wildfire, timber harvest, or human-footprint impacts such as urbanization or ski resorts. The scientists found that around one-third of likely habitat overlapped with disturbance, including forest insect outbreaks (31 percent), wildfire (5 percent), and forest management activities like tree harvest and prescribed burning (3 percent). Despite the greater overlap of lynx habitat with insect outbreaks, the scientists are more concerned by the impacts of severe wildfires. 'We know that lynx continue to occupy areas after insects kill the overstory trees during spruce-beetle outbreaks. Forests impacted by spruce beetles still have enough young conifer trees in the understory to support hares,' said Dr. John Squires, the study's principal investigator and a Rocky Mountain Research Station research wildlife biologist. 'Also, some tree species like subalpine fir often survive spruce beetle attacks. That means that forest insects represent a more benign threat to lynx compared to broad-scale, high-severity wildfire.' The researchers found that lynx tend to avoid fire-impacted areas until the understory has regrown–a process that takes upwards of 50 years in subalpine forests in the southern Rockies, where fires tend to burn less frequently than lower elevation forests and are often stand-replacing. 'Although fire disturbance from 1990-2022 overlapped only 5 percent of likely lynx habitat in this area, we believe that frequent, high-severity fire is the main risk to lynx in high-elevation forests moving forward,' continued Squires. 'We were surprised at how little lynx habitat overlapped areas of managed forest and human development,' said Dr. Lucretia Olson, study coauthor and a Rocky Mountain Research Station ecologist. 'While forest management mainly causes temporary habitat changes, activities like urbanization and developing or expanding ski areas often lead to permanent losses. We hope our work will reach managers who make complex decisions about land uses.' Squires stressed the value of partnerships for conducting this research: 'Close collaboration across state and federal agencies in terms of data sharing, logistical support, and added expertise made this research possible.'	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfBQcmBWoRa7nsOUTITgv_b	2025-01-06T15:54:01-08:00	
AI Slashes Cost And Time For Chip Design, But That Is Not All	Specialized microchips that manage signals at the cutting edge of wireless technology are astounding works of miniaturization and engineering. They’re also difficult and expensive to design. Now, researchers at Princeton Engineering and the Indian Institute of Technology have harnessed artificial intelligence to take a key step toward slashing the time and cost of designing new wireless chips and discovering new functionalities to meet expanding demands for better wireless speed and performance. In an article published in Nature Communications, the researchers describe their methodology, in which an AI creates complicated electromagnetic structures and associated circuits in microchips based on the design parameters. What used to take weeks of highly skilled work can now be accomplished in hours. What is more, the AI behind the new system has produced strange new designs featuring unusual patterns of circuitry. Kaushik Sengupta, the lead researcher, said the designs were unintuitive and unlikely to be developed by a human mind. But they frequently offer marked improvements over even the best standard chips. 'We are coming up with structures that are complex and looks random shaped and when connected with circuits, they create previously unachievable performance. Humans cannot really understand them, but they can work better,' said Sengupta, a professor of electrical and computer engineering and co-director of NextG, Princeton’s industry partnership program to develop next-generation communications. These circuits can be engineered towards more energy efficient operation or to make them operable across an enormous frequency range that is not currently possible. Furthermore, the method synthesizes inherently complex structures in minutes, while conventional algorithms may take weeks. In some cases, the new methodology can create structures that are impossible to synthesize with current techniques. Uday Khankhoje, a co-author and associate professor of electrical engineering at IIT Madras, said the new technique not only delivers efficiency but promises to unlock new approaches to design challenges that have been beyond the capability of engineers. 'This work presents a compelling vision of the future,' he said. 'AI powers not just the acceleration of time-consuming electromagnetic simulations, but also enables exploration into a hitherto unexplored design space and delivers stunning high-performance devices that run counter to the usual rules of thumb and human intuition.' Wireless chips are a combination of standard electronic circuits like those in computer chips and electromagnetic structures including antennas, resonators, signal splitters, combiners and others. These combinations of elements are put together in every circuit block, carefully handcrafted and co-designed to operate optimally. This method is then scaled to other circuits, sub-systems and systems, making the design process extremely complex and time consuming, particularly for modern, high-performance chips behind applications like wireless communication, autonomous driving, radar and gesture recognition. 'Classical designs, carefully, put these circuits and electromagnetic elements together, piece by piece, so that the signal flows in the way we want it to flow in the chip. By changing those structures, we incorporate new properties,' Sengupta said. 'Before, we had a finite way of doing this, but now the options are much larger.' It can be hard to comprehend the vastness of a wireless chip’s design space. The circuitry in an advanced chip is so small, and the geometry so detailed, that the number of possible configurations for a chip exceeds the number of atoms in the universe, Sengupta said. There is no way for a person to understand that level of complexity, so human designers don’t try. They build chips from the bottom up, adding components as needed and adjusting the design as they build. The AI approaches the challenge from a different perspective, Sengupta said. It views the chip as a single artifact. This can lead to strange, but effective arrangements. He said humans play a critical role in the AI system, in part because that AI can make faulty arrangements as well as efficient ones. It is possible for AI to hallucinate elements that don’t work, at least for now. This requires some level of human oversight. 'There are pitfalls that still require human designers to correct,' Sengupta said. 'The point is not to replace human designers with tools. The point is to enhance productivity with new tools. The human mind is best utilized to create or invent new things, and the more mundane, utilitarian work can be offloaded to these tools.' The researchers have used AI to discover and design complex electromagnetic structures that are-co-designed with circuits to create broadband amplifiers. Sengupta said future research will involve linking multiple structures and designing entire wireless chips with the AI system. 'Now that this has shown promise, there is a larger effort to think about more complicated systems and designs,' he said. 'This is just the tip of the iceberg in terms of what the future holds for the field.'	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWdsHdRru1UVoGLfZrvquG-s	2025-01-06T15:48:24-08:00	
Beyond The ‘Dragon Arc,’ A Treasure Trove Of Unseen Stars	Looking halfway across the observable universe and expecting to see individual stars is considered a non-starter in astronomy, a bit like raising a pair of binoculars at the moon in hopes of making out individual grains of dust inside its craters. Thanks to a cosmic quirk of nature, however, an international team led by astronomers at the University of Arizona's Steward Observatory did just that. Using NASA's James Webb Space Telescope, or JWST, the research group observed a galaxy nearly 6.5 billion light-years from Earth, at a time when the universe was half its current age. In this distant galaxy, the team identified a large number of individual stars, made visible thanks to an effect known as gravitational lensing and JWST's high light collecting power. Published in the journal Nature Astronomy, the discovery marks a record-breaking achievement – the largest number of individual stars detected in the distant universe. It also provides a way to investigate one of the universe's greatest mysteries – dark matter. Most galaxies, including the Milky Way, contain tens of billions of stars. In nearby galaxies such as the Andromeda galaxy, astronomers can observe stars one by one. However, in galaxies billions of light-years away, stars appear blended together as their light needs to travel for billions of light-years before it reaches us, presenting a long-standing challenge to scientists studying how galaxies form and evolve. 'To us, galaxies that are very far away usually look like a diffuse, fuzzy blob,' said lead study author Yoshinobu Fudamoto, an assistant professor at Chiba University in Japan and a visiting scholar at Steward Observatory. 'But actually, those blobs consist of many, many individual stars. We just can't resolve them with our telescopes.' Recent advances in astronomy have opened new possibilities by leveraging gravitational lensing – a natural magnification effect caused by the strong gravitational fields of massive objects. As predicted by Albert Einstein, gravitational lenses can amplify the light of distant stars by factors of hundreds or even thousands, making them detectable with sensitive instruments like JWST. 'These findings have typically been limited to just one or two stars per galaxy,' Fudamoto said. 'To study stellar populations in a statistically meaningful way, we need many more observations of individual stars.' Fengwu Sun, a former U of A graduate student who is now a postdoctoral scholar at the Center for Astrophysics | Harvard & Smithsonian, stumbled on a treasure trove of such stars when he was inspecting JWST images of a galaxy known as the Dragon Arc, located along the line of sight from Earth behind a massive cluster of galaxies called Abell 370. Due to its gravitational lensing effect, Abell 370 stretches the Dragon Arc's signature spiral into an elongated shape – like a hall of mirrors of cosmic proportions. In December 2022 and 2023, JWST obtained two pictures of the Dragon Arc. Within these images, astronomers counted 44 individual stars whose brightness changed over time due to variations in the gravitational lensing landscape. 'This groundbreaking discovery demonstrates, for the first time, that studying large numbers of individual stars in a distant galaxy is possible,' Sun said – as long as nature is there to lend a helping hand. However, even extremely strong gravitational magnification from a galaxy cluster is not sufficient to magnify individual stars in galaxies even farther away. In this case, the discovery was made possible by a serendipitous alignment of 'lucky stars.' 'Inside the galaxy cluster, there are many stars floating around that are not bound by any galaxy,' said co-author Eiichi Egami, a research professor at Steward Observatory. 'When one of them happens to pass in front of the background star in the distant galaxy along the line of sight with Earth, it acts as a microlens, in addition to the macrolensing effect of the galaxy cluster as a whole.' The combined effects of macrolensing and microlensing dramatically increase the magnification factor, allowing JWST to pick up individual stars that otherwise would be too far and faint to be detected at all. Because the stars inside the magnifying cluster move relative to the target stars in the distant galaxy and Earth, the alignment of microlenses in this natural 'telescope' changes slightly over short timeframes – from a few days to a week. When they are perfectly aligned, the brightness and magnification of the distant stars increase dramatically, only to fade again shortly afterwards. 'By observing the same galaxy multiple times, we can spot stars in distant galaxies because they appear to pop in and out of existence,' Fudamoto said. 'This is a result of the varying effective magnifications from the macro- and microlensing effect as the microlensing stars move in and out of the line of sight.' The research team carefully analyzed colors of each of the stars inside the Dragon Arc and found that many are red supergiants, similar to Betelgeuse in the constellation of Orion, which is in the final stages of its life. This contrasts with earlier discoveries, which predominantly identified blue 'supergiants' similar to Rigel and Deneb, which are among the brightest stars in the night sky. According to the researchers, this difference in stellar types also highlights the unique power of JWST observations at infrared wavelengths that could detect stars at lower temperatures. Future JWST observations are expected to capture more magnified stars in the Dragon Arc galaxy. These efforts could lead to detailed studies of hundreds of stars in distant galaxies. Moreover, observations of individual stars could provide insight into the structure of gravitational lenses and even shed light on the elusive nature of dark matter.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWdsHdRru1UVoJkqqfhnNjbd	2025-01-06T15:44:16-08:00	
New Star In The East: Arakan Army – OpEd	The United League of Arakan (ULA) and its military wing Arakan Army may achieve the impossible -- independence for Myanmar's Rakhine province to fulfil the great Arakanese dream of regaining what they lost in 1784. If the ULA-AA manage to overrun the entire Rakhine province and declare independence, this will be the first successful secessionist campaign in Asia after the birth of Bangladesh in 1971. But Bangladesh was liberated by a decisive Indian military intervention, without which the Pakistan army would never have lost the war. Not to speak of the training and arming of tens of thousands of Bengali guerillas by India. On the other hand, the Arakanese rebels have fought their battles on their own and won decisive victories despite indiscriminate use of airpower by the Burmese military junta. And no major power has come forward to bolster the AA's armoury -- at least not openly. The AA commanders transitioned from guerrilla style hit-and-run warfare to conventional offensive battles, perfecting the encirclement tactics to enforce denial of supplies. In fact, they bettered the Kachin rebels who helped the battered nucleus of National Unity Party of Arakan (NUPA) raise the Arakan Army in the first decade of this century. The Kachin Independence Army has also captured much territory in their province, including the rare earth mines at Pangwa but they are not yet in sight of complete victory. The ULA-AA has already captured 15 of the 18 townships of the Rakhine (former Arakan) state of the Union of Myanmar. Only the renovated port of Sittwe done up as part of the India-funded Kaladan Multimodal Transport project, the China-funded deep-sea port of Kyaukphyu and the town of Munaung is in the hands of the Burmese military junta. On the last day of 2024, the Arakan Army overran the town of Gwa. Last week it had captured Ann, the headquarter of the western military regional command. It also overran Maungdaw and now control the entire border with Bangladesh. In fact, the ULA-AA has subtly warned Bangladesh not to back the Rohingya militants who fought alongside the military junta with support from their intelligence agencies. The Arakanese rebels are also upset over 'increasing atrocities on Buddhist minorities' in Chittagong Hill Tracts in Southeast Bangladesh. The Yunus-led interim government is already worried over the situation in Rakhine. Having established control over much of Rakhine and also taken control of the strategic river town of Paletwa in Chin state, the ULA-AA said in a statement on Sunday that it is agreeable to talk to the military junta. Referring to the Haigeng Agreement, a short-lived ceasefire agreement brokered by the Chinese in January 2024, the statement said that 'we always remain open to resolving the current internal issues through political means rather than military solutions.' The ULA statement, also published in Chinese, assures 'foreign countries' -- surely China and India--that it will protect their investments in Rakhine State. Hailing the 'active leadership of the People's Republic of China,' the statement said that the Arakan People's Revolutionary Government 'welcomes and recognizes all foreign investments that will bring benefits to the Arakan region and assist in its development and progress.' It added that the government 'will take special care to ensure the security and safety of those involved in investment activities, projects, and businesses.' The statement comes covert meetings between senior Arakan Army leaders and top security officials of both China and India. But it is not yet clear whether the ULA-AA will launch offensives straightaway to capture Sittwe and Kyaukphyu or wait to assess Chinese and Indian reactions. Their amazing military victories have been achieved despite extensive use of Burmese airpower and naval power. So the rebels may need a brief breather to regroup for one last big attack, but the real reason behind offering talks and assuring foreign investors is to seek time to assess the chances of diplomatic recognition if independence is indeed achieved. Without recognition by important countries, both in Asia and the West, the ULA-AA may not be able to complete its journey towards independent statehood. The two other members of the Three Brotherhood Alliance, the Ta'ang National Liberation Army (TNLA) and Myanmar National Democratic Alliance Army (MNDDA) have also agreed to resume their political talks with the military junta, under Chinese mediation. But they have refused to hand over the town of Lashio, headquarters of the northwestern military command, back to the military junta, as desired by China. If the Burmese military junta agrees to negotiate, the Arakanese rebels may not immediately push for independence but might explore possibilities of extensive federal autonomy with other ethnic armed organisations. That partly depends on how successful the other rebel groups are in their military offensives against the junta. Myanmar is clearly the new Syria in the east, but it is yet to attract the kind of global attention one would have expected.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWdsHdRru1UVoDz6UQInD2wU	2025-01-06T15:42:14-08:00	
New Study Links Millions Of Diabetes And Heart Disease Cases Glob...	A new study from researchers at the Gerald J. and Dorothy R. Friedman School of Nutrition Science and Policy at Tufts University, which published in Nature Medicine, estimates that 2.2 million new cases of type 2 diabetes and 1.2 million new cases of cardiovascular disease occur each year globally due to consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages. In developing countries, the case count is particularly sobering. In Sub-Saharan Africa, the study found that sugar-sweetened beverages contributed to more than 21% of all new diabetes cases. In Latin America and the Caribbean, they contributed to nearly 24% of new diabetes cases and more than 11% of new cases of cardiovascular disease. Colombia, Mexico, and South Africa are countries that have been particularly hard hit. More than 48% of all new diabetes cases in Colombia were attributable to consumption of sugary drinks. Nearly one third of all new diabetes cases in Mexico were linked to sugary drink consumption. In South Africa, 27.6% of new diabetes cases and 14.6% of cardiovascular disease cases were attributable to sugary drink consumption. Sugary beverages are rapidly digested, causing a spike in blood sugar levels with little nutritional value. Regular consumption over time leads to weight gain, insulin resistance, and a host of metabolic issues tied to type 2 diabetes and heart disease, two of the world’s leading causes of death. 'Sugar-sweetened beverages are heavily marketed and sold in low- and middle-income nations. Not only are these communities consuming harmful products, but they are also often less well equipped to deal with the long-term health consequences,' says Dariush Mozaffarian, senior author on the paper and director of the Food is Medicine Institute at the Friedman School. As countries develop and incomes rise, sugary drinks become more accessible and desirable, the authors say. Men are more likely than women to suffer the consequences of sugary drink consumption, as are younger adults compared to their older counterparts, the researchers say. 'We need urgent, evidence-based interventions to curb consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages globally, before even more lives are shortened by their effects on diabetes and heart disease,' says Laura Lara-Castor, NG24, first author on the paper who earned her Ph.D. at the Friedman School and is now at the University of Washington. The study’s authors call for a multi-pronged approach, including public health campaigns, regulation of sugary drink advertising, and taxes on sugar-sweetened beverages. Some countries have already taken steps in this direction. Mexico, which has one of the highest per capita rates of sugary drink consumption in the world, introduced a tax on the beverages in 2014. Early evidence suggests that the tax has been effective in reducing consumption, particularly among lower-income individuals. 'Much more needs to be done, especially in countries in Latin America and Africa where consumption is high and the health consequence severe,' says Mozaffarian, who is also Jean Mayer Professor of Nutrition at the Friedman School. 'As a species, we need to address sugar-sweetened beverage consumption.'	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfQyTUqXWCxDkD2j6aFUYXw	2025-01-06T15:40:31-08:00	
Marked Decrease In Arctic Pressure Ridges	In the Arctic, the old, multiyear ice is increasingly melting, dramatically reducing the frequency and size of pressure ridges. These ridges are created when ice floes press against each other and become stacked, and are a characteristic feature of Arctic sea ice, an obstacle for shipping, but also an essential component of the ecosystem. In a recently released study in the journal Nature Climate Change, experts from the Alfred Wegener Institute report on this trend and analyse observational data from three decades of aerial surveys. Satellite data from the last three decades documents the dramatic changes in Arctic sea ice due to climate change: the area covered in ice in summer is declining steadily, the floes are becoming thinner and moving faster. Until recently, it was unclear how the characteristic pressure ridges had been affected, since it’s only been possible to reliably monitor them from space for the past few years. Pressure ridges are produced by lateral pressures on sea ice. Wind or ocean currents can stack floes up, forming metre-thick ridges. The part of the ridges – which break up the otherwise smooth surface of the ice every few hundred metres – extending above the water is called the sail and measures between one and two metres. Even more impressive is the keel below the water line, which can extend down to 30 metres and create an impassable obstacle for shipping. Pressure ridges affect not only the energy and mass balance of the sea ice, but also the biogeochemical cycle and the ecosystem: when their sails catch the wind, floes can be driven all across the Arctic. Polar bears use pressure ridges as a source of protection for overwintering or birthing their young. In addition, the structures offer ice-associated organisms at various trophic levels protection and promote the turbulent mixing of water, which increases nutrient availability. A team of researchers from the Alfred Wegener Institute, Helmholtz Centre for Polar and Marine Research (AWI), has now reprocessed and analysed laser-based readings gathered in 30 years of research flights over the Arctic ice. The survey flights, which cover a total distance of roughly 76,000 kilometres, show for the first time that the frequency of pressure ridges north of Greenland and in Fram Strait is decreasing by 12.2%, and their height by 5%, per decade. Data from the Lincoln Sea, an area where particularly old ice is known to accumulate, paints a similar picture: here, the frequency is declining by 14.9% and the height by 10.4% per decade. 'Until now, it’s remained unclear how pressure ridges were changing,' says Dr Thomas Krumpen, a sea-ice expert at the AWI and the study’s main author. 'More and more of the Arctic consists of ice that melts in the summer and is no more than a year old. This young, thin ice can more readily be deformed and more rapidly forms new pressure ridges. So you might expect their frequency to increase. The fact that pressure ridges are nonetheless in decline is due to the dramatic melting of older floes. Ice that has survived several summers is characterised by a particularly high number of pressure ridges, since it has been subjected to high pressures over a longer timeframe. The loss of this multiyear ice is so severe that we’re observing an overall decline in pressure-ridge frequency, even though the thin young ice is easier to deform.' In order to draw conclusions regarding Arctic-wide changes, the researchers combined all observational data to develop a metric. Then, with the aid of satellite data, they applied it to the Arctic as a whole: 'We tend to see the greatest decline in pressure ridges in those places where the ice’s age has decreased most,' summarises Prof Christian Haas, Head of Sea-ice Physics at the AWI. 'Major changes can be seen in the Beaufort Sea, but also in the Central Arctic. Both regions are now partly ice-free in summer, though they were once dominated by ice that was at least five years old.' For the study, individual pressure ridges and their heights were precisely measured and analysed during survey flights. This was possible thanks to the low-level flights (less than 100 metres above the surface) and the laser sensors’ high scanning rate, which allowed terrain models to be created. The AWI began scientific flights over the sea ice in the early 1990s, launching from Svalbard. Back then, the institute relied on two Dornier DO228s, Polar 2 and Polar 4; they have since been succeeded by two Basler BT-67s, Polar 5 and Polar 6. Specially equipped for flights under the extreme conditions found in the polar regions, they can be fitted with a range of sensors. Using these aircraft, researchers survey the ice north of Greenland, Svalbard and Canada twice a year. But the icebreaker Polarstern’s onboard helicopters are also part of the monitoring programme. In order to estimate the direct effects of the observed changes on the Arctic ecosystem, models need to be developed that can reflect both physical and biological processes in sea ice of various ages. Although we know that pressure ridges are home to a range of organisms, we still lack a deeper understanding of the role of pressure-ridge age. Yet this aspect is especially important, as the percentage of ridges that don’t survive their first summer is on the rise. Another riddle: although the size and frequency of ridge sails have decreased, the drift speed of Arctic ice has generally increased. As AWI sea-ice physicist Dr Luisa von Albedyll, who contributed to the study, explains: 'Actually, the ice should drift more slowly when the sails shrink, since there’s less area for the transfer of momentum. This indicates that there are other changes producing just the opposite effect. Stronger ocean currents or a smoother ice underside due to more intensive melting could be contributing factors. To answer these open questions and gain a better grasp of the complex interrelationships, we have made the entire dataset available in a public archive, (Link zu PANGAEA), ensuring that other researchers can use it and integrate it into their studies.' An expedition with the research vessel Polarstern is planned for next summer, with a focus on investigating the biological and biogeochemical differences between floes and pressure ridges of different ages and provenances. At the same time, there will be extensive aerial survey flights with the research aircraft. According to Thomas Krumpen: 'By combining ship-based and aerial observations, we hope to gain better insights into the complex interactions between the sea ice, climate and ecosystem – since we’ll only be able to devise effective strategies for the preservation and sustainable use of the Arctic once we better understand the region’s environmental system.'	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfQyTUqXWCxDgh7izzti-E3	2025-01-06T15:38:15-08:00	
Pope Francis Said: ‘All Religions Are Paths To God’ So True Relig...	For most of the last half of the 20th century liberals confidently believed that racism and religious extremism would soon disappear from human society: but shockingly they have revived in the 21st century. One reason for this revival is that for more than thirteen centuries most Jews, Christians and Muslims have read each other's holy scriptures from an adversarial perspective. Since all monotheistic scriptures come from the one and only God, we should view other monotheistic scriptures as potentially enriching our understanding and appreciation of our own scripture. But in the middle ages almost all readers thought of revelation as a zero sum sport like tennis, rather than a multiple win co-operative sport like mountain climbing. In a zero sum game any value or true spiritual insight I grant to another scripture somehow diminishes my own. This was the result of the influence of Greek philosophy's emphasis on the logic of the excluded middle. Something is either true or it is false. There is no other option. If two propositions contradict one another, one or both of them must be false. This would mean that if my religion is true, yours must be false. In modern terms, light could not be both a particle and a wave at the same time. Yet we now have been enlightened and know that light is indeed both a particle and a wave at the same time, depending how you observe it. This medieval situation did not improve much in modern times. In the last two centuries university academics have written many studies of comparative religion which they claim are objective and not distorted by their religious beliefs. Unfortunately, academics who treat other religions academically usually do not believe that other scriptures are actually Divinely inspired. Indeed, many academics do not believe that even their own sacred scriptures are Divinely inspired; and believe in nothing but their own skepticism. They use the same kinds of explanations to understand a revealed religion that they would use to explain secular history and literature. As a rabbi I follow a different model, one I learned from prophet Muhammad. For example, the Mishnah (an early third century compilation of the oral Torah, states, 'Adam was created as an individual to teach you that anyone who destroys a single soul, Scripture imputes it to him as if he destroyed the whole world.' (Mishnah Sanhedrin 4:5) And the Qur'an states,'one who kills a human being, unless it be for murder or for spreading mischief in the land, would be as if he slew the whole people, and if any one saved a life, it would be as if he saved the life of the whole people' (Qur'an 5:32) Academics explain the similarity of the two statements by assuming that since the Jewish statement is several centuries earlier than the Qur'an, Muhammad must have heard it from a Rabbi or other educated Jew in Medina. However, I believe Prophet Muhammad is a non-Jewish Abrahamic prophet of God who confirms the Torah of prophet Moses. Muhammad has no need to learn this statement from another human being. Academics might reply that the statement is not found in the written Torah; it appears in the oral Torah written by the Rabbis in the Mishnah more than 1000 years after Moses. But the Rabbis maintain that the Mishnah is part of the oral Torah that was passed down from Moses through many generations; just as Ahadith have been passed down through the generations. Indeed, the Qur'an itself introduces this statement as follows, 'It is because of this that We ordained for the Children of Israel 'one who kills a human being ...' (Qur'an 5:32) No prophet of God needs to be informed by another human what should be written in Holy Scripture. God is the source of all Divine inspiration. There are several verses in the Qur'an that mention things from the oral Torah. My perspective is that prophets and Holy Scriptures can not in reality oppose one another because they all come from one source. Prophets are all brothers; they have the same father (God) and different mothers (motherlands. mother tongues, nations, cultures and historical eras). (Sahih al-Bukhari 3443 Book 60, Hadith 113) All of these factors produce different rituals and legal systems, but their theology can differ only in small and unessential details. As the sage of Konya, Jalal al-Din al-Rumi says, 'Ritual prayer might differ in every religion, but belief never changes.' (Fihi Mafih 49) Religions differ because the circumstances of each nation receiving them differ. Where sacred Scriptures differ they do not nullify each other; they only cast additional light on each other. My belief is based on an important Hadith of prophet Muhammad. Abu Huraira relates, 'The people of the Book used to read the Torah in Hebrew and then explain it in Arabic to the Muslims. Allah's Apostle said (to the Muslims). 'Do not believe the people of the Book, nor disbelieve them, but say, 'We believe in Allah, and whatever is revealed to us, and whatever is revealed to you.'' Following Muhammad's teaching I too neither believe nor disbelieve the Qur'an. If I believed in the Qur'an, I would be a member of the Muslim ummah (community). But I cannot disbelieve in the Qur'an because I believe that Muhammad was indeed a non-Jewish, Abrahamic prophet; and I respect the Qur'an as a revelation to a kindred people, in a kindred language. In fact, the people, the language and the theology are closer to my own people, language and theology than that of any other religion on earth. How does this perspective affect my understanding of their Qur'an and my Torah? Unlike those in the past who played the zero sum game, I do not seek some verse in the Qur'an I can dispute or object to. Indeed, this is what the Qur'an itself teaches. 'For every community We have appointed a whole system of worship which they are to observe. So do not let them draw you into disputes concerning this matter.'

15 Questions That Will Put An End To The ‘Climate Scare’ Once-And...	To support the growth of health and prosperity worldwide for the 8 billion on this planet in the coming decades, and the increasing demand for electricity, AND for the 6,000+ products in our materialistic society, and for the various transportation fuels, will challenge humanity’s creativity to support the supply chains to meet those growing demands. Government mandated winners and losers are only applicable to those few in the wealthier countries that can afford huge subsidies, but the reality that there are no silver bullet answers. For those outside the few wealthy countries, we see that at least 80 percent of humanity, or more than six billion in this world are living on less than $10 a day, and billions living with little to no access to electricity. Politicians in wealthier countries are pursuing the most expensive ways to generate intermittent electricity. Energy poverty is among the most crippling but least talked-about crises of the 21st century. We should not take electricity, products, and fuel for granted. Wealthy countries may be able to bear expensive electricity and fuels, but not by those that can least afford living in 'energy poverty.' It should be one of everyone’s New Year’s resolutions to acquire a passion to stimulate discussions to enhance everyone’s Energy Literacy. To support and facilitate those Conversations, at least 3 are required: A Moderator: Teacher, student, or Podcast host. A representative of the products and fuels of our materialistic society, and A representative of the pro-renewables for zero-emissions electricity. Here are just a few open-ended starter questions for Teachers, Students, and Podcaster Moderators to stimulate 3-way Energy Literacy Conversations: Limitations of just electricity from renewables. Renewables, like wind and solar, only exist to generate occasional electricity. Since these so-called renewables, CANNOT manufacture any of the more than 6,000 products AND the various transportation fuels made from fossil fuels for vehicles, planes and ships, that are demanded by the infrastructures of today, the same infrastructures that did not exist 200 years ago, the question for our conversation is: WHY eliminate fossil fuels when there is no known 'replacement' to fossil fuels that can support the materialistic demands for products and fuels of the population and economy that are supporting the 8 billion on this planet? Most of the products in our materialistic society are made from fossil fuels. Everything that NEEDS Electricity, like iPhones, computers, data centers, and X-Ray machines, that need electricity to function, and all the parts of toilets, spacecraft, and more than 50,000 merchant ships, more than 20,000 commercial aircraft and more than 50,000 military aircraft are also made from the products based on derivatives manufactured from crude oil, so the question for our conversation is: Why rid only the wealthy countries with 'green' movements, of fossil fuels as that would just divert the supply chain of oil to refineries in developing countries, to meet the demands for products and fuels that did not exist 200 years ago? Only wealthy economies have 'green' movements. For the 8 billion now on planet earth, of which 80% are making less than $10/day, and lack many infrastructures being enjoyed by those in the wealthier countries such as Transportation, Airports, Water filtration, Sanitation, Hospitals, Medical equipment, Appliances, Electronics, Telecommunications systems, Heating and ventilating, so the question for our conversation is: Why are the wealthy countries the only ones pursuing a 'green movement' with subsidies and mandates? Planet Earth’s resources are limited! Our 4-billion-year-old planet has limited natural resources like oil, gas, coal, lithium, cobalt, manganese, etc. that are being extracted at alarming rates. Even with technological advances in the next few decades by those in wealthier countries, we may find 'more', but at current rates of extraction of those resources, the planet may be sucked dry in 50, 100, 500, or 1,000 years, so the question for our conversation is: Should there be a greater focus on the limitations of earth’s natural resources now being extracted for the enjoyment by wealthier countries on Earth as our 4-billion-year-old planet will continue to be here, with or without humans,? Developing countries are THE only source for the materials for wealthier countries to go 'green'. Since the current 'green movement' technology requires significant rare earth minerals and metals to construct EV batteries, wind turbines, and solar panels that are not easily available in the few wealthier countries are being mined in developing countries, so the question for our conversation is: Are the wealthy country mandates and subsidies ethical and moral, to continue financially encouraging China and Africa to continue the egregious human rights' violations of vulnerable minority populations by exploiting 'their' poor with yellow, brown, and black skin, and financially supporting environmental degradation to 'their' landscapes just to reinforce mandated EV’s, and subsidizing of wind turbines, and solar panels in 'wealthier country backyards'? The Future of EV Batteries. The first cell phone, more than 50 years ago in 1973, the Motorola DynaTAC, weighed 2.5 pounds and was 9 inches tall. Today’s cell phones are generally under 7 ounces with almost unlimited functions, easy charging, and with virtually unlimited applications. In the coming decades, the current 1,000 pound lithium battery in EVs will seem barbaric just like the first cell phone, future EV batteries will be lighter, cheaper, longer range, and shorter charging times, so the question for our conversation: How long do you think it will take humanity ingenuity and creativity driven by the free enterprise environment, to meet the humongous growing demand for efficient electricity, that will most likely exceed what we experienced in cell phone development that took 5-decades? Electricity came about AFTER the discovery of oil. ALL six methods to generate electricity, from hydro, coal, natural gas, nuclear, wind, and solar, for the generation of electricity are ALL built with the products, components, and equipment that are made from the oil derivatives manufactured from crude oil, so the question for our conversation is: Why rid the world of fossil fuels as that would eliminate our ability to generate electricity? So-called renewable power has proven to be very expensive electricity. The few wealthy countries able to provide heavy subsidies to transition to occasional electricity generation from breezes and sunshine has proven to be ultra-expensive for Germany, Australia, Great Britain, New Zealand, all of the EU, and the USA. These few wealthy countries that currently represent about one of the eight billion of the world’s population, still remain ignorant that billions in Africa, Asia and Latin America still live on less than $10 a day – and that billions still have little to no access to electricity, so the question for our conversation is: How will the 'green movement' help those in poorer developing countries join the industrialized society being enjoyed by those in the wealthier countries? The supply chain to support zero-emission mandates must be ethical and moral. The zero-emission mandates from the few wealthier developed countries requires key challenges in the supply chain requirements from the raw materials sector for rare earth minerals and metals that need to be overcome if the electricity generation transition is to be realized, so the question for our conversation is: Why are there no conversation about securing sustainable supply chains, promoting responsible sourcing practices with labor and environmental laws and regulations, and ensuring a just and equitable green and digital transition for everyone, both poor and wealthy? Nuclear power plants are prolificating around the world. For more than 7 decades, nuclear power has proven to be the safest, most compact, emissions free, and cheapest way to produce continuous, uninterruptable, and dispatchable electricity, has resulted in increased activities in China, Russia, and Japan with about 60 new nuclear power plants under construction across the world and a further 110 planned, so the question for our conversation is: Why do you think that America is supporting subsidies for unreliable wind and solar generated electricity that is NOT continuous nor dispatchable, and avoiding nuclear generated electricity that is continuous, dispatchable, and emissions free? Nuclear power generation has an impressive safety track record.America has a track record of almost 70 years of nuclear power plant operation without any injuries, including over 70 years of nuclear Navy reactor operations for all their submarines and aircraft carriers, so the question for our conversation is: Why is there so much public resistance in America to allowing nuclear power to compete with other forms of power generation on the open market? The USA is falling behind in technological developments in nuclear power generation. While nuclear power generation is proliferating around the world in China, Russia, and Japan with about 60 new nuclear power plants under construction and a further 110 planned, nuclear power design and construction came to a slow end in America in the early 1980’s due to the handling of the anti-nuclear movement and an incompetent Nuclear Regulatory Commission, so the question for our conversation is: What will it take to stimulate American interest to just catch up with foreign countries domination of technological developments in nuclear power generation? CO2 starvation. The minimum threshold for plant life is 150 ppm of Carbon Dioxide (CO2), but today, CO2 levels are about 420 ppm which is essential for life on Earth as humans need carbon dioxide to regulate respiration and control blood pH while Plants use carbon dioxide to create oxygen through photosynthesis, so the question for our conversation is: With CO2 levels today nearing the starvation levels for plant and human life on earth, why the focus to reduce CO2 levels to end life? Government subsidized projects have yet to produce Environmental Impact Reports. To date, all wind and solar generation of electricity has been funded by government subsidies as NONE have been financed by private entrepreneurial investor funds, but all those subsidized renewable projects have yet to be accountable for Environmental Impact Reports (EIR’s) that details the life cycle for renewables that runs from design, procurement, and construction through operations, maintenance, and repair, as well as the life ending decommissioning and disposal or recycling and restoration of the landscaping back to its original pristine condition, so the question for our conversation is: Why are government subsidized renewable projects toward wind, solar, and electric vehicles EXEMPT from the same Environmental Impact Reports that extensively discuss decommissioning, recycling, and restoration of the landscaping back to its original pristine condition for wind, solar, and EV battery materials, when they are required when those projects are funded with private money? Earth’s natural resources are not being replenished. As the world’s population depletes the 4-billion year old Planet earth’s natural resources of crude oil, coal, natural gas, and the critical minerals and metals to support the 'green' movement like, lithium, cobalt, manganese, etc., over the next 50, 100, or more years, our grandchildren may be unable to enjoy the more than 6,000 products of our materialistic society, being enjoyed by the current residents on this planet, so the question for our conversation is: To continue the preservation of human life on earth, how do we get serious about conservation, efficiency improvements, and recycling the waste that humans are generating? The above open-ended questions are intended to facilitate the stimulation of 3-way Energy Literacy Conversations among teachers, students, and Podcast Moderators with representatives of the products and fuels of our materialistic society, and representatives of the pro-renewables for zero-emissions electricity.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfQyTUqXWCxDnymKlMfHqOs	2025-01-06T15:33:51-08:00	
Prime Apple Growing Areas In US Face Increasing Climate Risks	Some of the most productive apple regions in America are facing big challenges from a changing climate, according to a Washington State University study. Researchers analyzed over 40 years of climate conditions that impact the growth cycle of apple trees from bud break and flowering through fruit development, maturation and color development. While many growing areas are facing increased climate risks, the top three largest apple producing counties in the U.S. were among the most impacted: Yakima in Washington, Kent in Michigan and Wayne in New York. In particular, Yakima County, the largest of the three with more than 48,800 acres of apple orchards, has seen harmful trends in five of the six metrics the researchers analyzed. 'We shouldn’t take the delicious apples we love to consume for granted,' said Deepti Singh, a WSU climate scientist and the study’s corresponding author. 'Changing climate conditions over multiple parts of the growth cycle pose potentially compounding threats to the production and quality of apples. Moving forward, it would be helpful to think about adaptations at different stages of apple growth that can minimize overall harmful impacts.' The team’s immediate next step is to look at projections, Singh added, to inform planning and management in the tree fruit industry. For this study, published in the journal Environmental Research Letters, the researchers analyzed climate data from 1979-2022. They specifically looked at six metrics that impact the apple growth, including two metrics of extremes—extreme heat days, defined as days with a maximum temperature greater than 34 degrees C (93 F) that can cause sunburn as well as other problems, and warm nights when the minimum temperatures were greater than 15 C (59 F) that can adversely affect coloration. The researchers also looked at the number of cold days; 'chill portions' or the number of colder hours an apple tree needs to be dormant; the last day of spring frost; and growing degree days, meaning the number of days above a certain temperature that are conducive for apples to grow. Changes in these metrics can impact apple production, changing the time when apple flowers bloom, increasing the risk of sunburn on apples as well as affecting apple appearance and quality. The western U.S. has experienced the strongest trends in multiple metrics that are detrimental to apples. The challenges are complex partly because apple trees are perennials, said co-author Lee Kalcsits, a WSU tree physiologist who leads programming at the Wenatchee Tree Fruit Research and Extension Center. 'What goes on in different seasons can affect long-term health as well as the performance and productivity of the apple tree during that specific season,' he said. 'So what goes on in the winter affects what happens in the spring, which affects the summer, and it just keeps going around in a cycle.' Growers are already adapting, he added, noting that in Washington state, producers are employing measures such as netting and evaporative cooling to fend off sunburn during the more frequent extreme heat. With more climate risks likely, researchers are also taking steps to help the industry adapt. Kalcsits is leading a project funded by a $6.75 million grant from the U.S. Department of Agriculture to help mitigate the impact of extreme climate events on apple and pear crops. It is a multi-institution grant with work planned across the nation as well as in the apple growing regions of Washington state. 'Washington is a great place to start to talk about adaptation,' said Kirti Rajagopalan, a WSU biological systems engineer and study co-author, who is also working on the grant project. 'A lot of the commercial apple production happens in the northern U.S. There are also parts of Washington where the summers can get pretty hot, so this is a good place for a case study – and if we can manage it here, then it's likely manageable elsewhere too.'	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfQyTUqXWCxDsloRK3rhV9T	2025-01-06T15:30:43-08:00	
Microplastics Widespread In Seafood People Eat	The tiny particles that shed from clothing, packaging and other plastic products are winding up in the fish that people eat, according to a new study from Portland State researchers, highlighting a need for technologies and strategies to reduce microfiber pollution entering the environment. Building on previous research exploring the prevalence of microplastics in bivalves like Pacific oysters and razor clams, researchers in PSU’s Applied Coastal Ecology Lab — led by Elise Granek, professor of environmental science and management — turned their focus to commonly eaten finfish and crustaceans. Summer Traylor, who graduated in 2022 with a master’s in environmental management, led the project with assistance from undergraduate environmental science student Marilyn Duncan, who graduated in 2024. The team set out to fill in gaps about microplastic contamination in Oregon finfish and shellfish and better understand variations across trophic levels, which classify a fish’s position in the food chain, and in pathways to consumers. Traylor’s research helped her land a job working for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) after graduating from PSU, and Duncan has plans to continue microplastics research in graduate school. The team quantified anthropogenic particles, materials produced or modified by humans, that they found in the edible tissue of six species that are economically or culturally important in Oregon: black rockfish, lingcod, Chinook salmon, Pacific herring, Pacific lamprey, and pink shrimp. They compared particle concentrations across trophic levels and whether their position in the food web affected what and how much was contaminating their edible tissue as well as whether there were differences in samples acquired directly from research fishing vessels versus those from supermarkets and seafood vendors. Susanne Brander, an ecotoxicologist and associate professor in Oregon State University’s College of Agricultural Sciences, helped analyze and validate a subsample of suspected plastics in her lab. The study, published in the journal Frontiers in Toxicology, found 1,806 suspected particles across 180 of 182 individual samples. Fibers were the most abundant, followed by fragments and films. Among the species sampled, pink shrimp, which filter-feed right below the surface of the water, had the highest concentrations of particles in their edible tissues. Chinook salmon had the lowest concentrations, followed by black rockfish and lingcod. 'We found that the smaller organisms that we sampled seem to be ingesting more anthropogenic, non-nutritious particles,' Granek said. 'Shrimp and small fish, like herring, are eating smaller food items like zooplankton. Other studies have found high concentrations of plastics in the area in which zooplankton accumulate and these anthropogenic particles may resemble zooplankton and thus be taken up for animals that feed on zooplankton.' Though the group expected that the processing from catch to consumer would introduce additional contaminants from plastic packaging meant to preserve seafood, that wasn’t universally true across the species. The researchers rinsed off the fish fillets and shrimp, replicating what most people do at home before preparing them, suggesting that in some cases, additional contamination that may land on the surface during processing can be removed with rinsing. The study results, however, provide evidence of the widespread presence of particles in the edible tissues of Oregon’s marine and freshwater species. 'It’s very concerning that microfibers appear to move from the gut into other tissues such as muscle,' Brander said. 'This has wide implications for other organisms, potentially including humans too.' The researchers say the findings signal the need for both further studies to understand the mechanisms by which particles translocate into muscle tissue, which humans eat, as well as policy interventions to regulate anthropogenic particles. 'This project established critical baseline data for West Coast fisheries stakeholders and highlighted how much we still do not know about these pervasive microplastic pollutants,' said Traylor, who now serves as a NOAA Corps Officer, helping collect baseline microplastic data in the Gulf of Mexico to further expand public knowledge and understanding. The authors are not advocating for people to stay away from seafood because, as Granek likes to remind people, microplastics are everywhere: in bottled water, beer, honey, beef, chicken, veggie burgers and tofu. 'If we are disposing of and utilizing products that release microplastics, those microplastics make their way into the environment, and are taken up by things we eat,' she said. 'What we put out into the environment ends up back on our plates.' That’s why Granek’s lab group is beginning to focus more on solutions. 'We're continuing to do work to understand the effects of anthropogenic particles on animals, but we're also moving into experimental work to test what are effective solutions to reduce microplastics entering marine ecosystems,' she said. She’s leading a $1.9 million NOAA-funded project that is developing and testing washing machine, dishwasher and clothes dryer filters that can serve as cost-effective filtration solutions. In another project funded by Oregon Sea Grant, six catch basin filters will be installed in stormwater drains in two coastal towns to determine their efficacy in trapping microplastics from road runoff before entering waterways. Brander’s lab is collaborating on both projects as well.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfQyTUqXWCxDjHWCY69-HV2	2025-01-06T15:28:12-08:00	
Lead Pollution Likely Caused Widespread IQ Declines In Ancient Ro...	Lead exposure is responsible for a range of human health impacts, with even relatively low levels impacting the cognitive development of children. DRI scientists have previously used atmospheric pollution records preserved in Arctic ice cores to identify periods of lead pollution throughout the Roman Empire, and now new research expands on this finding to identify how this pollution may have affected the European population. The study, published in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS), examined three ice core records to identify lead pollution levels in the Arctic between 500 BCE through 600 CE. This era spans the rise of the Roman Republic through the fall of the Roman Empire, with the study focusing on the approximately 200-year height of the Empire called the Pax Romana. Lead isotopes allowed the research team to identify mining and smelting operations throughout Europe as the likely source of pollution during this period. Advanced computer modeling of atmospheric movement then produced maps of atmospheric lead pollution levels across Europe. Combined with research linking lead exposure to cognitive decline, the research team also identified likely reductions in IQ levels of at least 2 to 3 points among the European population. 'This is the first study to take a pollution record from an ice core and invert it to get atmospheric concentrations of pollution and then assess human impacts,' says Joe McConnell, research professor of hydrology at DRI and lead author of the study. 'The idea that we can do this for 2,000 years ago is pretty novel and exciting.' Records of the Past Preserved in Ice McConnell’s Ice Core Laboratory at DRI has spent decades examining ice cores from places like Greenland and Antarctica, where sheets of ice have built up over millennia. Using enormous drills, they painstakingly extract columns of ice as much as 11,000 feet (3,400 meters) long, reaching more distant depths of Earth’s history with each inch. McConnell’s team creates precise timelines using records of well-dated volcanic eruptions, which stamp the ice record like postcards from the past. Gas bubbles trapped in the ice offer insight into the atmosphere of past eras, while pollutants like lead can be used to interpret mining and industrial activity. McConnell began developing methods to create very detailed lead records in ice more than twenty years ago, when he applied them to more recent history. When archeologists and historians learned of this work, they approached him hoping to apply these new techniques to the Roman period, seeking answers to lingering historical questions. 'The resulting research changed our understanding of the era by finding precise linkages between the lead pollution records and historical events such as population declines associated with periodic plagues and pandemics,' adds coauthor and ancient historian Andrew Wilson of Oxford University. A Growing Understanding of the Harms of Lead Pollution Ancient lead pollution stemmed largely from silver mining, whereby the lead-rich mineral galena was melted down to extract silver. For every ounce of silver obtained, this process produced thousands of ounces of lead—much of which was released to the atmosphere. In the 20th century, lead pollution predominantly came from the emissions of vehicles burning leaded gasoline. Following the passing of the Clean Air Act in the U.S. in 1970, which restricted the use of leaded gasoline, researchers have tracked the sharp decline of lead in human blood. However, the nationwide exposure, particularly for children born between 1950 and 1985, allowed scientists to track lead’s impact on health and cognitive development. 'As lead pollution has declined during the last 30 years, it has become more and more apparent to epidemiologists and medical experts just how bad lead is for human development,' McConnell says. In adults, high levels of lead exposure are linked to infertility, anemia, memory loss, cardiovascular disease, cancer, and reduced immune response, among other impacts. In children, even low levels of exposure have been connected to reduced IQ, concentration challenges, and reduced academic success. While the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) considers a blood lead level of 3.5 µg/dl the point for medical intervention for children, they have stated that there is no level of lead exposure without risk. 'Lead is known to have a wide range of human health impacts, but we chose to focus on cognitive decline because it’s something we can put a number on,' says study coauthor Nathan Chellman, assistant research professor of snow and ice hydrology at DRI. 'An IQ reduction of 2 to 3 points doesn’t sound like much, but when you apply that to essentially the entire European population, it’s kind of a big deal.' The study found that atmospheric lead pollution began during the Iron Age and reached a peak during the late 2nd century BCE at the height of the Roman Republic. It then declined sharply during the 1st century BCE, during the crisis of the Roman Republic, before increasing around 15 BCE following the rise of the Roman Empire. Lead pollution remained high until the Antonine Plague from 165 to the 180s CE, which severely affected the Roman Empire. It wasn’t until the High Middle Ages in the early 2nd millennium CE that lead pollution in the Arctic exceeded the sustained high levels of the Roman Empire. According to the research, more than 500 kilotons of lead were released to the atmosphere during the nearly 200-year height of the Roman Empire. Although ice core records show that Arctic lead pollution was up to 40-fold higher during the highest historical peak in the early 1970s, the insight gained from this study demonstrates how 'humans have been impacting their health for thousands of years through industrial activity,' McConnell says.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWdZi0lIQNynzzvGzJAE9q-y	2025-01-06T15:24:12-08:00	
New Non-Paper On Developments In The Western Balkans – OpEd	On December 4, 2024, the Sarajevo portal 'Slobodna Bosna' published the full text of the document accompanied by the article entitled 'New Non-PAPER for the Western Balkans, green light from Washington for the final result...'! The Albanian Institute for Geopolitics translated and published it in full. In relation to this 'New Non-Paper', in this analysis we will try to draw some conclusions related to the authorship and the messages that are claimed to be conveyed and related to the security of the Western Balkans and its future in NATO and the EU. Entry A non-paper is an unofficial diplomatic document that presents a proposal, formulation, draft, amendment, or similar, with which the author does not wish to be officially identified. As a rule, it is used for informal presentation of diplomatic positions to see - whether these 'offered' positions will be accepted and to determine the maximum common position of the parties involved - in a certain political dispute.So, precisely because it deals with delicate political issues, the names of the authors of the non-paper are not mentioned and it can also be translated as a 'working document' in the diplomatic vocabulary... In this analysis, it is about a document coming from Washington.The branches of the Bosnian portal 'Slobodna Bosnja', it is said in the introduction of the text, near the new head of American diplomacy, confirmed that the document was already on the desk of Republican Senator Marco Rubio from Florida, who has been appointed by the newly elected American President Donald Trump as Secretary new US State. The goal of the initiative is to put an end to territorial claims and conflicts in the Western Balkans and create opportunities for a final turn towards Euro-Atlantic integration of the entire region, as well as away from Russian influence and possible wars, which, from time to time, threaten to destabilize the the region.In the geopolitical context, this document seems to have a clear goal - that of the integration of the Western Balkans first of all within the strategic architecture of the USA, respectively the core of this architecture which means the Anglo-Saxon sphere of interest. Hypotheses The new non-paper on the Western Balkans [1] is an informal document that is often used by international actors to stimulate discussions and propose ideas or strategies regarding sensitive political issues, without taking an official position. Recently, there have been rumors that such a non-paper is circulating on the integration processes of the Western Balkans in the European Union (EU), as well as on issues such as dialogue between Kosovo and Serbia, internal reforms and the acceleration of integration processes. In the predecessor non-papers, there was an open tendency to use the 'coveter's letter' through the narrative of a 'great Albania' in the general public, there were clear intentions to make the idea of ​​the 'Serbian World' aka great Serbia, more acceptable to international factors. But what are the de facto authors of the new non-paper revealing? What does the new non-paper contain? The contents of a non-paper are usually not published officially, but described in the media through diplomatic sources. As we pointed out at the beginning, 'Slobodna Bosna' has published a new non-paper related to the Western Balkans, which is claimed to come from Washington. The current document reflects the intention of the Western decision-making centers for the termination of territorial conflicts in the Western Balkans, therefore it has nothing to do with Greater Serbia. One even gets the impression that the essence of this new document is the idea of ​​a kind of distancing of the states of Southeast Europe, aka the Western Balkans, from Russian influence, which would automatically, according to the document in question, cancel the possibilities for possible conflicts, which are warned through the exercise of Serbian state terror against the Republic of Kosovo and its citizens [the case of Banja on September 24, 2024 and the latter in the Ibri e Lepenci channel]. The new non-paper specifically states: 'The goal of the initiative is for all countries of the Commonwealth of Independent States to be in NATO, Serbia and Kosovo to recognize each other, to repeal the application of the Declaration of the All-Serbian Parliament in BiH , and the possibility of introducing the Law on Dual Citizenship in Montenegro'. Currently, Montenegro has a strong position regarding the recognition of dual citizenship. According to the legislation in force, a foreign citizen seeking Montenegrin citizenship must surrender his previous citizenship. This legal provision constitutes an obstacle to the implementation of the proposals of the pro-Serbian and pro-Russian parties, which require that Montenegrin citizens of Serbian origin have the right to have dual citizenship, including that of Serbia. These efforts come as part of a broader strategy to change the demographic and political balance in Montenegro, significantly strengthening ties between the Serbian community and Serbia. This scenario creates a favorable basis for political manipulation and increasing Belgrade's influence in Montenegro. Demographic statistics show deep changes in the ethnic composition of Montenegro during the last decades. In the last census, 41.12% of the population declared themselves as Montenegrins, while 33% declared themselves as Serbs—an increase of 4% compared to the 2011 census.[2] The 'new non-paper' would essentially contribute to the democratization of the Western Balkans, clearly preserving the existing - internationally recognized borders. Let's remember the fact that, for four years now, we have been witnessing disturbing trends, that through the example of Montenegro, which is the 'alpha and omega of the Greater Serbia project', Serbia can prove in reality its possibilities for expansion even through the hybrid war, alias 'soft approach', installing the pro-Serbian and pro-Russian government in Podgorica, despite the fact that Montenegro is a member of NATO. Meanwhile, through the All-Serbian Assembly held on 07.06.2024 in Belgrade and the approval of the Political Platform as a basic document in the service of the 'Serbian World' idea, Serbia challenged the Pre-Soviet diplomacy, making clear the final goal of the Serbian strategy. Content and deadlines for the implementation of the 'new non-paper' According to this document, within the year 2025 - from April to October, it is planned to hold a large international conference designed as an 'Initiative of the Commonwealth of Independent States' (Serbia, Kosovo, Montenegro and Bosnia and Herzegovina) organized under care of the EU, NATO and the USA. According to the said document, a series of agreements and memoranda would be signed at the conclusion - in which the states participating in the conference would mutually commit to the following: 1. The signing of the Agreement between Serbia and Kosovo for the full normalization of relations according to the Franco-German-EU plan, which means the de facto recognition of Kosovo by Serbia and the formation of the Community of Municipalities with a Serbian majority in the north of Kosovo, on the part of Kosovo. 2. The agreement between Serbia and Bosnia-Herzegovina on the repeal of the 'Declaration for the Protection of National and Political Rights and the Common Future of the Serbian People', [i.e. the Political Platform of the All-Serbian Assembly - SR], fully and strictly respecting the Agreement of Dayton and the political sovereignty of Bosnia-Herzegovina. The aforementioned declaration [on the 'Serbian World'] is essentially a program of political movements with the ultimate goal of creating a greater Serbia. [3] That is, it is the logical continuation of Milosevic's 'all Serbs in one state' policy, which he once articulated - in accordance with the guidelines from the SANU [Serbian Academy of Art and Science] Memorandum. 3. The agreement between Serbia and Montenegro foresees the permanent suspension of the Law on Dual Citizenship of Montenegro, creating a de facto opportunity for an army of citizens to restore Serbian citizenship as well. Through this act, more than 200,000 Serbian citizens could automatically obtain Montenegrin citizenship, through which, then, as voters, they would be able to overturn the political will of the majority citizens of Montenegro, seriously undermining the Montenegrin identity and the state of Montenegro, since it has only about 633,000 inhabitants.4. The joint agreement on preserving and respecting territorial integrity and sovereignty (Serbia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Kosovo and Montenegro), and 5. The agreement for submitting a joint candidacy for membership in NATO (Serbia, BiH and Kosovo) by taking all the necessary steps and measures towards an accelerated process of admission to the EU. [4] *** The response to this document did not take long from Belgrade. However, both Vucic and Putin are asking about something concrete. In this context, Aleksandar Vučić's response to the non-paper offers was quick, clear and unequivocal. He said: 'As long as I am president of Serbia, there are no international conferences, no recognition of Kosovo and no membership in NATO'! Emphasizing then: 'There will be no conferences as long as I am president and I am president of Serbia, at least for another two years and a few months.'! Reactions to non-paper Positive : Some countries see this as a new impetus for integration and conflict resolution, especially for those who feel left behind by previous processes. Skeptical : Others are concerned about ideas that may violate the territorial integrity of countries, as well as unequal treatment among countries in the region. Kosovo and Serbia : If the non-paper includes ideas for mutual recognition or new models for dialogue, it is likely to stimulate heated debates in both countries. Conclusion These non-papers often remain unclear to the general public, as they do not have an official character. However, they provide an indication of the direction that EU policy or international actors may follow. It is worth seeing how the discussions will take place and whether the proposals included will find concrete support. It is clear that the solution to all these conflicts and decades-long disputes between the states in the Western Balkans, including the ideas of a return to war, is the membership of the bloc in NATO and the EU. The spirit of this document claims to be more comprehensive - this means the full application of democratic elections, the creation of a political environment where free media can live, the independence of the judiciary and the police, including the full harmonization of foreign policy and security with that of the EU, which implies the acceptance of the political and governing philosophy, and which in principle implies the peaceful resolution of all disputes between the countries of the region.The document in question, with emphasis on its first point and those numbered four and five, offer a clear vision for the development of the region's separation from the sphere of Russian influence and the opening of real opportunities for economic and digital development of the Western Balkans, placed Albania and Kosovo at the heart of a global strategic architecture. This project, as well as peace in the region itself, further depends on the position of Serbia. The first reactions from Belgrade seem to say that Serbia and Russia will reject this non-paper, as Vucic has already said. The real reasons why Belgrade reacted so quickly are of an ideological and political nature: it is aware that its acceptance means giving up the ambitious project of the 'Serbian World' alias Greater Serbia. The consequences if this document were to be rejected, according to its conclusion, would be unbearable: 'Rejection of the participation of the countries of the Western Balkans in the Conference on Peace and Cooperation in BP and adherence to all the mentioned initiatives, memoranda and agreements , would clearly show ill will towards neighboring countries, towards European peace and order and security, and towards the wider European community of states. This rejection would also lead to the end of the EU membership negotiations, non-membership of the Schengen Agreement, withdrawal of foreign investments, economic sanctions and political and economic isolation.' [5]In conclusion, we can underline that, in diplomatic circles, there is no longer any doubt that 'the first non-paper (2021) completely pro-Serb, was drafted in 'Vučić's office or in one of the Moscow cabinets', and was issued to the public by the then Slovenian Prime Minister, Janez Jansha. Meanwhile, if we judge based on its content and especially on its spirit, the 'second (pro-Western) no-paper', in the Croatian media [6] it is judged that it must have been drafted by the Bosnian elite with a strong political-religious background, but anyway supported by some counties from the west.__________________________ 1. ).See the version in Albanian: [ ]2.

Biden Honors Soros – OpEd	On January 4, President Biden gave the Medal of Freedom to George Soros. It is the nation’s highest civilian award, given to 'individuals who have made exemplary contributions to the prosperity, values, or security of the United States, world peace, or other significant societal, public or private endeavors.' The White House said those who received the award are 'great leaders because they are good people who have made extraordinary contributions to their country and the world.' The truth is that George Soros has done more to destroy western civilization and the United States, in particular, than any single person in the world. An inveterate anti-Catholic bigot, his anti-law enforcement policies have impoverished and punished legions of innocent black Americans. A self-hating Jew, he has been condemned by Jewish leaders in the United States and Israel. Soros uses his Open Society Institute to help 'reset' America’s priorities. He contributes to 'dark money' organizations that make it hard to trace the origins of their funding services. This includes funding the Tides Foundation. According to the Capital Research Center, 'If the Left does it, Tides funds it.' Among the most important American values is freedom of speech. Soros has worked overtime to kill it, donating to causes that fight 'disinformation,' or speech that the Left deems worthy of censoring. He was particularly active in promoting President Obama’s efforts at censorship. Soros has sought to destabilize America by supporting open borders, welcoming those who have illegally entered the country. His embrace of Black Lives Matter, which has openly said it wants to destroy the nuclear family, is of a piece with his attacks on the criminal justice system. He gave Alvin Bragg $1 million when he was running for the DA in Manhattan in 2021; he gave George Gascón nearly $3 million when he ran for DA in Los Angeles in 2020. In 2022, he gave $40 million to elect seventy-five 'social justice' prosecutors. Between 2016 and 2022, Soros gave more than $29 million to a personal network of political action committees specifically established to back radical DA candidates. By mid-2022, one in five Americans, or seventy million people, were living in a jurisdiction overseen by a Soros-backed prosecutor. Soros DAs were running New York, Chicago, Saint Louis, New Orleans, Philadelphia and Los Angeles. Crime-ridden Austin, Texas, was made worse when he gave $500,000 in 2021 to defeat a ballot initiative that would have provided more money to hire police officers (cops were retiring at record levels). [See my book, War on Virtue: How the Ruling Class is Killing the American Dream, for the documentation.] Soros’ Open Society Institute has waged war on Catholics for decades. It funds many dissident organizations, activist groups that falsely claim to be Catholic. They include Catholics for Choice, a pro-abortion, anti-Catholic letterhead funded by the likes of Soros. He was also the money behind Catholics in Alliance for the Common Good and Catholics United, two front-groups set up by Clinton aide John Podesta to create a 'Catholic Spring' revolution in the Church. Though Soros is Jewish, he has been accused by the ADL of blaming anti-Semitism in Israel on the Israeli government, and the Jerusalem Post has accused him of weakening support for Israel in the Democratic Party. The editor of the New Republic, Martin Peretz, called him 'a cog in the Hitlerite wheel.' As a young man in Hungary, Soros became a Nazi collaborator. In a 60 Minutes interview he admitted that he helped confiscate property from Jews. He told Steve Kroft that he never regretted doing so. When asked if this was difficult, Soros said, 'Not, not at all.' Stunned, Kroft said, 'No feeling of guilt?' 'No' came the reply. Biden has been telling us for four years how much he supports DEI (diversity, equity and inclusion). His decision to honor George Soros, the world’s most influential anti-Catholic bigot, shows what a liar this 'devout Catholic' really is.

Syrian Kurds Should Not Be Left At The Mercy Of Turks – OpEd	Since Assad's regime fell in early December, clashes have intensified in northern Syria between the US-backed Kurdish fighters and the Turkish proxy force Syrian National Army (SNA). Following the regime change in Syria, Turkey has become the most important regional actor in the country. By providing support for Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) and the Syrian National Army Ankara has been consolidating its power over Syria. Turks think that this is the right time to get rid of the small statelet of Syrian Kurds often referred to as Rojava sitting next to its borders. The Kurdish people, often referred to as the largest stateless ethnic group in the world, have faced centuries of marginalization and persecution. Scattered across Turkey, Syria, Iraq, and Iran, the Kurds share a cultural, linguistic, and historical bond but remain divided by political borders imposed after World War I. In Syria, their plight has been particularly stark with decades of oppression and neglect under the Arab nationalist Baath regime. Kurds in Syria have long been treated as second-class citizens. Stripped of citizenship rights in the 1960s, many were rendered stateless and denied access to education, property ownership, and other fundamental rights. Syrian Kurds, who make up about 10-15% of the population, had been more suppressed and less visible than Kurds in Turkey, Iraq, and Iran. From the beginning of the Syrian war, the main Kurdish political party in Syria, the Democratic Union Party (PYD) chose to side with neither Assad nor the anti-regime opposition groups and instead sought to secure its position in the north. In 2012 it unilaterally declared the establishment of an autonomous region called Rojava (Western Kurdistan), formed of three territorially separate cantons: Afrin, Kobane, and Manbij. Turkey's regular military interventions endangered the PYD's position in North and North-East Syria, but the latter continued to maintain an efficient and well-organized administration even under dire situations, with a commitment to bottom-up democracy, gender equality, and minority rights. This is exceptional in the Middle East, where hopes for democracy have been largely crushed since the Arab Spring. Currently, this Kurdish project in Syria is fighting for its survival as they face Turkish mercenary groups like SNA and direct Turkish attacks in the form of artillery shelling and airstrikes. Turkey's key objective in Syria is simple: liquidating multiethnic, Kurdish-led governance along its border, and pushing the Kurdish population back into the Syrian desert by establishing a twenty-mile-deep 'safe zone.' There, it will also resettle Syrian refugees in formerly Kurdish settlements as a way of both satisfying domestic anti-refugee sentiment and entrenching ethnic change along its border. Turkey has been continuously attacking not only Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) bases but generally every kind of Kurdish structure in its vicinity. Syrian Kurds have been regularly targeted by Turkey and its allied militias. Through regular shelling of Kurdish positions and military campaigns like Euphrates Shield and Olive Branch. Syrian Kurds are on top of the Turkish hit list as they are the major obstacle in Ankara's expansionist policies in Syria. Turkey justifies its fierce hostility towards Kurdish forces in Syria by arguing that Kurdish-controlled regions in northern Syria are terrorist dens and shelters for the outlawed PKK which has launched a guerrilla campaign against Turks since 1984. But Turks failed to provide any evidence that Kurds have launched any terror attacks against Turkey from Syria. The real motive behind these kinds of onslaughts launched by Turkey is to drive out the Kurds from these areas and get the pro-Turkish population settled there. It is evident from the fact that in its previous operation in Afrin, Turkey engaged not in counter-terror, but in ethnic cleansing. In its multiple reports, Amnesty International has reported that Turkish military forces and their allied armed groups. Have displayed a shameful disregard for civilian life, carrying out serious violations and war crimes, including summary killings and unlawful attacks that have killed and injured civilians, during the offensive into northeast Syria. Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), the main fighting force of the Autonomous Administration of North and East Syria (Rojava) since the beginning has been an important ally of the West in the fight against ISIS. They have done the bulk of the fighting on the ground against ISIS. It should be remembered that Syrian Kurds are still holding thousands of ISIS operatives in the prisons controlled and guarded by them. The new regime in Damascus led by Hayat Tahrir al-Sham offers to take over guard duty at Al-Hol prison camp, where thousands of Islamic State fighters and their families remain under guard, is ridiculous, it's equivalent of a hunter offering to guard its prey. The situation would be worse, however, as the thousands of Islamic State fighters would spread out not only across Syria and the Middle East but also into Europe with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan happily extorting concessions from weak European and NATO leaders in exchange for promises not to turn on the wave of illegal immigration. Ankara's neo-Ottoman approach in the region has been clearly visible through its engagement in the Syrian conflict after 2011. All of Turkey's strategic targets and demands since the start of the Syrian conflict like the ousting of the Assad regime, preventing a Kurdish autonomous region, declaration of a no-fly zone, creating a buffer zone along the eastern part of Euphrates River, and protecting radical Islamist groups in Idlib, have been a part of this approach. But Syrian Kurds who are a beacon of liberalism and democracy in the troublesome Middle East should not be allowed to fall prey to the expansionist policies of Turks if this valuable ally of the United States is not provided with the required assistance in time. The West will lose its credibility as a reliable ally.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWdZi0lIQNynzxb3CZfNdiFE	2025-01-06T15:19:12-08:00	
Sarfraz Hussain: Bank Of Punjab Driven By Innovation And Dedicati...	Sarfraz Hussain is a seasoned banker with over 23 years proven track record of success and delivery. He carries with him diversified exposure in Agriculture, SME Banking and Credit Administration with leading commercial banks of Pakistan. He is currently associated with The Bank of Punjab (BOP) as Head Agri Credit Division for last 6 years, and h holds a M. Phil degree in Agri Economics from University of Agriculture, Faisalabad, Pakistan. There are several international and local trainings in his credit, covering different aspects of banking. He is also a certified trainer on the platform of National Institute of Banking and Finance (NIBAF), a training arm of State Bank of Pakistan. His accomplishments at bank testify to his acumen and expertise. BOP has been recognized as Best Bank for Agriculture at the Pakistan Banking Awards 2024. Following are excerpts from an exclusive interview with Sarfraz Hussain. BOP has been recently declared the Best Bank for lending to farmers. Please share the important benchmarks achieved. Sarfraz Hussain: The Bank of Punjab (BOP) acknowledges the critical role of the farming community in sustaining Pakistan’s economy. Guided by a strategy centered on empowerment, innovation, and sustainability, BOP has taken transformative steps to redefine agricultural financing and uplift the livelihoods of farmers nationwide. Key benchmarks achieved include: Sarfraz Hussain Best Agri Bank Recognition: BOP has been awarded the title of Best Agri Bank by Pakistan’s Banking Association (PBA) which is the most prestigious award in this sector in Pakistan. Additionally, BOP has also won of Best Agri Mid-Tier Bank for two consecutive fiscal years (2021–22 and 2022–23). Since it has now entered the league of large Agri Banks, it now ranks second amongst the large banks as per the State Bank of Pakistan’s Agriculture Scorecard. Exponential Growth: Over the last three years, BOP’s agricultural portfolio has increased manifold, from PKR14.93 billion to PKR43.70 billion. Additionally, the Non-Performing Loans (NPLs) also stand at a very low level, below 5% as of December 31, 2023 (far lesser than the industry/competition). Pioneering Initiatives: As the pioneer of the Kissan Card Project, BOP has enhanced financial accessibility for a huge chunk of small/ subsistence farmers – which is perhaps the overlooked portion of the farming population due to lack of organized documentation, business model, socio-economic conditions etc. This program enables them to benefit from digital and subsidized solutions which has been launched by BOP; the Govt. of Punjab. The program, which is an end to end digital system based on a structured transaction through Cards to be used at specified POS machines (vendors), aims to disburse PKR75 billion to more than 500,000 farmers for the ongoing Rabbi season. The prescribed innovation took place by integrating PLRA, PITB and PMD systems into BOP’s system enabling smooth sailing of the project. Additionally, BOP has developed a 'Livestock Card' addressing the small farmers of Non-Farm segment. The project aims to facilitate an estimated around 400,000 farmers with a limit of PKR27,000/ animal. The project aims to disburse a total of PKR11.00 billion. Global Recognition: BOP won the prestigious Gates Foundation's Digital Agri Challenge Fund through Karandaaz, affirming its innovative approach to agricultural finance. The challenge fund won by BOP was contested by several other banks/FIs in partnership with Fintechs/ Agtechs. BOP has been allotted a grant of PKR50.00 million through the project which aims to develop an end-to-end digital lending platform targeting the small/ subsistence farmers. The maximum loan amount to an individual farmer is PKR1.00 million which will be extended to both the Farm (Crop Production) as well as Non-Farm (Dairy & Livestock Only). The Bank will integrate its system with Punjab Land Record Authority (PLRA) for this purpose which will verify a borrower’s land for the crop loans. Electronic Warehouse Receipt Financing: BOP is pioneer bank in introducing EWRF in the industry. This feat is achieved by only 2 banks at the overall industry level, even today. Introduced financing programs under conventional, Islamic, and government schemes, revolutionizing post-harvest financing. BOP has disbursed PKR1.28 billion in this area of financing against major commodities i.e. Paddy and Maize. Adoption of New Insurance Method for Risk Mitigation: Launched the Area Yield Index Insurance to safeguard farmers against production risks. This project, which was launched as a pilot, was also pioneered by BOP and one other Bank in the industry. The payout to the farmers against their crop yields was exemplary. Area Yield Index Insurance (AYII) protects farmers against yield losses due to various factors like adverse weather or pests. An Area Yield Index Insurance (AYII) is an insurance cover that insures farmers against a pre-set historical benchmark. The perils covered in this product are windstorm, frost, excessive rainfall, heat wave, hail, flood, drought, pest and diseases. AYII index insurance primarily covers natural calamities or other factors causing yield reductions in the area. Commitment to Inclusion; Non-Financial Advisory Services: Through a relentless focus on innovation, financial inclusion, and sustainability, BOP continues to empower farmers and strengthen Pakistan’s agricultural sector. BOP has also embraced the Agri Finance Literacy Program (AFLP) introduced by SBP through which it conducted around 600 awareness sessions since the program’s inception, all over the country. The awareness sessions also paved way for female farmer inclusion. Due to female inclusion focus, BOP has also won the women inclusion award by PBA (which is also a prestigious award). Tech-Enabled Advisory Services: Partnered with reputed AgriTech firms to offer non-financial advisory services, equipping farmers with essential knowledge and tools for improved productivity. The onboarding of Agritechs took place through PPRA as well as MOUs/ Agreements. Reputed names in the Agritech industry are included in this list. BOP is currently engaged in providing advisory services to its customers of farm loans i.e. crop Production; Tractors etc. BOP’s comprehensive and forward-looking approach underscores its dedication to being the preferred partner for farmers and a catalyst for agricultural transformation across Pakistan. How has BOP achieved these benchmarks, whereas some larger banks have not? Sarfraz: The Bank of Punjab (BOP) has achieved its benchmarks through a strategic approach that prioritizes innovation, inclusivity, and technological advancement in agricultural finance. Key factors contributing to BOP’s success include: Board Level Commitment: Agri Financing is close to the heart of BOP’s Board. This puts special emphasis on the level of commitment towards this industry. BOP’s senior management is keen to implement the Bank’s strategy formulated to expand agri financing through inclusion, diversity and digitalization. Creation of Agri Hubs: The Agri Credit Division (ACD) of BOP expanded its foot print beyond the borders of Punjab and is now present in all the provinces of Pakistan. Similarly, specific hubs were created through which Agri field officers were hired to expand the team presence in all areas thereby ensuring portfolio growth. ACD is currently managed through the field by a division of 11 regions, 36 hubs and more than 200 Agri designated branches. Each region has a Regional Head supported by a Regional Credit analyst. Program Lending Approach: The Bank of Punjab (BOP) has strategically divided its network into Rural and Urban regions to tailor its offerings to specific customer needs. In rural areas, BOP prioritizes agriculture-based customers, providing a comprehensive suite of Farm and Non-Farm products. This includes financing for essential areas like crop inputs, farm machinery, Dairy/ livestock, fisheries, food processing, and sustainable energy solutions. BOP finances all these sectors under program based lending duly approved by the Bank management. Delegation Matrix: In order to address the Bank’s processing challenges, BOP simplified the approval processing of Agri Loans and delegated powers of approval to the Business Unit, thereby, creating a dedicated Credit Factory within the Business Unit by the name of CIU (Credit Initiation Unit) who look after the business risk and ensure compliance to the regulator and bank’s policy etc. By adopting this multifaceted approach, BOP has successfully outperformed larger banks and established itself as a leader in agricultural finance, driving growth, innovation, and inclusivity in Pakistan’s agricultural sector. What is the amount and share of Inputs/ development/ warehouse construction/ livestock/ aqua culture in the total lending to farmers? Input loans: PKR18.58 billion Development: PKR4.98 billion Livestock/ aquaculture: PKR14.244 billion FFSAP+EWRF: PKR0.367 billion BOP has extended loans to fishermen which were the major products financed and what is the total quantum of loans extended in FY24? Sarfraz: Overall financing and trade business extended to Aquaculture including fishermen during the year remained PKRs3 billion approximately. BOP is involved in EWR financing, what was the quantum of financing in FY24? Sarfraz: By spearheading Electronic Warehouse Receipt (EWR) financing, BOP has revolutionized agricultural financing in Pakistan. The bank has significantly expanded its EWR financing portfolio beyond the pilot phase, incorporating a diverse range of commodities such as maize, rice/ paddy, and wheat. Through this initiative, BOP has enabled farmers and businesses across various regions to unlock the value of their agricultural assets, promoting sectoral growth and financial empowerment. EWRF significantly addresses the country’s issue of Food Security, postharvest crop losses and compensation to farmers for the sale of their crops in the peak time. In FY24, BOP disbursed PKR1.28 billion under EWR financing. What is the lending target of lending to farmers for FY25? Sarfraz: After being named Best Agriculture Bank of the Year 2024, BOP is poised to further its leadership in agricultural financing. The bank remains dedicated to enhancing financial inclusion, delivering innovative solutions, and transforming the agricultural sector. For FY25, BOP has set an ambitious lending target of PKRs110 billion to support the growth and prosperity of farmers across Pakistan. Which new areas BOP intend to explore in FY25? Sarfraz: BOP is focused on digital innovation in agriculture financing to provide quick and efficient online loan solutions for farmers, improving accessibility, transparency, and the overall borrowing experience. Key areas of exploration include: Launching the Digital Grower Loan. Digitizing non-farm sectors lending. Offering bundled non-financial advisory services alongside farm sector financing. Partnering with agribusiness corporates for dairy/ Livestock / Crop Production/ Agri machinery to enhance financial inclusion through a close loop value chain model. What is the recovery percentage/ bad loans? Sarfraz: BOP has maintained an impressive recovery rate of 97%, with bad loans accounting for less than 3% of the portfolio, reflecting its strong risk management and borrower engagement strategies. Does BOP go for credit insurance? Sarfraz: BOP currently does not go for credit insurance. This is in line with the industry practice in Pakistan where credit insurance does not prevail. Additionally, we believe that the local insurance industry is not offering any such credit solutions. However, BOP has insurance arrangements in place for Livestock and Dairy Animals, Agri Machinery and Tractors, along with crop loan Insurance for Crop Production loans. Moreover, Bop offers comprehensive insurance coverage for all its agricultural products. This includes life insurance of its clients pertaining to digital lending.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWdZi0lIQNynz-Hzuf4i5kwW	2025-01-06T15:16:57-08:00	
Indian Politicians And Media Are Harming Hindus In Bangladesh – O...	That the sense of gratitude is not perpetual is a proven reality evident in the context of Bangladesh-India relations. During Bangladesh's War of Liberation, India extended unparalleled support, often beyond its own capacity. India not only provided shelter to 10 million refugees but also ensured their sustenance with remarkable compassion and empathy. On the historic day of December 16th, the unforgettable scenes of the Pakistani army's surrender to the allied forces of Bangladesh and India at the Ramna Racecourse remain etched in our collective memory. The open-air signing ceremony and the sky-high cheers from the people of Dhaka as they welcomed the Indian army generals and soldiers were nothing short of incredible. Where have those profound feelings of solidarity and gratitude gone? Why have they faded over time? Two key incidents can help us to explain the erosion of positive sentiments toward India in Bangladesh: the Farakka Long March of 1976, led by Maulana Bhashani, and the tragic killing of a 15-year-old girl named Felani in 2011. The Farakka Long March symbolized widespread resentment over India's alleged failure to ensure a fair and equitable share of river water, leaving Bangladeshis feeling deprived. Similarly, the repeated killing of Bangladeshis intruders—along the India-Bangladesh border, with Felani's death serving as a heart-wrenching example, has further fueled anger and distrust. These events reflect deep-seated grievances of Bangladeshis. India demonstrated remarkable diplomatic success in the early 1970s, particularly under the leadership of Prime Minister Indira Gandhi, who skillfully outmaneuvered her global counterparts. The creation of Bangladesh in 1971 stands as a testament to her strategic acumen and India's diplomatic prowess during that era. During I.K. Gujral's premiership, India adopted the Gujral Doctrine, which emphasized fostering goodwill and cooperation with neighboring countries without expecting reciprocity. This policy created a period of relative harmony and satisfaction among Bangladesh and other neighboring nations. Unfortunately, in the years since, India's approach to regional diplomacy has seen a decline, contributing to rising tensions and resentment in its immediate neighborhood, including Bangladesh. The rise of the BJP as a Hindu nationalist party in India has inadvertently fueled the growth of Islamic fundamentalism in Bangladesh. This dynamic is deeply rooted in the historical and sociopolitical interplay between the two neighboring countries, forming a dialectical relationship that continues to shape their interactions. A key misstep in Indian diplomacy lies in its tendency to prioritize relations with ruling regimes rather than engaging directly with the people. Effective diplomacy should center on fostering goodwill and trust among the population of the concerned country. Building a sustainable and robust bilateral relationship requires winning the hearts and minds of the populace, thereby creating a foundation of mutual respect and understanding. Both Congress and BJP governments have blindly supported the Hasina regime in Bangladesh. The BJP government continued to back Sheikh Hasina, even though her re-election was marred by widespread electoral rigging. When a government is installed through such dubious means, it loses the trust of its people. Consequently, the overt support from India for Sheikh Hasina’s regime not only alienated the Bangladeshi people from their own government but also intensified resentment against India itself. India’s failure to grasp the depth of public anger towards Sheikh Hasina is baffling. Had Indian policymakers truly understood the situation, they might have advised Hasina differently—perhaps urging her to hold free and fair elections or even to resign voluntarily to prevent escalating tensions. The resignation and departure of Sheikh Hasina have brought a new wave of challenges. As is often the case after regime changes, incidents of persecution against minority communities, particularly Hindus, have surfaced. One particularly troubling case is that of Hindu monk Chinmoy Krishna Das, who has been arrested on charges of sedition. Disturbingly, he has been denied bail, and lawyers willing to represent him have reportedly faced intimidation, with some even being physically assaulted. As a Hindu-majority country and a close neighbor, India has a moral responsibility to address these issues with sensitivity. The Prime Minister's Office, through its regular briefings, could express concern over the persecution of Hindus in Bangladesh—much like the way the United States has been vocal about human rights issues. However, instead of adopting a constructive approach, many Indian politicians and media outlets have resorted to relentless denunciations. Indian television channels, in particular, have been saturated with loud and sensational coverage of Bangladesh’s internal events since Sheikh Hasina’s departure. This incessant vilification not only undermines India's credibility as a responsible regional power but also risks worsening the plight of the Hindu minority in Bangladesh. A more measured and diplomatic response is urgently needed to support minority rights without inflaming tensions further. Their actions appear more motivated by political self-interest, with the aim of leveraging communal sentiments to secure votes. They are doing little to help the Bangladeshi Hindu community and, in fact, they have no capacity to effect meaningful change on the ground. However, these relentless denunciations have caused significant harm to Bangladeshi Hindus. Such actions have fueled distrust between Muslims and Hindus, further straining the already delicate fabric of interfaith relations in Bangladesh. This atmosphere of division has created tangible challenges for Hindus in various spheres of life. For instance, I have come across numerous accounts of Hindu professionals—particularly those in leadership positions in offices and academic environments—facing resistance, disrespect, and even outright hostility from their Muslim subordinates. This toxic environment, largely exacerbated by the polarizing narratives broadcasted by Indian media, is making it increasingly difficult for Hindus to perform their duties and maintain their positions. A harmonious relationship between India and Bangladesh is essential for fostering peaceful coexistence between Hindus and Muslims, not just in Bangladesh but also in India. Responsible diplomacy and measured rhetoric are critical to building mutual trust and addressing minority issues effectively.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWdZi0lIQNynz0P4yrQaDPjO	2025-01-06T15:14:37-08:00	
NATO, Ukraine, And The Looming Challenges Of Trump’s Return – Ana...	As Europe braces for President Donald Trump’s return to the White House, questions loom over its impact on the war in Ukraine and NATO’s future. Nearly three years on, Russia’s invasion of Ukraine remains the most significant challenge to transatlantic security since World War II. The year 2024 proved pivotal for the conflict. Russia secured minor territorial gains in Ukraine but paid a steep price. As it ramped up airstrikes on Ukrainian cities. Ukraine responded with bold moves, including an incursion into Russia’s Kursk Oblast and advancing weapons capable of hitting deep inside Russian territory. In a dramatic twist, North Korean ground forces entered the fray on Russia’s side, escalating tensions further. These developments have underscored the complexity of the war and its far-reaching consequences. With Trump soon to return to office, Europe must tackle shifting dynamics that could redefine its approach to the conflict and test NATO’s resolve in safeguarding transatlantic stability. After Ukraine’s underwhelming counteroffensive in 2023, expectations for any major breakthrough in 2024 were notably tempered. The narrative among Kyiv’s Western allies shifted to a longer-term strategy: rearming, restructuring, and training the Ukrainian military for a potential counteroffensive in 2025. However, this plan faced significant setbacks, with political gridlock in Congress that delayed critical military aid for months. By early 2024, Ukraine was grappling with dire shortages of air defense missiles, artillery shells, and basic ammunition for its front-line troops. When American aid finally arrived in March, it came just as Ukraine faced mounting pressure from small yet strategically important Russian advances, particularly in the Donetsk region. Nevertheless, bolstered by the much-needed support, Ukraine launched an audacious counteroffensive into Russia’s Kursk Oblast, which showcased Ukraine’s ability to succeed when adequately equipped. The capture of Russian territory reshaped the strategic calculus. Any future peace talks are now unlikely to freeze the front lines at their current positions. Moreover, Ukraine’s maneuver compelled Moscow to divert troops and resources to defend Kursk, alleviating pressure on other critical fronts. This operation not only signaled Kyiv’s resilience but also demonstrated the enduring importance of sustained Western support. Ukraine also faced diplomatic setbacks during NATO’s landmark 75th-anniversary summit in Washington this July. Expectations were high that the alliance would outline a definitive path for Ukraine’s membership, even as immediate accession was off the table due to Kyiv’s ongoing war with Russia. Instead, Ukraine was handed ambiguous assurances of eventual membership but without a clear roadmap, leaving Kyiv with more questions than answers. This outcome represented a missed opportunity, both for NATO and Ukraine. For Ukraine, it dashed hopes of a transformative moment in its integration into the Western security architecture. For NATO, it highlighted an internal hesitancy to adapt decisively to the evolving threats posed by Russia’s aggression. The vague promises made by NATO underscores the persistent uncertainty in Ukraine’s fight for a secure place within Europe’s defense structure. It also signals to Russia that cracks remain in the West’s resolve. Ukraine left the summit with a reaffirmation of NATO’s moral support but without the strategic guarantees it so urgently seeks. To predict Donald Trump’s strategy in Ukraine, his first-term approach to foreign policy provides useful insights, particularly his handling of the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) with Iran. Although he vowed to exit the nuclear deal during the 2016 campaign, Trump did not immediately follow through upon taking office. Instead, he adopted a gradual approach: an interagency review led to a phased withdrawal, which culminated with a definitive exit in May 2018, more than a year into his presidency. This methodical withdrawal was followed by the launch of a 'maximum pressure' campaign against Iran, executed with deliberate planning despite its divisiveness. A similar pragmatism may shape Trump’s policy toward Ukraine. Although some of his prior comments have raised concerns about his stance on Russia, Trump is unlikely to pursue a course that could be interpreted as weakness. A settlement that favors Moscow would risk significant political fallout, undermining his strongman image. Any conclusion to the war that weakens Ukraine while bolstering Russia could mirror the optics of the Biden administration’s much-criticized withdrawal from Afghanistan, an outcome Trump would be keen to avoid. Whether through intensified diplomatic efforts or recalibrated military aid, Trump’s decisions will likely balance his political ambitions with America’s international credibility. Frustration is mounting among Ukrainians over delays in recent assistance and the strict limitations imposed by the White House on the use of American weapons. However, Trump’s recent exchanges with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky have been notably positive. Their in-person meeting in September was described as constructive, and within 24 hours of Trump’s reelection, the two leaders spoke again by phone, signaling an ongoing commitment to dialogue. Moreover, early indications from Trump’s new administration have been encouraging for Kyiv. National Security Adviser Mike Waltz and Secretary of State nominee Marco Rubio are both known for their past expressions of support for Ukraine, suggesting a continuation of assistance under new leadership. As Trump seeks a resolution to the Ukraine conflict, any expectations of a swift or simple outcome are misguided. The world must brace for the likelihood that the war will remain unresolved through 2025.

Moscow–Pyongyang Partnership Could Derail Japan’s Indo-Pacific St...	By Ben Sando In November 2024, Japanese Foreign Minister Takeshi Iwaya stopped in Kyiv for a surprise meeting with his counterpart, Andrii Sybiha. Iwaya’s priority was to discuss the some 12,000 North Korean soldiers battling Ukrainian forces in the Kursk border region of Russia. This burgeoning military alliance between Pyongyang and Moscow threatens to upset the security balance in Northeast Asia and may force Tokyo to scale back its engagement with maritime issues in East Asia. For the past two decades, a new generation of political leadership in Tokyo has encouraged a pivot away from Japan’s insular, restrained defence posture towards greater engagement in defence multilateralism, led by the United States. Former prime minister Shinzo Abe signalled his resolve in 2014 by reinterpreting Japan’s pacifist constitution to allow greater leeway for the Self-Defense Forces (SDF) to come to the aid of an ally under attack, an act Japan’s armed forces were previously unable to perform. In 2016, Abe announced the Free and Open Indo-Pacific (FOIP) strategy, which was geared towards curbing China’s growing influence in maritime Asia. Japan helped revitalise the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue (the Quad), and has participated in naval exercises with Quad members in waters as far-flung as the Indian Ocean. In tandem with this enhanced multilateral engagement, the SDF has shifted its focus south and has invested in the defence of its southernmost islands, the Nansei Shoto, against Chinese aggression. Japan’s expansive new foreign policy has cemented it into the United States’ vision for East Asian order and endeared Tokyo to capitals throughout the Indo-Pacific. But Tokyo’s expansive regional vision has implicitly relied on a relatively predictable balance of power in Japan’s immediate vicinity, Northeast Asia. The principal impediment to peace in Northeast Asia — North Korea — has historically been deterred by the US nuclear umbrella and remained weak and impoverished due to decades of economic sanctions. While South Korea has been preoccupied with balancing North Korean military power, Japan has been able to prioritise issues beyond its main archipelago, such as China’s threats to maritime security in East and Southeast Asia. For Japanese defence planners, the North Korean threat is not as urgent as China’s expansionism. North Korea remains a frail power, but its incipient military alliance with Russia promises toboost its technological capacity, enable its independence from China — its traditional security partner — and allow it to project force beyond the Korean Peninsula. This Russian aid is already visible. Moscow has shared air defence technology with Pyongyang and has aided it in its halting efforts at a military space program. Admiral Samuel Paparo, commander of the US Indo-Pacific Command, predicts that Moscow will transfer nuclear submarine technology to Pyongyang. North Korea’s submarines, which presently patrol its shores in the Sea of Japan, could offer an elevated threat to Japan’s Maritime SDF if equipped with more advanced propulsion systems. Emboldened by its freedom from Beijing and replete with advanced weaponry, Pyongyang may escalate tensions with its democratic neighbours in Northeast Asia in a bid to secure diplomatic concessions. Such aggression may force Japan to re-orient from a focus on containing China to deterring North Korea. Simultaneously, the Japanese political elite and public may lose enthusiasm for the FOIP vision that commits defence and diplomatic resources beyond Japan’s main archipelago. Anxiety over North Korea’s military expansion serves the interests of China and Russia, which both oppose Japan’s support for Taiwan and Ukraine. Beijing and Moscow may opt to underwrite a policy by North Korean president Kim Jong-un to impede the expanding regional strategies of South Korea and Japan through calculated aggression. As Japan’s Liberal Democratic Party — the political force behind the FOIP vision — rules with a minority government, Japanese political elites may lose the political capital to convince the public to support engagement beyond acute Northeast Asian threats. Much of North Korea’s strategy will be defined by its interactions with US President-elect Donald Trump. But it is uncertain whether Trump can recreate the conditions needed for any kind of rapprochement with Pyongyang, especially given that North Korea’s intercontinental ballistic missile technology is established and Kim Jong-un has eradicated the channels for diplomatic engagement with South Korea. Tokyo should not wait for unilateral US diplomacy and should instead double down on successful defence trilateralism with Seoul and Washington. If Tokyo can learn to trust South Korea and the South Korea–US alliance with its own security, it can continue an offensive position that commits the SDF beyond Northeast Asia. There is evidence that this is possible. In October 2022, when North Korea fired a missile over Japan’s main island, it was South Korea and the United States that retaliated with a precision bombing drill near North Korea. But the impeachment of South Korean President Yoon Seok Yeol has thrown the prospect of such a policy up in the air. If Seoul commits to blunting North Korea’s escalations against both South Korea and Japan, Tokyo will retain relative comfort in committing the SDF to contain China in the East and South China Seas, even as North Korea and Russia grow more menacing. Only sustained security cooperation with Seoul will allow Tokyo to preserve its FOIP vision and tackle the growing threat of Beijing in the Indo-Pacific.

China’s Paper Boat Navy: A Colossus At Risk Of Capsizing – Analys...	China's naval expansion has been nothing short of staggering. In just two decades, the People's Liberation Army Navy (PLAN) has transformed into the world's largest maritime force by fleet size. This dramatic growth underpins Beijing's ambitions to project power and challenge the established dominance of the United States and its allies in the Indo-Pacific. Yet, beneath the veneer of strength lies a navy grappling with critical vulnerabilities—untested in combat, reliant on unproven technology, and overstretched in its strategic reach. The PLAN may appear formidable on paper, but is a colossus with clay feet. Its vulnerabilities expose it as a paper tiger, raising serious doubts about its ability to sustain dominance during prolonged maritime conflict. A Force Without a Fight: The PLAN's Combat Deficiency Military power is measured in numbers and tested in the crucible of battle. By this metric, the PLAN is strikingly deficient. Since the Sino-Vietnamese War in 1979, China has not engaged in significant armed conflict, leaving its military leadership and personnel devoid of the experience that underpins effective combat readiness. Decades of peace have created a theoretically powerful but operationally unproven force. No matter how elaborate, Naval exercises cannot replicate war's chaos and unpredictability. For instance, the PLAN's dual-carrier drills in the South China Sea (SCS) showcase technical skills but lack the real-world pressures of adversarial engagement. In stark contrast, the U.S. Navy and its QUAD allies like the Indian Navy have amassed decades of operational experience, from combating piracy off the Horn of Africa to high-stakes missions in contested waters. Combat in modern maritime warfare demands quick decision-making, flexible tactics, and the ability to adapt under fire. The PLAN's rigid command structures and lack of real-world testing leave critical questions unanswered: Can it operate cohesively under fire? Will its untested systems perform reliably when it matters most? Quantity Over Quality: The PLAN's Technological Dilemma The rapid expansion of China's fleet has come at a cost. While the PLAN boasts over 234 warships, many vessels suffer from design flaws, reliability issues, and rushed production schedules. The result is a fleet that prioritises numbers over combat endurance. Submarine Mishaps: The 2024 sinking of a Zhou-class nuclear submarine during trials near Wuhan epitomised the risks of hasty development. Engineering flaws led to the catastrophic failure of a vessel intended to represent the cutting edge of Chinese naval power. Surface Fleet Shortcomings: The PLAN's frigates and destroyers, including those exported to Pakistan, have faced recurring technical problems. Islamabad's dissatisfaction with Chinese-built F-22P frigates highlights the gap between expectations and reality. Ageing Underwater Arsenal: China's submarine force, though growing in size, struggles to match the stealth, range, and firepower of its American counterparts. The lack of advanced vertical launch systems (VLS) on PLAN submarines further limits their operational flexibility. While Beijing's shipyards are among the most productive in the world, this industrial prowess masks underlying weaknesses. The PLAN's emphasis on rapid construction leaves little room for rigorous testing and quality control, creating a fleet that may falter under sustained conflict. Exporting Dependence: China's Arms in the IOR Beyond building ships for its own use, China has sought to extend its influence through arms exports to nations in the Indian Ocean Region (IOR). Countries such as Bangladesh, Myanmar, and Pakistan have become major recipients of Chinese naval platforms, often provided at attractive financing terms or as part of broader strategic agreements. However, these deals come with significant caveats. Substandard Equipment: Myanmar's decision to return a Chinese submarine in 2022 after persistent mechanical failures reflects the low quality of these exports. Technology Lock-In: By refusing to share critical technologies, China ensures recipient nations remain dependent on Beijing for maintenance and upgrades. This dependency stifles the development of indigenous defence capabilities and fosters long-term reliance on Chinese support. Limited After-Sales Service: Recipient nations frequently cite a lack of post-delivery support, further diminishing the operational value of Chinese-made vessels. These practices undermine China's image as a reliable arms supplier. The PLAN's export model prioritises influence over partnership, leaving recipient nations questioning the value of Chinese military hardware. Strategic Overreach: The Risks of Expansion China's naval ambitions are not limited to shipbuilding; they extend to the Indo-Pacific and beyond. From constructing artificial islands in the West Philippine Sea to deploying warships in the Indian Ocean, Beijing is signalling its intent to dominate key maritime chokepoints. However, this strategy exposes significant vulnerabilities. Logistical Constraints: The PLAN lacks a robust network of overseas bases that underpins U.S. naval operations. Its reliance on the Djibouti facility and sporadic port agreements limits its ability to sustain deployments far from home. Blue-Water Aspirations: While China has made strides toward becoming a blue-water navy, much of its fleet remains optimised for littoral operations. Frigates and corvettes dominate its order of battle, offering limited utility in high-seas engagements. Aircraft Carrier Shortcomings: The PLAN's aircraft carriers, Liaoning and Shandong, face significant logistical and operational challenges. Their role in modern naval warfare remains uncertain without the advanced catapult systems and air wings that define U.S. supercarriers. China's efforts to project power risk outpacing its ability to sustain it. Overextension could leave the PLAN vulnerable to rival powers' counterstrategies, particularly in contested regions like the West Philippine Sea and the Indian Ocean. Opportunities for Counterbalance The PLAN's weaknesses present a strategic opening for its adversaries. Regional powers such as India, Japan, and Australia are uniquely positioned to counterbalance China's maritime ambitions. Enhanced interoperability, joint exercises, and leveraging advanced technologies can tilt the scales in favour of a rules-based maritime order. With its established naval tradition and strategic location, India is particularly well-placed to challenge Beijing's influence in the IOR. Its growing partnerships with like-minded nations, including the USA and Japan, highlight the potential for coordinated responses to Chinese assertiveness. A Navy on Shaky Waters China's navy may be the largest in the world, but its scale belies its fragility. From its lack of combat experience and unreliable technologies to its contentious export practices and strategic overreach, the PLAN is a force that remains unproven in both capability and resilience. As the Indo-Pacific becomes the stage for great power competition, China's maritime aspirations face mounting challenges. The PLAN's vulnerabilities offer a cautionary tale and an opportunity for regional and global actors to craft a counterbalance that ensures stability and deters aggression. Ultimately, the PLAN's rapid rise is as much a warning to its adversaries as it is to itself: strength built on shaky foundations rarely endures the test of time.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfRniTl9HKi3W6xRNJzdXYn	2025-01-04T17:13:01-08:00	
US-India: Diamonds Are Not Forever – OpEd	The US state department disclosed on Thursday in an accounting of gifts received from foreign leaders during 2023 that Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s was the 'priciest' gift that President Biden received, rather, his wife Jill Biden received — a diamond valued at $20,000 (over Rs. 17 lakh.) To an observer of the US political culture, it would invoke the analogy of a Middle Eastern sheikh from the Gulf region kow-towing to curry favours from the White House. Indeed, troubling questions do arise. Touched to the quick, Delhi reacted immediately to put the record straight — that it was an artificial lab-grown diamond with a cost price between Rs. 15000-25000, which would put the value of the gift between Rs. 1.1-1.9 lakh only. What Delhi didn’t say, or more likely its bureaucrats didn’t know, is that while real diamond has no limits on its shelf life, a lab-grown diamond may look the same, but has zero resale value. Suffice to say, the brilliance of the relationship may be gone, but the stone won’t lose its lustre and doesn’t get worn out with time. Delhi’s clumsy clarification, unattributed of course, makes things worse. Actually, none of the three famous people looks good in this controversy. It makes Jill Biden who apparently took the gift seriously and retained it for official use, somewhat foolish. A lavish edition of Mahabharata, the great epic that tells a millennia-old tale about the futility of war would have probably made a more appropriate gift from Modi to Biden who poked his nose into a fratricidal strife in distant Eurasia, undermined a nascent peace treaty between two brothers, and coaxed the impetuous kid brother to instead go into a futile proxy war that ultimately caused the death of hundreds of thousands of his subjects and destroyed his kingdom. Biden is still unrepentant. Earlier this week, columns of American military vehicles loaded with weaponry were crossing border from Iraq into Syria in anticipation of some war in the making just 4 years after the old one ended. However, the good part is that the diamond controversy is emblematic of the matrix of US-Indian relationship beneath the rhetoric. Some sixteen months after gifting the diamond, BJP accused the Biden administration of conspiring to overthrow Modi government. Which means that the estimation of Jill Biden being a ‘silvery influencer’ in the White House was a wrong notion. The Biden administration is no longer believing that in Modi government it has a potential ally to curb China’s rise as superpower that would spell doom for the 5-century old Western hegemony in the world order. The Biden Team belatedly realised that Delhi was not only boosting the ties with Russia but also had a master plan to engage with China bilaterally and work out the guard rails of co-habitation as immediate neighbours. The common refrain is that constraints in India’s development path forced the government, under pressure from the industry and business, to ease the tensions with China to attract investments and boost trade. But that is not the whole story. Chinese commentaries are stressing that the two countries have a higher destiny that is easier to realise if they cooperate rather than undercut each other. There is much truth in this, as the colonial history would testify. At any rate, the defining moment in the US-Indian relationship came with the G20 Summit, which Modi hosted in the third quarter of 2023, when Biden came to Delhi and in tandem with his Canadian counterpart Prime Minister Justin Trudeau took up with Modi the report of the Five Eyes (US, Canada, UK, Australia and New Zealand) that India was involved in trans-national crimes in North America. The whiplash, albeit administered in private, came as a bolt from the blue when Indian diplomacy was riding high — oil trade with Russia going hand in hand with the 'consequential' partnership with the US. The entire delusional foreign-policy matrix began unravelling. And a cat-and-mouse game began, culminating in the Biden administration installing a hostile regime in Bangladesh. It was a stark reminder that diamonds are not forever. Indeed, there are heartrending tales in literature of young love and passion turning into betrayals, vendetta, betrayals, revenge and marginalisation, and an entire world tumbling down around diamonds. Fortunately, the sordid chapter is ending as the Trump presidency begins on Jan. 20. The big question is what conclusion Trump would have drawn by now. Perhaps, External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar is doing the right thing by reminding the Trump Team tirelessly that their boss holds the patent for Quad. But, a rearguard course correction is already being advocated in the US intellectual discourses. The prestigious DC-based Stimson Centre addressed two policy briefs on the Indo-Pacific in quick succession to the new administration no sooner than Trump’s election victory was in the cards on November 5: Revive the South Asia Strategy by Elizabeth Threlkeld • Elizabeth Zazycki dated November 26, 2024, which argues that 'The next administration should craft a standalone South Asia strategy to address regional complexities while aligning with Indo-Pacific priorities', and, Think Small to Win Big in the Indo-Pacific by Kelly A. Grieco • Evan Cooper dated November 21, 2024, which argues that 'The next administration should lean into smaller, more flexible alignments and issue-based coalitions and lead more with economics and diplomacy rather than military and security policies.' Succinctly put, the thesis advanced by these policy wonks is, paradoxically, what Jaishankar also has been espousing — multi-alignment as a foreign-policy doctrine. There is a saying that our dreams ought to be what define our individuality. As the English poet and philosopher William Blake put it succinctly, ‘No bird soars too high if he soars with his own wings’. But the Modi Government’s diplomacy leaps out of Kautilya’s Arthashastra, the ancient Indian Sanskrit treatise on statecraft, politics, economic policy and military strategy which overlooks that this is an era of Internet and Artificial Intelligence. Delusional mantras still continue — ‘There is a bipartisan consensus in America for relations with India; so-and-so in Trump Team has been in the India Caucasus; we got along fine with Trump, etc.’ From available indications, however, Trump 2.0 can be radically different. Trump has no more elections to fight and his soaring ambition, which is no secret, will be to carve out a legacy that outshines by far all his mediocre predecessors. Trump’s turnaround on H-1B visa debateshows that he can take tough decisions and there are no holy cows in his domain. Then, there is the X factor, the known unknown, navigating his compass. By the way, I go along entirely with the incisive opinion of Mick Mulvaney, who served as Mr. Trump’s second chief of staff, when he told the Times, 'What makes (Elon) Musk such a valuable adviser is that he has enough money — and enough other things to do — that he is uniquely situated to be the bearer of honest news. More than perhaps anybody else on the planet, he doesn’t need the job.'	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfRniTl9HKi3dHO0TwJO-yn	2025-01-04T17:11:28-08:00	
India Can Learn From Argentina’s Economic Turnaround – OpEd	By Mudit Jain Argentinean President Javier Milei is a self-described anarcho-capitalist, which means he supports replacing the state with free markets and private entities. He can also be described as a minarchist, supporting a 'night watchman' state whose only function is to preserve its citizens’ safety and property rights. In simple words, for Milei, citizens should have the freedom and responsibility to support themselves through their own enterprise, both economic and social, with the state providing only military, police and law courts. As soon as he entered office in December 2023, Milei implemented shock treatment — much needed after years of hyperinflation and rampant taxing and spending led to low investment and capital flight. Let’s look at what he has achieved in one year since then. Under Milei, annualized inflation — which was over 200% a year ago — has come down to 166%. Because falling prices have a cascading effect, this trend will accelerate in the new year. BBVA Research projects that it will reach just 35% in 2025. Milei loosened tenancy laws, leading to an increase in the housing supply and drastically reducing rents. In February, Milei oversaw Argentina’s first monthly budget surplus in 12 years, a feat that he would go on to repeat throughout 2024, substantially decreasing the country’s default risk. The new president has achieved all this through drastic cuts in government spending and regulation, allowing the markets to perform the basic function of price discovery based on supply and demand. He abolished 13 ministries, slashed 30,000 government jobs and limited both the size and powers of the tax department. The results have been magnificent. There are still challenges of poverty reduction and unemployment but these are legacy issues and will take time to improve. With the current numbers, Argentineans are finally starting to feel some hope. India can learn from Argentina Could such policies improve the economy of India? After India’s independence in 1947, industrialization took off sharply under a mixed economy model. Rapid growth continued until faulty policies of excessive state control under Prime Minister Indira Gandhi (1966–1977 and 1980–1984) led to stagnation. In 1970, the per capita income of India, South Korea and China was around $270. In 2022, nearly 50 years later, that number was about $2,700 for India, compared to over $10,000 in China and over $30,000 in South Korea. Even Bangladesh has exceeded India in per capita, and India is now one of the poorest countries in Asia. Sure, India can technically claim to be the fifth largest economy in the world, with a fast growth rate of 7%, but the reality is starkly different the numbers are normalized on a per capita basis. Besides, with just as much veracity, India could call itself the world leader in the number of people living in poverty, in people suffering from blindness and in malnourished people. Corruption is endemic, government services at all levels are abysmal, trade deficits are huge, jobs are unavailable, and millions continue to migrate overseas both legally and illegally. The feudal mentality of the state continues as it did in colonial times; the impulse of policymakers is to make the state even bigger and the citizens even less empowered. One can hardly imagine how this would lead to improvement. Instead, we should take a cue from Milei’s philosophy of minimal state intervention. Less government spending would mean less incentive for corruption and less inflation. At the same time, deregulation would mean empowered, productive citizens enabled to create their own enterprises, raising GDP and lowering unemployment. Indians are natural entrepreneurs, after all; unleashing their latent energies would create a huge domestic market that would facilitate unlimited growth. It would be the golden age of India. Countries like China and Singapore have shown that state control can indeed grow the economy — if it is done responsibly and lawfully. Sadly, India has developed the worst habits of command economies without the benefits. The Indian administrative state is too corrupt to pull off a feat like China or Singapore. We are more like Argentina, and what worked there can work here too. India could be the poster nation of this new philosophy of placing the common citizen on top.

World War I: The Great Banker Bailout – OpEd	By Joshua Mawhorter 'Nobody could hate war more than I do.'—J. P. Morgan, Senate Munitions Committee 'We see men living with their skulls blown open; we see soldiers run with their two feet cut off, they stagger on their splintered stumps into the next shell-hole; a lance-corporal crawls a mile and a half on his hands dragging his smashed knee after him; another goes to the dressing station and over his clasped hands bulge his intestines; we see men without mouths, without jaws, without faces; we find one man who has held the artery of his arm in his teeth for two hours in order not to bleed to death. The sun goes down, night comes, the shells whine, life is at an end.'—All Quiet on the Western Front It is estimated that the disaster of World War I claimed some 15-22 million lives. This does not even take into account the injuries, property destruction, and other post-war consequences. The above quote from the well-known novel, All Quiet on the Western Front, captures a horrific snapshot of World War I. While people often flippantly talk about war—especially from within the borders of a wealthy international hegemon like the United States—people ought to read such descriptions and soberly weigh the costs and benefits of going to war. Given the description of the destruction above, plus the fact that Woodrow Wilson ran on the slogan, 'He kept us out of war,' Americans probably would have resented the fact that the late entry of the United States in World War I served, at least in large part, to bail out American bankers. Such a statement as, 'We are fighting this war on behalf of the bankers,' was, at one time, enough to land an American populist presidential candidate—Eugene V. Debs—in prison under the Espionage Act and Sedition Acts in 1918. However, following the war, Woodrow Wilson admitted, Why, my fellow-citizens, is there any man here, or any woman—let me say, is there any child here, who does not know that the seed of war in the modern world is industrial and commercial rivalry? . . . This war, in its inception, was a commercial and industrial war. It was not a political war. Yet, in the above quote, Wilson only admitted that this was the case for the commercial powers of Germany and its rivals, but he did not acknowledge the rescue that the US performed for American bankers in the war, who had been funding the Allied cause and providing loans to the Allied powers. The newly-printed money for these loans, supplied to Allied European powers, was quickly funneled back to certain industries in the United States who provided war materials. In the middle were the Fed-connected bankers. No less an historian than the Oxford don, Niall Ferguson—who we might expect to act as a 'court' historian who crafts evidence only to make a positive case for the actions of the state—in his Pity of War (p. 329), said, 'By the beginning of 1917, J. P. Morgan was so committed to Britain...it was Morgan as much as Britain which was bailed out in 1917.' He was right. World War I provided a new opportunity to utilize the newly-created powers of central banking through the Federal Reserve system. The Federal Reserve—doubling the money supply since its inception in 1914—would finance US entry into World War I. This probably could not or would not have been supported by the American people through direct taxation. World War I simultaneously strengthened the power and centralization of the Fed, the federal government, and the closely-connected banker-industrial class. Wall Street banks and Morgan were greatly benefited by the war as financier and mart for war materials for the Allies. How did this process work? The war heavily indebted England and France. When the merchant banks and even the central banks of those countries hit limits, the political elites of England and France turned to the US and the House of Morgan. Most of the money loaned out by the US was quickly funneled back to the US to purchase war materials from select US companies. Acting both as banker and purchase agent, J. P. Morgan would loan the money to the Allies, quickly receive it back in order to direct it to US companies, receiving a commission from each transaction in both directions. Many of the companies receiving these production contracts were often owned by Morgan holding companies or were at least within 'his orbit of bank control.' When it seemed that the Axis powers might succeed in the war as is ground toward a stalemate, these financial interests agitated for American entry into the war to extricate them from a major financial loss and open new vistas of profit. Woodrow Wilson also saw US financial control over the other Allies as essential to influencing France and England into Wilson’s view of post-war peace and world order. The fortunes of the House of Morgan had actually been declining since about 1900, but the outbreak of the war provided opportunity for Morgan, the Fed, the Fed-connected banks, and the select companies which would receive war contracts. Rothbard said, 'At the moment of great financial danger for the Morgans, the advent of World War I came as a godsend.' Walter Hines Page—trustee of the Rockefeller General Education Board, editor of several Wall Street publications, and so pro-British that he often appeared to others to be a British agent—is described in Lundberg’s America’s 60 Families (1937), 'He did everything he could to have the United States rake England’s chestnuts out of the fire.' Therefore, 'There was every reason, of course, for Wall Street to regard the war as beneficent.' While there is absolutely nothing wrong with voluntary trade and profit on a free market, as these are essential features of a thriving civilization, we should remind ourselves that there are two ways to reap economic growth—engaging in the production-and-exchange process or force and fraud to expropriate the production of others. Reaping wealth by the political means—war, force, coercion, cronyism—should not be considered as within the same category of market profits. While there were many well-earned entrepreneurial fortunes during this era, many fortunes were made through the war—wealth transferred from the American people to these institutions via the Fed and government. Lundberg, again, records that, in 1892, the number of fortunes amounting to a million dollars or more was only 4,047. In 1914, the millionaire or higher fortunes amounted to 7,509, but by the next year—largely because of the war profits—there were 10,450. The Internal Revenue Bureau recorded that the number grew to 11,800 in 1917. The newly-inflated money that the US government 'sent' to Europe quickly returned to the US bankers and companies with war contracts. Lundberg writes, Europe got none of the money lent by the Treasury; it received only materials of war. The owners of American industries got the money. They employed most of it to expand the industrial equipment of the nation and to increase the size of their fortunes and the extent of their power. In short, the war debt created by the American government amounted simply to money transferred from the people of the country to the richest families, who owned the banks and industries. Wartime profits…were enormous. The money that the US government—aided and abetted by the Fed and banking system—gave to the Allies was basically' [transferred] into the hands of the wealthiest families.' General Smedley Butler—retired major general, two-time Medal of Honor recipient, and author of War is a Racket—wrote in 1935, In the World War a mere handful garnered the profits of the conflict. At least 21,000 new millionaires and billionaires were made in the United States during the World War. That many admitted their huge blood gains in their income tax returns. How many other war millionaires falsified their income tax returns no one knows. (emphasis added) The US got involved in the war, quickly ensuring an Allied victory. Rather than a stalemate of exhausted powers, American entry into the war prevented a negotiated peace, drove the Allies toward an unconditional surrender policy toward Germany, German dismemberment, war guilt and reparations requirements laid totally on Germany, etc. The disruption of WWI not only cost lives and property, but enabled the rise of fascism, Nazism, and Communism. Ignoring the other disastrous consequences of WWI, at least the men who fought and died, the civilians who died, their families, the injured, those who had their property and livelihoods destroyed, those who would suffer under the later brutal 20th-century regimes, and those who held their arteries together with their teeth, could rest assured that US entry and an Allied victory at least saved US bankers and funneled war profits to politically-connected US businesses.

Not Even Beautiful Hawaii Is Immune To ‘Tax Flight’ – OpEd	By Keli‘i Akina If you’ve ever been to Hawaii, you might wonder why anyone would leave the state. Its beauty and fair weather are world-renowned, and it’s not for nothing that the place has often been called the 'Paradise of the Pacific.' The reality, however, is that the Aloha State’s population has been decreasing every year since 2016, and most observers believe it’s because of the state’s high cost of living, of which taxes are a significant part. Indeed, the concept of 'tax flight' has been in the news a lot in recent years. Tax flight is when the residents of a state with high taxes leave to go live in a state where the tax burden is lower. The extent to which tax rates directly influence migration patterns is a matter of debate. But the data do demonstrate that people tend to leave higher-tax states in favor of states with lower taxes. For fleeing Hawaii residents, a popular destination is Las Vegas, Nevada, which has no state income tax and now is often called 'Hawaii’s Ninth Island,' due to its high number of former Hawaii residents. Other high-tax states which have experienced consistent population loss include California, New York, and Illinois. Conversely, low-tax states such as Texas, Florida, North Carolina, and Nevada have all seen their populations grow. Moreover, jurisdictions that don’t act to reduce their tax flight will likely soon be looking at more of it. That’s because as residents leave, a state or county’s tax burden falls on ever-smaller numbers of taxpayers, which in turn will mean tax increases for those who stay behind, which further incentivizes people to leave, and so on. It’s easy to see how this can lead to a state, county, or city budget crisis, especially for jurisdictions that have racked up large pension liabilities or other long-term debt. But there is something states can do to stop the bleeding, though it might be painful to those who aren’t used to it: Cut taxes and rein in spending. In Hawaii, lawmakers have finally come to terms with this idea. Going into 2024, Hawaii families making the median income paid the second highest income taxes in the country, after Oregon, a state with no sales tax. But during the state’s 2024 legislative session, the governor and legislature unanimously enacted the largest personal income tax cut in state history. By the time the 2024 cuts take full effect in 2031, the average Hawaii family making the median income will have seen its taxes reduced by more than 70 percent and cumulatively saved more than $19,000, or about $7.6 billion statewide. As Hawaii prepares for its next legislative session, starting this month, the governor has pledged to secure the cuts by reducing spending and balancing the budget. In fact, his proposed budget for fiscal 2026 is actually 1.8 percent lower than the current fiscal year’s budget. Time will tell whether local lawmakers ruin the rosy outlook by getting back on the tax-and-spend bandwagon. And, of course, it would be naive to expect that Hawaii’s historic tax reduction will solve all of its population-loss problems overnight. Significant reforms are still needed to bring down the state’s housing costs; healthcare regulations continue to add to Hawaii’s high medical costs and limit access; occupational licensing severely limits job opportunities; and the federal Jones Act continues to add to the cost of all goods imported by ship from the US mainland. Still, the tax cuts signed into law earlier this year are a promising start, and they demonstrate an understanding of a very simple principle: If you want people to stay in your state, then you need to reverse the economic policies that are inducing them to leave.

New Censor Replacing Old Censor At Meta – OpEd	Some people are optimistic that the promotion of Joel Kaplan to be Meta’s president of global affairs heralds the end of, or at least a big reduction in, censorship at Meta’s social media sites of Facebook and Instagram. This optimism springs from the fact that Kaplan leans Republican in the notoriously Democratic leaning company, and even was White House deputy chief of staff for policy in the Republican George W. Bush administration. Yet, there is plenty of reason for skepticism. Support for free speech has become a rallying cry for many Republicans in response to censorship efforts by Meta, other companies, and governments over the last few years. However, many Republicans and Republican-leaning individuals still are keen on censoring people, though sometimes for different reasons than are many Democratic or Democratic-leaning individuals. Consider efforts by Republicans, with Texas Governor Greg Abbott a good example, to shut down very broadly defined 'antisemitic' communication. Also, Kaplan is not a hire from the outside. He joined Meta 13 years ago as vice president of United States public policy. Since 2014 he has been the company’s vice president of global affairs. In this job, Kaplan has worked with Nick Clegg — the person Kaplan will succeed. Are we to believe Kaplan has spent all this time itching to tear down the censorship implemented, with his help, by this boss? They have had some differences of opinion regarding Meta’s censorship, but let’s wait and see what change comes. Clegg, in a Thursday Facebook post, praised profusely Kaplan ascending to Clegg’s job, stating: And no one could pick up from where I’ve left off with greater skill and integrity than my deputy, Joel Kaplan. I am simply thrilled that Joel will now become Meta’s Chief Global Affairs Officer. Hmmm. That is not suggesting a big change in policy on censorship is on the way. Reporter Glenn Greenwald provided in a Friday Twitter post a fact that challenges the optimism that Kaplan’s promotion signals the end of, or even a large reduction in, censorship by Meta. Greenwald wrote, using 'FB' to refer to Facebook: 'Kaplan was the senior FB official who worked directly with the Israeli Government to ensure that Israel’s demands for censorship were honored.' Backing up his claim, Greenwald linked in his Twitter post a September 12, 2016 The Times of Israel article that detailed Facebook’s, at the behest of the Israel government, then substantial and expanding clamping down on communication. This was years before the company’s name change to Meta. The article identifies Kaplan as a Facebook employee who took part in a high-level meeting to carry out the arrangement with the Israel government: Justice Minister Ayelet Shaked and Public Security Minister Gilad Erdan met Monday morning with senior Facebook officials in an effort to jointly stem online incitement that Israel claims leads to terror activities. The Facebook officials included Joel Kaplan, vice president of Global Public Policy and a former deputy chief of staff for policy at the White House, and Monika Bickert, Facebook’s head of product policy and counterterrorism. And the censorship by Facebook at the Israel government’s request was ongoing before the meeting. Noted in the article: In a speech at a conference in Herzliya, also on Monday, Shaked said that Facebook has already started removing 95 percent of content Israel has requested it to remove, while YouTube has complied with Israel’s requests 80 percent of the time, the Israeli news website Ynet reported. But, that was just the start. The Israel government wanted even more censorship from Facebook. From the article: 'In the meeting Israel requested that Facebook be more proactive in removing materials that could be seen as incitement to terror and the joint teams will study how to work together to serve the interests of both parties, a person familiar with the matter said.' This man is the hope for stopping censorship? Hoping is fine, but it is often important to keep your feet firmly on the ground as well.

Japan: Religious Groups, Activists Urge Govt To Review Laws On Re...	(UCA News) -- Faith leaders, academics, and rights activists have expressed concern over legislation and restrictions in Japan against religious entities following former prime minister Shinzo Abe’s assassination, which they warn could threaten 'all religions.' Some 31 global leaders in the field of freedom of religion or belief (FoRB) issued a joint statement on Dec 31 titled 'A Religious Liberty Crisis in Japan,' Bitter Winter reported. 'Various forces are using this [Abe’s] assassination to begin dismantling key human rights of religious believers in the democratic nation of Japan,' the statement said. 'We believe that the strong emotions generated by the Abe assassination, understandable though they may be, should not lead to legislation, administrative, or legal actions that violate human rights in Japan,' the signatories said. 'A democracy should not arbitrarily harm the right of any religion to operate freely, collect donations, and transmit its faith and moral values to the next generation,' they added. Tetsuya Yamagami shot and killed Abe on July 8, 2022, over his ties to the Unification Church. Yamagami said his family faced economic hardship due to hefty donations made by his mother to the church, which was estimated to be around US$1 million. The signatories alleged that the donations from the Yamagami family were returned in 2009 as part of a mutually agreed settlement, which is 'less mentioned in the media.' They also pointed out that Tetsuya was never a member of the Unification Church and 'had in fact signed a statement accepting the settlement.' Following Abe’s assassination, there was a 'sudden resurgence of old and largely politically motivated campaigns against the Unification Church,' the statement said. 'These efforts, relying on the populist but unscientific term ‘cult’ also targeted other groups, including religions such as the Jehovah’s Witnesses,' they said. The signatories said that the sale of articles at exorbitant prices — called 'Spiritual Sales — was carried out by a company whose members were part of the Unification Church and had ceased by the time of Abe’s assassination. The signatories also said that only the negative claims of second-generation Unification Church members were heard, who alleged that they 'were not provided with good educational opportunities,' by the media and politicians. The media and politicians were 'ignoring the thousands who grew up happily in new religious movements and gladly remained there,' Bitter Winter said citing the statement. The signatories said three legal measures that threaten all religions, 'not the [Unification Church] alone, and not new religious movements alone,' were enacted in Japan. The first measure includes provisions for the dissolution of a religious corporation, which the signatories said was revised to enable the disbanding of religious groups if they 'lost some civil cases.' The previous version of the law was interpreted to permit dissolution only if religious corporations were found guilty of major crimes. 'If this minimalist basis for dissolution is upheld by the courts, then no religion will be safe from dissolution,' the signatories warned. Secondly, the signatories said that new provisions were introduced limiting the possibility for 'controversial' organizations to solicit donations and made it easier for those who had donated to such movements, or their heirs and relatives, to get their money back. Thirdly, the signatories expressed concern about guidelines in the form of questions and answers on the deprivation of second-generation members of 'controversial' religious movements and the so-called 'religious abuse of children.' The signatories alleged that, 'several provisions of the guidelines have nothing to do with the Unification Church and target the Jehovah’s Witnesses and other conservative Christian groups.'	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfRniTl9HKi3VjgQyIZ2Mny	2025-01-04T16:49:37-08:00	
2025, Iran Is Back In US Crosshairs For Regime Change – OpEd	The signs are that Iran is going to face intensified hostility from the U.S. over the next year for regime change. The sudden fall of Syria and the isolation of Hezbollah in Lebanon – Iran’s regional allies – have made Tehran look vulnerable. Anti-Iran hawks in the U.S. are cock-a-hoop about the prospect of regime change in Tehran. The recent death of Jimmy Carter at the age of 100 puts in perspective how great a prize the Islamic Republic represents for Washington’s imperial desires. Carter was disparaged as the American president who lost Iran in 1979 as a crucial client state for U.S. power in the Middle East. For over four decades, American imperialist power has sought to topple the Islamic Republic and return the Persian nation to the U.S. global fold. Though, as U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken lamented last month, American 'regime change experiments' in Iran have been a failure. Now, however, there is renewed enthusiasm in Washington for the Persian prize. The lust for regime change in Tehran has peaked with the dramatic fall of President al-Assad in Syria. American lawmakers and Iranian exiles are publicly calling for the new Trump administration to get back to its maximum pressure campaign on Tehran because they believe there is 'a perfect moment' for regime change. During Donald Trump’s first White House (2017-2021), he revoked the Iranian nuclear deal of the Obama administration and ramped up economic sanctions in what was referred to as a policy of 'maximum pressure.' A growing chorus of Republicans and Democrats are urging the United States to seize the opportunity of a perceived weakened Iran to overthrow the clerical rule of Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. At a recent forum in Washington, it was reported that speaker after speaker brayed for regime change in Tehran. For years, such a desire had been dulled with U.S. failure and the formidableness of the Islamic Republic. 'We have an obligation to stand together with allies in making sure this regime’s suppression will come to an end,' said Democratic Senator Cory Booker. 'Iran is projecting only weakness,' declared Jeanne Shaheen, another Democratic Senator. Republican Senator Ted Cruz sounded vindicated over his long-time anti-Iran stance: 'I have, for a long time, been willing to call quite unequivocally for regime change in Iran… The ayatollah will fall, the mullahs will fall, and we will see free and democratic elections in Iran. Change is coming, and it’s coming very soon.' James Jones, a former White House national security adviser, said: 'The tectonic shift in the Syrian government… should mean to the people of Iran that change is in fact possible in the Middle East.' The Islamic Revolution in 1979 deposed Shah Pahlavi, an ardent American client. The revolution and the hostage crisis at the U.S. embassy in Tehran was a horrible blow to Washington’s global image. The Shah had been brought to power by the U.S.-British coup in 1953 and for 26 years, the dictatorial monarch ruled with an iron fist as a loyal and massive buyer of American weaponry and supplier of oil profits. The overthrow of the Shah put Iran in the crosshairs for regime change. The Americans prompted the Iraq-Iran War between 1980 and 1988. The new Islamic rulers were subjected to crippling economic sanctions, which were eased in 2015 with the signing of the Iran nuclear deal brokered by the Obama administration. By then, the U.S. was trying a softer policy of regime change and limited engagement. Trump abandoned that policy, reverting to a more hostile one. Trump ordered the assassination of Iran’s top military commander Major General Qassem Soleimani on January 3, 2020. Trump can be expected to make Iran his foreign policy goal during the first year of his second administration beginning on January 20. There is a giddy sense that the U.S.-backed Israeli war on Gaza, Lebanon and Yemen has fatally weakened the Islamic Republic. During his election campaign, Trump endorsed Israeli plans to attack Iran’s nuclear sites militarily. Trump will be tempted that Iran could be an early success for his political legacy. To overthrow the Iranian government and replace it with a pro-U.S. regime would be the prize of the century for the American imperial ego. There is also the imperative of geo-strategy. Russia, China and Iran have emerged as an important alternative geopolitical axis that is perceived as a threat to U.S. global power and the American dollar hegemony. Iran appears to be the weakest link among the opposing bloc, known as the BRICS. Trump seems to be prioritizing making a peace settlement in Ukraine with Russia. Part of that calculation is incentivized by freeing up U.S. resources to target Iran. Last year, the imperialist Atlantic Council published an article headlined: 'The United States needs a new Iran policy – and it involves regime change, but not the traditional kind'. The Atlantic Council article advocated intensified economic and political pressure on Iran and internal destabilization by the covert backing of Iranian opposition groups. We can expect a turbo-charged color revolution in Iran, with Western media amplifying public protests against the authorities. Also recommended by the Atlantic Council: 'Propaganda efforts to drive a wedge between Russia and Iran, as well as undermine its support by the rank-and-file within the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) and military, would also help weaken the regime.' The year ahead is shaping up for a mammoth effort by the U.S. to target Iran. Suddenly, the U.S. imperial regime-change machine has found the driving seat again after years of sputtering failure in Iran and Syria. The victory of CIA proxies in Syria to finally overthrow Assad is producing a rush to do the same in Iran. That prize seemed out of reach for too long. A new American president and a new Middle East configuration have brought Iran back into the crosshairs for regime change with an intoxicating vengeance.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfRniTl9HKi3Q9MbLqhkHG4	2025-01-04T16:44:35-08:00	
Poland’s EU Presidency: Thinking In Polish – Analysis	By Shairee Malhotra On 1 January 2025, Poland assumed the presidency of the Council of the European Union (EU). The EU’s rotation system, which changes presidencies every six months, marks the beginning of a new trio of presidencies led by Poland, Denmark, and Cyprus. Poland will preside over the presidency until 31 June, during which it will drive the EU’s political agenda while factoring in its own national interests. After Hungary’s controversial tenure, where top EU officials boycotted meetings in Budapest, the Polish presidency is expected to be markedly different. Hungary was the first country to have an EU presidency while being under EU sanctions over rule of law tensions. Moreover, much to the EU’s chagrin, Hungary’s eurosceptic Prime Minister, Viktor Orbán, undertook unilateral 'peace missions' to Moscow and Kyiv during his EU presidency. On the other hand, the victory of the pro-European Donald Tusk in Poland’s 2023 parliamentary elections, over the nationalist and eurosceptic Law and Justice party (PiS) that ruled Poland for eight years, marked Warsaw’s return to the European mainstream, already bolstered by its leading role in Europe’s response to Russian aggression. Tusk’s experience, based on his tenures as the former head of the EU Council from 2014–2019 and as the Prime Minister during Poland’s first EU presidency in 2011, ensures the EU is in sound hands during Poland’s presidency. Poland takes charge at a critical juncture for Europe—the Russia-Ukraine war is entering its fourth year, and on the other side of the Atlantic, the uncertainties accompanying Trump 2.0 loom large. Meanwhile, the incoming European Commission’s new legislative framework will soon emerge. Polish priorities Tusk emphasised the EU’s need to 'think in Polish', making it capable 'not only of survival but also of a political offensive.' The overarching theme and motto for the Polish presidency is 'Security, Europe!' with security organised into seven dimensions: external security, internal security, energy security, economic security, food security, health security and information security. This encompasses a comprehensive approach to security that goes well beyond the military domain. External security dimensions include continued Ukraine support, as well as scaling up domestic defence production to expand Europe’s defence industry. This includes mobilising greater European defence spending, which reached a record 279 billion euros in 2023—a 10-percent increase from 2022—but it also requires an additional 500 billion euros over the next decade, according to Mario Draghi’s report on competitiveness. A key priority is strengthening the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation’s (NATO) eastern flank through defence infrastructure initiatives like the East Shield, which Poland wants the EU and its member states to co-finance. Initiatives such as the to finance the EU’s military-industrial complex over the 2025-2027 period, fall short of funding requirements, and Poland advocates the use of common euro bondstowards defence. External security also includes tackling challenges at the EU’s external borders and hybrid threats such as the 'instrumentalisation of migration'. As Europe braces for Trump’s planned tariffs on European imports, and as economic ties with its other main trading partner, China, remain strained, economic security, which includes deepening the single market and eliminating barriers to cross-border trade, is highlighted as a key priority. With regard to food security, the Polish programme emphasises 'a competitive and resilient European agriculture'. In this context, a strong Common Agricultural Policy to support farmers and strengthen their position in value chains, and the development of rural areas is highlighted. Poland also intends to address challenges arising from future EU enlargement in this sector. The programme reiterates the need to boost energy security through diversification and a further reduction in dependency on Russian sources. It also necessitates reduced dependence on imported technologies, components, and critical raw materials, while decreasing costs for European citizens and businesses. Poland advocates for a more flexible energy-climate policy, focusing on 'rewards and incentives [rather than] penalties and obligations'. Information security involves enhancing cybersecurity while also battling disinformation and information manipulation. In reference to health security, Poland focuses on addressing mental health challenges, empowering the digital transformation of healthcare, and strengthening European pharmaceutical manufacturing. The programme also emphasises strengthening transatlantic ties, and among EU member states, Poland is well-equipped to do so. Trump’s contempt for NATO and his pledge to end the war in 24 hours on terms likely to favour Russia are concerns for Warsaw. Still, Poland, despite being amongst the staunchest supporters of Ukraine, is on the same page as Trump when it comes to the need for increased European defence spending, leading by example. Poland currently spends 4 percent of its GDP (gross domestic product) on defence—much higher than the 2 percent NATO threshold—and it intends to raise this to 4.7 percent in 2025. Moreover, 35 percent of the Polish defence budget is committed to buying American weapons, thus cementing Warsaw’s status amongst the top five importers of American military equipment, thereby fulfilling Trump’s push towards 'buying American'. In other priorities, Poland will encourage the EU to impose further sanctions on Russia, with the 16thsanctions package expected to be adopted in February 2025. It will also focus on accelerating EU enlargement since the EU decision in December 2023 to open membership talks with Ukraine and Moldova. Can Poland deliver? One caveat is the Polish presidential election, which is scheduled for May 2025, a decisive vote for the country’s future presented as a choice between the hard-right and centre-right. This may pose distractions, especially as several EU initiatives, such as the European Green Deal, the EU-Mercosur trade agreement, and the grain imports agreement with Ukraine, are not favoured by Polish voters. Yet, member states such as France and Spain have conducted national elections during their EU presidencies, proving that domestic political pressures and EU ambitions can be balanced. Russia’s war against Ukraine vindicated Poland’s warnings about Russian aggression and Western European dependencies, heightening Polish credibility. In the words of the Polish Minister for EU Affairs, Adam Szłapka, Poland is now 'an expert for the greatest challenges' confronting the West. For Poland, the presidency is an added opportunity to fortify its role as a major European power centre, given the eastward shift in Europe’s centre of gravity, reinforced by political turmoil in the traditional hubs of Paris and Berlin. Moreover, Tusk’s return to power in Poland also sparked a revival of the Weimar Triangle. On the other hand, Poland’s participation in the Nordic-Baltic 8 (NB8) meeting in November 2024 reflects its increasingly close ties with the Nordic and Baltic nations that share its security concerns regarding Russia. Poland will have to navigate a challenging terrain, but it is well-positioned to take over the EU presidency, bringing to the table strategic foresight, action-driven leadership, and an ability to unite member states.

Musk Projects His Hard-Right Influence In Europe	(EurActiv) -- He demanded new elections in Britain, promoted Germany's far-right, blasted the European Commission -- and that's just the start. Elon Musk is pushing the hard right in Europe, where progressives are grappling with how, or even whether, to contain him. The interventions by the world's wealthiest man -- who also owns one of the planet's largest megaphones, the social media platform X -- have already seen him secure unprecedented influence thanks to his proximity to US President-elect Donald Trump. Now the ever-more powerful Tesla and SpaceX chief is turning his gaze on Europe, where many governments are already grappling with the rise of populism and the far-right. '(Keir) Starmer must go and he must face charges for his complicity in the worst mass crime in the history of Britain,' the multi-billionaire posted recently. He was referring to the British prime minister's time as chief state prosecutor in England and Wales, which coincided with a child grooming scandal -- posting about it repeatedly on Friday. Musk has also called for the release from prison of Tommy Robinson, an extremist agitator, and boosted the fringe anti-immigration Reform UK party, whose leader Nigel Farage he met with recently. On Friday, he shared a message from former prime minister Liz Truss calling for an end to state BBC funding. As in the United States, Musk is increasingly popular with young British men, according to the Savanta polling institute. For them, 'the lines between the perceptions of success and wealth are increasingly blurred with politics,' Chris Hopkins, Savanta's political research director, told AFP on Friday. Downing Street has so far refrained from engaging with Musk's comments, other than the odd light rebuke and stressing that it 'looks forward' to working with Trump's administration. The response Friday by a senior British government minister to Musk's latest attacks over the exploitation scandal highlighted the delicacy of leaders' high-wire act. Health Secretary Wes Streeting told ITV News that Musk's comments were 'misjudged and certainly misinformed.' But, he swiftly added, 'we're willing to work with Elon Musk, who I think has got a big role to play with his social media platform to help us and other countries to tackle this serious issue.' 'As 2025 begins, Musk is no longer a jaundiced commentator on British politics but a power player within it,' political commentator Patrick Maguire wrote in The Times on Friday. The 'government needs to figure out how to deal with Elon Musk and his interventions, because this is not sustainable,' posted Sky News political reporter Ben Bloch on X Friday, as Musk called yet again for new elections. 'Dictator' Britain is not Musk's only target in Europe. He met Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán, a leading figure on the radical right, when the latter visited Trump in Florida last month. The businessman has also been accused of interference by the German government for his strong support of the far-right AfD party ahead of parliamentary elections. On 9 January, he will host a conversation with the party leader, Alice Weidel, on X. The 53-year-old entrepreneur also branded as 'dictator' judges who recently annulled Romania's presidential election amid suspicions of Russian interference. Musk is also an enthusiastic supporter of Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni, the country's most right-wing leader since 1945, who calls him a 'genius.' Politics and business Musk's political initiatives are intimately linked to his economic interests, experts suggest. For Musk and Trump, 'democracy, debate, disagreement, state welfare systems all get in the way of business,' said Ilan Kapoor, a professor at Toronto's York University known for his critical research on neo-liberalism. 'This is why they look favorably towards more authoritarian forms of government, which they think can function more efficiently, by eliminating political opposition and cutting down the role of government (although the contradiction is that they need a lot of state intervention when it comes to their 'law and order' agenda).' Musk also criticized the European Commission, calling the functioning of the European Union undemocratic and demanding a greater role for the European Parliament. He has spoken as the EU, grappling with rampant disinformation on social media, attempts to regulate his X network under a landmark new content law. A former European Commissioner, Věra Jourová, went so far as to describe Musk as a 'promoter of evil' in an interview with Politico last October. In December, researchers from the European Council on Foreign Relations warned that Musk could use X 'to mobilize citizens and far-right parties to raise the political cost for EU decision-makers pursuing the crackdown.'	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfRniTl9HKi3ZwukgYaWLZc	2025-01-04T16:29:06-08:00	
Ukraine Can Expect Further US Aid Offers Before Biden Leaves Offi...	(RFE/RL) -- Ukraine can expect more announcements in coming days about additional U.S. security assistance, a White House spokesman said as President Joe Biden’s term in office winds down. White House National Security Council spokesman John Kirby told a briefing on January 3 that additional announcements on the provision of U.S. aid to Ukraine can be expected in the coming days. He gave no specifics. The announcements would follow a $5.9 billion package of additional military and budget assistance for Ukraine announced by the Biden administration last week amid concerns that the new administration under President-elect Donald Trump will significantly reduce or halt arms supplies to Ukraine in order to push Kyiv to negotiate a peace settlement with Russia. The White House said in a statement on December 30 that the aid includes an additional $1.25 billion drawdown package for the Ukrainian military and a $1.22 billion Ukraine Security Assistance Initiative package. The Treasury Department later on December 30 announced a separate $3.4 billion disbursement to Ukraine in direct budget support. Biden said in the statement that the United States would continue to work relentlessly to strengthen Ukraine's position in the war, but despite his pledge, the $5.9 million package was thought to be the last during his administration, which is set to end on January 20 with the inauguration of Trump. Kirby also announced that Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin would travel to Ramstein, Germany, for a meeting next week of Ukraine Defense Contact Group on January 9. Kirby had previously said that there was a possibility that another meeting of the group could take place before Biden leaves office. Pentagon Deputy Press Secretary Sabrina Singh confirmed later on January 3 that Austin would leave for Germany on January 7 to attend the 25th meeting of the Ukraine Defense Contact Group. The meeting will 'reaffirm our enduring commitment to Ukraine,' Singh said at a briefing. 'Together with defense ministers and military leaders from around the globe, Secretary Austin will focus on delivering practical and coordinated support that reinforces Ukraine’s ability to defend itself today and deter aggression in the future.' She said more details about Austin’s schedule would be announced in the coming days. Asked about plans for future meetings of the contact group, Singh said it would be up to the incoming secretary of defense to decide whether to continue them. She added that Trump’s transition team had so far met with 79 Pentagon officials about the transition to the new administration. There has been no confirmation from the Trump team that his designated Ukraine envoy, retired Lieutenant-General Keith Kellogg, will travel to Kyiv in the coming days. Reuters quoted two sources with knowledge of the trip's planning as saying that Kellogg will visit senior leaders in Kyiv. His team is working to set up meetings with leaders in other European capitals, such as Rome and Paris, they said. He is not planning to visit Moscow during the trip. The meetings are expected to focus on fact-finding on behalf of the new administration rather than on active negotiations, the sources said. The trip is seen as a sign of the urgency that Trump, who said he would end the war in Ukraine swiftly after his inauguration, has placed on quickly winding down the war. Ukraine and other European countries have been skeptical about the claim and are concerned that a deal drafted by Trump could force Ukraine to give up territory to Russia in exchange for peace. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said in a televised interview broadcast on January 2 that Trump's 'unpredictability' could help end the war. Zelenskiy said that he believes Russian President Vladimir Putin is afraid of Trump, who could be 'decisive' in ending the war.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfRniTl9HKi3eGHaCvqFrNh	2025-01-04T16:26:47-08:00	
Status Quo Frame In Burma’s Internal Warring – OpEd	The military regime in power is the status quo. It sees itself as the eternal and indispensable actor/player in Burmese politics to the point that Burma is like its private property which it profits from. However, it was under pressure to open up if it wanted to keep the status quo going, thus that 'controlled democracy interlude' with a constitution which kept power in its hand. Displaying it was ready to change and transit to a democracy, the regime played and plays the NCA process but always on its own terms, in its control. Across the table the participating EAOs thought they should end the wars through negotiations prospecting the post-military era and democratic federalism. They bought into endless protracted rounds of negotiations without seeing a light of the day till today. When the military regime found that this controlled democracy experiment didn’t go their way with the NLD and its famous leader getting the upper hand, it was time to finish off this democratic experiment to preserve the status quo. What followed next was the contestation of the status quo with brutal repression and suppression and the unfolding of the rest of the events till today. In this it is the young that is contesting the status quo with the help of certain older resistance armies while other old soldiers were sitting on the fence or continuing with the NCA process. They are part of the status quo in the same boat as the military regime. The NCA types still saying a political issue must be solved through a political process meaning no more battles, no wars when they were in battles with the military. This poses a problem when the military regime does fall and the fighting resistance wins. A new war? The actions of the UWSA also defends the status quo since they have their own territory and new ones without objections of the SAC and has the support of China. How does its allies feel about it? ASEAN and its Member States are status quo powers, and they are in a world of status quo diplomacy. Hence, they cannot really sanction the military regime and put ASEAN at risk of a split since it is divided, risking losing its centrality, straining its raison d’être. They had to come up with a compromise, the 5-point Consensus, 'in helping the people of Myanmar to achieve an inclusive and durable peaceful resolution to the crisis' with a few Member States grudgingly entertaining contacts with the NUG over time. They stick to the status quo fearing chaos in a post status quo as the statement cited above reveals especially 'peace, security, and stability in the region' in the same statement. Here is the primary concern of ASEAN. In this context of the 5-point Consensus, the only thing ASEAN has hit on is emergency aid and even then it passes through the status quo SAC when IDPs in the areas under resistance control is where needs are largest. Thailand on its own initiative talks of helping SAC to organise elections to bring in some legitimate government under the existing Constitution which keeps power in the hands of the SAC. This is similar to the present Thai political status quo where the military is lurking behind the scene. It is supporting a status quo way out, the future election which also has China’s support. This obviously will be opposed by the resistance and as some analysts say will not solve the problem and no peace and stability will occur. Now we hear that Thailand wants to mediate between the KNLA and the KTLA. Isn’t this interference in the affairs of another country even if for any good reason? ASEAN is ineffective. It can continue with its bla, bla, bla, retreats, conferencing and meetings etc.. ASEAN does not have the confidence that the resistance will win and be capable of forming a new state and bringing stability. The status quo is a sure bet for order and stability rather than chaos. Hence, the resistance must prove, rout out the junta on the ground in winning the civil war, a ceasefire at least between resistance forces and the first steps towards the establishment of a federal or co-federal state: a transitional government at least to hold the country together. This will then give some confidence to ASEAN which will then have to accept the reality of a new sitting power in Myanmar. East Timor is an example and explains why she whole-heartedly supports the Myanmarese/Burmese resistance. She too had to fight to be recognised and accepted by the status quo ASEAN powers and now it is part of the status quo. The rest of the international community is in the entourage of supporting ASEAN. Japan as a status quo power through its envoy or envoys tried to mediate between the regime and certain resistance armies but now it is gone with the wind. She still has her investments while the NUG and other local civil society organisations call for divestment. Australia has for years continued to entertain relations with the SAC with the rational that one of its citizens was in prison but it has always thought that it had influence having military-to-military relations which has ended. The far away EU has been using funds and still does support civil society actors but no call of divestments (garment and textile industries) because it will result in job losses. The US, the one power does not appear to see Burma as a strategic interest even in the face of China or she accepts that Burma is part of the Chinese sphere of influence. She has her Burma Act but we have still to see what it is concretely. A bit of what she gives to Ukraine or Israel will help the resistance to overcome the regime but fears entering into confrontation with China. All these external powers have sanctions, the easiest thing to do but has it got real effects. The UN is the only vigorous institution acting on Burma. Africa and South America has been quiet except for Gambia and Argentina both related to the Rohingyas. They are all very good at making statements. Wonder how many tons of paper have been spent if these statements are printed out. They all see the sitting military regime as crucial to negotiate with the resistance for peace. None will line up behind the resistance except East Timor if I am not provocative. For their own reasons, they are reinforcing the centrality of ASEAN to find peace in Myanmar and S.E. Asia. Myanmar does not appear to be at the top of their foreign policy agenda. There are more pressing concerns. They are all after a status quo solution. My message to the resistance is that the bottom-line is to rely on your own efforts and make yourselves credible meaning unity rather than internal disputes. The NUG must be a credible alternative for the status quo powers to dialogue with not necessarily recognition, but it is, however, challenged by other EAOs who themselves are in contact with external powers. This brings me to China. The scene is free for China to deal in its own way with Myanmar motivated by its huge investments in the country and pursuing its intention of having access to the Indian Ocean. We have seen her arranging ceasefires between the SAC and the Northern Alliance allies. This, of course, puts a lie to China’s non-interference policy. We are mediators they say while saying we are against foreign interference. It seems to have gone further by putting pressure on the EAOs under its wing, the TNLA, the MNDAA to stop fighting. Will China send in its troops to protect its investments? It should not be a surprise if she does. She has opted for her joint private security company behind which are mercenary soldiers. These Chinese moves will increase anti-China sentiment towards her that does not bode well for future relations. The latest is supporting a general election as a status quo solution to the alternative chaos it perceives. How does the EAOs which she supports feels of this? She is siding more towards the SAC than towards the resistance these days. China wants to bring an end to the Myanmar crisis but on its own terms and interests. With the NUG, there is no evident ties while the NUG has issued its pragmatic policy towards China. What really counts is that the NUG and the resistance must show it’s a credible alternative. Winning battles expanding territorial control is not enough. India in courting the military regime because of China (China in the Indian Ocean) is just allowing the regime space to play a game between the 2 giants to its own benefit. But it is no match to China. Am I provocative here for India? She anchors herself with Myanmar by her investments, the Kaladan to speak of one, which is no comparison with China’s. It is stated that she wants Myanmar’s cooperation regarding the Indian insurgencies on its border with Myanmar while its border states are sympathetic to their brethren across the border, the Chins for example. In no way is India in a position to contribute positively to bring about a peaceful solution inside Myanmar and without any openings with the resistance and the NUG. It has put all its cards with the status quo regime. She is making it difficult for the Rohingyas to take refuge. She has no solidarity with them. She is just thinking of its own selfish national interest like all other states countering China primarily. Lately with China’s move of her joint private security company, India has started engaging with the AA along with CNF, KIA and the NUG as reported. An example here of a status quo power having to recognise the reality on the ground to engage with a resistance army to its fellow status quo SAC. Bangladesh evokes sympathy and thanks for housing the Rohingyas but are the Rohingyas a cash-cow for Bangladesh through all the monetary transfers she receives and where is all this money going to. Its call for repatriation is going nowhere while its government and even the press, writers, analysts, the thinkers talk of security. We don’t see any seriousness to stamp out trafficking, the Rohingya armed groups that terrorise the Rohingya population the latest being recruitment to fight the resistance in their homeland allying with the SAC. Will the new interim government led by a Nobel Prize Laureate take hold of the Rohingya issue and deal with it in a positive sympathetic way? With the complete control of the border towns along the Bangladesh-Burmese border by the AA, time for Bangladesh to entertain talks with the AA, a non-state actor, the language of the status quo. Concretely, it is with the AA that it has to speak to of repatriation but the AA will not accept if the Rohyinga armed groups are not annihilated especially when they are aligning with the SAC. Finally, are the journalists, the commentators, the analysts, the opinion makers who write about what is happening in Burma/Myanmar. Without putting all in the same bag, they are writing in a mindset with the starting point of the status quo. To start with is the language of the status quo: terrorists, insurgents, rebels…… and what else instead of speaking of the resistance, the freedom fighters, the revolutionaries as the resistance call themselves……. Then, with the status quo in mind, how the SAC is facing up to the resistance, to the opposition? What are their manoeuvrings? Speculating on what is happening within the ranks in SAC. How long they are going to last? Speculating on the SAC as a necessary, indispensable actor in power-sharing as a way out to avoid chaos, instability even when populations of Burma want the SAC out of politics, of government. We need to see much more analysis, opinions from the point of view of the resistance. Factual reportage of their victories and losses, stories of the people in the resistance, the situation of the IDPs, there are but not much speculation on how they are going to or could overcome the SAC? How are they going to change the status quo? Is the resistance just going to fight to the last man to remove the military? The tipping point when the balance of power will change. Has it changed? At what point is the resistance ready to negotiate? Perhaps the resistance, the NUG are not even thinking through when they are ready to negotiate to end military rule. And after the end of military rule? Hence, more on the internal dynamics of the resistance, their unity. More on how the NUG works, more on the progress of the NUCC. Perhaps this is top secret not to inform the SAC. How could analysts supporting the resistance share their views with the resistance on how to proceed to topple the status quo, what to do with negotiations. The final word is that analysts, observers, commentators, journalists ….. have to take a stand and not sit on the fence in a so-called neutral position.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfRniTl9HKi3TFYJ05qC5UZ	2025-01-04T16:21:47-08:00	
Rohingyas’ Return To Myanmar Uncertain, Despite Rebel Control Of ...	The dream of returning home to Myanmar remains uncertain for hundreds of thousands of Rohingya who fled to Bangladesh despite rebel control of the border, members of the ethnic group said Friday. About 740,000 Rohingya fled from western Myanmar’s Rakhine state following a bloody crackdown against members of their stateless Muslim minority group in August 2017. They joined other Rohingya who had settled in camps in and around Cox’s Bazar, bringing the total number of refugees in southeastern Bangladesh at the time to just over 1 million. Years of negotiations to repatriate Rohingyas to Rakhine state have yielded little progress, in part because members of the community say their safety cannot be guaranteed back home after the military that targeted them seized power in a February 2021 coup d’etat. On Dec. 8, rebels known as the Arakan Army, or AA, which is battling the junta for self-determination in Rakhine state, captured Maungdaw township and took control of the region’s border with Bangladesh. The takeover rekindled hope that the Rohingya might be offered safe transport across the border and feel comfortable enough with AA governance to resettle their communities in Rakhine. On Wednesday, the AA — which now controls about 80% of Rakhine state — announced that it would begin allowing people displaced by fighting to return home, after having fully secured the border. However, RFA Burmese spoke with Rohingya refugees in Bangladesh who said they remain uncertain about their return — in part because it’s unclear whether the AA might accommodate such a move and because ongoing fighting in Rakhine would leave them susceptible to military airstrikes. 'It is a time of war, so it is impossible for us to return home,' said Mohammed, a Rohingya refugee from Kutupalong refugee camp in Bangladesh. 'Even if the AA takes over the entirety Rakhine state, our repatriation program remains far off because they are not a legitimate government.' Refugees who earlier fled violence and persecution in Myanmar said they had been kidnapped and forced to fight in the country’s ongoing civil war for the Arakan Army as well as the junta.both the junta and the AA Nearly 65,000 Rohingya have crossed into southeastern Bangladesh since late last year amid unrest and violence in Rakhine, according to Bangladeshi officials. Even if the refugees are allowed to return home, they remain fearful of junta airstrikes, said Europe-based Rohingya activist Nay San Lwin. 'The repatriation program is directly related to the AA because they currently control the area [where the Rohingya communities are],' he said. 'Even if the AA gives firm guarantees, the Rohingya people might suffer great losses if the junta carry out airstrikes when they return home. Their repatriation is largely concerned with their security.' Demands for repatriation Rohingya refugees have also demanded recognition of their identity as an ethnic minority of Myanmar, acknowledgment of their Myanmar citizenship and the opportunity to return home 'with dignity.' On Dec. 25, more than 100,000 Rohingyas in the Cox’s Bazar refugee camps protested and called for assistance from the international community, including the United Nations, in meeting their demands ahead of a return to Myanmar. 'When people in the camps return home, they hope to go back to their original homes,' said Mohammed of the Kutupalong refugee camp. 'Moreover, we have also asked both Myanmar and international representatives to ensure our rights to freedom of movement, access to education, and all other basic rights. We will not change these demands.' The AA’s seizure of the border has, in some ways, complicated the issue even further. On Dec. 22, during a meeting on the situation in Myanmar, held in Thailand last month, Bangladesh Foreign Ministry spokesperson Mohammad Rafi Alam told reporters that the Bangladesh government had urged Myanmar’s junta to 'find a way' to settle the border dispute as it would 'not engage' with the AA. A week later, however, Bangladeshi security experts, former diplomats and scholars advised the Bangladesh government to engage with the AA directly and diplomatically. The status of the relationship remains uncertain. A former district law officer who asked not to be named due to security concerns told RFA that the repatriation of the Rohingyas will depend on the ruling administration in Rakhine state. 'Since there is currently no legal framework for the repatriation of the Rohingya, a bilateral agreement is essential for implementing this program,' he said. On Dec. 23, nearly 30 Rohingya organizations worldwide called on the AA to guarantee the rights and security of all communities in Rakhine state, including the Rohingya; establish an interim consultative committee; recognize the Rohingya as an ethnic minority of Myanmar; and adopt and enforce a public code of conduct for AA fighters. Attempts by RFA to contact AA spokesperson Khaing Thukha for comment on the Rohingyas' return went unanswered by the time of publishing. Dire food shortage Meanwhile, more than 5,000 displaced Rohingya sheltering at a camp in Rakhine’s Pauktaw township are in urgent need of food after not receiving aid for more than a year, they told RFA on Friday. A Rohingya at the camp in Pauktaw’s Ah Nauk Ye village said that the displaced are living on a diet of rice gruel, due to the food shortage. '[Dry] rice is urgently needed at the camp as some displaced persons are suffering from starvation,' said the camp resident, speaking on condition of anonymity due to fear of reprisal. 'We have no jobs and are forced to borrow money from others. The rising prices of essential goods are making our situation even more difficult.' Camp residents said that a pregnant woman, an elderly person, and a child died in December due to a lack of access to healthcare and medicine, as well as malnutrition. According to the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, Myanmar’s junta has restricted the delivery of food, medicine, and other relief items under its humanitarian assistance program to Rakhine state. Moreover, local and international aid agencies have been blocked, and the United Nations Development Program warned in November that about two million people in Rakhine state could experience food shortage in March and April due to insufficient food supplies. Attempts by RFA to reach Hla Thein, the attorney general and junta spokesperson for Rakhine state, for comment on the food shortages went unanswered Friday.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfRniTl9HKi3QcUS7HS2lRa	2025-01-04T16:17:48-08:00	
US Capital In ‘Heightened Threat Environment’ After New Year’s Da...	By Jeff Seldin Law enforcement and security agencies in and around Washington are bringing in reinforcements as they prepare to secure three high-profile events in the nation's capital, following the New Year's Day terror attack in New Orleans and the Cybertruck bombing in front of the Trump International Hotel in Las Vegas. The first event will occur Monday, when Congress meets to certify results of the presidential election four years to the day since the Jan. 6, 2021, Capitol riot. The second will be the state funeral for the late President Jimmy Carter, starting with a ceremony and procession on Tuesday before wrapping up on Thursday. The last high-profile event will come Jan. 20, when President-elect Donald Trump is inaugurated. 'That has never happened before. We have three [National Special Security Events] over a 15-day period,' Matt McCool, U.S. Secret Service Washington Field Office special agent in charge, told reporters Friday. 'But what I will tell you is we're flexible. We're adaptable. We've been working on these events for, in some cases, years,' he said. 'So, we're going to be prepared.' Despite concerns stemming from the New Orleans attack and the Las Vegas bombing, security officials are confident so far that the Washington events will proceed safely. 'We are not tracking any credible or specific threats associated with these events,' said David Sundberg, assistant director in charge at the FBI's Washington Field Office. The law enforcement and security agencies, however, are not taking any chances, acknowledging that the city and the region are operating in a heightened threat environment. The Secret Service said Friday that it was bringing in agents from across the country to boost staffing levels, which were already the highest they have been in three years. Washington's Metropolitan Police Department said it has added to its ranks almost 4,000 officers from departments across the country. The capital's National Guard Bureau confirmed it also has approved requests for additional support, including the provision of 500 guardsmen for the Jan. 6 election certification and liaison officers for the state funeral. An additional request for 7,800 National Guard soldiers and airmen to assist with security for the Trump inauguration is pending. Increased security measures, including barriers and fencing, are already up in parts of Washington and around the Capitol, but more are coming. 'A multitude of seen and unseen security measures will operate in tandem to ensure a comprehensive and seamless security plan comes to fruition,' McCool said, adding that the measures will include the use of aerial drones. 'The Secret Service will use drones as part of our comprehensive security plan,' McCool said. 'Do not be alarmed if you see these assets during the upcoming events or training in the days ahead.' The Metropolitan Police Department said its increased security measures would go into effect starting Sunday, with the deployment of specialized officers around the city to respond to any emergencies. The U.S. Capitol Police, whose 2,400 officers and civilian employees are responsible for protecting the Capitol and members of Congress, also said they were more prepared to handle contingencies than they were four years ago, when rioters upset with the outcome of the 2020 presidential election stormed the Capitol, forcing lawmakers to flee and injuring police officers. About 1,560 people have been charged with federal crimes in the riot. So far, about 979 have pleaded guilty, while another 210 have been convicted. 'Our nation's capital is prepared to ensure that the legislative process will proceed without disruption, and our government will have a peaceful transfer of power,' said Capitol Police Chief J. Thomas Manger, noting that the force has implemented more than 100 recommendations made following the 2021 riot. Officials in Washington are also bracing for potential protests, saying several planned demonstrations have already gotten required permits. 'We are committed to upholding the right to peacefully assemble and protest here in our city,' said Metropolitan Police Chief Pamela Smith. 'We welcome visitors to come and experience what this incredible city has to offer, but those who are intentional on unlawful activity should know that there will be consequences,' Smith said. 'However, as I've stated before, when we have special events, and I want to be very clear, that we will not tolerate any violence, rioting, destruction of property, or any behavior that threatens the safety and security of our city.'	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfRniTl9HKi3ZibOcf0B442	2025-01-04T16:15:59-08:00	
2024 In Review: Was It The Year Of Democracy? – OpEd	The world bid farewell to 2024 which forged a phase marked by its democratic struggles, political reforms, and major shifts in power. From the streets of Dhaka to the battlefields of Myanmar, from election rallies of Washington to war-torn Syria and Ukraine, and to the polls of India and Russia, 2024 left behind a legacy that may reshape the global politics with tremendous effects and transformational reforms across the globe. As the last hospital of Gaza has been shut down, and Palestinians are on the verge of eternal extinction, hope remains the only beacon since the world has abandoned them. Meanwhile, a country with liberal values has unprecedentedly rocked by a coup, with South Korea witnessed political upheaval as its President faced an arrest warrant. In 2024, almost half of the world’s population was in political temperature to go the polls across more than 80 countries since it was heralded as 'the year of democracy'. But even in what we call 'successful democracies'– freedom of speech, plurality of media and equality of participation were in immense threats. There were widespread political upheaval, rise of commodity prices as well as corruption and civic unrest in countries across continents that fueled violence and various other tragedies. Across countries, people demanded freedom, accountability, fair elections and overall change of heavily corrupted systems. Among the stories that defined the year 2024, Bangladesh emerged as a symbol of democratic hope as it earned its place in The Economist’s 'Country of the Year' in which the country has been praised for overthrowing an autocrat as well as restoring order in the first place. Here is a review of incidents that occurred in key countries that indicate how those nations are going to navigate their democratic futures: Bangladesh: The Revolution That Captivated the World The year began in Bangladesh with prolonged dissatisfaction under the autocratic rule of Sheikh Hasina, with manipulated election held on 7 January; the Awami League won an easy victory with every opposition being silenced, jailed and even killed. But the July Revolution changed everything, by captivating the world’s attention citizens from all walks of life including students, opposition parties, civil societies and mass people came to the streets, bringing an end to the ruling party’s 15-year old oppressive regime. Later on, when the reformist government took seat led by Chief Adviser Dr. Muhammad Yunus, economic reform and restoring rule of law have become priorities to change the long-sustained corrupt system of Bangladesh. The Economist’s 'Country of the Year' credit is yet to be maintained in rebuilding democracy through collective action. Point to be noted as democratic uprising in Bangladesh has been decided in the streets, not at the polls. Syria: Another Unprecedented Change After 12 years of longstanding civil war as well as almost 50 years of autocratic rule by two generations of tyrants, Syria became free. With emerging horrendous stories of the hidden cells of Sednaya Prison, Syria seems to be recovered from reign of fear. With Hay’at Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), the alliance of rebel groups announced reforms in the country bringing Syrian interests for the first time. It is a matter of fact that the western alliance did not want HTS to come to power. However, in growing escalation of Iran and Israel, HTS was implicitly permitted to overthrow Al Assad regime, cutting off Iran’s arms and logistical supply chain with Hezbollah. Turkey has played major role negotiating with the West to bring HTS in power of Syria, defeating both Russian and Iranian interests there. United States: Trump’s Return The U.S. presidential election, amidst a deeply polarized political landscape, saw Donald Trump reelected. Despite controversies, the reelection of Mr. Donald Trump raises concern not only in USA but to various upcoming international negotiations. Trump is notorious who has already stacked courts, and with his populist demands, attempted an insurrection to maintain power. In world stage, he altered major relations with countries like Russia, India and those in the Middle East. Yet still democratic divide remains as Trump 2.0 is taking power in USA, institutions in the USA are one of those to bring its vibrant democracy forward. Gaza: A Year of Unrelenting Crisis In 2024, Gaza endured the most suffering in its history, with the whole city becoming rubbles and dreams becoming shattered. In a full blown war toward the common people by Israeli forces, the casualties turned some of Palestinian families erased from existence, turning the nation to extinction. The modern era has seen no such thing like a nation is being extinct while the world does nothing. In U.S. universities, student protests for saving lives in Gaza were also suppressed, revealing a lack of value placed on freedom of speech. This has also prompted a reevaluation of what freedom of speech should truly mean in a democratic society. South Korea: A Shocking Coup In an unbelievable move, South Korea which often considered as an example of liberal democracy faced an exceptional coup in October when factions within the military under President Yoon Suk-yeol seized power. The coup shocked the world, most notably, citizens within South Korea rallied for returned to democracy. An arrest warrant was issued after Yoon, which is remarkably unseen against a sitting president in South Korea’s history. Question remains will this incident impact democratic navigation in South Korea in recent times? Myanmar: Ethnic Armed Organizations Strike Back Myanmar's Ethnic Armed Organizations (EAOs) has launched a coordinated offensive and gained significant momentum against the military Junta regime. The Chin National Army (CNA) in Chin state and Arakan Amry (AA) in Rakhaine state as well as many other factions in the country are now challenging the iron-fist Junta regime in Naypyidaw. However, concerns remain as the rebels are backed by Chinese interests, will they tend to democratic reforms or anything else that favors China in the end? Sri Lanka Anura Kumara Dissanayake has been elected as Sri Lanka’s new President and the Marxist-leaning politician is playing a key role in deciding the future of reforms of the debt-ridden nation in the Indian Ocean. Slowly but steadily the country is emerging from a crushing financial crisis that ousted Rajapaksa rule in 2022. A nation of 22 million, Sri Lanka now hopes for its democracy may show financial recovery from the crushing economic crisis. Ukraine: Defiance in the Face of Aggression Ukraine’s struggle against Russian aggression continued in 2024. Despite significant territorial losses, Ukraine displayed significant resilience. Democratic future of Ukraine depends on continuous support from the West and the capabilities of Ukrainian resistance from mass people to the soldiers in the battlefield. Meanwhile, international community’s support, particularly from NATO and the EU, remained fundamental for Ukraine’s existence as a sovereign state in front of Russian aggression. Pakistan In Pakistan, the most popular party leader, Imran Khan, had been imprisoned by Pakistan’s interim military rulers, hindering democratic governance in the country. Pakistan’s 2024 election, held on February 8 after two years of political turmoil has seen significant political melodrama and Imran Khan’s party was banned from entering into election, causing people to come to the streets. Yet the democratic aspirations were neglected and future remains bleak in Pakistan. India: Modi’s Toughest Contest Yet Indian elections were held from 19 April to 1 June in 7 phases, with Narendra Modi’s Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) facing strong opposition from a united coalition of rival parties. As in the world's largest democracy, BJP remained a formidable force, but growing dissatisfaction over economic policies, unemployment and incessant minority attacks remain severe. India often showed elections as weather of festivals, yet its institutions, free press, and minority rights are to be scrutinized, especially when continued campaigns against the Muslim minority are on significant rise. Russia: Putin’s Predictable Victory In stark contrast to democratic upheavals elsewhere, Russian election had a predictable outcome: strongman Vladimir Putin’s victory. Although many in the world rejected this as allegations of vote manipulation persisted, Putin’s hold of power remains unshaken. The future of democracy in Russia looks bleak, with little room for any opposition and generations are accustomed to Vladimir Putin’s manipulated news outlet while his continued influence in countries like Moldova, Georgia and Romania remains fearful democracy in those countries. The Future of Democracy in 2025 and Beyond As the world moves into 2025, the incidents of 2024 will have tremendous impacts into upcoming events. For democracy to thrive in the world, strengthening institutions and promoting inclusivity will be crucial besides taking mass aspirations into consideration. Analyzing incidents from world politics, the implications for global democratic health continue to subjects of debates. In the developed world, voter dissatisfaction remains over issues like ineffective governance and inflation, while in many parts of the globe, democracy is craved through violence in the streets. As the Time magazine pronounced 2024 as a 'make-or-break year' for democracy, it can be said only elections no more guarantee democracy, rather forging effective institutions is a key to surpass the setbacks.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfRniTl9HKi3TJIJpcVaipe	2025-01-04T16:13:45-08:00	
China’s ‘Monster’ Ship Arrives At Scarborough Shoal	The world’s largest coast guard vessel, a Chinese ship known as 'The Monster,' has arrived at the disputed Scarborough Shoal inside the Philippine exclusive economic zone to boost Beijing’s control over the maritime area, an American analyst said. Meanwhile, the Chinese navy has been conducting a New Year carrier-based helicopter training exercise in the airspace over the South China Sea, according to state broadcaster CCTV. The 12,000-ton CCG 5901 arrived at Scarborough Shoal on Wednesday, said Ray Powell, director of the SeaLight project at Stanford University, who tracks the ship’s movements. There are at least three other Chinese coast guard ships – CCG 3106, 3302 and 3305 – as well as seven militia ships, already present at the shoal, Powell told Radio Free Asia. The aim of their mission is to boost Beijing’s control over the maritime area just 125 nautical miles (232 kilometers) from the main Philippine island of Luzon, he said. Scarborough Shoal is known in the Philippines as Bajo de Masinloc and has served as a traditional fishing ground for Filipino fishermen but their access has been restricted by Chinese vessels in recent times, which hold de-facto control of the area. It is well within the area under the jurisdiction of the Philippines, where it has exclusive rights to resources in the waters and on the seabed. 'The Monster' is not only large in size, it is also armed with heavy machine guns and has a helicopter platform. It is unclear whether the ship carries any helicopter unit on this mission but last week, the Chinese coast guard conducted a carrier-based helicopter training exercise, also at Scarborough Shoal, using another coast guard vessel. Control of airspace Chinese authorities 'are now paying more attention to the deployment of airpower' in relation to the South China Sea disputes, Yang Xiao, a maritime expert at the China Institutes of Contemporary International Relations, said on an influential blog with nearly three million followers on Sina Weibo. The U.S. and Philippine militaries have been deploying reconnaissance aircraft and drones to the Scarborough Shoal, a strategically located chain of reefs south of Bashi channel between Taiwan and the Philippines, Yang said, adding that China now has to gain air control, especially after it announced baselines to form territorial sea and airspace around the shoal in November. The carrier-based aircraft training is to send a warning to the Philippines and its ally the U.S. that they should think twice before 'entering China’s airspace,' the Chinese expert said. The Chinese coast guard’s training exercise on Dec. 27 was similar to current drills by a helicopter unit of the Southern Theater Command navy’s carrier-based aviation force, conducted at an unspecified location in the South China Sea. According to CCTV, on Wednesday and Thursday, various types of carrier-based helicopters carried out multi-subject practical training including search and rescue, alert control, and sea landing, 'further improving the unit’s coordinated combat capabilities.' The aircraft also carried out reconnaissance patrol and alert control training exercises at high altitude in a 'target sea area,' CCTV said without identifying the location. In recent weeks, China’s military has been ramping up combat readiness exercises at Scarborough Shoal. On Sunday, its Southern Theater Command staged large-scale patrols around the shoal, with both navy and the air force taking part. Submarine drone Meanwhile, the Philippine armed forces on Thursday said it was conducting an investigation into the origin and purpose of a submarine drone with suspect origins in waters off the central Philippines. Philippine police said the drone, which was fished out of waters off Masbate island in the central Philippines on Monday, could be Chinese. A report by the police about the incident said the drone was found by fishermen on the morning of Dec. 30 while fishing in the area. The fishermen, accompanied by village officials, then turned over the item to police. The yellow drone had the markings 'HY-119,' which police said refers to a Chinese underwater navigation and communication system. The Chinese embassy in Manila did not return messages requesting for comment. 'The Navy is currently conducting further investigation to determine its origin and purpose,' Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP) public affairs chief Col. Xerxes Trinidad said in a statement. 'The AFP is fully committed to ensuring the safety and security of our maritime domain, with all necessary resources mobilized to address similar and other situations with the utmost diligence,' he added.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfRniTl9HKi3QnOdx4v8B2V	2025-01-04T16:11:29-08:00	
UNIFIL Accuses Israeli Army Of Deliberately Destroying Property I...	The United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) on Saturday accused the Israeli army of deliberately destroying its property and critical infrastructure in southern Lebanon, marking a serious escalation in tensions along the border. In a statement issued on Saturday, UNIFIL said: 'This morning, peacekeepers witnessed an Israeli army bulldozer destroying a blue barrel marking the withdrawal line between Lebanon and Israel in Al-Labbouneh, as well as a watchtower belonging to the Lebanese Armed Forces adjacent to a UNIFIL site in the area.' The blue barrels, which serve as markers for the withdrawal line — commonly referred to as the Blue Line — are crucial in delineating the boundary established following Israel’s withdrawal from southern Lebanon in 2000. UNIFIL condemned the actions, describing them as a 'deliberate and direct destruction' of its property and infrastructure clearly identifiable as belonging to the Lebanese Armed Forces (LAF). The statement further characterized the incident as 'a blatant violation of (UN Security Council) Resolution 1701 and international law.' Resolution 1701, adopted in 2006 to end hostilities between Israel and Hezbollah during the Second Lebanon War, calls for respect for Lebanon’s territorial integrity and the cessation of all aggressive actions in the area. UNIFIL also urged all parties to exercise restraint and avoid any actions that could jeopardize the fragile cessation of hostilities. 'We urge all parties to refrain from any actions, including the destruction of property and civilian infrastructure, that could jeopardize the cessation of hostilities,' the statement added. The incident comes amid heightened tensions along the Lebanon-Israel border, with several exchanges of fire reported in recent weeks. There has been no immediate comment from the Israeli military regarding the accusations.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfRniTl9HKi3bQZXxa8ebAa	2025-01-04T16:06:13-08:00	
The Destruction Of Early Republican Architecture In Ankara – OpEd	Unbelievable things are happening in Ankara. Many valuable buildings from the early Republican period, which witnessed the founding years of the Turkish Republic, are sadly being demolished one by one. In their place, either empty parking lots or new structures with no architectural or historical connection to the past are being constructed. The Etibank building was one of the first to go. This structure, reflecting the modern architectural style of the Republican era, was torn down, leaving behind an empty parking lot. At the Opera Square parking area, the Melike Hatun Mosque, inspired by Ottoman-era designs, was built. Meanwhile, the magnificent İller Bank building next to it shared the same fate and was demolished. Today, only a temporary shack occupies its former location. But it didn't stop there. The Ministry of Public Works and Settlement building was also torn down, leaving yet another parking lot in its wake. There are now plans to build a mosque on that site. Similarly, the beautiful DSİ (State Hydraulic Works) building was demolished, replaced once again by an empty parking lot. One of the most distressing losses is the destruction of the Ministry of Public Works building, designed by the renowned Austrian architect Clemens Holzmeister. This structure was not merely a building but a monument embodying the modernization ideals of the Republic. Now, this historical masterpiece is being erased. The Yargıtay (Supreme Court) building is also on the brink of demolition. The Saraçoğlu Neighbourhood appears to have been spared for now. However, even one of the symbolic structures of the Republic, the Çankaya Presidential Mansion, has been left neglected and abandoned to decay. The architectural treasures of the early Republican period are disappearing one by one, replaced by empty parking lots or soulless, nondescript structures. This is not just a loss of architecture; it is also the destruction of a historical and cultural identity. These buildings represent more than bricks and mortar; they are living testaments to a bygone era, reflecting the spirit of a time when the Republic's ideals of modernization and development were at their peak. Preserving this heritage is vital not only for Ankara but also for Turkey's cultural memory and identity. Yet, it seems these structures are not seen as valuable monuments but as disposable entities, torn down without a clear plan for their replacement. This is a grave injustice to our history and culture.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfRniTl9HKi3Rn6CWnESyXZ	2025-01-04T16:02:29-08:00	
Key Strategic Forces Takeaways From The 2024 China Military Power...	By Rebeccah L. Heinrichs China’s Nuclear Buildup The Department of Defense has released its annual report to Congress on Chinese military developments. The report confirms that China is accelerating its strategic nuclear breakout. China now has over 600 fully operational nuclear warheads in its arsenal, up from the estimate of 500 in last year’s report. This supports the DoD’s assessment that China is on track to have 1,000 fully operational nuclear warheads by 2030. Official assessments expect China to complete its buildup and modernization efforts by 2035. However, Xi Jinping’s aim to replace the United States as the preeminent geopolitical power—and his attendant ambitions to undermine US security alliances—raises doubts that China will be satisfied with peer nuclear status rather than nuclear superiority. The New START Treaty between the US and Russia is the last remaining nuclear arms control agreement. Yet Moscow is not complying with its verification requirements. The treaty limits each nation to 1,550 total deployed nuclear weapons between intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs), submarine-launched ballistic missiles (SLBMs), and heavy bombers equipped for nuclear armaments (with each bomber counted as one warhead). The treaty is expected to expire in February 2027. The DoD report includes several key findings regarding China’s nuclear buildup: China possesses approximately 400 ICBMs, up from last year’s estimate of 350, all of which can reach the continental United States. The People’s Liberation Army’s expanding nuclear force will enable it to target more US cities, military facilities, and leadership sites than ever before in a potential nuclear conflict. Since 2017, China has constructed 30 new silos for DF-5-class liquid-propellant ICBMs, more than doubling its previous total before the recent buildup. The Chinese Navy has fielded the extended-range JL-3-class SLBM, capable of reaching the continental United States, on its JIN-class ballistic missile submarine, enabling China to strike the continental United States with SLBMs from the Bohai Gulf or the South China Sea. With Russian assistance, China has completed construction of the first of two planned CFR-600 nuclear reactors, and construction on the second is ongoing. Each reactor can annually produce enough weapons-grade plutonium for 'dozens of nuclear warheads.' China is developing an 'early warning counterstrike' posture aimed at rapidly responding to warnings of a nuclear attack with retaliatory strikes. China seeks to diversify its force with more low-yield precision strike missiles to control escalation. Since the Cold War the United States has sought to rely less on nuclear weapons in its defense strategy. But Russia and China have not followed suit. Both have invested heavily in nuclear weapons as part of their strategies to coerce the US and its allies. Making matters worse, Russia is helping China accelerate its nuclear development. How the US Should Respond The United States needs to prioritize strategic deterrence above all else. It should adapt its forces to credibly deter simultaneous and opportunistic aggression. 1. Prioritize efforts to bolster strategic deterrence. The modernization of the nuclear deterrent, supported and expedited by both the Trump and Biden administrations, is essential. In 2023, the Congressional Commission on the Strategic Posture of the United States, of which I was a member, found that the currently planned US nuclear force modernization is necessary but not sufficient. This latest report on China’s nuclear buildup reinforces the commission’s findings and the salience of its recommendations. 2. Urgently adapt US theater nuclear options to offer the president a range of credible nuclear response options to convince China and Russia that their nuclear threats will not achieve their aims and they should not venture to use even a low-yield nuclear option. These theater options should account for advances in Russian and Chinese integrated air and missile defense (IAMD). To do this, the US will also need its allies to build up their conventional forces while contributing to US efforts to improve nuclear deterrence. 3. Adapt and expand missile defense to protect the US homeland as well as critical assets abroad. IAMD contributes to deterrence by complicating adversaries’ calculations and causing them to doubt their attacks will succeed. As China’s nuclear program matures and the United States seeks to protect the American people and US vital interests, Washington should also bolster homeland defense against Chinese and Russian missile threats.

Cold War: Moldova’s Breakaway Transnistria Freezes Amid Russian G...	This week's cut-off of Russian gas supplies could create a humanitarian crisis in the breakaway Transnistria region, sparking public discontent and that might threaten Moldova's path towards the EU, experts warn. By Madalin Necsutu After more than three decades of de facto control over Moldova’s separatist Transnistria, the small region on the left bank of the Dniester River was left in the cold when Moscow halted gas supplies from January 1. Before then, Russia’s energy giant Gazprom delivered gas to Moldova, including the separatist region of Transnistria, through Ukraine. But Ukraine has said it will no longer allow the transit of Russian gas through its territory once its contract with Gazprom, which was valid until the start of 2025, expired. Although Russia has the technical possibility to continue to send gas to Moldova through the trans-Balkan gas pipeline, via Turkey, Bulgaria and Romania, Gazprom has refused to do so. Gazprom claims it has ended supplies because of Moldova’s huge debts, although Chisinau disputes this. Analysts in Chisinau believe that Russia is using the expiry of the gas transit contract with Ukraine to put pressure on Moldova, cause public discontent and disrupt its route towards eventual European Union membership, away from Moscow’s influence. 'Gazprom … has a contractual obligation to deliver gas to the border with Moldova and it could use the alternative route through Turkey,' Sergiu Tofilat, an energy expert at WatchDog Community, a Chisinau-based think tank, told BIRN. From 2006 until 2024, Russian gas deliveries to Moldova, including the Transnistrian region, were based on two agreements. Under a contract signed with Gazprom in 2006, Moldovagaz supplied gas to Tiraspoltransgaz, the Transnistrian energy company, from 2007 to 2011. Both parties renewed the agreement annually until 2019 and they extended it from October 2021 until 2026. A second contract, between Moldovagaz and Tiraspoltransgaz, signed in 2011, stipulated the conditions for delivering Russian gas to Transnistria. The most recent contract signed between Gazprom and Moldovagaz, signed in October 2021, covering the next five years to 2026, obliged the Russian company to supply Moldova with 3.3 billion cubic meters a year. Of this, 1.24 billion cubic meters would go to Moldova proper and 2.06 billion to Transnistria. But, in December 2022, Gazprom only supplied Moldova with the gas intended for Transnistria – 2.06 billion, equal to 5.7 million cubic meters per day. This came after Moldova decided to stop buying gas from Russia, a political decision designed to coordinate with international efforts to stop funding the Russian war machine maintained by money from the sale of gas and oil. While Moldova gave up its contractual share of the Russian gas, the remaining 2.06 billion cubic meters of gas was required to meet Transnistria’s internal needs and allow it to produce electricity, vital for its economy. Moscow has long viewed Transnistria as a strategic outpost and base for possible military action in the Balkan region. It illegally keeps about 1,600 soldiers in the region, divided into alleged peacekeeping troops and soldiers of the Operative Group of the Russian Army, OGRT. This is subordinate to the Western Military District of the Russian Army based in St Petersburg, whose mission is to guard about 20,000 tons of ammunition left over from the Soviet period in the village of Cobasna. Arguments over size of Moldova’s debts On December 28, Gazprom informed Moldovagaz, its Moldovan subsidiary, that it would stop all gas supplies to Moldova on January 1, citing Moldova’s alleged refusal to pay its debts. It noted Moldova’s habit of 'regularly not fulfilling its payment obligations under the contract, which is a serious violation of its terms' as the reason for stopping deliveries. 'In this context, based on the provisions of the contract … Gazprom is introducing, starting at 08:00, on January 1, 2025, a limitation of natural gas supplies to Moldova,' a Gazprom press release said. Gazprom referred to an alleged but unspecified debt of 709 million US dollars owed by Moldovagaz, which Gazprom said should be paid by the Moldovan authorities. However, an independent international audit done in September 2023 set Moldovagaz’s debt to Gazprom at only eight million US dollars, which Chisinau was willing to pay immediately, but Moscow refused. At the same time, the Transnistrian region already owes Gazprom a colossal 10.5 billion US dollars for gas consumed and never paid for over three decades. Gazprom has tolerated this debt, which is transferred annually to the Russian company’s economic balance sheet. Gas crisis hits secessionist regime The separatist leader in Tiraspol, Vadim Krasnoselsky, announced on Wednesday that the region’s gas reserves currently stood at 13 million cubic metres. Most of the region’s 350,000 or so inhabitants, about 220,000, hold Russian passports and are citizens of Russia. In 1992, after a war in which Transnistrian forces were aided by the former Soviet Union’s 14th Army, the tiny region became de facto-independent from Chisinau – but in practice in Russia’s orbit. Krasnoselsky insisted that the energy crisis was under control and that he would not allow the region to collapse. But most economic institutions in Transnistria are already paralysed. According to media reports, the end of gas supplies has led to the closure of most industries, except for food factories. Thousands of people have become unemployed overnight. The MoldGres thermal power plant in the town of Cuciurgan has switched to coal-fired operation and, together with the Dubasari station, can cover electricity needs for at most 50 days. 'The crisis is so serious that there is no need to list which enterprises have stopped. All industrial enterprises are standing still except those that ensure Transnistria’s food security,' the separatist deputy prime minister of Transnistria, Serghei Obolonik, told the Novostipmr news agency. 'There are no energy resources for the industrial sector,' he added. ‘Squeezing Moldova’ ahead of elections The authorities in Chisinau believe Russia wants to create a humanitarian crisis and trigger a domino effect in Moldova ahead of crucial parliamentary elections due this summer. The idea is that high prices for energy will foment dissatisfaction among Moldovans who might otherwise vote for pro-European forces. High energy prices will lead to further price rises of all goods and services and cut living standards. 'The 2025 parliamentary elections are seen as a last major opportunity for Moscow to reaffirm its influence in the Republic of Moldova and to slow down or even stop the pro-European orientation of the Moldovan state,' political analyst Anatol Taranu wrote in an editorial for IPN news agency. The elections will determine whether Moldova stays on its European course, against a background of polarisation in society and scenarios in which pro-European forces might find themselves unable to form a governing coalition. In tandem with stopping gas deliveries to Moldova, on December 23, Russia’s Foreign Intelligence Service, SVR, accused Moldova’s pro-Western President, Maia Sandu, of preparing a military operation in Transnistria. According to the SVR, the alleged plan is for Moldovan military to take over the Cuciurgan power plant in Transnistria, which is supplied by Gazprom. The SVR claimed that, after Sandu recently the Moldovan government’s energy security chiefs, the meeting ended with Sandu saying it was time to plan a military operation to establish control over Transnistria and 'eliminate the Russian peacekeeping presence in the region', the SVR said. 'No one can guarantee that the Moldovan president will not really try to start a real war in the region,' the SVR alleged, as quoted by the Russian TASS news agency. Meanwhile the secessionist authorities in Transnistria are trying to shift attention from Moscow and seek culprits in Chisinau. Tiraspol and the Transnistrian media insist that Gazprom stopped supplies to Transnistria because Moldovagaz failed to pay its debts. They also claim Chisinau did nothing to persuade Kyiv to extend the gas deal. In response, Moldovagaz announced on Thursday that, together with the energy company Energocom, it is 'willing to provide assistance, including technical and commercial support to Tiraspoltransgaz, in organising the purchase of natural gas on any European gas platform'. Kremlin accused of ‘energy blackmail’ President Sandu has condemned the actions of the Russian authorities, accusing them of blackmail. 'The Kremlin is again using energy blackmail in an attempt to destabilize the situation, to influence the 2025 parliamentary elections and to undermine our European path,' she said on December 30. Moldova is also being hit by the crisis. It was buying about 80 per cent of its electricity from the Moldgres thermal power plant in Transnistria at a below-market price. Now it has to secure energy from other sources. Neighbour Romania has jumped to Moldova’s aid and is already supplying about 50 per cent of Moldova’s electricity needs. Romania’s energy minister, Sebastian Burduja, said Russia has used energy as a weapon of blackmail for decades, always threatening to 'turn off the tap'. He added that those who dream of 'cheap Russian gas' should remember that freedom has a price. 'Without energy independence, there can be neither the freedom nor the security of a country … we have a moral duty to be with our brothers across the Prut [river in Moldova],' he said. Moldova has secured another 30 per cent of the electricity it needs through the heating company Termoelectrica. Another 15 per cent comes from renewable energy and about 5 per cent from the CET Nord plant and the Costești hydro plant in the north. On December 30, meanwhile, Prime Minister Dorin Recean called for a new look at laws on the nationalization of enterprises, to 'get rid of any tools of blackmail'. He was referencing the fact that Russia’s Gazprom owns about two-thirds of the shares in Moldovagaz, while Moldova’s Ministry of Economy owns about 35 per cent. However, some experts see this energy crisis also as an opportunity for Moldova. They see it as a chance for Moldova to reintegrate the Transnistrian region, which represents about 11 per cent of the country’s land surface, and to 'close the Transnistrian file'. 'Every crisis also brings opportunities. In this case, stopping the delivery of ‘free’ gas to the left [bank] of the Dniester would pave the way for the reintegration of the two banks,' energy expert Sergiu Tofilat said. 'However, this project can become feasible only with the support of external partners, to maintain stability in the region, especially on the border with Ukraine,' he concluded.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWc2wOIVsfs_3EHVzdL_0VhC	2025-01-03T16:29:38-08:00	
Chinese Companies Expanding Abroad Must Strike A Balance Between ...	By Chen Li Chinese companies are riding a new wave of 'going global,'driven by a strong enthusiasm to expand into overseas markets, targeting regions like Africa, South America, and North America. However, hidden beneath this wave is a profound contradiction between growth and costs. ANBOUND's founder Mr. Kung Chan raised athought-provoking point during the 2025 Trend Seminar, that Chinese companies going global must make a choice between 'growth' and 'cost'. High-growth markets like Africa may offer rapid growth, but they come with enormous risks. In contrast, developed country markets arevast with stable returns, but the costs are higher, making them more suitable for companies aiming to 'grow bigger and stronger'. Mr. Chan warned that it is improbable to have both ways and attempting to take advantage ofboth sides is not feasible. Growth and cost are inherently difficult to balance,and before going global, companies must carefully consider their positioning and what trade-offs they are willing to make. The crisis triggered by BYD's factory project in Brazil is a typical example of failing to properly balance growth with costs. As the largest economy in South America, Brazil offers immense potential in the new energy vehicle market, making it a key target in BYD's global strategic layout. However, such high-growth markets also come with significant risks. According to a statement from the Brazilian Labor Prosecutor's Office, BYD's contractor,the Jinjiang Group, severely violated labor laws: workers faced excessively long hours, poor living conditions, and even had their passports confiscated. These actions were deemed 'slave-like conditions', sparking a strong social backlash in Brazil. While BYD quickly responded by terminating its contract with the Jinjiang Group, its response in China was to avoid addressing the core issue, attempting to shift the focus by claiming it was a smear campaign by 'hostile forces'. However, this response did not quell the controversy but further damaged the brand's image. BYD's management failure has not only harmed the company's own interestsbut also impacted China's national image. The most fundamental principle ofcorporate management is to respect and take care of employees. During China's most difficult times, the country still provided workers with clothing allowances and diplomatic etiquette training to maintain national dignity. However, today, some Chinese companies expanding abroad are attempting to cut costs, resorting to questionable practices, neglecting basic management principles, and putting workers' legal rights at risk. This is not only a failure in corporate management but also a blow to the country's reputation on the global stage. Similar issues also occurred at Fuyao Glass's U.S. factory. Fuyao triedto implement its highly efficient Chinese-style management model in the U.S. but overlooked the importance American workers place on labor rights and unionculture, leading to escalating management-employee conflicts. The documentary American Factory showcased Fuyao's lack of cultural adaptation, which sparked public criticism of 'Chinese-style capitalism'. Fuyao's experience highlights that entering developed markets comes with higher costs, and that only by respecting the cultural differences of the target market and adheringto local laws can a company achieve long-term growth. Ignoring these issues notonly fails to save costs but can also lead to greater hidden costs as conflicts escalate. Mr. Chan's perspective reveals the core challenges faced by companies expanding abroad. High-growth markets such as Africa and South America, while offering tremendous growth potential, come with high risk and cost. Meanwhile, developed markets like the U.S. and Europe, though more stable in terms of regulations, have high entry costs. Blindly pursuing growth or overly focusingon cost-cutting can lead to significant costs for companies expanding overseas. More importantly, when Chinese companies expand abroad, they not only represent themselves but also carry the image of the nation. Companies going abroad must not only pursue profits but also fulfill their responsibilities to employees, society, and the country. This means Chinese companies expanding abroad must abandon a 'shortcut-taking' mentality, as fulfilling basic responsibilities ismore important than anything else. If a company cannot even guarantee basic labor rights and management standards, how can it talk about brand building and long-term development? Some companies, in an effort to cut costs, have taken the misguided path of exchanging short-term gains for long-term costs, which not only plunges the company into crisis but also forces the country to be a rreputational damage. As Mr. Chan stated, companies expanding abroad must clarify their growth objectives while adhering to bottom-line management and making sound risk predictions. The balance between growth and cost is a constant challenge for Chinese companies expanding internationally. As they pursue growth, these companiesmust also confront the realities of costs and ensure they maintain strong management practices and cultural adaptation. In high-growth markets, understanding and managing risk is crucial, while in developed markets, a careful approach to cost is essential. Expanding abroad is a key step in the globalization of Chinese companies, but it is not without its difficulties. Byplan ning ahead, taking responsibility, and strategically balancing growth withcost management, companies can achieve sustainable success on the global stage. Final analysis conclusion: The international expansion of Chinese companies is a delicate balance between growth and cost. High-growth markets offer tremendous potential but come with significant risks, while developed markets have stable rules but higher entry costs. The cases of BYD and Fuyao Glass demonstrate that blindly pursuing growth or overly focusing on cost-cutting can lead to costly consequences, affecting both business interests and China's national reputation. Companies expanding abroad must set clear objectives and uphold their bottom lines, i.e., ensuring employee rights, complying with regulations,and adapting to cultural differences, while also managing risks. Only through responsible business practices can companies strike a balance between growth and cost, achieving true globalization.

Drone Production In South And North Korea – Analysis	By Dr. Ranjit Kumar Dhawan The Korean Peninsula is one of the highly militarised regions in the world. In the milieu of the ongoing Russia–Ukraine war since 2022, which has seen extensive use of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), the export of defence equipment from both South and North Korea has significantly increased.1 South Korea has also been focusing on technological innovation in developing new defence systems. In this regard, drone technology has gained attention in South Korea as a new instrument in modern warfare. In North Korea also, drone technology is being used to develop more sophisticated systems for surveillance, as well as for combat operations. Defence Production in South and North Korea The experience of the devastating Korean War (1950–1953) had a deep impact on the development of defence industries in both South and North Korea. The Korean War ended only with an armistice which has still kept the two Koreas technically at war with each other. Due to the continued conflict on the Korean Peninsula, defence industries received top-most priority by the administrations in Seoul and Pyongyang. Apart from the threats of the outbreak of another major conflict on the Korean Peninsula which led to an arms race between South and North Korea, the urge to become ‘self-reliant’ in defence production had also been equally strong in both Seoul and Pyongyang.2 In South Korea, the defence production was largely promoted by the Park Chung-hee administration (1961–1979). In the wake of threats of withdrawal of the American troops from South Korea in the 1970s, the need to become self-reliant in defence became the goal of Seoul. In this regard, South Korea reverse engineered weapons mainly received from the United States. Also, the Park Chung-hee government collaborated with family-controlled big capitalist enterprises, known in Korean as chaebol, and provided them support to make the country self-reliant in defence production.3 In contrast to South Korea, the North Korean defence industries followed socialist principles of state ownership and were promoted to defend the country from the imperialist forces.4 Moreover, the urge to attain independence in international affairs under the larger ideology of Juche in North Korea gave national defence a key priority in the country.5 Although in the initial years after its establishment, North Korea was heavily dependent on the then Soviet Union for arms procurement, in the later period, the Kim dynasty regime in Pyongyang started manufacturing a number of weapons within the country. North Korean regime even focused on the development of nuclear weapons as part of its Juche ideology and to gain legitimacy from the domestic population.6 The North Korean regime exported some of its ballistic missile technologies in exchange for its nuclear weapons programme. In this regard, North Korea’s nuclear proliferation activities with Pakistan are now well-documented.7 Drones and the two Koreas The advancement made by South Korea in drone technology was displayed during the country’s Armed Forces Day parade on 1 October 2024, along with other military assets.8 A day later, South Korean government signed a deal on 2 October 2024 to buy about 200 units of Warmate suicide drones from WB Electronics firm of Poland.9 Also, for the first time in November 2024, South Korea and the United States conducted a joint military exercise for the use of drones in combat operations.10 This joint drone exercise tested the compatibility and synergy between the South Korean surveillance drone RQ-4B Global Hawk and the MQ-9 Reaper attack drone from the United States. It was also reported in December 2024 that South Korea is mulling to obtain about 100 cardboard drones to counter rising threats from North Korea.11 Later in December 2024, South Korea was stated to start the manufacture of medium-altitude unmanned aerial vehicles (MUAVs) which are capable of producing high-resolution pictures. These would be used for surveillance against the North Korean targets.12 South Korea also planned to conduct military exercises in December 2024 against the infiltration of drones from North Korea in future.13 In the milieu of the ongoing Russia–Ukraine war, North Korea has exported several tonnes of weapons to Russia, and has dispatched thousands of soldiers to fight against Ukraine in support of Moscow.14 The participation of North Korean soldiers in this war has been facilitated due to the ‘Comprehensive Strategic Partnership’ between Moscow and Pyongyang which was signed in June 2024, and later ratified in December 2024. This new treaty has the provision for mutual defence if either of the two countries comes under foreign invasion.15 It is also argued that North Korea’s participation in the ongoing conflict between Moscow and Kyiv would provide North Korean soldiers new experiences with regard to the modern warfare and use of drone technology.16 Recently, the North Korean leader Kim Jong-un has called for significantly increasing the production of ‘suicide attack drones’ and has urged for more research on this technology.17 The increased production of the suicide drones by North Korea could also be meant for export to Russia to be used against the Ukrainian forces.18 However, the advancement in drone technology by the two Koreas could also be used against each other. In the past, drones were apparently sent by both North and South Korea across the Demilitarised Zone (DMZ), which divides the two Koreas, for spying or for spreading propaganda leaflets. In December 2022, South Korea accused North Korea for sending several drones towards Seoul and adjoining areas.19 This incident of North Korean drones entering into the South Korean airspace led to a serious security challenge for South Korea. Later, in October 2024, the Kim dynasty regime claimed that South Korea sent drones to scatter anti-Pyongyang propaganda leaflets over the sky of North Korea and warned of 'horrible disaster' if it happens again in future.20 The North Korean state media even released the pictures of a drone allegedly sent by Seoul.21 On the other hand, South Korean defence ministry flatly denied any role in sending drones laden with propaganda leaflets to North Korea.22 Conclusion The advent of the drone technology in modern warfare has created new opportunities and challenges. The demand for such low-cost, expendable, but precise and lethal power of drones has increased across the world. While it has helped export-oriented nations in their defence production, it has also added lethality by causing massive destruction at a much cheaper cost. The ongoing war between Russia and Ukraine has proved the efficiency of the drones. In this regard, while the interest in the production and export of drones from both South and North Korea would help them economically, it may also increase tensions on the Korean Peninsula.

Bangladesh: Can Sheikh Hasina, Awami League Make A Political Come...	By Sharifuzzaman Pintu The once formidable Awami League has faded from the limelight in Bangladesh, leading some political analysts to question the party’s future amid uncertainty about whether it will be allowed to participate in elections again. The AL, which led Bangladesh to independence in a vicious war against Pakistan in 1971, held power for 15 consecutive years under Sheikh Hasina until a student-led revolt toppled her in early August. Now, there’s a growing debate about whether the party and former Prime Minister Hasina, who led Awami for 45 years, can make a comeback in Bangladeshi politics in the wake of her downfall. Abdul Latif Masum, a political analyst and former professor of government and politics at Jahangirnagar University, said the party had previously faced a crisis caused by Hasina’s six-year exile following the assassination of her father, Bangladesh founding President Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, and other family members in 1975. It also survived the anti-dictatorship movement of the 1990s. 'Actually, this crisis is different from all the previous incidents, where Hasina has put herself, the party and countless leaders and workers in existential crisis by fleeing. So in my opinion, the future of Awami League is zero and Sheikh Hasina’s future is double zero,' he said. Others pointed to a lack of remorse from Hasina and Awami leaders over alleged abuses that were committed during her rule, which grew more autocratic toward the end. 'Despite the corruption, misgovernance and human rights abuses, neither Sheikh Hasina nor others in the party has shown regret or apologized,' Mujahidul Islam Selim, former president of the Communist Party of Bangladesh, told BenarNews. When asked if he or other Awami League members would apologize, A.F.M. Bahauddin Nasim, the party’s joint general-secretary, leveled counter-accusations of genocide and power-grabbing against interim government leader Muhammad Yunus and other leaders in the interim government. Yunus took over the reins of government on Aug. 8, three days after Hasina fled to India, where she remains in exile. Since then, Bangladesh’s International Crimes Tribunal issued arrest warrants in October against Hasina and AL associates for alleged crimes against humanity. More recently, the government filed a formal request for Hasina’s extradition from India in late December. Bahauddin Nasim remains defiant despite facing possible arrest. 'Many were killed and publicly hanged during the movement. People have seen those atrocities. The big question is whether the public would forgive them instead,' he told BenarNews from an undisclosed location. 'The Awami League is a people’s party. We remain humble before them and act appropriately at the right time.' While Hasina does not have a presence on social media, the Awami League posted a New Year’s message attributed to her on its X page. In it, she expressed hope for peace and prosperity in 2025 while lamenting that 'the likelihood of achieving these hopes has significantly diminished.' In addition, the statement said, the 'unconstitutional overthrow of the legitimate government in July 2024, through local and international conspiracies disguised as student protests, has resulted in an illegal, undemocratic group seizing state power. 'A once globally praised Bangladesh, known for its stable law and order, communal harmony, and robust socio-economic development, now finds itself grappling with chaos. The rule of law has collapsed, with crimes such as murder, robbery, and looting becoming everyday occurrences.' Student leaders concerned Student leaders who spearheaded protests that led to Hasina’s fall have expressed strong reservations about her party rejoining politics or participating in elections. 'The Awami League conducted three consecutive illegal elections. How can they be allowed another chance without first declaring those elections invalid,' Samantha Sharmin told BenarNews. She serves as spokeswoman for the Jatiya Nagorik Committee (JNC), which is comprised of protest leaders and which formed on Sept. 8. Hasnat Abdullah, convener of the pro-democracy student movement, has repeatedly emphasized that the Awami League must face trial before any discussion of election participation. Despite those calls, A.M.M. Nasir Uddin, the chief election commissioner, said unless the government or the courts banned AL, there would be no legal obstacle to the party participating in elections. Analyst Latif Masum said Awami members were delusional in their hope for a miraculous return led by Hasina. 'The anger and resentment surrounding the party are so intense that if they attempt a return, resistance will be overwhelming,' he told BenarNews. ‘People miss Sheikh Hasina’ Still, Hasina has support with AL. 'Since Aug. 5, ongoing injustices and anarchy have boosted the Awami League’s popularity,' said party leader Bahauddin Nasim, who added, 'People miss Sheikh Hasina.' In addition, some leaders of the rival Bangladesh Nationalist Party(BNP) have called for AL to participate in upcoming elections – Yunus recently called for a national vote to occur at the end of 2025 or by March 2026. The BNP, the main opposition party during Hasina’s rule, has been pressing the Yunus-led government to pave the way for a general election. 'We expect the election to be participatory. If anyone is to be excluded, it will be the people’s decision. However, anyone who commits a crime will face justice, and the government is responsible for that,' BNP Standing Committee member Hafiz Uddin Ahmed told BenarNews. Sharmin, the JNC spokeswoman, argued that just as the AL could not gain legitimacy in elections or parliament without the BNP, the same held true for the BNP – it could not gain acceptance without the Awami League. 'With political unity, the Awami League could be banned directly. However, some political parties are opposing this, creating a dangerous situation. Those opposing the ban have strayed from the spirit of the mass uprising,' she said. Syed Anwar Hossain, historian and political analyst, said an AL return to power should not be discounted. 'The interim government continues past mistakes, worsening the human rights situation, leaving people afraid to speak up. With sky-high prices for essentials, ordinary people are suffering, making the change of a ruler irrelevant to them. These kinds of failures of the current or successive regime will create a path for the Awami League to return,' he told BenarNews. 'While Sheikh Hasina’s human rights violations must be addressed, the Awami League should still be allowed to participate in politics,' Hossain said. He pointed out that fallen rulers around the world, including in Bangladesh, have returned with great influence. 'Whether Sheikh Hasina succeeds or not remains uncertain, but the Awami League will endure – a truth many are reluctant to acknowledge,' he said.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWc2wOIVsfs_3ARqdkcbZxKv	2025-01-03T16:21:22-08:00	
The Limits Of Transactionalism – OpEd	We make men without chests and expect from them virtue and enterprise. We laugh at honor and are shocked to find traitors in our midst.' -- C.S. Lewis 'Men Without Chests' I recently returned from Spain where I participated in a seminar on The Defeat of the West, the most recent book by the well-known French historian Emmanuel Todd. Whether one agrees with all, part, or none of his thesis—I find myself in the second category—it is a compelling and suggestive read, one that in typical Todd style relies on the innovative mixing of demographic, anthropological, religious, and sociological theories to make its case. One would think that here in what we are constantly told is the beating heart of the West, a book such as this, written by someone who is widely acknowledged to be one of the more prestigious historians and public intellectuals in Europe and who, moreover, sports a very enviable record of prognostication (he was one of the first important public figures to predict the collapse of the Soviet Union), would be the subject of lively speculation on these shores. But as of yesterday this book, unlike so many of his others, was still unavailable in English, nearly a year after its publication. And outside of a brief article at Jacobin and another by the thankfully iconoclastic Christopher Caldwell at the New York Times, it has garnered no sustained attention within the chattering classes of the US left or right, a fate that would only seem to confirm one of the many excellent points he makes in the book: that one of the more salient features of societies that have started on a sharp descent into cultural decline is their enormous capacity to deny palpable realities. For Todd, decline is inexorably linked with cultural nihilism, by which he means a state of being defined by the generalized absence of consensually recognized moral and ethical structures within the society. Like Weber before him, he sees the rise of Protestantism, with its theretofore largely unknown emphasis on personal responsibility and probity in both personal and public matters, as key to the rise of the West. And he thus sees the final expiration of this same ethos among us, and especially among our elite classes, as heralding the end of our time of unchallenged world prominence. One can accept or not that it was the particular attributes of the Protestant mindset that, more than anything else, launched the West on its now 500-year reign of world hegemony. But I think it is harder to dispute his larger and what I think will be his more enduring point: that no society can impel itself toward the commission of great, creative, and hopefully humane things without a broadly agreed upon set of positive moral imperatives emanating from a purportedly transcendent font of power and energy. Put in a slightly different way, without a set of social norms modeled by our elite classes that encourage us to feel wonder and awe before the condition of being alive, and the sense of reverence that inevitably follows in their wake, human beings will inevitably redound to their most base impulses, something that in turn sets off endless rounds of infighting within the culture, and from there, its eventual collapse. After saying that, I could, if I wanted to play to the cheap seats, go on a long diatribe about how, over the last 12 or so years, the Democrats, with their many accomplices in the media, academia, and the Deep State have set out quite consciously to destroy this preternatural human impulse toward reverence and all that flows from it, doing so especially, and most criminally, in social spaces inhabited by the young. And no element of that would-be diatribe would be false or misleading. But in doing so, I’d be engaging in the type of lying and self-deception that these misnamed liberals, with whom I used to mostly identify, are so good at. The fact is that these so-called progressives were and still are working on well-fertilized terrain, land carefully tilled by Republicans in the wake of September 11thwith the plow of fear, the hoe of social ostracism and, above all, the stinking manure of conversation-ending false binaries in our civic discussions. You know, exchanges like this. Person 1: 'I’m troubled by the idea of destroying Iraq, thereby killing and displacing millions, when Saddam had nothing to do with Bin-Laden or September 11th'. Person 2: 'Oh, so you’re one of those America-hating types that loves terrorists and wants to let them kill us all.' Or things like the brutal cancelling of people like Susan Sontag and Phil Donahue, just to name two, who dared question the wisdom of purposely destroying a country that had had nothing to do with the attack on the Twin Towers. The conceptual thinking of human beings is largely delimited by the repertoire of verbal devices at their disposal. With more words and tropes come more concepts. With more concepts comes more imagination. Conversely, the fewer available words and concepts a person has, the less rich his repertoire of concepts and imaginative capabilities. Those who control our media on behalf of the super-elites are well aware of this reality. They knew, for example, that it was perfectly possible to be against what was done on September 11th and not be in any way in favor of the ideas and methods of bin Laden or the goal of punishing Iraq for his sins. But they also knew that allowing space for this concept in our verbal economy would greatly complicate their preconceived plan to remake the Middle East at the point of a gun. So, they used all the coercive powers at their disposal to disappear this mental possibility from our public life, purposefully impoverishing our public discourse to achieve their private ends. And, for the most part, it worked, paving the way for the use of the exact same techniques, only more widely and more viciously, during the Covid operation. Americans are a famously transactional people. And we have just elected a famously transactional President. I have nothing against transactional approaches to problem-solving per se. In fact, in the realm of foreign policy, I believe they can often be quite useful. And I believe that if Trump can do away with so many of the ideological aprioris that currently fog American elite thinking on its dealings with the world—including their need to see ourselves as inherently different and better than all other collectives on the earth—he will be doing us and all the world a great favor. There is, however, one great drawback with transactionalism as it relates to the issue of establishing or re-establishing what I earlier described as 'a broadly agreed upon set of moral imperatives emanating from a purportedly transcendent font of power and energy.' And it’s a big one. Transactionalism is by definition the art of manipulating what recognizably is, and is thus often indifferent when not openly hostile to the process of what we might need or want to be from a moral and ethical point of view down the road. Am I saying that Trump has no positive vision for the future of the US? No. What I am suggesting, however, is that his vision for the future appears to be rather delimited, and riven, moreover, with contradictions that may sink it in the longer run. From what I can tell, his outlook revolves around two major positive concepts (amidst a sea of others designed, for better or worse to undo the work of his predecessors (e.g. close up the border). They are a return to material prosperity and a renewed respect for the military, the police, and all other uniformed civil servants. A third, more vaguely and more confusingly expressed positive concept is that of transforming the US from an instigator of wars into a purveyor of peace. Returning material prosperity is of course a noble goal that if accomplished would alleviate a lot of citizen anxiety and misery. But it does not, in and of itself, address the problem of cultural nihilism that Todd sees as lying at the core of the West’s and hence the US’s social decline. In fact, a good case could be made that by renewing our obsession with the pursuit of material gains at the expense of more transcendently conceived goals, we could, in fact, be unwittingly hastening our descent down that hill of decline. And using the military as the prime placeholder for that which holds us together presents another set of problems. One of the key goals of those who planned the cultural and media response to 9-11 was to take a once broad field of social exemplarity where there were heroes of all social classes and types and reduce it to a space defined by narrowly conceived fixation on the military and those who wore uniforms. This, of course, played into the authoritarian and bellicose plans of the neocon warmongers who planned that propaganda effort. But looking back, we can see that this not only placed an undue and unrealistic moral burden on our servicemen—they are, after all, principally in the business of killing and maiming— but led to a dangerous narrowing of the discourse, central to the creation and maintenance of every healthy culture in history, of what it means to be a good person and to live the 'good life.' And as for peace, it is difficult to make a convincing case for it when it is clear that the US leadership class, including the faction about to enter the White House, has shown itself to be wholly indifferent to the gruesome slaughter of tens of thousands of maimed and slain children in Gaza, Lebanon, and Syria. Nope, largely limiting our repertoire of exemplarity to those who kill and those who get rich, with side helpings of praise for famous athletes and young women who exhibit surgically enhanced 'beauty,' really won’t do the trick. What exactly will, I don’t know. What I do know is that problems, such as the dramatic winnowing and hollowing out of our public discourses of social exemplarity can never be repaired if we don’t talk about them. When was the last time you talked in depth with a young person about what it means to live a good and fulfilling life as it is conceived of outside the parameters of economic gain or the game of acquiring reputation chits through the acquisition of titles and credentials? My guess is that for most of us it has been longer than we care to admit. And my sense is that a lot of that reticence comes from the fact many of us have been worn down by the overwhelming pressure in our culture to be 'pragmatic' and to not 'waste time' thinking about big questions like 'Why am I here?' and/or 'What does it mean beyond to live an internally harmonious and spiritually satisfying life? You know, those 'spiritual' things that in recent years have been portrayed by our elite culture planners as, take your pick, a marker of being a loopy New Ager or a culturally intolerant Right-Winger. But when we look at things in the broader expanse of history, it becomes clear that the real joke is likely to be on those who, desirous of achieving status in the pragmatically defined world, amputated their relationship to the world of holistic and reverent thinking. Or to put it in terms used by Ian McGilchrist, the joke is likely on those who passively subjugate the 'master' who inhabits the big-thinking right hemisphere of the brain to the restless, narrowly focused 'grabbing and getting' spirit of his 'emissary' who inhabits in the left side of his cranium. As contemporary thinkers as seemingly different as Stephen Covey and Joseph Campbell have argued, lasting satisfaction really only comes when we work, as it were, from the 'inside out,' bringing what we have found to be more or less true in our own internal dialogues and pilgrimages 'out' into our friendships and loveships, and from there, into the conversations we maintain with others in the public square. If, as Todd suggests, we have lost the spiritual ethos that allowed the West to gain favor and power in the preceding centuries, we better get down to work on creating a new social credo, understanding as we do so that while those focused on the spirit often easily conceive of the matter that surrounds them, those obsessed with matter generally have a harder time of doing the opposite.

Frail Egos And Sandpit Colonialism: Australia, The United States ...	Former Australian Prime Minister John Howard is in the news again. The release of Australian cabinet documents from 2004 – a supposed treat for historians of Australian history each new year – has been given a typically modest, calm and boringly anodyne treatment in media outlets. One topic featured should have caused continued sharp intakes of breath and stirs of indignation: Australia’s participation in the invasion of Iraq in March 2003. Led by the United States with clinging support from the United Kingdom and Australia, ostensibly to disarm Saddam Hussein’s regime of biological, chemical and dare it be said, possible nuclear weapons, was a crude example of buccaneering, criminal adventurism. It was illegal, lacking the approval of the United Nations Security Council. It was almost certainly a crime against the peace, a higher offence developed by drafters and judicial authorities during the Nuremberg war crimes trials of 1945-6. The words of US chief prosecutor at Nuremberg, Robert H. Jackson, delivered in his opening statement to the International Military Tribunal in November 1945, are all too pertinent. While Nazi Germany is the target of his address, the US-led coalition can do just as well as substitutes: 'That attack on the peace of the world is a crime against international society which brings into international cognizance crimes in its aid and preparation which otherwise might be only internal concerns. It was aggressive war, which the nations of the world had renounced.' This vast hinterland of venality, incompetence, and indifference to international law – the very sort of things countries such as the United States and Australia hyperventilate over when concerning adversaries – should have received more comment. The issue of Iraq in the 2004 cabinet release receives some mention in David Lee’s rather skimpy overview, perhaps unsurprising given that he occupies the position of National Archives of Australia Cabinet Historian. In a comment to Guardian Australia, however, Lee makes a suggestion that should make the blood of service personnel and Australia’s citizenry boil. 'The balance of evidence we’ve seen from the cabinet records from 2003 and 2004 indicate that weapons of mass destruction is not the casus belli – the cause of war – for Australia, but rather Australia’s desire to strengthen the US alliance.' Put another way, the commitment was, as have most Australian commitments to war been over its short history, a matter of impressing others. The released documents do reveal that the Howard government, through its National Security Committee (NSC) of key ministers, had approved the deployment of forces three months prior to the official authorisation of Australia’s involvement on March 18, 2003, and began planning for it from August 2002 onwards. This meant that Australia, along with the US and UK, had long given up on getting a UN Security Council resolution authorising an invasion, let alone waiting for the findings from ongoing UN weapons inspectors. This hideous sense of a chugging, unstoppable train to war is evident in the admission on the part of Australian Foreign Affairs Minister, Alexander Downer, that the WMD issue was scratchy at best. A January 10, 2003 oral briefing on the efforts of the UN weapons inspectors drew a rueful observation: 'there was no confidence that the inspection process would uncover clear evidence of continuing Iraqi weapons of mass destruction programmes'. On February 10, 2004, the NSC met to discuss the release of a public version of a review by the Department of Defence of Iraq operations. The advanced deployment, above all else, had to be kept secret from the public, described in the minute as 'the specific issue of public handling of when ADF action in Iraq commenced'. This had an added urgency, given that the Bush administration had, by January 2004, conceded that launching a war to disarm a state of its weapons of mass destruction (WMD) had been without merit. The Howard government not only risked having its mendacity exposed, but its competence questioned. Showing that old dogs (and dogmas) are beyond learning new tricks, Howard remains unmoved and unenlightened by his role in this bloody affair. Last November, ahead of the release of the cabinet papers, he merely admitted to being disappointed by the failure of US intelligence assessments he refused to question. He still 'tenaciously' maintained 'that the decision was taken in good faith, based largely on what was called a national intelligence assessment.' When considering such assessments, the former PM continues to prove slippery. 'I knew from earlier examinations that there had been a failure to find stockpiles, in other words, the physical weapons, although there was plenty of capacity through programs to develop them rapidly.' When a failure to find something is paired with the capacity to develop it, its absence becomes irrelevant. The capacity to develop a weapon becomes the equivalent of hypothetically having it. As if hearing the sound of a distant arrest warrant being rustled up in The Hague, Howard concludes that, 'We were wrong, in fact, but not maliciously.' Like the fate that was to cruelly befall so many Iraqis and those in the broader Middle East, such a claim lacks legs, arms, or any limbs for that matter. It is also impossible to reconcile with the hardboiled zealotry that marked Washington’s desire to redraw the Middle East in a fit of forced democratisation. The journey into Mesopotamia was a blind mission of assumption and presumption: the instant, easeful discovery of WMDs in the possession of a madman previously feted by the West; the creation of a transitional authority without hiccup, despite a wholesale dismantling of the Baathist state. Neither eventuated. The invaders were sandpit colonialists, poorly costumed to reenact the glory days of European empires in the Middle East with trimmed forces and smaller budgets. What makes Australia’s own involvement even worse, was that the reason to go to war lay less in an international security threat than a weak ego and reputational yearning: to be cringingly worthy to Washington.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWc2wOIVsfs_3PM4VmFwbFgq	2025-01-03T16:18:18-08:00	
African Union Developing A Ten-Year Comprehensive Agriculture Pro...	For three working days, 9th –11th January 2025, in the Speke Resort Conference Centre in Uganda's capital, Kampala, the African Union Commission (AUC) will host the Extraordinary Summit on the Post-Malabo Comprehensive Africa Agriculture Development Programme (CAADP). This Summit is supported by the Government of Uganda. The event is organized jointly by the African Union Commission, Department of Agriculture Rural Development Blue Economy and Sustainable Environment (DARBE) and African Union Development Agency- New Partnership African Development (AUDA-NEPAD). Dignitaries will deliver statements on the consideration of the Kampala Declaration, the Comprehensive African Agriculture Development Programme (CAADP) Ten-Year Strategy and Action Plan (2026-2035); the draft Statute of Africa Food Safety Agency; and the report on selection of African Union Centres of Excellence for Research and Training in Fisheries, Aquaculture, Aquatic Biodiversity Conservation and Ecosystems Management. The Objectives of the Summit: The convening of the extraordinary session of the Assembly is specifically to: Endorse the draft Kampala CAADP Declaration. The draft declaration provides a vision for transforming Africa’s Agrifood Systems for the period: 2026-2035. Endorse Ten-Year CAADP Strategy and Action Plan: 2026-2035. This plan provides details on how to achieve the goals and targets in the draft Kampala CAADP Declaration. Risk Management and Mitigation The post-Malabo CAADP strategy will span ten years, from 2626 to 2035. Given the longtime horizon, many risks and uncertainties could affect the strategic positioning of the agri-food systems transformation agenda to deliver on its goals. There are external socioeconomic, environmental, and other shocks that might come up, which will demand that the strategy be agile enough to respond to such unforeseen developments. The strategy will therefore call for institutional adaptation to changes in a complex and rapidly changing context. Major risks and uncertainties will need to be identified and outlined together with their respective mitigation actions. Key interventions to ensure better risk management include: ● Identify potential risks (e.g., political instability, climate change) and put in place mechanisms for dealing with or mitigating such risks ● Identify health crises, including pandemics or epidemics, early and develop mechanisms for minimizing negative impacts ● Identify and address gender inequalities or biases and restrictive social norms that may limit the access of women and youth to education, resources, and decision making processes thereby preventing them from fully participating in and benefiting from agricultural activities or initiatives ● Invest in durable peace because it is essential for building resilient agri-food systems (from the local to global levels) and affects agricultural production, food security, market access, investment, resilience, and social cohesion. Establishing and maintaining peace is critical for enabling long-lasting investment to unlock the full potential of Africa's agri-food systems. The Kampala CAADP Declaration will need to emphasize establishing conflict-resolution mechanisms at the community level while strengthening local markets and value chains. ● Promote household insurance and other coping mechanisms that can help mitigate the impact of health shocks on livelihoods. These mechanisms will be key to enhancing the resilience of communities. ● Enhance public health surveillance systems to detect and respond to health threats, including of zoonotic origin. It will also be important to strengthen food safety measures to prevent health shocks related to foodborne diseases. ● Financial resources will be required to achieve the Kampala CAADP declaration's resilience objectives. Specifically, households need access to credit, savings, and other financial instruments that help them weather economic shocks. ● Food price monitoring: It will be necessary to implement policies that stabilize food markets and prevent price volatility to ensure a steady supply of food and agricultural inputs. ● Capacities development of African governments to formulate resilience-focused policy measures is a critical step and a priority for the CAADP Strategy and Action Plan. Mainstreaming resilience-focused policies will trickle down to operational actions led by various stakeholders towards sustainable agri-food systems. Background: The Comprehensive Africa Agriculture Development Programme (CAADP) has been crucial in driving agricultural transformation across Africa since its inception in 2003. The program is aimed at increasing food security and nutrition, reducing rural poverty, creating employment, and contributing to economic development while safeguarding the environment. CAADP aims for a 6% annual growth rate in the agricultural sector, with African Union member states allocating at least 10% of their budgets to agriculture. Building on the Maputo Declaration (2003-2013), the 2014 Malabo CAADP Declaration renewed commitment to CAADP and established ambitious goals for 2025, including eradicating hunger, reducing malnutrition, tripling intra-African trade, and building resilience of livelihoods and production systems. The Malabo Declaration underscored the importance of mutual accountability through agricultural biennial reviews and recognized the essential role of related sectors like infrastructure and rural development. During the Thirty-Seventh Ordinary Session of the African Union Assembly in February 2024, the Heads of State and Government expressed concern that the continent is not on track to meet the Malabo CAADP goals and targets by 2025. This has spurred a call for the development of a post-Malabo CAADP agenda to build resilient agri-food systems. It is in this context that the An Extraordinary Summit of The African Union Assembly of Heads of States and Governments is scheduled for January 9th to 11th 2025 in Kampala, Uganda, to deliberate on the post-Malabo CAADP agenda to consider the draft Ten-Year CAADP Strategy and Action Plan with its associated draft Kampala Declaration on Advancing Africa's Inclusive Agrifood Systems Transformation for Sustainable Economic Growth and Shared Prosperity. Format and Structure of the Summit: The Extraordinary Summit will start with a one-day meeting of the Ministers responsible for Agriculture, Rural Development Water and Environment on the 9th of January 2025, to be followed by Joint Session of the Ministers of Agriculture, Rural Development, Water and Environment together with the Ministers of Foreign Affairs on the 10th of January 2025. The sessions will feature two presentations the: i) draft CAADP Ten-Year Strategy and Action Plan (2026-2035); ii) draft Kampala CAADP Declaration and both will be done in closed sessions. The Ministerial sessions will be structured to encourage inclusive and interactive conversations and dialogue among the Ministers, as well as between the Ministers and key strategic stakeholders. At the same time, it will enable the Ministers to review the strategic documents presented to them for their consideration and recommendations to the Assembly. The Assembly of Heads of State and Government will convene on the 11th of January 2025 to endorse the: i) draft Ten-Year CAADP Strategy and Action Plan (2026-2035); ii) draft Kampala CAADP Declaration. Participants: The Extraordinary Summit on the CAADP Agenda will be attended by Heads of States and Government of the African Union Member State, Ministers of Foreign Affairs, PRCs, Ministers and Experts in-Charge of Agriculture (forestry, fisheries, crops and livestock), Rural Development, Water and Environment, RECs, Youth, Women, Non-State Actors, Media, Academia and Development Partners African Union: The AU is guided by its vision of 'An Integrated, Prosperous and Peaceful Africa, driven by its own citizens and representing a dynamic force in the global arena.' The African Union (AU) is a continental body consisting of the 55 member states that make up the countries of the African Continent. To ensure the realisation of its objectives and the attainment of the Pan African Vision of an integrated, prosperous and peaceful Africa, Agenda 2063 was developed as a strategic framework for Africa's long term socio-economic and integrative transformation. Agenda 2063 calls for greater collaboration and support for African led initiatives to ensure the achievement of the aspirations of African people.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWc2wOIVsfs_3G3YrJqnlYH9	2025-01-03T16:15:41-08:00	
Georgia At The Crossroads – Analysis	By Luke Coffey For more than two months, mass demonstrations have dominated Georgia, a small, yet strategically vital, country in the South Caucasus. These protests initially erupted in response to parliamentary elections in late October, widely regarded by international and local observers as fraudulent. The situation intensified dramatically in November when Prime Minister Irakli Kobakhidze announced that Georgia would suspend its EU membership talks until at least 2028. Considering that 80 percent of Georgians support joining the bloc — according to consistent polling, including among Georgian Dream voters — this decision struck a nerve. The government’s actions have sparked a wave of unrest unseen since Georgia’s 2003 Rose Revolution. Adding fuel to the fire, Georgian Dream recently orchestrated the election of a new president under questionable circumstances. President Salome Zurabishvili’s term ended last month, marking the end of the Georgian people directly electing presidents. This time, the president was chosen by an Electoral College in parliament dominated by Georgian Dream. Opposition parties, boycotting parliament in protest of the October elections, were absent, effectively ensuring victory for Georgian Dream’s candidate. For the first time since independence in 1991, Georgia’s military abstained from its traditional parade in Tbilisi during the new president’s inauguration. This symbolic gesture from a military that prides itself on being apolitical reflects broader dissatisfaction within the institution. Meanwhile, Zurabishvili declared herself the 'people’s president,' pledging to challenge Georgian Dream’s increasing authoritarianism. In her parting words, she affirmed that the presidency’s legitimacy is rooted not in a building but in the will of the people, therefore arguing that she remains the legitimate president of the country. Georgian Dream’s transformation from a pro-Western coalition in 2012 to its current pro-Russian iteration is not surprising for those who follow Georgian politics. While elements of the party always harbored pro-Moscow sentiments, they were once marginalized by those who took a more Euro-Atlanticist outlook. Over the years, those pro-Russian voices have risen to prominence, sidelining Western-oriented members and redirecting the party’s trajectory. Today, Georgian Dream’s policies reflect a Kremlin-aligned worldview, including denouncing Western sanctions on Russia, deepening economic ties with Moscow, and blaming NATO for the war in Ukraine. Considering that Georgia has long aspired to join NATO and the EU, these are unusual policy positions to take. Georgia’s historical relationship with Russia is marked by betrayal. It is important to know this history to better understand the events of today. In the late 18th century, Imperial Russia offered security guarantees to the Kingdom of Kartli-Kakheti, the precursor to modern Georgia, only to abandon it during a Persian invasion in 1795. After the Persians withdrew, Russia annexed Georgia in 1801. A similar betrayal occurred in 1920 when Soviet Russia signed the Treaty of Moscow, pledging to respect Georgia’s sovereignty after the latter declared independence in 1918. Less than a year later, the Soviet Union invaded, overthrowing Georgia’s government and incorporating it into the USSR. This history of betrayal has left a deep mistrust of Russia among many Georgians. Life in the Soviet Union and the 2008 Russian invasion reinforced these fears. Moscow also occupies 20 percent of Georgia’s internationally recognized territory to this day. For Georgians, these historical grievances are not distant memories but lived realities, influencing their geopolitical aspirations. The current protests are the culmination of these grievances and fears. While Georgian Dream has maintained its grip on power through media suppression, undermining civil society, and discrediting political opposition, public discontent has reached a boiling point. Georgians have demonstrated their willingness to stand up for their European aspirations repeatedly, most notably in May when hundreds of thousands protested against a law seen as restricting civil society. But the current protests are different in their intensity, scale, and persistence. With Georgia’s EU membership aspirations enjoying widespread public support, the government’s decision to suspend talks has galvanized even those who previously supported Georgian Dream. The sheer size and duration of these protests are unprecedented in Georgia’s recent history. For comparison, the 2003 Rose Revolution lasted 21 days before achieving change, while Ukraine’s Euromaidan protests lasted 93 days. As of this week, the Georgian protests have surpassed 65 days, and show no signs of abating. The international community must pay closer attention to Georgia for two critical reasons. First, Georgia’s strategic location makes it a geopolitical linchpin. Situated at the crossroads of Europe and Asia, Georgia serves as a vital corridor for energy supplies, with oil and gas pipelines traversing its territory. These pipelines are essential for diversifying Europe’s energy sources and reducing dependence on Russian energy. Any instability in Georgia could disrupt these supply lines, with global ramifications. Second, Georgia’s crisis offers Russia an opportunity for intervention. With its setbacks in Syria and an inability to achieve a major breakthrough in Ukraine, the Kremlin may view Georgia as an easier target to reassert its influence. The current protests are not just about electoral fraud or the EU membership suspension; they are about Georgia’s identity and its place in the world. Will Georgia continue on its Euro-Atlantic trajectory, or will it revert back to the Russian orbit against the will of most people? As the world faces an array of challenges in 2025, from conflicts in Ukraine and the Middle East to economic instability, Georgia’s unfolding crisis might seem peripheral. But ignoring it would be a mistake. Georgia is at a crossroads, and its future hangs in the balance. The international community must not turn a blind eye. What happens in Georgia will not stay in Georgia — it will reverberate across the region and beyond. • Luke Coffey is a senior fellow at the Hudson Institute.

The New Hysteria: The Regime Pivots From Russians To Immigrants –...	By Ryan McMaken The debate over immigration is working out perfectly for the deep state. Donald Trump is calling on the CIA and the FBI to 'get involved' in domestic policing. At he same time, MAGA conservatives are begging the US government to impose a vast new surveillance state on Americans in the name of stopping illegal aliens. For at least four years, Russiagate hysteria has been used to promote more police statism, spying, military intervention, and government spending. Now, the incoming president Donald Trump will help the US regime seamlessly pivot from Russiagate hysteria to hysteria over Islamists and immigrants. The result will be the same: more growth in the federal police state and the further erosion of the Bill of Rights. This will be welcomed by MAGA conservatives who weeks earlier claimed to be suspicious of federal power and opponents of federal spy and police agencies. Trump’s Foreign Bogeymen and His Allies at the CIA On Thursday, Trump posted on X/Twitter demanding that 'The CIA must get involved, NOW, before it is too late,' presumably in reaction to the New Orleans New Years Eve massacre, which rightwing activists have declared to be an act of terrorism committed by an Islamist from an immigrant family. In the same post, Trump says 'This is what happens when you have OPEN BORDERS,' tying the issue of immigration to terrorism, and then demanding that the CIA become more active in domestic spying. Trump has already given a number of hints as to what will be used to justify the continued drumbeat for police statism under his second administration. Just prior to his post calling for an expanded CIA, Trump declared that 'Radical Islamic Terrorism, and other forms of violent crime, will become so bad in America that it will become hard to even imagine or believe.' This is Trump’s version of the 'communists under your bed' hysteria of the 1950s, which, of course was used to justify the growth of the American security state during the Cold war. The Trump administration has already signaled its openness to a growing surveillance state through Trump’s chosen friends and alliances. For example, Trump’s Vice President, JD Vance is essentially bankrolled by Peter Thiel, founder of Palantir, a data mining firm thoroughly linked to the CIA. Thiel is a longtime advocate of a federal surveillance state, and now Trump proposes appointing Thiel’s protégé, Blake Masters, as head of the BATF. All the evidence points to an incoming administration that is very comfortable with helping the deep state get bigger and more powerful. After all, during Trump’s first administration, Trump immediately betrayed his promise to make the six-decade-old JFK files public, instead siding with CIA and FBI bureaucrats. Trump apparently believes that the taxpayers still must not be allowed to view basic historical records from the days when your grandfather was still hoping to move up to middle management at Studebaker Corporation. Moreover, during his first term, Trump issued an order giving more independence to the CIA, making it easier for the agency to conduct cyber attacks without oversight from the civilian government. Who can be surprised that he’s now calling on the CIA to do more? Using Immigration to Justify the Panopticon From the regime’s perspective, it was a brilliant move when Trump tied together the topic of Islamic terrorism—used to fuel the runaway police state of the Bush years—to the topic of immigration. This new synergy will be excellent for further growing state power. Indeed, it’s likely the regime can barely believe its good fortune on the immigration front. After years of subsidizing migrants with taxpayer dollars to balloon immigrant numbers, the regime will now be rewarded with vast new powers to 'solve' the problem. Opponents of immigration will throw their support to deep state agencies while demanding a stronger surveillance state that supporters tell themselves will only ever be used against immigrants. For example, back in November, Trump promised that, if reelected, 'We will finally complete the Biometric Entry/Exit Visa Tracking System which we need desperately. It will be on land, sea, and air. We will have a proper tracking system.' Meanwhile, the US Office of Biometric Identity Management plans to 'improve facial recognition technology' for children by collecting biometric data from immigrant children. This is all key to building the tools necessary for implementing nationwide AI surveillance tools. For years, anti-immigration activists have been calling for vast new federal powers such as national identification cards and 'E-verify,' so these new federal programs and powers are unlikely to meet any opposition from 'America First' activists. The incoming administration certainly has the connections necessary to make it all happen. Key to building the vast new databases justified by migrant control will be new AI tools developed by highly paid Silicon Valley tech bros like Elon Musk and Peter Thiel. In September, Oracle co-founder Larry Ellison happily reported that 'Citizens will be on their best behavior because we are constantly recording and reporting everything that’s going on.' It’s not mentioned if non-citizens will be on their best behavior too, but it’s clear that citizens are going to be targeted every bit as much as any immigrant. In response to all this, some might say 'well you can’t just let immigrants do whatever they want.' Assuming we agree with this sentiment, we can still see that history has made it quite clear that immigration can be suppressed quite effectively—as it was from the 1950s to the 1990s—without a federal surveillance state. A surveillance state is not necessary to end migrant welfare. A surveillance state is not necessary to deport violent migrants. Nor a surveillance state necessary to drastically cut down on border crossings with walls and fences. Nonetheless, anti-immigration activists have been quite effectively duped by the federal regime which has gone to great lengths to drastically maximize immigration that would never be seen unless migrants were being actively rewarded with free cash upon entry. The ruse has worked well to get conservatives calling for vast new federal powers. The federal government has provided free room and board for millions of migrants, torn down border barriers, and opposed state-level efforts at border control. Then, rather than focus on ending the subsidizes and controlling the physical border—strategies that worked fine for decades—Trump doubles down on building a biometric visa tracking system. Heads, the feds win. Tails, you lose. Other supporters of the new ostensibly anti-immigrant police state may also say 'well it’s inevitable, so we might as well use the spy state against immigrants.' Yet, this isn’t even true because the surveillance state is heavily dependent on federal taxpayer dollars and federal cooperation. The ersatz 'entrepreneurs' like Thiel, Musk, Ellison, and others are all heavily subsidized by federal contracts and federal programs that continue to build partnerships between Silicon Valley, Langley, and the Pentagon. Without these nonstop subsidies—further fueled by ZIRP which funnels easy money to these politically favored industries—the AI panopticon would be years behind where it is now. In truth, the surveillance state is where it is because conservatives have spent so many years demanding that it get bigger. Whether it’s in the name of anti-terrorism or anti-immigration, the result is the further shredding of our privacy and the Fourth Amendment in the name of fighting the latest foreign bogeyman. Trump is just the latest manifestation of the same police-state impulse we witnessed in the Bush years. Worse yet, the current MAGA crop will repeat their own version of what we heard during the Bush years: you’re either with the president, or you’re with the terrorists.' Thanks in part to these conservative collaborators, the technocracy of total surveillance is coming. It will be wrapped in an American flag and proclaiming 'America first.'

Kyiv Plays Games With Russian Gas Transit – OpEd	The dataset by the Brussels-based think tank Brugel aggregating the data on European natural gas import flows and storage levels puts in perspective Ukraine’s decision to halt the transit of Russian gas to Europe. The statistics reveal that as of end-2024, Russia had become the second largest gas supplier to the EU after Norway, overtaking the United States — now, that’s 3 years into the Ukraine war and the Western ‘sanctions from hell’ notwithstanding. In particular, in December 2024, Russian LNG was delivered to Europe in an amount of 2.16 billion cubic meters — an all-time record since 2019. The European Union’s import of Russian LNG in 2024 amounted to almost 21.5 bcm against 17.8 bcm a year earlier and 19 bcm in 2022. What does this mean? First, EU countries find its irresistible to source LNG from Russia, which is reliable, abundant and cheap. Second, Ukraine’s decision, coming in the middle of the winter heating season, will trigger a price spiral for natural gas on the whole in Europe, but in immediate terms only. To borrow the words of Ralph Nader, if the use of solar energy has not been opened up, that’s because the (Russian) oil industry does not own the sun! Third, ensuing from the above, the demand of Russian LNG will only increase. Fourth, there is widespread discontent in European industry that the US suppliers have taken advantage of gas shortage in Europe due to the sabotage by the Americans, with help from Ukrainian henchmen, of the Nord Stream pipelines (which directly connected Russian source to German ports bypassing Ukraine). Big Oil subsequently sold LNG to Europeans twice or thrice the price in the US domestic market and made windfall profit. (here) Fifth, the skyrocketing gas prices will further shoot up the cost of production in European economies, especially Germany’s, which is also heading for parliamentary election on February 23. Sixth, there is bound to be resentment in the European mind that Ukraine is ‘biting the hand that feeds it.’ In Germany, there is already an undercurrent of opinion that energy ties with Russia ought to be revived for economic recovery, a stream of opinion that may swing the political fortunes of the Alternative for Germany (AfD) which is not only a far-right and right-wing populist political party but also Eurosceptic and calls for improving ties with Russia. On the other hand, if the set-up in Kiev hopes to please Big Oil, things are only likely getting more complicated in the transatlantic relationship under Donald Trump. Elon Musk, tech billionaire and close advisor to Trump penned an opinion piece last week supporting the AfD. Musk since doubled down and Vice President-elect JD Vance took to X to call Musk’s op-ed 'interesting.' Vance wrote: 'I’m not endorsing a party in the German elections, as it’s not my country and we hope to have good relations with all Germans. But this is an interesting piece. 'Also interesting; American media slanders AfD as Nazi-lite, but AfD is most popular in the same areas of Germany that were most resistant to the Nazis.' According to Pew Research Centre, nineteen percent of German adults have a positive view of the AfD and the party is running second in opinion polls. Besides, AfD has a strong anti-immigration stance like Trump’s in relation to the US. Plainly put, the famous line of late American philosopher and social critic Eric Hoffer comes to mind — 'People who bite the hand that feeds them usually lick the boot that kicks them.' In this respect, Russian Foreign Ministry Spokeswoman Maria Zakharova’s statement on January 2 is to the point: 'The responsibility for the shutdown of Russian gas supplies lies entirely with the United States, the puppet Kiev regime and the authorities of European countries that sacrificed the wellbeing of their people in order to provide financial support to the US economy. 'The cessation of the supplies of reasonably priced and environmentally friendly energy from Russia not only weakens Europe’s economic potential but is also negatively affecting the living standards of Europeans. The geopolitical background of the Kiev regime’s decision is perfectly clear. It is the US – the key sponsor of the Ukraine crisis – that is the main beneficiary from the redistribution of the European energy market.' But that is a pipe dream. What cannot be overlooked is that Russia also used to sell oil to Germany at discounted price anchored on long-term agreements. President Vladimir Putin once disclosed a state secret that Germans even used to sell surplus Russian gas after its own use to third countries, especially Poland, to make a tidy profit to subsidise its domestic price. Apparently, given the centrality of Russian-German energy alliance in Russia’s strategic calculus, Moscow looked away. Such considerations probably weighed on Gorbachev’s mind too when he green-lighted German unification, ignoring Margaret Thatcher’s angst and France’s preference that the two German States (FRG and GDR) merely developed good relations, at most in the form of a confederation. (France was acutely afraid that Gorbachev’s policy of glasnost would persuade Germans to accept neutrality as the price of reunification.) These are indeed moments when one fails to understand such 'sentimental' Russian attitudes — be it on German unification or selling gas to Europe at discounted price, or the unilateral disbandment of Warsaw Pact (which, again, Thatcher thought was a rushed, premature decision.) This is rather intriguing since the Russians know better than any country, being the victim of waves of Western aggression in its tortuous history, that politics is hard ball. In the final analysis, Ukraine must be held responsible for this vengeful decision. But Kiev has expressed readiness to discuss preserving transit with Europeans. What emerged from the recent visit of Slovak Prime Minister Robert Fico to Moscow and his one-on-one with Putin is that Europe is ready to move the turnover point for Russian gas in Ukraine. He claimed Putin nodded consent, too. Putin told the media after the talks, 'Regardless of the war, our supplies were regular and we paid, and still pay… money for transit.' Actually, Ukraine gets $1 billion annually as transit fee! Putin added that Moscow is also ready to supply gas to Europe through Poland, using the existing Yamal-Europe route. 'All it needs is just pushing a button'. The Russian government daily Rossiyskaya Gazeta quoted expert opinion that business circles are likely to initiate talks on resuming transit and, in fact, gas companies from Central Europe have already taken the first steps by signing a declaration supporting gas transit via Ukraine for 2025. Valery Andrianov, an associate professor at the Financial University under Russian Government told the daily that overall, halting supplies via Ukraine is not likely to cause a substantial gas deficit in Europe, as this has already been factored into gas prices, so it won’t be a surprise for the gas market. However, any interruption in supplies will increase the instability of the European gas market, making it more dependent on various external and largely uncontrollable factors, such as gas prices in Asia, delivery destinations of American LNG, or production dynamics on the Norwegian shelf.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWc2wOIVsfs_3HUTVaKJglEb	2025-01-03T15:49:35-08:00	
Best Bet For 2025: Stronger Trade Ties Between Europe And China –...	One development for 2025 that can be seen clearly in the crystal ball is improving trade ties between China and Europe. The reason this is a virtual certainty is Donald Trump is doing everything he can to convince the world that, under his leadership, the United States is an unreliable trading partner. He already worked hard to establish this point in his first term when he arbitrarily slapped tariffs on various imports from Canada and the European Union. His ostensible rationale was national defense, but no one outside of Mar-a-Lago could take that one seriously. We worried that we may not be able to get steel from Canada if the US is engaged in a war with another country? Or maybe we’re worried we will be at war with Canada, and they will cut us off. But Trump is showing that the craziness will get even worse in his second term. Before even taking office Trump made strong demands that Canada and Mexico essentially do things they are already doing (block drug shipments and restrict the flow of immigrants) or he will slap 25 percent taxes on all the goods we import from them. This is bizarre from many angles, but most notably because Trump’s proposed import taxes would be a flagrant violation of the trade agreement he negotiated with Mexico and Canada just four and a half years ago. If Trump can just toss into the garbage a trade deal with two of our closest allies — one that he widely trumpeted at the time — then what would be the value of any deal he would strike with European countries? Clearly Trump does not feel bound by his commitments and there is no one in the US political structure who can force Trump to adhere to agreements made by the government, even when it was Trump himself who made the deal. This is the way Trump has always done business. He routinely reneged on his commitments and often refused to pay contractors after they had done work on his projects. Many contractors would insist on payment in advance from Trump because they knew they would have a tough time collecting after the fact. If the US is not going to be a reliable trading partner for at least the next four years, and possibly many more years into the future, Europe would be wise to look elsewhere. And there is one obvious elsewhere: China. China’s economy is in fact already considerably larger than the US economy and growing far more rapidly. This fact is obscured by the tendency in the US media to use exchange rate measures of GDP, rather than purchasing power parity (PPP) measures. An exchange rate measure simply takes a country’s GDP, measured in its own currency, and then converts it into dollars at the current exchange rate. By contrast, a PPP measure uses a common set of prices to assess the value of all the goods and services produced in each country. This would mean that we apply the same price for a car, a computer, and a haircut, in both the US and China. Economists would usually argue that for most purposes the PPP measure is more useful. By this measure, China’s economy grew larger than the US economy roughly a decade ago. It is now almost 30 percent larger, and according to I.M.F. projections will be more than 40 percent larger by the end of the decade. It’s not clear why the U.S. media insists on using the exchange rate measure of GDP in reporting that routinely refers to China as the world’s second-largest economy, perhaps it’s just nationalistic chauvinism. In any case, that call reflects political biases not realities in the world. The larger size of China’s economy makes it a more attractive trading partner in any case, but it is also more likely to stick to its commitments than the United States as long as Donald Trump is in charge. For this reason, we can be fairly certain that Europe will be looking to shore up its trade relations with China as Donald Trump puts on his clown show in Washington and Mar-a-Lago.

Robert Reich: The Only Real Firewall Against The Trump Regime – O...	As a practical matter, where will we find a firewall against the excesses of the Trump regime? The federal courts. You might say it doesn’t matter because the Supreme Court will rubber-stamp whatever Trump and his cronies want to do. Not so. The Supreme Court didn’t support all of Trump’s moves in his first administration (remember Trump’s Muslim ban?). More importantly, fewer than 1 percent of federal cases ever reach the Supreme Court. Given the amount of federal litigation likely to be created by the upcoming Trump administration, the Supreme Court probably won’t be able to deal with even 1 percent. Most disputes will be decided instead by 1,457 federal judges across 209 courts in the federal court system. Most of these federal judges were appointed by Democratic presidents. Of the 680 federal district court judges, 370 were appointed by Democrats compared to 267 by Republicans. Of the 179 federal courts of appeals judges, 89 were appointed by Republican presidents and 89 by Democratic presidents. Judges appointed by Democratic presidents hold the majority of seats on seven of the 13 regional courts of appeal. (Biden nominated and the Senate confirmed 235 federal judges — a quarter of all federal judges, and one more than Trump.) *** Examples of federal litigation we can expect: 1. Trump has promised to withhold, by executive action, birthright citizenship from people born in the United States to parents who are undocumented immigrants. Yet the 14th Amendment guarantees citizenship to 'all persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof.' The restriction, at the time of the amendment’s adoption in 1868, was widely understood to exclude foreign diplomats and native tribes. American Indians later started receiving birthright citizenship under a law passed in 1924. 2. Trump says he’ll refuse to spend money that Congress has authorized. 'When I return to the White House, I will do everything I can to challenge the Impoundment Control Act in court,' Trump has said. 'With impoundment, we can simply choke off the money.' Wrong. Congress restricted impoundments in 1974 in response to Nixon’s efforts to unilaterally alter domestic programs. Trump’s OMB is expected to argue that the 1974 Impoundment Control Act is unconstitutional. But the Constitution assigns Congress the 'power of the purse' to control taxation and spending. 3. Trump wants to revive a policy from late in his first term making it easier to fire tens of thousands of civil servants despite Biden’s moves to bolster their protections. When Trump does this, unions representing federal workers will appeal to the federal courts. 4. Trump will seek to raise tariffs across the board, arguably a move that requires congressional action. To impose 25 percent tariffs on all imports from Mexico and Canada, as Trump says he wants to do, would require his reliance on an emergency powers law that’s the basis for U.S. financial sanctions, but not the basis for tariffs. Such executive action would almost certainly be challenged by affected businesses. 5. Trump will try to erode Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid without congressional approval. Vivek Ramaswamy, the co-chair (with Elon Musk) of Trump’s so-called 'Department' of Government Efficiency, asserts that he and Musk could cut Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid without Congress’ approval. 'The executive branch has no obligation to send out a payment if it is wasteful,' he said. I doubt they’ll try to take on these popular programs head-on. More likely, they’ll try to alter eligibility or, as in the case of Medicaid, impose work requirements and make block-grants to the states. Where will this issue be decided? Again, in the federal courts. 6. Trump will seek to undo thousands of regulations through an executive order instructing agencies not to enforce them. Musk and Ramaswamy have already boasted that this is what Trump will do. The Administrative Procedure Act requires, however, an open process if agencies want to adopt or rescind regulations. Musk and Ramaswamy’s moves (via Trump) will be instantly appealed to the federal courts. 7. DOGE’s secrecy itself will be challenged. The Federal Advisory Committee Act of 1972 requires outside groups advising the executive branch to hold open meetings and include a range of perspectives. (The federal appeals court in Washington upheld the requirements during the first Trump administration, when a veterans group sued the Department of Veterans Affairs for relying on a trio of advisersbased out of Trump’s Mar-a-Lago Club.) Where will this be decided? The federal courts could order disclosures or even bar agencies from using recommendations from advisers who broke the rules. *** Trump’s incipient administration is already laying plans for this tsunami of federal litigation against the regime. 'Those who seek to delay or stall [Trump’s] agenda by filing litigation against the Trump administration will be subverting the will of the tens of millions of Americans who just reelected President Trump,' said Trump spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt. Rubbish. In light of Republican control over the White House and both chambers of Congress, litigation in the federal courts may be the only way to protect the rights of the tens of millions of Americans who didn’t elect Trump and even of many who did. Given that most of this litigation will be decided not by the Supreme Court but by federal judges appointed by Democratic presidents, there’s a fair chance that many of Trump’s initiatives will be found to be illegal.

Venezuela Puts A Price On The Head Of Exiled Opposition Candidate	(EurActiv) -- Venezuelan authorities announced Thursday (2 December) they are offering $100,000 for information leading to the capture of exiled opposition candidate Edmundo González Urrutia, who insists he beat President Nicolás Maduro at the polls. Police published on social media a photo of the previously little-known ex-diplomat with the word 'wanted' under the image He fled to Spain in September after Maduro claimed victory in the 28 July election and cracked down hard on dissent. González Urrutia, 75, vowed to return to his troubled, economically distressed country to be sworn in as president on January 10 instead of Maduro, who is due to take the oath of office that day. Judicial officials told AFP that the wanted poster with Gonzalez Urrutia's face would be displayed at airports and police checkpoints around the country. Spain granted González Urrutia asylum on 20 December after Venezuela announced charges of conspiracy and racketeering against him. Venezuela declared Maduro the winner of a third six-year term in the July vote but the opposition cried foul, saying it has detailed polling station numbers that show Gonzalez Urrutia won handily. The government has resisted intense pressure at home and abroad to release vote results that prove its claim of victory. Street protests erupted after the election and degenerated into clashes with police, with 28 people dead, 200 injured and more than 2,400 arrested. Three detainees died in prison, and nearly 1,400 of those originally arrested have been released. Maduro is a former bus driver hand-picked by the late socialist icon Hugo Chaves to succeed him upon his death in 2013. Maduro has overseen the oil-rich country's decline into economic ruin and been accused of acting like a harsh left wing dictator as he cracks down on dissent and clings to power. Only a handful of countries, including Venezuelan ally Russia, have recognized Maduro as the winner of the July election. The United States and the European Parliament have recognized González Urrutia as 'president-elect.' In October 2024 the European Parliament announced Venezuelan opposition leaders María Corina Machado and Edmundo González Urrutia as joint winners of this year’s Sakharov Prize for Freedom of Thought, the EU’s highest human rights award.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWc2wOIVsfs_3PwEODyNaIi_	2025-01-03T15:44:44-08:00	
Biden Blocks Japan’s Nippon Steel From Buying US Steel	By Patsy Widakuswara President Joe Biden has made good on his months of public opposition to the proposed purchase of American company U.S. Steel by Japan’s Nippon Steel, announcing Friday he is blocking the $14.9 billion takeover. The acquisition would 'place one of America’s largest steel producers under foreign control and create risk for our national security and our critical supply chains,' he said in a statement. He did not elaborate on how the deal would jeopardize national security. The collapse of the proposed acquisition represents a victory for the United Steelworkers union. Based in Pennsylvania, an electorally crucial swing state, the union in March endorsed Biden, who at that time was still running for reelection. 'This was clearly a political decision that President Biden had been chewing over for a long time. He is determined to demonstrate that he's going to protect American workers, and particularly in the steel sector,' said Matthew Goodman, director of the Council on Foreign Relations' RealEcon initiative, which explores the U.S. role in the international economy. 'It is an important sector, and it is subject to unfair trade practices, but it's hard to really understand the national security logic of blocking this transaction,' he told VOA. Federal law gives the president power to block a transaction based on the recommendation of the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, chaired by Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen and made up of other Cabinet members. Last month, CFIUS failed to reach consensus on the possible national security risks of the deal. White House national security spokesperson John Kirby declined to clarify Biden's decision making based on the CFIUS process. 'The committee of national security and economic experts assessed that there was a security risk,' Kirby told VOA during his briefing Friday. The president made the decision based on 'his concurrence with that assessment and the risk that he saw, and that this is very much about keeping a critical company in American hands.' Biden made the announcement in his remaining days in office, despite some analysts and advisers warning that his rejection of the deal could damage relations with Japan, a key U.S. ally and trade partner — especially with a looming trade war under the incoming Trump administration, which has vowed to slap high tariffs on trading partners. 'We need allies especially in the war — a potential war against China,' said John Ferrari, a nonresident senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute. 'Japan is a staunch ally in the Pacific. They have prowess in ship building and in manufacturing, and so we need them,' Ferrari told VOA. 'Allowing them to invest in the United States would make us stronger.' President-elect Donald Trump, who is set to come to power on Jan. 20, also opposes the acquisition. In a November social media post, he vowed to block the deal and to use tax incentives and tariffs to grow U.S. Steel. Both Nippon Steel and U.S. Steel have vowed to pursue legal action, saying that the U.S. government failed to follow proper procedures in considering the acquisition. 'The President’s statement and Order do not present any credible evidence of a national security issue, making clear that this was a political decision,' the companies said in a statement. 'Following President Biden’s decision, we are left with no choice but to take all appropriate action to protect our legal rights.' The White House dismissed U.S. Steel's warning that it may have to close steel mills if the deal with Nippon Steel fell through. 'The president is confident that domestic steel and domestic steel workers are going to continue to thrive because of the work that he's done, because of the commitment that he has to this industry,' White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said during her Friday briefing. The announcement by Biden followed other protectionist moves by the administration. Last year, Biden tripled tariffs on steel imports from China. 'For too long, U.S. steel companies have faced unfair trade practices as foreign companies have dumped steel on global markets at artificially low prices, leading to job losses and factory closures in America,' he said in his statement Friday.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWc2wOIVsfs_3LkoLCavJtlc	2025-01-03T15:42:00-08:00	
South China Sea: 5 Things To Watch In 2025	The South China Sea has become one of the world’s most perilous geopolitical hot spots in recent years, with China stepping up the reinforcement of its expansive claims and countries from outside the region getting increasingly involved. Here are five areas to watch in 2025: Taiwan Strait The situation in the Taiwan Strait has been becoming notably more tense, with nearly 3,000 incursions into Taiwan’s air defense identification zone between January and November 2024, as well as two major military exercises - Joint Sword A and B – coinciding with important political events on the self-ruled island. Chinese leader Xi Jinping reiterated in his New Year message that the unification of Taiwan was 'inevitable.' 'China will continue to hold exercises in 2025 if senior Taiwanese officials visit the United States or top U.S. officials visit Taiwan,' said Shen Ming-Shih, a research fellow at the top Taiwan government think tank, the Institute for National Defense Security Research (INDSR). Chinese military exercises such as joint fire strike, joint blockade, and joint anti-access and area denial will continue, but they will become less effective as Taiwan develops effective countermeasures, Shen said. Another INDSR research fellow, Ou Si-Fu, director of the Division of Chinese Politics, Military and Warfighting Concepts, told Radio Free Asia that China was not ready for a full-on war with Taiwan. 'Xi is not confident with his army,' Ou said, pointing to recent sackings in the top ranks of the People’s Liberation Army. 'The PLA has not fought a real war in a long time, so an imminent invasion of Taiwan is not expected,' the analyst said. 'They may be preparing their forces, but we are preparing, too.' Taiwan’s President Lai Ching-te said in his New Year message that his government would increase the defense budget and strengthen military capabilities. Scarborough Shoal Latest developments at the chain of reefs in the Philippines’ exclusive economic zone but under China’s de-facto control are worrisome. Just before the New Year, the PLA Southern Theater Command conducted large-scale combat readiness drills at the shoal that involved both naval and air force troops. China’s coast guard is maintaining a strong presence in the area, as is its maritime militia. A month earlier, Beijing announced a set of baselines around the Scarborough Shoal to define its territorial waters and airspace – a step seen as illegal by many but used by China to justify its actions against the Philippines and its ally the United States. The Chinese coastguard in early December fired a water cannon at a Philippine fisheries bureau boat taking supplies to fishermen in the shoal, saying it 'dangerously approached' Beijing’s territorial waters. 'You cannot draw baselines if you don’t own the features,' said former Philippine Supreme Court justice Antonio Carpio. He suggested that the Philippines should challenge China’s announcement at an international tribunal. Scarborough Shoal is unoccupied and there are no structures on it but that may change in 2025, given Beijing’s assertiveness. Philippine forces have been removing Chinese floating barriers around the reefs but access by Filipino fishermen to their traditional fishing ground remains restricted. The Philippines is believed to be considering a new legal case against China for its violations of the U.N. Convention on the Law of the Sea but since Beijing refused to take part and rejected the ruling of the 2016 U.N. arbitral tribunal, there is little chance it will participate. Second Thomas Shoal Throughout 2024, China and the Philippines were engaged in stand-offs at the Second Thomas Shoal, also inside the Philippines’ exclusive economic zone, where Manila deliberately grounded an old warship in 1999 to serve as an outpost. In the last few years, China’s coast guard has been blocking and disrupting Philippine resupply missions to the ship, the BRP Sierra Madre, and the troops stationed there. On June 17, 2024, in an unprecedented confrontation, China coast guard personnel, armed with pikes and machetes, punctured Philippine boats and seized firearms during a Philippine rotate and resupply mission, wounding a Filipino sailor. Both sides later called for de-escalation. On Dec. 12, China said it had granted permission to the Philippines to resupply the 'illegally grounded' warship on Second Thomas Shoal on a humanitarian basis. But the June 17 incident showed that the situation could easily escalate into conflict, especially given the proximity of Second Thomas Shoal to a Chinese naval base on Mischief Reef, an artificial island that China built and has fully militarized. Manila and Washington signed a Mutual Defense Treaty in 1951 under which both parties are obliged to support each other in the event of an armed attack. U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin in November revealed that the U.S. military had set up a Task Force Ayungin, the Filipino name for the Second Thomas Shoal. Chief of the Philippine armed forces, Gen. Romeo Brawner Jr., told an RFA reporter in Manila that his country was pursuing a three-pronged strategy when it comes to maritime defense: to establish an effective presence; to create effective deterrence and modernize military equipment; and to leverage alliances and partnerships with like-minded nations. Beijing, however, is not expected to give up its demand that Manila removes the BRP Sierra Madre and leave the disputed shoal. For its part, the Philippines is determined to defend it. 'We’ll never abandon our territory at Ayungin,' insisted Col. Xerxes Trinidad, the Philippine armed forces’ spokesperson. Vietnam’s island building Vietnam’s island building in the South China Sea has reached a record, with the total area created in the first six months of 2024 equaling that of 2022 and 2023 combined, according to a study by the Washington-based Asia Maritime Transparency Initiative (AMTI). Between November 2023 and June 2024, Hanoi created 692 new acres (280 ha) of land across a total of 10 features in the Spratly archipelago. Vietnam’s overall dredging and landfill totaled about 2,360 acres (955 ha), roughly half of China’s 4,650 acres (1,881.7 ha). 'Three years from when it first began, Vietnam is still surprising observers with the ever-increasing scope of its dredging and landfill in the Spratly Islands,' AMTI said. Vietnam occupies 27 features and has been carrying out large-scale reclamation works on some over the past year. A new 3,000-meter airstrip is nearly finished on Barque Canada reef, where the total landfill area more than doubled in one year to nearly 2.5 square kilometers, or 617.7 acres, by October 2024. Vietnam has had only one airstrip on an island called Spratly, measuring 1,300 meters, but besides Barque Canada, AMTI said that 'it would be unsurprising' if Hanoi also considers runways on Pearson and Ladd reefs. New bases and runways 'would give Vietnam a position on the other side of China’s ‘Big Three’ islands,' said Tom Shugart, adjunct senior fellow at the Center for a New American Security. He was referring to China-developed Fiery Cross, Subi and Mischief reefs, which are the largest artificial islands in the South China Sea. The next four largest are all newly expanded Vietnamese reefs. 'Its progress in the last five months suggests that Hanoi is determined to maximize the strategic potential of the features it occupies,' said AMTI, adding that 'it remains difficult to say when the expansion will end—and what new capabilities Vietnam will have once it has.' Code of Conduct in the South China Sea Malaysia is taking over as chairman of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, or ASEAN, from Laos this month and every time the chair changes hands, the question of a legally binding code of conduct (COC) for all competing parties in the South China Sea surfaces. China and ASEAN countries have been negotiating a COC after reaching an initial Declaration of Conduct of Parties in the South China Sea in 2002. More than two decades later, it seems many obstacles remain despite Beijing’s repeated assertions that the consultation process is going well and agreement is close. Premier Li Qiang told an ASEAN summit in October that China and the bloc were 'striving for early conclusion' of the code of conduct. China and five other parties, including four ASEAN countries – Brunei, Malaysia, the Philippines and Vietnam – hold conflicting claims over parts of the South China Sea but China’s claim is by far the most expansive, covering nearly 90% of the sea. China is adamantly against what it sees as 'a politicization' of the COC, as well as any 'external interference' in the matter. Yet its assertiveness has prompted some countries to seek a counterweight from outside ASEAN. 'Negotiations on the COC continue at a snail’s pace,' former Thai Foreign Minister Kantathi Suphamongkhon told Reuters news agency in October. 'An agreement seems impossible,' said Philippine legal expert, former Supreme Court justice Antonio Carpio. 'China will never agree to some provisions, Vietnam to some others and so on. The target of concluding the COC by 2026, therefore, was 'unrealistic,' he said. One of the underlying obstacles is ASEAN’s own division and weakness. 'ASEAN could strengthen its collective bargaining power by aligning the interests of its member states and speaking with a unified voice in negotiations with external powers like China,' said Isha Gharti, a public policy professor at Thailand’s Chiang Mai University. It remains to be seen how the new chair Malaysia will seek to raise a collective ASEAN voice.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWc2wOIVsfs_3Lzdeg1qAiu3	2025-01-03T15:36:05-08:00	
US Law Enforcement Warned To Watch For New Orleans Copycat Attack...	The U.S. Homeland Security Department and the FBI are warning federal, state, and local law enforcement agencies to be vigilant for potential copycat incidents inspired by the New Year’s Eve truck-ramming attack in New Orleans that killed at least 14 people. In a joint intelligence bulletin released Friday, federal authorities warned the nation's 18,000 law-enforcement agencies to be on the lookout for 'potential copycat or retaliatory attacks inspired by this attack and other recent, lethal vehicle-ramming incidents across the globe.' The bulletin said such attacks 'are likely to remain attractive for aspiring attackers given vehicles' ease of acquisition and the low skill threshold necessary to conduct an attack.' The federal bulletin noted that since 2014, the Islamic State terror group has been promoting the use of vehicles in terror attacks, followed by attacks with secondary weapons, as a method to cause mass casualty incidents. The joint bulletin advised law enforcement agencies to look for danger signs, such as fraudulent documents or credit cards used to rent vehicles, or signs of 'pre-operational surveillance,' such as automobiles parked in odd locations or suspicious activity near an event location. The FBI released three photos Friday of the now deceased suspect in the attack, 42-year-old Shamsud-Din Jabbar, taken from surveillance video about an hour before the deadly Bourbon Street attack. They also released a photograph of a blue ice chest that was found near the scene containing an improvised explosive device. The photos were released along with a statement soliciting information from any member of the public who might have passed Jabbar on the street or saw the cooler like the one in the photo. The White House announced Friday that President Joe Biden and first lady Jill Biden will travel to New Orleans on Monday to visit with families and community members affected by the attack, as well as meet with officials on the ground. In a briefing Thursday with reporters, FBI officials said they believe Jabbar, who was killed at the scene in a shootout with police, acted alone in the New Year’s attack and was inspired by the Islamic State terror group. FBI Deputy Assistant Director Christopher Raia, with the agency’s counterterrorism division, said they concluded Jabbar had no accomplices following hundreds of interviews and reviews of the attacker’s calls, social media accounts and electronic devices. Officials reopened Bourbon Street on Thursday afternoon. The attack occurred on Wednesday at 3:15 a.m. On Tuesday evening, just hours before the attack, Jabbar posted five videos to his Facebook account, apparently addressed to his family and recorded while he was driving, in which he aligned himself with the Islamic State terror group. The FBI said an Islamic State flag also was found in the vehicle after the attack. 'This was an act of terrorism. It was premeditated and an evil act,' Raia said. Jabbar had originally planned to hurt his relatives and friends but worried about how that would be interpreted by the media, Raia said. 'He was 100% inspired by ISIS.' The attack occurred at the intersection of Canal and Bourbon streets in the city's lively French Quarter. The historic tourist destination filled with bars and music is also known for its large New Year's Eve celebrations. After the vehicle crashed, the driver got out of the truck and shot at responding officers, police said. Officers returned fire, killing the driver, according to police. Two officers were wounded but are in stable condition, the police said. 'This is not just an act of terrorism. This is evil,' New Orleans Police Superintendent Anne Kirkpatrick told reporters at a news conference Wednesday. Investigators found weapons and an explosive device in the vehicle, the FBI said, along with other explosive devices found in the French Quarter. The vehicle appeared to have been rented, the FBI said. President-elect Donald Trump condemned the attack in a post on his social media platform Truth Social. 'Our hearts are with all the innocent victims and their loved ones. The Trump Administration will fully support the City of New Orleans as they investigate and recover from this act of pure evil!' he said. In the same post, Trump also falsely suggested that the suspect was an immigrant. VOA National Security Correspondent Jeff Seldin and VOA reporter Liam Scott contributed to this report.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWc2wOIVsfs_3LZukjJeStd9	2025-01-03T15:30:39-08:00	
Zelenskyy Says Trump Could Be ‘Decisive’ In Ending War	(RFE/RL) -- Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said in a televised interview broadcast on January 2 that U.S. President-elect Donald Trump's 'unpredictability' could help end the war with Russia. Trump, who is set to be inaugurated on January 20, has said he would end the conflict within 24 hours of taking office. Ukraine and other European countries have been skeptical about the claim and are concerned that a deal drafted by Trump could force Ukraine to give up territory to Russia in exchange for peace. Zelenskiy said in the interview that he believes Russian President Vladimir Putin is afraid of Trump, who he said could be 'decisive' in ending the war. 'He's very strong and unpredictable, and I would really like to see President Trump's unpredictability apply to Russia,' Zelenskiy said in the interview with Ukrainian TV. He also said Trump promised in a recent conversation that one of his first meetings after the inauguration would be with Zelenskiy. The Ukrainian leader has sought to build bridges with Trump amid concerns he could slow U.S. military aid or halt it entirely. Zelenskiy met Trump in Paris last month to discuss the war, and the idea of deploying European peacekeeping forces to monitor a potential cease-fire reportedly was on the agenda. Zelenskiy said in the interview that he supports the idea of France deploying peacekeepers to guarantee a cease-fire but said 'France alone is not enough' and stressed this would need to be a step toward joining NATO. 'We support this initiative, but. We would not want it to be one or two countries if it comes to this initiative. It should definitely be on the way to NATO,' Zelenskiy said. The idea of European forces in Ukraine is supported by some countries that have not yet spoken about it publicly, Zelenskiy said. But there are no specifics yet, he said, and a deployment of several thousand 'demonstrative' soldiers would not work. There must also be naval and aviation support, he said. Russia is against the deployment of Western peacekeeping troops to Ukraine as part of any settlement to end the conflict, Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said earlier this week. In an interview published on December 30, Lavrov said Moscow was 'not satisfied' with that idea and others being proposed by Trump, including postponing Ukrainian NATO membership for 20 years. Zelenskiy, who was interviewed together with his wife, Olena Zelenska, also discussed important achievements by the military in 2024, including the defeat of Russian plans to occupy Kharkiv, Sumy, and Zaporizhzhya and the incursion into Russia's Kursk region. He acknowledged Ukraine's army is fatigued amid Russia's relentless assault on the front line but said the military 'will do everything to stabilize the front in January,' promising this should happen with the help of weapons due to arrive and with the return of Ukrainian military personnel who are training abroad. Asked about elections, which have been postponed because of the war, Zelenskiy said he didn't know whether he would run for a second term but added that presidential and parliamentary elections are possible after martial law is lifted. He suggested that this could even happen in 2025 if Ukraine manages to end the hot phase of the war in a strong position.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWc2wOIVsfs_3EVSH0qoyici	2025-01-03T15:27:25-08:00	
Brazil Assumes BRICS Presidency As Bloc Expands	By Lucas Pordeus Leon On Wednesday (Jan. 1), Brazil assumed the BRICS rotating presidency for the fourth time, coinciding with the bloc's expansion to include at least nine new members by 2025. Brazil aims to prioritize global governance reform and sustainable development with a focus on social inclusion. Under the motto Strengthening Cooperation in the Global South for More Inclusive and Sustainable Governance, Brazil faces key challenges, including integrating new members and advancing the development of a local currency payment system to replace the dollar in trade among member countries. In early 2025, the BRICS bloc will welcome at least nine new members: Cuba, Bolivia, Indonesia, Belarus, Kazakhstan, Malaysia, Thailand, Uganda, and Uzbekistan, as confirmed by Russia via the state news agency Tass. Russia held the BRICS presidency in 2024. Professor Paulo Borba Casella, an international law expert from the BRICS Study Group (GEBRICS) at the University of São Paulo (USP), told Agência Brasil that a key challenge for the bloc's presidency is establishing a cohesive dynamic for the expanded BRICS. 'There are over a hundred working groups in a wide range of areas. We'll have to see how Brazil can contribute to making the BRICS function in its new configuration, with ten member states and a dozen more associated states. How will it work? No one has seen it yet, and no one knows,' Casella pondered. In total, thirteen countries have been invited to join BRICS. Nigeria, Turkey, Algeria, and Vietnam are also expected to confirm their participation. The decision to include new members was made in October 2024 during the 16th BRICS summit in Kazan, Russia, where the new category of bloc partners was established. The Brazilian Foreign Ministry has yet to confirm in which category the nine countries will join the group—whether as partners or full members. Unlike full members, partners can participate in meetings and events but do not have voting or veto power, as BRICS decisions are made by consensus. By 2024, the bloc had already welcomed five new full members, bringing the total to ten countries. Previously consisting of Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa, BRICS expanded in the past year to include Iran, the United Arab Emirates, Egypt, Ethiopia, and Saudi Arabia. Although Saudi Arabia has not officially joined the group, it has participated in all of the meetings. Importance of BRICS Professor Maria Elena Rodríguez, coordinator of the BRICS research group at the Pontifical Catholic University of Rio de Janeiro (PUC), noted that during Brazil's last presidency of the bloc, the government did not place much emphasis on BRICS—an approach she expects to change this year. 'The previous summit under the Brazilian presidency took place during the Bolsonaro government, and it was marked by a lack of significance and ambition. Now, BRICS is much more consolidated. Brazil must be well-prepared and demonstrate concrete progress, such as in negotiations involving local currencies. We need an agenda that helps elevate both Brazil and the Latin American continent within BRICS,' she said. Trump and BRICS The initiative to replace the dollar with local currencies has prompted US President-elect Donald Trump to threaten countries that abandon the American currency with higher taxes on their exports. According to Paulo Borba Casella, a professor at the University of São Paulo (USP), Trump cannot impose tariffs on all BRICS countries without harming the US economy. 'He's playing to the domestic electorate to make a point, but it's nonsense because the international system doesn't function solely through threats,' he said. Given Trump's behavior, Casella believes that forums like BRICS are gaining importance. 'It may be the role of BRICS to counter a rather petty and crude discourse from the point of view of international relations, such as Trump's style,' he added. BRICS has emerged as an alternative platform for dialogue and the integration of countries dissatisfied with the US-led, dollar-dominated international order. With its ten current full members, BRICS represents over 40 percent of the global population and 37 percent of the world's GDP by purchasing power, surpassing the economic influence of the G7, which includes the world's most industrialized nations. A key demand of the group is the reform of global governance, calling for greater representation of Asian, African, and Latin American countries in institutions such as the UN Security Council, the World Trade Organization (WTO), and financial organizations like the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund (IMF).	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWc2wOIVsfs_3HFkfDZIGQ90	2025-01-03T15:25:34-08:00	
The Realms Of Doxa And Episteme In The Global Landscape – OpEd	A Metaphor for Global Politics and Journalism Doxa, the realm of common opinion and culturally contingent beliefs, serves as the starting point for collective understanding, often influenced by tradition and subjective experience. Episteme, by contrast, is the domain of justified, evidence-based knowledge, constructed through rigorous inquiry and logical reasoning. We can say that Episteme is a concept that is casually referred to objective truth and Doxa refers to opinion based truth. Together, these concepts provide a framework for examining how societies form, challenge, and refine their views. While the two realms seem distinct, they are deeply interconnected. Opinions formed in the Realm of Doxa often inspire the questions that guide us toward Episteme. Conversely, knowledge discovered in the Episteme must be effectively communicated back to the Doxa for it to have a meaningful impact. This knowledge, when disseminated through journalism, has fueled policy actions like the Paris Agreement. However, this interplay is fraught with challenges. False narratives from the Doxa can undermine the credibility of evidence-based knowledge. For instance, anti-vaccine movements, fueled by misinformation, have led to declining vaccination rates in certain regions. A 2023 World Health Organization report noted that measles cases surged by 80% globally due to vaccine hesitancy, emphasizing the need to bridge the gap between the realms effectively. Journalism’s primary role is to bridge the divide between Doxa and Episteme, translating the chaos of public opinion into actionable knowledge. Yet, this role has become increasingly complex in the digital age. The proliferation of 'fake news' and opinionated reporting has blurred the lines between fact and opinion. A Reuters Institute report in 2022 highlighted that only 42% of global audiences trust the news they consume. Despite these challenges, journalism remains pivotal in guiding societies toward informed decisions. Initiatives like fact-checking platforms (e.g., PolitiFact and Snopes) and investigative organizations (e.g., ProPublica) aim to counteract misinformation. They act as the modern-day seekers of Episteme, sifting through the noise to uncover the truth. The interplay of Doxa and Episteme is vividly illustrated in the global political and journalistic landscape, where public opinion and evidence-based reporting often clash or converge. In Brazil, former President Jair Bolsonaro’s dismissal of scientific warnings about COVID-19 and Amazon deforestation reflects how political leaders can manipulate the Doxa to suit their agendas, undermining trust in empirical knowledge. Meanwhile, in Hungary, state-controlled media under Viktor Orbán has blurred the lines between propaganda and journalism, weaponizing Doxa to stifle dissent and consolidate power. Contrastingly, journalists in regions like the European Union have sought to bridge the gap between belief and truth through initiatives like the European Digital Media Observatory, which combats fake news and promotes media literacy. These examples underscore how the struggle to balance Doxa and Episteme shapes not only public discourse but also the very fabric of governance and societal trust. The allegory of Doxa and Episteme challenges global leaders and journalists to uphold their responsibilities as navigators between belief and truth. Political leaders must ensure that policies are grounded in evidence while remaining sensitive to the voices of their constituents. For instance, New Zealand’s response to COVID-19 under Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern exemplified this balance. By combining transparent communication with adherence to scientific advice, the country managed to maintain public trust and achieve relatively low infection rates. Last but not least, Pakistan, former Prime Minister Imran Khan and his political party, PTI, have leveraged misinformation and emotional narratives to challenge state institutions and rally public support. Through claims of political victimization and unverified conspiracy theories, they have fostered a divisive Doxa that undermines trust in democratic processes and the judiciary. Journalists, meanwhile, must commit to ethical storytelling and rigorous investigation. Training programs to enhance media literacy among citizens could empower audiences to discern fact from opinion. Furthermore, technological advancements like artificial intelligence can be leveraged to detect and counteract misinformation in real time. The journey from unexamined belief to evidence-based knowledge is not just a philosophical exercise but a practical imperative for global politics and journalism. By embracing this journey, societies can aspire to governance and journalism that not only reflect but elevate the human condition. It is a path that requires courage, discipline, and unwavering commitment to the truth.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWc2wOIVsfs_3Ki6pnQp13G1	2025-01-03T15:23:44-08:00	
Sentencing Of Hong Kong Democrats Just The Latest Legal Blow – An...	By Brendan Clift On 19 November 2024, a Hong Kong court sentenced 45 pro-democracy activists to jail terms between four and 10 years for conspiracy to commit subversion, an offence under the national security law Beijing imposed on the region in mid-2020. The 47 charged — a diverse group including lawmakers, academics, unionists, campaigners and community leaders — had participated in unofficial primary elections held by the pro-democracy camp in late 2020, with the aim of winning the maximum number of available seats at the next Legislative Council election to improve leverage over the government. More than 600,000 people voted in those primaries — almost 10 per cent of Hong Kong’s population — less than a year after the pro-democracy camp won a landslide victory in the 2019 District Council election, tripling its seats and ousting many pro-establishment politicians amid a record voter turnout. These votes revealed high levels of political engagement and support for opposition politicians at the same time as widespread and often unruly anti-government protests unfolded in Hong Kong. The government likely saw this combined movement as an existential threat that must be decisively put down. The ‘Hong Kong 47’ were not the first diverse opposition collective to be prosecuted — the 2019 ‘Umbrella Nine’ are a notable earlier example — but these proceedings were unprecedented in their scale. Sixteen defendants pleaded not guilty and stood trial before three specially selected ‘national security judges’ in the Court of First Instance. Fourteen of those were convicted, eight of whom plan to appeal their convictions and sentences. Western democracies criticised the Hong Kong 47 sentences and the handling of the cases overall, with Australia expressing ‘strong objections’ and the United States foreshadowing new visa restrictions on Hong Kong officials. Amnesty International called the affair ‘a ruthless purge of the opposition’ — an accurate assessment, given that the Hong Kong 47 included almost all pro-democracy candidates who were readying to contest the next Legislative Council election. In response to these critiques, the Hong Kong government issued a lengthy statement just one day after the sentences were handed down, condemning the ‘untruthful smearing and unscrupulous attacks’ coming from overseas. The statement labelled criticisms ‘typical despicable political manipulation’ and urged outsiders to ‘stop interfering in China’s internal affairs’, distinctive phrasing that confirms Beijing is now running the Hong Kong government’s public relations. National security laws are common worldwide, but Hong Kong’s is unusually strict. The subversion offence goes beyond the more common (but still controversial) offence of sedition by criminalising acts that merely disrupt or undermine the government. Its inchoate ‘conspiracy’ form attaches a harsh criminal penalty to a speculative disruption — and in this case, one that is an ordinary part of democratic politics, where legislative majorities rule. That is not even to mention the national security law’s presumption against bail, cancellation of trial by jury and mechanism to transfer major trials out of Hong Kong and into mainland jurisdiction. Also unusual by international standards is the Hong Kong government’s strong appetite for prosecution, which has included reviving long-abandoned criminal laws. In August 2024, editors of the now-defunct Stand News were convicted under a colonial sedition law that had lain dormant since 1967, after they published interviews and opinion articles on Hong Kong’s political malaise. Hong Kong’s courts continue to apply established judicial methods, like the principle that penal provisions are to be construed narrowly. But the impulse to protect civil and political rights is cooled by strict legislation and the political reality that Beijing has no more patience for regional autonomy. Courts in authoritarian contexts fear to assert themselves lest they be placed under further constraints. Hong Kong’s judiciary has already suffered several blows, including the resignation of foreign judges and the indefensible requirement that judges in national security cases are to be politically selected, which does little to dispel the impression that defendants may not receive a fair trial. The government and the courts make a virtue of long, detailed judgments which often run into the hundreds of pages, but conversations with local journalists suggest that all this judicial ink does little to clarify the safe ground for critical expression, nor does it convince the public that these laws and the decisions made under them are legitimate. The rule of law remains, but in diminished form. Hong Kong is open for business, but not for politics. The Legislative Council has already been reconfigured to prevent pro-democrats from being elected, and the Hong Kong 47 case shows that wider democratic behaviours have been criminalised. Meanwhile, changes to the education system are attempting to reprogram the population to accept political disempowerment. Despite the political persecution playing out in Hong Kong, news cycles are brief and, with no shortage of war and turmoil elsewhere in the world, limited attention is being paid to China’s peripheries. The world might take more notice if Beijing sent in the tanks, as some speculated they might. As it is, Hong Kong’s freedoms are experiencing a less dramatic, but similarly destructive, death by a thousand legalistic cuts.

Ignoring A Leopard’s Spots: The UK, Syria And Courting Dictators ...	Moral evangelists in power preaching about democracy and human rights resemble dowdy advocates of family values. When given a chance, they will wander, leaving their principles aside like unwanted impediments. This was certainly the case regarding various Western powers and their relationships with secular authoritarian powers in North Africa and the Middle East. For a stretch, leaders such as Libya’s Muammar Gaddafi and Iraq’s Saddam Hussein were indispensable in keeping fiery Islamic fundamentalists in check, usually through means of killing, torture and detention. In doing so, sectarian and tribal divisions were patched up, keeping revolution at bay. Business could be undertaken, the corporations of the West kept happy. In time, these same figures fell out of favour in the most expeditious fashion. Gaddafi and Saddam became tabloid villains and cartoon grotesques, worthy of overthrow for their sudden threats to international security and butchering their own people. The idealogues in Washington and Downing Street seized the day with a canned, stupid enthusiasm, placing the grey world upon a Procrustean bed of values. In 2004, Bashar al-Assad, now the former leader of Syria, was not regarded as a despot crying out for overthrow by democracy inebriates. The list of achievements his regime did boast, however, was one of torture and the crushing of dissent, a specialty of his father Hafez’s three-decade rule. Having come to power in 2000, there were suggestions, coming largely from Britain, that a fruitful relationship might be formed with Bashar. UK diplomats were most enthused of all by these Levantine prospects, expressing admiration, according to documents obtained by Declassified UK in 2021, at Bashar’s 'desire for modernisation' and the continuing 'drive against corruption, instigated before his father’s death'. They also swooned at Hafez’s record (the Hama massacre of 1982 is skipped over), one that saw 'improved living standards, especially among the rural population'. A convinced UK Prime Minister Tony Blair, just over a month after the September 11, 2001 attacks on US soil by Al Qaeda operatives, made the first trip by a British leader to Syria. This was followed by a visit by Bashar and his wife, Asmaa, which also involved an audience with the late Queen Elizabeth II and the then Prince of Wales, the current King Charles III. The desire to engage Damascus was further invigorated by problems posed by the dottily catastrophic invasion of Iraq in March 2003 by US-led forces, charged with finding weapons of mass destruction they never did. The swift defeat of Iraq’s military forces in conventional combat, along with Saddam’s hurried exit, did little to stimulate peaceful instincts and turn swords into ploughshares. A fractured Iraq, sundered by faction and sect, became a beacon for jihadist causes. The group Baghdad had been baselessly accused of cavorting with, Al Qaeda, became a genuine threat to US troops and their allies. Foreign fighters, including a certain Islamist Abu Mohammed al-Jolani, now famed as the man who overthrew Assad, hit his strides with them. In 2004, he was, along with associates, on the verge of establishing an Iraqi branch of the organisation. A worried Blair was desperately on the search for allies. Prior to Blair’s journey to Washington to meet President George W. Bush, a briefing note by the government released on December 31, 2024 by the UK National Archives charts the nature of Downing Street’s interest: 'Our primary concern remains the flow of terrorists into Iraq through Syria. We are pushing the Syrians hard to accept a visit from a team of senior officials from the FCO [Foreign and Commonwealth Office], SIS [Secret Intelligence Service, or MI6] and MOD [Ministry of Defence] to address the issue.' Additionally, it was also hoped that 'an intelligence relationship which we hope will bear fruit' might arise. Then British Foreign Secretary Jack Straw sought out the offices of his counterpart Farouk al-Sharaa, writing to him 'urging early cooperation on stemming the flow of terrorists entering Iraq through Syria.' The released note does little to indicate whether the Assad regime provided any such assistance, though some contextual relevance of this point was provided in October 2004 when talks were held between Straw and al-Sharaa. The Syrian foreign minister was particularly keen to swat any suggestions, largely coming from Washington, that Syrian territory was being used as a staging ground for a Sunni insurgency in Iraq led by former senior Ba’ath Party official Mohammed Younis al-Ahmed. While concerns were expressed about recruits crossing into Iraq from Syria, Bashar’s regime, along with those in Egypt and Libya, opened another front of cooperation to Bush and Blair. The regimes in question offered useful sites of collaboration in interrogating and torturing individuals suspected by Western intelligence agencies of being terrorist suspects. The British proved particularly sordid in this regard, bookishly seeking assurances from various governments via 'memoranda of understanding' that they would not, when receiving such suspects, be tortured. It was almost axiomatic that countries with true and tried records of torture were ones happily agreeing to reassurances they had no interest in observing: Jordan in August 2005; Libya in October that year, and Lebanon a month later. A chilling observation by former CIA operative Robert Baer to the New Statesman in May 2004 is worth recalling: 'If you want a serious interrogation, you send a prisoner to Jordan. If you want them to be tortured, you send them to Syria. If you want them to disappear – never to see them again – you send them to Egypt.' In an echo of history, the current UK government has found a new man of transactional worth in Damascus. The great usurper, Jolani, has taken Bashar’s place. His Al Qaeda and Islamic State past is being strategically sanitised, the revolutionary made good and useful. The assurances (that word again) of his Islamist group, Hay’at Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), itself a jihadist organisation of various iterations, including the Nusra Front, have been noted by UK Foreign Secretary David Lammy. These include a commitment to protecting the rights of minorities in Aleppo, Hama and Damascus, and an undertaking 'to co-operating with the international community over monitoring chemical weapons.' Lammy promises that HTS will be judged 'by their actions', their conduct monitored 'closely' in terms of how they treat civilians under their control. But as Albion has shown in the past with bright ease, actions can be discounted when expediency demands it. The spots of a leopard may never change, but they can be conveniently ignored.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWerQvePz50ByYDMAeAtUXbw	2025-01-02T16:36:31-08:00	
The Five Central Asian Countries Remain Shaped By The ‘Soviet Str...	By Zhou Chao Independence is not only about the formal sovereignty of a nation but also about economic structural constraints. In Central Asia, this economic structure is what ANBOUND’s founder Mr. Kung Chan refers to as the 'Soviet structure'. Mr. Chan points out that, even today, and perhaps into the future, this 'Soviet structure' continues to deeply influence the long-term stability and security of the Central Asian region. A significant feature of the Soviet-era economic system was its strong planned nature. In the Central Asian region, Kyrgyzstan is an agricultural country, with agriculture being the backbone of its economy, accounting for 36% of its GDP. Uzbekistan is the world’s sixth-largest cotton producer and the second-largest cotton exporter. According to past data, 28% of Uzbekistan's workforce was in agriculture, which contributed 24% to its GDP. Tajikistan is the poorest country in Central Asia, with a low GDP; in 2006, its GDP was only 80% of what it had been in 1990. The country’s economy is also heavily reliant on agriculture and livestock. Thus, several key countries in the Central Asian region, influenced by the 'Soviet structure', have their economies and productive forces focused on water-intensive agricultural sectors, and this situation has not fundamentally changed. However, since the Soviet era, water scarcity has always been a significant challenge. The five Central Asian countries are located deep in the heart of the Eurasian continent, making it difficult for oceanic moisture to reach the region. As a result, the average annual precipitation in Central Asia is generally below 300 millimeters. In areas near the Aral Sea and the deserts of Turkmenistan, the annual rainfall is even as low as 75-100 millimeters. Only in the mountains and the southern slopes of the Fergana Valley does precipitation increase slightly, reaching 1,000-2,000 millimeters. Along with the low rainfall, evaporation is exceptionally high. For example, the annual evaporation rate from the Amu Darya Delta can reach 1,798 millimeters, which is 21 times the local precipitation. The five Central Asian countries not only face water scarcity, but the distribution of water resources is also extremely uneven. The southeastern part of Central Asia is home to the towering Tian Shan Mountains and the Pamir Plateau, where glaciers and snowfields serve as the most important sources of water. During the spring and summer, the melting ice and snow feed the Syr Darya and Amu Darya rivers, which flow from southeast to northwest through the Turan Plain, passing through deserts and steppes, and eventually drain into the Aral Sea. The Syr Darya, which originates in the Tian Shan Mountains, is 2,212 kilometers long and flows through Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Uzbekistan, and Kazakhstan. Its basin area is 219,000 square kilometers, with an average annual runoff of 33.6 billion cubic meters. The Amu Darya, on the other hand, originates in the Hindu Kush Mountains, stretches 2,540 kilometers, and flows through Tajikistan, Afghanistan, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan. Its basin area is 465,000 square kilometers, with an average annual runoff of 43 billion cubic meters. Due to differences in the origins and lengths of the countries through which they flow, the two major rivers exhibit imbalances in terms of both flow and hydroelectric potential. In terms of flow, 43.4% originates in Tajikistan, 25.1% comes from Kyrgyzstan, 2.1% is from Kazakhstan, 9.6% is from Uzbekistan, and 1.2% comes from Turkmenistan. The upstream countries of Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan contribute 68.5% of the flow. As for hydropower resources, Tajikistan accounts for 70%, and Kyrgyzstan accounts for 21%, totaling 91%. It is clear that both Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan hold a dominant position in terms of both flow and hydroelectric resources. After the dissolution of the Soviet Union, the five Central Asian countries frequently clashed over water resources. Since 1990, Kyrgyzstan and Uzbekistan have fought over land and water in the Osh region, resulting in 300 casualties. In 1992, due to disputes over cross-border rivers between Uzbekistan and Kyrgyzstan, Uzbekistan sent airborne troops to the Kyrgyz border, using force to pressure Kyrgyzstan. In the winter of 2000, Kyrgyzstan had to increase the water discharge from the Toktogul Reservoir to meet its domestic electricity needs after Uzbekistan stopped supplying natural gas. This resulted in large areas of Uzbekistan's cotton fields turning into swamps. In the summer of 2008 and 2009, management failures at the Toktogul Dam caused water shortages in Uzbekistan and Kazakhstan, leading to prolonged electricity shortages in Kyrgyzstan. The ensuing instability in Kyrgyzstan ultimately led to the downfall of then-President Kurmanbek Bakiyev, highlighting the highly political nature of water resource issues. In recent years, disputes over water resources among the five Central Asian countries have been rarely heard of. The five countries have also repeatedly expressed their intention to strengthen coordinated management and use of water resources, as well as to enhance consultation on multilateral platforms such as the United Nations. The situation regarding the water crisis seems to be showing signs of easing. However, researchers at ANBOUND believe that, based on a combination of historical and current factors, the water crisis in Central Asia is far from being truly alleviated. In the current and next 3-5 years, the water crisis will continue to disrupt the stability of the region's situation. First, the basic situation of the water crisis in Central Asia has not undergone any real change. As for the basic water resource situation in the five Central Asian countries, the state of water scarcity and the uneven distribution of water resources has not changed in any meaningful way. This inevitably means that the scarcity of water resources and the competition for them will not see any real easing. Due to economic development, the water crisis in the five Central Asian countries continues to worsen. The natural population growth rate in these countries is high, and the population structure is young, hence there is a strong and constant demand and consumption of natural resources. Rapid population growth means that there is a decline in per capita resource availability, and the shortage situation is becoming increasingly prominent. At the same time, in recent years, these countries have been actively attracting foreign investment, especially from China, to develop manufacturing industries, with plans for factories such as BYD's. The call for building data centers is also growing. Industrial production and data computing both require large amounts of water, which exacerbates the already limited water resources in the five Central Asian countries. Moreover, water pollution in Central Asia has been increasingly severe over the years. Data shows that in 2018 alone, sewage flowing into the Amu Darya River accounted for 35% of its total flow, with an even higher proportion in downstream Uzbekistan. Ecological deterioration means that the already scarce water resources are even less available for human use. Secondly, there has always been a lack of a strong and comprehensive mechanism for coordinating water resources and addressing the water crisis between the five Central Asian countries. During the Soviet era, through the construction of a series of water infrastructure and coordination of electricity resource distribution, the Soviet Union carried out a series of resource allocations and division of labor among the five Central Asian countries, establishing a water resource distribution mechanism between upstream and downstream regions. After the dissolution of the Soviet Union, the original coordination mechanism no longer existed, and water resource allocations, once an internal issue, became an international one. To fill the order vacuum created by the dissolution of the Soviet Union, in October 1991, the five Central Asian countries signed an agreement on cooperation in joint management, use, and protection of interstate sources of water resources. This agreement decided to establish the Interstate Commission for Water Coordination (ICWC), whose main responsibilities included water resource allocation, water body operation and water quality monitoring, and the design and repair of hydraulic facilities in the Syr Darya and Amu Darya river basins. However, the ICWC was unable to intervene in the domestic water policies of the countries, ultimately becoming an organization that only provided water resource information to the countries. Furthermore, the ICWC was not trusted by the other four Central Asian countries, as its personnel was largely from Uzbekistan. The repeated calls by the five Central Asian countries at international forums to address the water crisis in the region also highlighted the weakness of their internal coordination mechanisms. This lack of an effective regional leadership mechanism to address and resolve the water crisis makes it difficult to prevent the issue from fermenting and worsening. At the ICWC conference held at the end of April 2024, after experts from the five countries expressed their views, they have yet to reach a consensus, and an effective coordination mechanism remains elusive. Furthermore, international forces have long been hindering the efforts of the five Central Asian countries to address the water resource crisis. In recent years, international NGOs in Central Asia have become increasingly active, and most of these organizations have Western backgrounds. When it comes to environmental issues related to water resources, multinational NGOs often focus on aspects such as environmental protection and cultural heritage preservation. For instance, the Kyrgyz government planned to exclude the Chatkal River floodplain from the Besh-Aral State Nature Reserve to build a series of hydropower plants. The 'Rivers Without Boundaries' coalition issued a call to the UNESCO World Heritage Committee and the International Union for Conservation of Nature, urging the Kyrgyz authorities to halt the plan. Environmentalists have also expressed concern about the Kyrgyz government's approval of gold mining and infrastructure development in the protected area. In response to Kazakhstan's new reservoir construction plan at the end of last year, relevant NGOs have argued from various perspectives that the plan is not feasible, and have organized petitions from local citizens to interfere with the process. In recent years, the five Central Asian countries have actively sought to attract Western capital, while the influence of international NGOs has steadily grown. The obstructive actions of these NGOs could undermine the efforts of the five countries to tackle the water crisis, further intensifying the situation. In November last year, the Eurasian Development Bank of Kazakhstan released a report stating that the five Central Asian countries will face a severe water crisis by 2028-29. In February this year, some analyses pointed out that due to increased irrigation demand, outdated infrastructure, and decreased water flow, the water consumption in the five Central Asian countries has risen sharply, surpassing the capacity of the main rivers, and the water crisis is imminent. Uzbekistan and Tajikistan even upgraded their river monitoring equipment in mid-February 2024 to closely monitor changes in flow. In this context, the lack of an effective coordination mechanism, coupled with the disruptive actions of international NGOs, will deepen the existing water crisis, potentially leading to regional conflict or even instability. The Soviet planned economy shaped Central Asia's focus on agricultural production, but this 'Soviet structure' has been severely impacted by water scarcity. Although the countries have gained independence in terms of national sovereignty, their economies remain tightly bound to water resource issues. This structure has not been loosened, as all the countries are still reliant on the basins of the Amu Darya and Syr Darya rivers, meaning they remain structurally interconnected. As long as the countries in Central Asia cannot break free from this 'Soviet structure', their independence in terms of national governance will only apply to political power, while their economic integration and shared dependence on water resources will continue to make the region a potential place of conflict and discord. Final analysis conclusion: ANBOUND’s founder Kung Chan pointed out as early as ten years ago that the competition for water resources would become a significant cause of future conflicts. In the five Central Asian countries, where water resources are scarce and unevenly distributed, the combined effects of numerous adverse factors will make this issue highly prominent and will continue to disturb the stability of the regional situation.

Rare Earth In Myanmar: Economic Opportunity Or Environmental Cost...	By Naw Seng Myanmar’s rare earth mining industry sits at the intersection of short-term opportunity, environmental degradation, and geopolitical conflict, shaping the future of local communities and global rare earth supply chains. Key takeaways Some local communities stand to gain economically from rare earth mining, which generates jobs and raises wages for workers, who make roughly twice the national average. Risks associated with these opportunities include potential health risks from dangerous conditions at work, lack of regulatory oversight, and exploitation by foreign corporations. Local communities, the Myanmar military (SAC), and foreign companies, particularly from China, significantly impact the country's rare earth mining sector. Increased conflict and instability could result from the struggle to control these valuable resources, especially between the military and the Kachin Independence Army (KIA). Deforestation, destruction of soil, and water pollution are the major environmental problems brought on by rare earth mining's uncontrolled nature. These effects put communities' long-term health and nearby ecosystems at risk. Sustainable practices and efficient governance are essential to balance economic development and mitigate these issues. 1. Overview of Rare Earth Elements The rare earth elements are divided into two groups, which are Light Rare Earth Elements (LREE-La, Ce, Pr, Nd, Sm) and Heavy Rare Earth Elements (HREE-Eu, Gd, Tb, Dy, Ho, Er, Tm, Yb, Lu, Y). The 17 chemical elements known as rare earth elements (REEs) are essential for many high-tech devices, such as smartphones, electric cars (EVs), and renewable energy sources. Rare earth elements are necessary to produce many goods, especially in the energy and technology industries. As the world moves toward clean energy and cutting-edge technologies, the demand for rare earth elements (REEs) is predicted to circle, possibly increasing three to seven times by 2040. With more than 58% of the world's supply, China controls most of the rare earth market, although Myanmar is making a growing contribution. Additionally, According to Investing News, globally, the producers of Rare earth are in first place, China with 68%, second place, Australia with 10%, Third place, USA 9%, and fourth place, 8% Myanmar, abundance of heavy rare earth element (HREE) deposits has made it a major player in the global rare earth supply chain. The stakeholders in Myanmar's rare earth mining industry—mostly from Kachin State—the economic consequences and the social and environmental effects of this profitable industry are covered in this analysis. 2. The Stakeholders in Myanmar's Rare Earth Mining 2.1. Local Communities Rare earth mining operations in Myanmar directly impact local communities, especially in Kachin State. There are negative impacts, such as social unrest and environmental weakening, even though some locals profit from employment prospects and higher incomes—earning much more than the national average. According to reports, local laborers can make about $600 a month, roughly twice the average salary in Myanmar. However, considering that mining operations are unregulated, the long-term viability of these jobs is uncertain. 2.2. Chinese Companies Chinese businesses are mainly involved in Myanmar's rare earth mining industry. One of the studies contradicts the belief that rare earth mining has decreased in China and increased in Myanmar. It shows a 130% increase in extractive mining area on the Chinese side and a 327% increase in surface mining area extraction on Myanmar's side. According to Voice of America, since 2014, they have been actively engaged in mining activities, making significant investments in areas such as Chipwi, Panwah, and Kanpaitee Townships. Since the Chinese government has long dominated the world market for rare earths, Chinese companies have looked to Myanmar to secure their supply chains as domestic production has been challenged. In 2014, Myanmar exported only $1.5 million, and by 2021, it had reached $ 780 million and found over 27,00 mining pools. ISP Myanmar reported that China imported rare earths from Myanmar, valued at almost $900 million in 2023 alone. 2.3. Myanmar Military and Local Governments The rare earth mining sector and Myanmar's military government, the State Administration Council (SAC), have a complicated relationship. Although the SAC has declared that rare earth mining is not officially allowed, mining operations have continued because the prohibitions have not been effectively enforced. The military uses the money from these operations to support its operations during ongoing conflicts, 'Civil War.' Similarly, Kachin Independence Organization (KIO) spokespersons had mentioned 'strict rules' regarding the Rare Earth mining companies due to the environmental shocks and ecosystems. Even though the KIO Chairman General N-Ban La met with residents, more than 1500 residents in Mai Ja Yang, he said, 'Rare earth mining will stop.' On the other hand, General N-Ban La said that 'the mining had been intended as a way to fund development projects and procure weapons for its war against the military junta.' This is evidenced by the local administration unit from Salingyi under the command of the National Unity Government (NUG), warning businesses like Wanbao Mining to stop working with the SAC. 2.4. International Corporations International companies indirectly profit from Myanmar's rare earth mining, especially those in the automotive and technology industries. Businesses in the West depend more on rare earth elements (REEs) to produce high-tech goods like electric cars as the demand for these minerals rises. According to industry experts, heavy rare earths from Myanmar will almost certainly be used in EV motors, underscoring the interconnection of global supply chains. 3. Economic Implications 3.1. Revenue Generation According to Global Witness, Myanmar's rare earth mining industry has grown to be a significant source of income. By 2021, the nation's rare earth exports to China had hit 780 million, up from just 1.5 million in 2014. Although this revenue infusion is essential for a nation dealing with economic difficulties, it questions whether such practices can be continued. The economic situation is made more difficult by the SAC's confidence in mining profits to finance its military operations. 3.2. Employment Opportunities This briefing paper series from the University of Warwick describes the various job categories in the rare earth mining industry. Men comprise most of the workforce in rare earth mining regions, though women work in some capacities, most notably as chefs and 'water watchers.' Jobs in the local economy, such as operating guesthouses, chopping firewood, and offering transportation services, are brought about by rare earth mining. Additionally, migrant workers generate demand for products frequently imported from China, such as clothing, cigarettes, snacks, alcohol, and toiletries. In isolated locations with high cash flow, some business people open local prostitutes, gambling establishments, and drug stores, all of which are unethical but profitable. However, these positions frequently carry risks, such as the possibility of being taken advantage of by foreign corporations and exposure to dangerous working conditions. Workers might not receive sufficient benefits or protections due to a lack of regulatory oversight. 3.3. Trade Relations with China China, the world's largest producer of rare earth minerals, is the leading destination for Myanmar's exports. Military conflicts and political tensions complicate trade dynamics between China and Myanmar. For example, China's trade restriction caused mining operations in Kachin State to temporarily halt due to the recent KIA taking over many rare earth mining areas. Myanmar's economy is significantly at risk from this dependence on a single market if geopolitical tensions increase. 4. Environmental and Social Impacts 4.1. Environmental Degradation Significant environmental effects result from the extraction of rare earth elements. Rare earth mining (REE) in China and Myanmar has caused environmental degradation and social harm. Despite high global demand, surface mine extents increased by 211% from 2005 to 2020. Land degradation and small-scale mining in areas like Kachin State indicate potential negative impacts on water resources. Mining operations negatively impact local ecosystems and communities. Concerns regarding the effects of mining on nearby communities and wildlife have been voiced by church leaders in Kachin State's Bamaw Diocese, according to a Union of Catholic Asia News report. These activities’ unregulated status worsens environmental decline, which has long-term effects on the area. Although in situ leaching is less expensive, doesn't involve excavation, and doesn't cause deforestation, it can lead to landslides and soil contamination. Comprehensive environmental assessments and regulations are necessary for proper management. 4.2. Social Disruption Concerns regarding drug use and migrant populations have arisen as a result of mining in Kachin State. Rural areas have changed, which has brought jobs. However, the loss of land, environmental harm, and pollution of rivers and streams also present new risks to livelihood. Farmers find it difficult to sell their products near mining sites, and water shortages impact farming livelihoods. Additionally, the Chipwe/Pangwa area is experiencing broader impacts from the rare earth mining boom, including sexual violence, rising drug use, community tensions, armed actors' control, and rural-to-urban migration. The situation has been made more difficult by the involvement of the Kachin Independence Army (KIA) and the Myanmar Military in those areas. The more significant conflict over controlling the region's valuable resources is reflected in the KIA's interest in creating its rare earth mine benefits. This competition may further impact local communities if there is increased violence and instability. 4.3. Health Risks Exposure to toxic substances used in rare earth extraction puts workers' health in the rare earth mining industry at risk. These risks are made worse by the absence of regulation and oversight in Myanmar's mining sector, risking locals' and employees' health and safety. Insufficient information on how mining operations affect health is essential for comprehending and reducing negative consequences. A more substantial evidence base requires evaluating local health data and assisting researchers and CSOs in gaining expertise, which raises questions about the long-term effects on community health. 5. Future Prospects 5.1. Regulatory Challenges Given the continuous political unrest and conflict, the future of rare earth mining in Myanmar is unclear. The SAC's inability to enforce mining laws questions the industry's viability. Furthermore, increased analysis of Myanmar's mining practices may result from international pressure for ethical mineral sourcing. If a company is discovered to be involved in environmental degradation or human rights violations, its reputation may be at risk. 5.2. Global Demand for Rare Earths Myanmar's position with an 8% contribution (4th place) in the supply chain might become even more crucial as the demand for rare earth elements rises globally. However, there are drawbacks since the nation has to balance social and environmental obligations and economic gains. If not handled appropriately, the possibility of more investment in the industry could result in more illegal exploitation. 5.3. Potential for Conflict Potential escalation of civil war in Myanmar may result from the struggle for control of rare earth resources. Increased violence and instability in the area could result in the KIA and SAC trying to take control of mining operations. Establishing a stable and sustainable mining industry needed to reflect on the Environmental Impact assessment plans (EIA), which were made more difficult during the ongoing conflict. Conclusion The rare earth mining operation in Kachin State, Myanmar, presents a complex trap of benefits and challenges. While some local communities, Chinese companies, and international corporations stand to gain economically, environmental and social costs to the local community cannot be overlooked. As the global demand for rare earths grows, Myanmar's role in this sector will be essential. Still, it must navigate the complicated balance between economic development and sustainable practices. The future of rare earth mining in Myanmar will depend on effective governance, responsible corporate practices, and the well-being of local communities.

The Crisis In Iran’s Shared Oil And Gas Fields – OpEd	Due to its geographical position and massive oil and gas reserves, Iran is one of the key energy players in the world. Iran holds 10% of global oil reserves and 18% of the world’s natural gas reserves. Forty-two percent of Iran’s gas reserves are shared with Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Azerbaijan, Turkmenistan, and Qatar, while 14% of its oil reserves are shared with Saudi Arabia, Azerbaijan, the UAE, and Iraq. On September 1, 2022, Iran Think Tanks website wrote, 'In more detail, Iran possesses 30 shared hydrocarbon fields, including both oil and gas, with Iraq, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Qatar, the UAE, Oman, and Turkmenistan. These include 13 fields in the Persian Gulf, two in the Caspian Sea, and 15 on land. South Pars, the world’s largest gas field, and the giant Azadegan oil field are among the prominent fields in this list.' Shared Fields: Lost Opportunities One of Iran’s most important shared fields is the South Pars gas field, which is shared with Qatar. This field, the largest gas field in the world, supplies nearly 70% of Iran’s gas production. The declining pressure in the Iranian section of this field has sounded a serious alarm for the country’s energy future. Meanwhile, Qatar, with extensive investment and the use of advanced technologies, has managed to exploit a significant portion of this field’s capacity. In other shared oil fields, such as the Arash field, the situation is even more dire. Saudi Arabia and Kuwait are rapidly advancing in this field. Similarly, in the West Karun fields, Iraq has reached exploitation by signing major contracts with international companies the peak of shared resource. Bureaucratic Processes and Delays in Issuing Permits One of the key factors contributing to the success of neighboring countries in developing shared fields is active energy diplomacy. The religious fascism ruling Iran has failed to establish bilateral, peaceful, and neighborly relations with neighboring countries. According to Erfan Afazeli, Secretary General of the Federation of the Oil Industry, one of the main reasons for Iran’s backwardness is the complexity of bureaucratic processes and the lengthy time required to issue permits. Energy expert Farzin Savadkouhi believes that Iran’s backwardness in developing shared fields is the direct result of the regime’s incorrect policies. Modern Technologies and Technical Knowledge One of the key factors in the development of shared fields is the use of advanced technologies and technical knowledge. Qatar, through investments in pressure-boosting technologies, has managed the pressure decline in the South Pars field. It should be noted that these delays stem from the policies of the regime. The regime’s priority has always been advancing the drone and missile industry and striving to acquire nuclear weapons. 'Red Alert and Emergency Conditions' The lack of development in shared fields has serious consequences for Iran’s economy. The reduction in oil and gas revenues, aside from directly impacting the national budget, exacerbates economic and social crises. Moreover, the loss of shared resources to neighboring countries weakens Iran’s position in the global energy market. The continuation of the current situation will only harm future generations and squander golden opportunities to exploit Iran’s vast energy resources. On December 23, Jahan-e Sanat news website quoted Savadkouhi as saying, 'There is no doubt that the development of shared fields should be prioritized because the current state of energy in the country is a red alert. We are in an emergency… The more this issue is delayed, the greater the harm to future generations.' Considering the above, is there any solution to save Iran, its national resources, and the fate of future generations other than overthrowing this anti-Iranian regime?	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWerQvePz50ByWWAA2CCqklM	2025-01-02T16:27:48-08:00	
Xi Jinping’s Talk Of ‘Rainbows’ Belies Simmering Public Anger Ove...	By Alan Lu and An Ke Chinese President Xi Jinping welcomed the new year with an upbeat speech to the nation complete with rainbows, claims of economic recovery and concern for the struggles of ordinary Chinese that commentators said belied simmering public anger over his handling of the economy. 'Together, we have experienced winds and rains and seen rainbows,' Xi told the nation in a speech marking the start to 2025 on Wednesday. 'China’s economy has rebounded and is on an upward trajectory ... Splendor adorns our motherland, and starlight graces every home,' he said. Xi’s speech name-checked his signature Belt and Road program and the China-Africa summit, as well as the country’s bid to produce cutting-edge technology in the face of U.S. export bans. China’s huge haul of gold medals at the Paris 2024 Olympics and the 25th anniversary of the handover of Macau were also named as milestones in 2024. But Xi’s speech came as many ordinary people in China are struggling to get by, commentators told RFA. At the end of last year, the Ministry of Civil Affairs ordered cash-strapped governments at every level to issue one-off payouts to the nation’s poorest people over the New Year holiday. 'The notice encourages local governments with conditions to issue relief funds or increase one-time living subsidies in advance on the eve of New Year’s Day and Spring Festival, and ... that temporary price subsidies be issued to minimize the impact of price increases on the basic lives of people in need,' state news agency Xinhua reported. All local governments are required to identify the poorest families, including those who hadn’t met previous criteria for needing state assistance, the report said. 'We need to implement minimum social security, assistance and support for the extremely poor ... and put an end to perfunctory responsibilities, buck-passing, and procrastination,' the ministry said in a recent directive. Focus on internal matters Xi’s speech, while making its now obligatory pledge to ‘unify’ with democratic Taiwan, was more focused on domestic challenges, analysts told RFA Mandarin, and alluded to 'uncertainties in the external environment and pressure of transformation from old growth drivers into new ones.' 'We grow in the wind and rain, and we get stronger through hard times. We must be confident,' Xi said. 'Xi Jinping’s remarks focused more on internal matters, highlighting [China’s] achievements,' Chen Ming-Chi, associate professor at the Center for Contemporary China at Taiwan’s National Tsinghua University told RFA Mandarin. 'Cross-strait issues were mentioned comparatively less.' But he said Xi’s 'red lines' remain the same, citing Beijing’s territorial claim on Taiwan, its rejection of Western-style democracy, Chinese Communist Party rule and China’s 'right to development.' He said Xi will be looking to uphold those key interests throughout the transition to the Trump administration. 'As Trump prepares to take office, China’s approach is to uphold its red lines and define its boundaries while not ruling out the possibility of dialogue,' Chen said. Xi has said he’s ready to work with the Trump administration, but has also warned that both countries stand to 'lose from confrontation,' as Trump announced plans to impose tariffs of at least 60% on Chinese imports. ‘Worst year’ to come Political commentator Lam Fei said people have never felt as hopeless going into a New Year as they do entering 2025. 'On the eve of 2025, the true public mood seems to be one of reluctantly waiting for the worst year in nearly half a century to arrive,' Lam wrote in a Jan. 2 commentary for RFA Cantonese, adding that Xi’s speech appeared to nod to the struggles of ordinary people. 'It seems that [Xi] finally realized the kind of hardship people have been going through in the two years since COVID-19 restrictions were lifted ... so it was hard for him to keep on playing the nationalist card,' Lam said. 'For the general public, merely surviving is becoming their overriding task, and this also sets the social tone for 2025.' 'People no longer expect freedom and democracy, they just want to survive the coming year.' Women have it tougher than anyone, Lam said, citing longer working hours and a greater burden of unpaid labor caring for children and the elderly. 'They also suffer more domestic violence ... as well as widespread gender discrimination in the workplace,' Lam said, adding that millions of women have taken to sex work or similar industries to make ends meet, in a political environment that is extremely hostile to women’s rights. Targeting dissent Veteran political commentator Hu Ping said Xi is unable to tolerate any public criticism of his handling of the economy, with any dissenting comments swiftly deleted from social media. He cited a Dec. 24 Weibo post by top economist Ren Zeping, who quoted a self-critical edict from a Han dynasty emperor from 89 BC, in which the emperor regrets his 'reckless' behavior that had caused the people to suffer. The post was deleted from Ren’s Weibo account after it went viral, with many online comments assuming it was a veiled criticism of Xi’s economic policies. Last month, censors took down a speech that went viral from economist Dong Shanwen, who warned that youth unemployment was tanking the economy, and that official growth figures had hugely underestimated the problem. 'The reason why supreme leaders [of the Chinese Communist Party] are the supreme leaders is that they are regarded as the embodiment of truth and the representative of the correct line,' Hu wrote in a recent commentary for RFA Mandarin. 'This means that any viewpoints and opinions that are different from those of the great leader are wrong by definition.' 'Anyone who insists on different political views is anti-party by definition and incites subversion of state power,' he said. 'If an emperor admits his mistakes, he is still an emperor. But if a Communist Party leader admits his mistakes, he will most likely be a leader no more,' Hu wrote, adding that the admission of mistakes is generally followed by a fall from grace. 'This is why Xi Jinping doesn’t want any talk of imperial edicts of repentance,' Hu said.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWerQvePz50Byfz2oFCvJ_OI	2025-01-02T16:26:25-08:00	
AI In Malaysia’s Education – OpEd	As Malaysia prepares to embrace AI in education, educators need to equip themselves with the skills necessary to navigate this evolving landscape. By doing so, they can become effective advocates for their students and the future of Malaysian education. Integrating artificial intelligence (AI) in education presents significant opportunities and advantages, yet it also introduces challenges and potential drawbacks. With Malaysia moving towards incorporating AI into its educational system, especially following recent remarks by the Minister of Higher Education, Datuk Seri Dr. Zambry Abdul Kadir, it is essential to consider both the benefits and the risks carefully. AI can enhance teaching support, personalize learning, and streamline administrative tasks, but it also raises ethical concerns around bias, misinformation, and the evolving roles of educators. The intersection of AI and education in Malaysia is a dynamic landscape where innovation and caution must coexist, requiring a thoughtful approach to its adoption. Artificial intelligence is a branch of computer science focused on creating machines, systems, or software capable of performing tasks that typically require human intelligence, such as reasoning, problem-solving, learning, perception, understanding natural language, and decision-making. AI aims to simulate or replicate human cognitive functions and adapt to new information and situations. The development of AI has progressed significantly over the decades, from early examples like Theseus, a remote-controlled mouse in the 1950s that could navigate a maze and remember the path it took, to today’s advanced AI applications powered by increased computing power, cloud technology, and access to large datasets. AI is now used in various fields, including conversational agents like ChatGPT, driverless cars, medical diagnostics, and dynamic pricing models, making its potential in education both exciting and concerning. In the context of Malaysian education, AI presents both pros and cons. On the downside, one of the primary concerns is bias. AI systems are only as reliable as the data they are trained on, and if this data contains biases, AI tools could perpetuate stereotypes and social inequalities, which is a significant concern in Malaysia's diverse society. For instance, biased grading algorithms could unfairly impact students based on race, gender, or socioeconomic background. Additionally, AI can generate errors and misinformation, providing inaccurate or outdated content that can mislead students and educators. This necessitates a critical approach to evaluating AI-generated information rather than accepting it at face value. Another drawback is the potential for cheating, as students can easily use AI tools like ChatGPT to generate essays, answer quizzes, or complete assignments, raising concerns about academic integrity. Although AI detectors exist, they can sometimes mistakenly flag original student work as AI-generated, complicating the situation for educators. Moreover, excessive reliance on AI could lead to reduced human interaction in learning, which may result in students feeling isolated. This is particularly problematic in Malaysia, where cultural values emphasize communal learning and personal connections, and such isolation could negatively impact student engagement and retention rates. Lastly, there are concerns about job displacement among educators, as the use of AI raises questions about the future of traditional teaching roles. On the positive side, AI can greatly assist educators by streamlining tasks such as lesson planning and grading, allowing Malaysian teachers to focus more on engaging with students and providing personalized instruction. AI can also offer instant support to students, helping them with difficult concepts when teachers are unavailable, which is particularly valuable in resource-limited Malaysian schools. Furthermore, AI-powered platforms can deliver individualized learning experiences by tailoring content to meet the diverse needs of Malaysian students, including those from different linguistic backgrounds. Enhanced contextual learning is another benefit. AI tutors can simulate interactions with historical or literary figures, providing students with immersive and engaging learning experiences that align with Malaysia’s educational goals of fostering critical thinking and creativity. Additionally, AI can analyze student performance data to provide personalized feedback and support, helping educators identify struggling students and develop effective interventions, thus enhancing the overall learning experience. Balancing the benefits of AI in Malaysian education with its potential drawbacks requires careful planning, ongoing evaluation, and thoughtful consideration of how AI can best be integrated into the educational system. While AI has the potential to empower educators, and accelerate learning, and personalized educational experiences, the risks of bias, misinformation, and student isolation must be addressed to ensure a positive impact on students and teachers alike. As Malaysia prepares to embrace AI in education, it is crucial for educators and policymakers to thoughtfully explore AI’s potential and align its integration with national educational goals and values, equipping educators with the skills necessary to navigate this evolving landscape and become effective advocates for their students and the future of Malaysian education.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfycL7TYHky8kf48SBuAMXq	2025-01-02T08:54:45-08:00	
A New Era: Ukraine Halts Gas Transit, Ending Russia’s Energy Domi...	For more than two decades, Russia has used its energy resources as a tool to exert pressure on Eastern Europe. As part of this strategy, President Vladimir Putin poured billions into the construction of the Nord Stream pipeline to bypass Ukraine. However, Ukraine has now taken a historic step by halting Russia’s ability to export gas directly to Europe, effectively ending Moscow’s long-standing dominance in the European energy market. As of 1 January 2025, gas transit from Russia to Europe via Ukraine has ceased entirely. Ukraine’s Naftogaz declined to renew its transit agreement with Russia’s Gazprom, which had been in place since 2019. This decision marks the end of a five-decade-long energy partnership. Europe’s Energy Transition The collapse of Russia’s dominance in the energy market is the result of Europe’s efforts to diversify its energy sources. However, this shift has increased Europe’s reliance on more expensive US liquefied natural gas (LNG). Rising energy costs, particularly during winter, are expected to place a significant financial burden on European consumers. Faced with the loss of the European market, Moscow is pivoting towards Asia, particularly China. However, these new agreements are far less lucrative than previous sales to Europe. The resulting decline in energy revenues significantly hampers Russia’s ability to fund its military operations, including its ongoing war in Ukraine. The Strategic Role of Ukraine and the US Ukraine’s decision to halt transit will result in a substantial loss of revenue, but it hopes to mitigate this through financial aid from the United States. Critics argue that this move is also part of a broader US strategy to pressure countries like Slovakia and Hungary, which have resisted purchasing American LNG in favour of alternative energy sources. Russia’s weaponisation of energy has ultimately backfired, delivering a significant blow to Moscow’s influence. Europe has taken a critical step toward reducing its dependence on Russian gas, bolstering its energy security. However, this new reality comes with higher costs, which will likely be borne by European citizens. As Europe navigates its energy crisis, supporting vulnerable countries like Moldova and ensuring transparency in energy policies will be crucial for maintaining stability and security across the continent. Türkiye’s Strategic Role With the Nord Stream pipelines decommissioned and Ukrainian routes closed, the Turkish Stream pipeline now serves as the only remaining connection for Russian gas to reach the European Union. This development underscores a recurring theme: Europe’s increasing dependence on Turkey for strategic issues. From immigration to energy, the continent now finds itself reliant on Ankara’s cooperation to address critical challenges.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfycL7TYHky8p69GrtU_Ua2	2025-01-02T08:53:24-08:00	
The Islamic State And Europe – Analysis	By Jason Wahlang The Islamic State Khorasan Province (ISKP), located in Afghanistan, has focused on recruitment and mobilisation from around the region, including Central Asia and the Caucasus. It has also made overtures to supporters in Europe to commit acts of terrorism across the European continent.1 The ISKP has threatened to carry out attacks against events such as music concerts and sports events. This is, however, not a new tactic of the Islamic State, as the group or its various vilayets have attempted attacks on sporting events before. In 2015, it carried out attacks at the Stade De France and the Bataclan Theatre that led to the death of 131 people and injured over 400. Attacks by ISIS members/sympathisers have also occurred in Dortmund, Germany (2017) and in Brussels, Belgium (2023). On 23 August 2024, in the German city of Solingen, three people were killed in a knife attack by an Islamic State supporter. The threat posed by ISKP sympathisers have raised concerns in European countries. Islamic State Motives The IS, across its various vilayets, has drawn motivation from past events or current geopolitical complexities. Its 22 March 2024 attack on the Crocus City Hall in Moscow was attributed to Russia’s past military campaign in Afghanistan, its involvement in Syria and its actions in Chechnya. The IS has called for lone-wolf attacks against Jews and Christians in Europe in response to Israel’s military action in the Gaza Strip.2 It has urged its followers and sympathisers to take 'practical steps to fight the Jews'.3 IS propaganda mouthpieces highlight Western military support for Israel.4 The group uses past incidents such as the Bosnia massacres after the collapse of the Yugoslav state to radicalise individuals. It also glorifies incidents such as the 2015 Paris attacks, to create new narratives and recruit new cadres. IS propaganda outlets justified the killing of two Swedish citizens in Belgium in 2023 on account of the controversial Quran burning incidents in Sweden and Denmark. Pro-ISIS Al-‘Adiyat Foundation, an online media organisation, has targeted the Swedish leadership for allowing Quran burnings and asked people to attack the ‘crusaders’ in Sweden and across Europe.5 Islamic State Propaganda The Islamic State has been actively using social media platforms such as Telegram and other tools to spread its ideology and attempt to radicalise individuals. Different social media outlets, including TikTok and Telegram, along with its own magazines such as the Voice of Khorasan, have been used to spread its message. Since 2022, the Al-Azaim Foundation, which is run by the ISKP, has aggressively ramped up media production in multiple languages, including English.6 The Islamic State has focused on using various local languages to further its propaganda, as evident from multiple propaganda pieces in Tajik, Arabic, Pashtun, Bengali and Hindi which the group uses to connect with individuals living in Europe and the West. The group has published books, magazines and translations of its media material and provided subtitles and voice narration in English to connect with a large international audience.7 This is done mainly through the Voice of Khorasanmagazine, the flagship publication, with the objective being to connect with more radicalised elements in Europe and the West. Apart from the Voice of Khorasan, the Islamic State has also used the I’Iam Foundation to spread propaganda in Europe. Unlike the Al-Azaim Foundation,8 the I’Iam Foundation acts as a dark web channel and sets up crypto wallets to raise funds. It acts as a repository and distribution channel for its propaganda and collects cryptocurrency funds for operations.9 The I’Iam Foundation also acts as an archive of the Islamic State’s past print and video media content in various languages in addition to the regular translations of the newly added materials. The group has posted propaganda in various European languages, such as French and Spanish, to radicalise and further the cause of the IS. Another major outlet used by the Islamic State has been a coalition of independent propaganda collective called the ‘Fursan al-Tarjuma’ (Knights of Translation). The collective created in 2023 has merged 14 Islamic state entities, including Al-Azaim, to produce propaganda in 18 languages, including in English (Halummu) and in French (French Centre Mediatique An-Nur), which are both jihadi translation services used by the Islamic State.10 Government Responses One of Europe’s steadfast reactions to the Islamic State threats has been to raise the terrorism alert level. In August 2023, Sweden raised its threat level to 4, in the aftermath of the Quran burning incidents. The Netherlands also raised its terrorism alert level to 4 in December 2023. Threat level 4 is the second highest response level to a threat situation on a five-tier scale. Spain has maintained a level 4 security alert since the 2015 Paris attacks. Countries such as France and the United Kingdom have deployed additional security personnel to protect large gatherings, including sporting events. The ISKP issued threats against Germany, which hosted the EURO football tournament in the summer of 2024. In recent times, European countries have taken significant actions to counter the threat posed by IS propaganda activities. Germany, Spain, Netherlands, Iceland and the US took down IS propaganda websites in June 2024. Seven radicalised individuals were arrested. The propaganda outlets focused on French, English, Spanish, German and Danish content.11 The European Union has also put counter-terrorism as a priority with member states working closely with one another to prevent terror attacks and ensure safety of the population. These efforts have been prevalent since the terror attacks in Paris in 2015, and extra efforts were made in 2020 post attacks in Germany, France and Austria. With rising terror attacks in Europe since 2023, the member states have upped the ante and ensured there is effective information sharing to track terror activities.12 There is also cooperation with non-EU countries such as the Western Balkans, North Africa, the Sahel region and the Horn of Africa.13 There is increased intelligence collaboration and monitoring the activities of IS-affiliated suspects living in Europe.

The Likely Lads: Why Merz’s New Political Generation Will Decide ...	By Timo Lochocki In February 2025, Germany will hold a federal election—and polls indicate that the conservative Christian Democratic Union (CDU) and its Christian Social Union in Bavaria (CSU) allies are likely to triumph. The change will usher in a generational shift of decision-makers in Berlin, which could see the country turning away from its supranational outlook and instead leading new intergovernmental alliances comprising of north-eastern European state groups, such as Finland, the Netherlands, Poland, and Sweden. It could even stretch to non-European Union states like Norway and the United Kingdom. But this new approach does not so much stem from 69-year-old likely CDU chancellor Friedrich Merz as from the party’s leading figures. They are, by and large, much younger than Merz and view Germany’s role in Europe in a more self-assured way than previous generations of CDU politicians. Should Merz triumph, the new German government will have a mandate to pursue a foreign policy based on integration steps concerning defence spending and debt-sponsored innovation policies. Eventually, Germany will be less likely to aim for the broad supranational alliances it previously developed to ensure no state was left behind. Instead, a ‘two-speed Europe’ is likely—although it come at the cost of alienating Germany’s core EU partner, France. Competing visions Ever since German chancellor Olaf Scholz was sworn in three years ago, his ‘traffic light coalition’—comprising of the Social Democratic Party (SPD), the Greens, and the Free Democratic Party—lacked a clear leading party and had low public approval. In the absence of coherence, his government seemed less inclined to account for the interests of its European partners in foreign policy decisions. For example, the coalition approved a serious domestic economic stimulus package to cushion economic losses due to Russia’s attack on Ukraine. However, it did not consult Germany’s main European partners prior to its implementation, despite the package having a substantial effect on their economies. In contrast, former chancellor Angela Merkel’s ‘grand coalition’— comprising the CDU, the CSU, and the SPD—enjoyed high public approval during her entire tenure. Now election polling shows the CDU and CSU in the lead once again, with between 30% and 32% of the vote. Indeed, as many people support the CDU and CSU as support the parties of the entire former traffic-light coalition, put together. These numbers indicate that the conservatives—with potential chancellor Merz at the helm—will win the election. Those who support ceding national power to the EU’s institutions might read this as a return to the supranationalism Germany exercised under Merkel. But trying to work out Merz’s whole personality requires slotting many seemingly contradictory aspects together; and this complexity in his character traits reflect in his politics. Some commentators argue that Merz is too pro-American and too spirited; too inclined to aim for one big partner like the United States, instead of forging compromises with many smaller European countries. During his interviews in the election campaign, he suggests going into debt to finance the German armed forces; but he also remains a fiscal hawk, a proponent of the famous-infamous 'black zero'—in other words, Merz is advocating for Germany to not take on any debt. This contradictory stance may herald the revival of a conflict with southern European economies over debt mutualisation. It is likely that, under Merz, Germany will instead act more in accordance with its short-term interests, building ad hoc intergovernmental alliances—such as with northern European states—in order to achieve this. Voters casting their CDU ballot in the hope of a more inclusive, supranational German leadership might be disappointed. Generational shift Merz is not the bearer of the coming change: he is part of an older generation of German leaders that is keen on power-sharing with EU institutions in Brussels. They understand modern German foreign policy also in the context of atonement for the atrocities committed during the second world war; Europe based its vindication on ensuring that Germany was denied a too-strong leadership. In turn, this relegated power to Brussels. However, the younger and more conservative Germans are, the less they are willing to link current German foreign policy with the impact of the second world war. This was apparent in the Eurozone crisis in the 2010s, where Germany rejected Greece’s demand that Berlin pay further second world war reparations; it became even clearer during the migration crisis in 2015, as international observers linked Europe’s hospitability towards refugees with the Holocaust. However, in their rhetoric, hardly any German politician made this explicit connection. The likely lads Furthermore, apart from Merz, the CDU’s leaders are generally younger—the powerful leader of North Rhine-Westphalia, Hendrik Wüst, is 49; the informal leader of the CDU’s conservative wing, Jens Spahn, is 44. Politically socialised in a reunified Germany, this new generation refers to their country as a clear leader in both Europe and the EU. Their parents were born after the second world war, while their grandparents—who might retain some connection to the post-war order—have long since passed away. Consequently, they lack the ties which defined previous generations of German leaders. To them, restraint is a foreign policy concept not rooted in personal conviction. Their likely influence on Germany’s future foreign policy is reinforced by changing societal perceptions of the second world war, which is losing clout as the prime defining feature of Germany’s past. Instead, it is increasingly considered as just one aspect, superseded by democratic Germany’s success. Now, among younger and more conservative voters, there is a broad desire to see Germany acting more in its immediate national interest; for instance, by forging alliances with countries outside of the EU. This is also reflected in the rise of the AfD. Wüst alone represents at least one-third of the entire CDU’s political power, through his leadership of its chapter in the German state where it could have the most influence, North Rhine-Westphalia. For his part, Spahn leads the party’s informal but more conservative wing, which flirts with nationalist positions, in particular during migration debates. However, Merz needs the faction on board to decide any major future German foreign policy commitments. Ultimately, both Spahn and Wüst are heavyweights. They have the political credibility and rhetorical power to make the country’s wider conservative-leaning voters either back or oppose changes to German foreign policy. Two-speed Europe Germany pursuing a strategy based largely on its short-term national interests makes ongoing supranational integration unlikely. However, sometimes Germany’s focus on intergovernmentalism for its own interests can lead to greater integration leaps—for example, the 2022 European Sky Shield Initiative, which Germany led, as well as its swift purchasing of anti-aircraft defence systems for Ukraine. In reaction to Russia’s attack on Ukraine, Germany forged these schemes with some European partners—albeit against the will of France, Italy, and Poland. As such, appealing to short-term German political, economic, and security interests will be key for European partners that wish to retain a strong connection with a Merz government. Europeans should now stop expecting Germany to act in response to its action in the second world war, in particular when it comes to restraining its national power. Instead, Germany’s involvement in future European integration will be more entrenched in German realpolitik. The main advantage of a ‘two-speed Europe’ is that it could be a mere pause; a bridge, until the entire EU follows the example of the north-eastern group and makes greater steps towards integration. The arrival of the Schengen Agreement in 1985 is a good example of how this spill-over effect can impact the whole of Europe. The greatest disadvantage, however, lies in its polarising potential. Merz’s future foreign policy strategy is likely to alienate France and Italy, which are two countries already struggling with their currently limited impact on the European theatre. China and Russia could happily boost this spat by fueling nationalism and national inferiority complexes in both countries. * But the EU is well-practiced at internal diplomacy. Its decision-makers should know to embrace the German leadership whenever its policy is backed by implementable proposals that are shared by a large group of states and credible financial investment; and to let it peter out when it is just cheap talk. But the EU must not be offended by daring proposals to avoid exacerbating inner-European frictions. In short, Europeans should only react if a Germany under Merz puts its money where its mouth is and pursues a more self-assured foreign policy to achieve substantial integration leaps—even if this bold approach raises a few eyebrows at first.

China’s Silence Over Russia–North Korea Ties An Opportunity For T...	By Alexander Richter Relations between North Korea and Russia have developed rapidly over the course of 2024. For the first time in two decades, Russian President Vladimir Putin visited North Korea, culminating in a mutual defence pact. As a result of ever-closer relations, North Korea sent 10,000 soldiers to fight alongside Russia against Ukrainian forces in the Kursk region. This alliance has alarmed officials in Washington and Beijing. Sensing China’s unease with the developing security partnership between Russia and North Korea, the US State Department and European officials have urged China to leverage its influence to halt Pyongyang’s deployment of troops. China’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs has so far remained silent and it is unlikely that US diplomatic pressure on China will persuade North Korea to change course. Instead, US diplomatic efforts should be oriented towards building international consensus with other states to delegitimise North Korean activities. To China, North Korea is both a strategic asset and liability. Historically, China and North Korea have maintained a close partnership, signing a mutual defence treaty in 1961 that remains in place today. China accounts for 90 per cent of all trade with North Korea and is an economic lifeline for the Kim regime. But China also views North Korea’s nuclear program as a destabilising force and has supported various efforts to denuclearise the Korean peninsula. Russia and North Korea’s security partnership exacerbates China’s insecurities. As Beijing is forced to share influence over Pyongyang with Moscow, North Korea has more room to improve its nuclear capabilities with Russia as an alternative benefactor of security and trade. North Korea’s deployment of troops will also draw unwanted attention from the United States and Europe — an outcome China seeks to avoid. Despite these frustrations, Beijing highly values its relationships with Russia and North Korea. China has been instrumental in propping up Russia’s defence industrial base and softening the impact of economic sanctions by exporting US$300 million worth of dual-use materials necessary for Russia’s weapons production. Although China has held back on directly supplying lethal aid to Russia to avoid triggering Western secondary sanctions, China does not want to see Russia defeated as it remains a strategic deterrent and partner against US coercion. It will certainly work in Beijing’s favour if North Korean soldiers strengthen Russia’s capability without costing China and risking external economic repercussions. Historically, China’s economic and diplomatic pressure has primarily been geared towardsNorth Korea’s nuclear program. But China refused to condemn North Korea for shelling Yeonpyeong Island, which killed four South Koreans, or for launching a torpedo at a South Korean warship that killed 46. This suggests that China is unlikely to condemn North Korea for the far less destabilising action of sending ground forces into Russia’s Kursk region. China’s lack of action so far indicates that North Korea’s troop deployments and engagement with Ukrainian forces do not place China’s ‘strategic security and core interests’ under threat. China almost certainly does not share the US view that North Korea’s support is ‘a dangerous expansion of the conflict, with serious consequences for European and Indo-Pacific security’. Instead of unilaterally exerting diplomatic pressure, the United States should take this opportunity to shape norms by promoting territorial sovereignty and delegitimising North Korea’s military assistance to Russia. US–China relations are increasingly dominated by a power politics mindset in which China views the United States as bent on maintaining hegemony, resulting in disillusionment with good-faith diplomacy. Building a broad coalition of states to condemn North Korea’s troop deployments can signal to Beijing that the objective of withdrawing North Korean troops reflects the genuine concerns of the international community, rather than a strategy by Washington to advance US interests in Europe or the Indo-Pacific. Part of China’s strategy to shape the global order is to portray itself as a leader and backer of the Global South. As much of the international community opposes Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, the United States has an opportunity to build support among the Global South and co-opt China’s attempts at leadership. But many Global South countries rely on Russia economically and are unlikely to be receptive to US advances in condemning North Korea’s troop deployments in Russia. Some states, such as Niger’s new military junta, receives direct military support from Moscow. Others are economically dependent on Russia and prefer to balance relations, like India, who has expressed discontent yet has not explicitly condemned Russia’s invasion. The United States should identify countries in the Global South that are not susceptible to Russian coercion. It could engage with Southeast Asian countries such as the Philippines, Singapore and Malaysia to coordinate multilateral statements condemning North Korea’s deployment of forces. Southeast Asian states have criticised the United States for making them ‘pick sides’ in the US–China rivalry. But while picking sides in the US–China context could mean losing out on Chinese investment, Russia does not possess this influence in Southeast Asia. Diplomacy alone will not ensure Ukraine can end the war on favourable conditions or prevent North Korea from sending troops to Russia. Still, a concerted diplomatic effort to build international consensus condemning North Korea is essential in creating favourable political conditions to support Ukraine and dissuade other states from backing Russia.

Health For Humans: Behavioral Prescriptions – Analysis	By Nimisha Chadha The 21st century is governed by economic theories built on assumptions that do not always reflect reality. One such assumption is that of the Homo economicus—a perfectly rational individual who always maximises utility. While Rational Choice Theory presumes all individuals to be homo economicus, humans are only partly rational. Behavioural economics, a subset of behavioural science, is an interdisciplinary field that draws from psychology, neuroscience, anthropology, sociology and political science, among others, focusing primarily on decision-making and the impact of psychological factors on economic behaviour. In a complicated, fast-paced world, instinctive decisions using heuristics (rules of thumb) and mental models (shaped by socioeconomic and cultural influences) that have evolved over centuries aid faster decision-making, reducing cognitive load. Simultaneously, however, the lack of deliberate thinking often leads to systematically sub-optimal decisions. By incorporating psychological models in economic frameworks, development challenges can be better addressed. Application of behavioural insights Recognising human limitations, behavioural scientists use 'nudges,' which Nobel laureate Richard Thaler, defines as subtle changes in choice architecture (the context in which individuals make decisions) that alter behaviour predictably without restricting choice or significantly changing economic incentives. In Chicago, painting white stripes progressively closer together on roads approaching sharp turns created an illusion of speeding, reducing accidents by 36 percent. Brazil leveraged soap operas with strong female leads to boost women’s education leading to an 11 percent decline in fertility, demonstrating the potential of small, cost-effective changes to address complex challenges where traditional interventions fail. We are all surrounded by nudges—intentional or unintentional. By leveraging them, policies can be improved for societal benefit. Globally, over 600 behavioural insights or 'nudge' units have been established in governments, businesses, nonprofits, research centres and multilateral organisations, showcasing their growing relevance in policy development. Public health interventions in India In healthcare, the most challenging issues are often behavioural rather than medical, such as inadequate uptake of preventative care and indulging in high-risk behaviours like tobacco consumption—explained by 'Hyperbolic Discounting,' a heuristic, according to which, when choices and results are separated by time, the change in present utility is given more weight compared to the change in future utility. Tailored behaviour-centric policies can serve as a new prescription to current challenges, improving health outcomes. In 2019, NITI Aayog established the Behavioural Insights Unit (BIU) which aims to combat unconducive behaviour through the use of evidence-based solutions, particularly in low-resource settings. Additionally, state BIUs were set up in Bihar and Uttar Pradesh to conduct on-ground research and test behaviourally-designed interventions. Currently, in collaboration with development partners, behavioural insights are being applied to boost the Aspirational Districts Programme in India. While India has made significant progress on the supply side (i.e., health infrastructure), behavioural constraints from the demand side (i.e., consumers) cause hindrances. For example, despite the provision of free iron-folic acid tablets by the government, their uptake remains low because of mental models of misconceptions and mistrust. In Madhya Pradesh, scratchable calendars were used to encourage pregnant women to take tablets daily, revealing a healthy baby upon adherence. Expectant mothers were also provided with a kit comprising the necessities for new mothers to reduce the cognitive load on them. In Maharashtra, glitter was used to illustrate the spread of germs when children shook hands, making the concept more salient for them, resulting in observed positive changes in children’s attitudes towards handwashing. During COVID-19, the gaming application Ludo King was used to promote COVID-appropriate behaviour using elements such as 'mask mode' and digital advertisements, helping change beliefs relating to mask effectiveness for 27.5 percent of the people and increase in intention to engage in safe COVID behaviours. These interventions represent the wide applicability of behavioural insights across age groups and differing socio-economic contexts, showcasing its immense scope in the Indian context. Way forward for India With the establishment of the BIUs in India, which is also the first BIU in South Asia, a dual responsibility falls upon it in introducing evidence-based insights not only within mainstream Indian policies but also contributing to the behavioural science community globally. Despite the implementation of some innovative interventions, gaps persist. In this regard, some recommendations are discussed below. Behavioural interventions, while cost-effective, raise ethical questions about autonomy and consent. Policymakers must ensure transparency to uphold individual autonomy and safeguard choice. Furthermore, interventions should align with societal norms and values to enhance acceptability and avoid marginalising vulnerable groups. Poorly designed choice architectures may have unintended consequences and risk reinforcing stereotypes or exacerbating inequalities, making inclusivity and cultural sensitivity critical. Sustainability is another challenge. Nudges often lose efficacy over time as their novelty wears off. Rigorous monitoring and evaluation are essential to assess long-term impacts and refine interventions. Ethical frameworks and ongoing research can help strike a balance between effectiveness and ethical responsibility. In India, the inclusion of behavioural components in Centrally Sponsored Schemes remains limited according to a 2022 evaluation by the BIU. Additionally, a study by the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), involving 60 nudge units from 23 countries, found that behavioural insights are often applied later in the regulatory process to address gaps. Moving forward, by adopting a proactive approach and incorporating behavioural insights during the initial stages of policy development, biases that undermine policy effectiveness can be better targeted. Within the domain of Indian public health, the centrally funded schemes primarily resort to Information, Education, and Communication strategies with limited fund allocation for behavioural channels. An experiment demonstrated that just providing information for widow pension schemes does not translate to increased applications, and accompanying behaviour change components are key to translating information into action. Moreover, many interventions are restricted to the regional level, indicating a potential for tailored expansion to state and national-level policies. Further, along with Bihar and UP, BIUs should be established in other states as well, considering the cultural diversity in India. Additionally, limited monitoring and evaluation are being conducted. Empirically tested interventions help identify gaps, assess impact in the short and long run, and accordingly scale successful interventions. Furthermore, nudges may not always be ideal, and analyses must be conducted to evaluate their net welfare effect. While the sectors of Health, Women and Child Development and Rural Development have been increasingly utilising behavioural insights, their application in domains such as social inclusion and labour markets is limited, both of which are social determinants of health. Further, nudges alone cannot resolve all issues. An intervention called 'Community-Led Total Sanitation', which aimed to create a defecation-free community in India and Indonesia in 2007 held public group discussions at sites of open defecation as a 'walk of shame' reducing open defecation by 7 percent in Indonesia and 11 percent in India. In India, it was combined with a subsidy for toilet construction, leading to 20 percent more toilets being built compared to Indonesia. This suggests that adequate resources and infrastructure are also essential and behavioural tools must be used as complements rather than substitutes for broader policy measures. The scope on the supply side also extends to physician behaviour as demonstrated by a study indicating improvement in patient safety and quality of care. A significant issue in India is that the community health workers often feel undervalued. Research suggests that recognition through social cues can boost morale and performance, strengthening social connections and triggering a sense of social approval. A 2010 Institut Public de Sondage d'Opinion Secteur survey found that the public acceptability of nudges is higher in less wealthy nations, including India; however, support for outright prohibitions on certain behaviours, such as smoking, is high as well. By fully understanding the level of acceptability and consequent experiences for people, policymakers can better assess the value of such interventions. To ensure that nudges do not adversely impact welfare by misuse through institutions, outlining laws and guidelines may be beneficial, such as the one by the Reserve Bank of India, requiring authentication for recurring transactions, targeting the default setting of automatic payment renewal, based on the status-quo bias, according to which, individuals tend to go for default options. Furthermore, by learning from global best practices, India can consider implementing similar policies. In terms of organ donation, for example, India faces a wide gap between demand and donors. By learning from countries such as Spain and the US, which have been successfully using behavioural tools to increase organ donations, India can combat such challenges. Additionally, the promotion of organ donation by Apple, in collaboration with Donate Life America, increasing registrations by over 6 million in the US, displayed the potential of public-private partnerships. Through global collaborations, the sharing of knowledge products and best practices can be facilitated, further advancing research. In conclusion, while cognitive biases are deeply ingrained, they can be addressed through context-specific behaviour-centric policies. Moving forward, as India continues to integrate behavioural tools to complement traditional policy approaches, it can create a resilient, equitable and effective public health system that addresses challenges for humans, not just homo economicus.

Facets Of Buddhist Life In Ancient Sri Lanka And India – Analysis	British historian William Dalrymple unravels interesting facets of Buddhist society before Christ It is generally accepted that Buddhism was introduced to Sri Lanka in 247 BC when the Indian Buddhist Emperor Asoka (304–232 BC) sent his son Mahinda and daughter Sangamitta to preach the doctrine enunciated by Siddhartha Gautama six centuries earlier. Both Mahinda and Sangamitta were members of the Buddhist order, whose mission was to spread the faith far and wide. . Mahinda's first achievement in Sri Lanka was the conversion of the then King of Anuradhapura, Devanampiya Tissa, in 250 BC. The two had met accidentally in the forests of Mihintale near Anuradhapura, where Devanampiya Tissa was hunting. Upon conversion, the King inspired his subjects to adopt Buddhism. Mahinda's sister, Sanghamitta, followed Mahinda with the sampling of the sacred Bo tree from Buddha Gaya, under which the Buddha got Enlightenment. The sapling was planted in Anuradhapura, giving the converts in the island a focus and a direct link with the Enlightened One. However, according to British historian William Dalrymple, author of The Golden Road, Bloomsbury, London, 2024, Buddhism was by no means new to Sri Lankans when Mahinda came. Dalrymple says that King Devanampiya Tissa was a friend of Emperor Asoka's even before Mahinda's arrival. He would have known about his friend Asoka's faith. The two monarchs were in fact 'intimate friends, united by faithful affection,' Dalrymple says. It was Asoka who had asked Devanampiya Tissa to seek refuge in the Buddha as he himself had done. Further, as a token of friendship and camaraderie, Asoka had sent Devanampiya Tissa appropriate gifts during his re-coronation. Pointing out to very early links between Sri Lanka and Indian Buddhism, www.factsanddetails.com says that from the time of the arrival in Sri Lanka of Prince Vijaya from Bengal (in 543 BC), there had been a constant intercourse between India and Sri Lanka. Some of the South Indian Pandyan families, who came to Sri Lanka, had originally belonged to the Madhyadesa, the Indian region lying between the Himalayas in the North and the Vindhya mountains at the Centre. This vast area was traversed by the Buddha during his wanderings spread over 80 years. The people in these areas came under the sway of the Buddha. At least some of the Pandyas who migrated to Sri Lanka from the Madhyadesa might have been Buddhist and it was likely that they had spoken about Buddhism to the islanders. Some scholars like Hermann Oldenberg and G.P.Malalasekera however, believed that Buddhism came to Sri Lanka from Kalinga (present-day Odisha) through the sea route. Be that as it may, what is undisputed is that it was Mahinda (who became an Arahant later) and his first convert, King Devanampiya Tissa, who gave Sri Lankan Buddhism an organizational structure which helped the faith spread far and wide. The 20th century Sri Lankan monk, Walpola Rahula, even went to the extent of describing Arahant Mahinda as 'the father of Sinhalese literature' because he had translated and written a commentary on the Tripitaka in Sinhala, turning it into a literary language. Mahinda is also credited with introducing the culture of the Mauryan (Asokan) Empire to the island, along with its architecture. Cave Temples King Devanampiya Tissa set up the first monastery and a grand stupa to house the Buddha's relics in his kingdom. And Dalrymple adds that it was at Anuradhapura (the second largest city in South Asia after the Asokan capital of Pataliputra) that the Buddha's teachings were committed to writing on palm-leaf folios. That was in 50 BC. Subsequently, hundreds of monasteries were built across the island. In the Rajagala area of Ampara district, recent excavations revealed 593 archeologically important remains dating back to the First Century BC. According to UNESCO, apart for these, there are about 70 inscriptions in Rajagala, out of them the most important inscription is the one stating that the relics of Arahant Mahinda were enshrined in a stupa in the premises. This is the only inscription in Sri Lanka to identify the presence of Arahant Mahinda in the country. Growth of Monastic Culture The Buddha had urged the monks in the Sangha to go forth in all directions to spread the new doctrine, even saying that no two monks should go in the same direction. But the monks ceased to be peripatetic by the First Century BC, preferring to stay put in the rock caves in Central India, Dalrymple says. Due to this trend, more than 1000 rock cave dwellings came up in the hills overlooking the Western Indian coast for monks to live and preach Buddhism. These caves later grew into monasteries or Viharas. However, these early Viharas were more than meditation centres. They became places for congregational or community worship, the first in the history of Indian religions, Dalrymple says. The focus of attention in a monastery was the Stupa, housing the Buddha's relics. According to Dalrymple, the earliest sculptures in stone in India, were not Hindu, but Buddhist. This is because Vedic Hinduism was either 'aniconic' (without idols) or the Vedic Hindu idols were made of perishable material like wood. It was at the time of Asoka that stone temples with stone carvings came into being in India. And all religions existing in India at that time, adopted stone carving. The symbolism of the various faiths in India were adopted by all religions. Indian religions tended to be syncretic. For example, ferocious lions, snakes and male and female demons figured in the temples of all religions, including Buddhism. The coexistence of human and animal figures represented in Buddhist sculptures reflected the Buddhist view that humans and animals did not belong to different worlds but to one integrated world. In the Buddhist view, both humans and animals have a place in the cycle of birth and rebirth in which one could be an animal in one birth and a human in the next. Monks-Traders Link In India, Buddhist monasteries and the expanding trading community got inextricably linked. Indian traders lavished the monasteries with money and other offerings and the monks gave them blessings as well as an ideology which legitimised trading as a noble profession and not one to be scorned. The other notable aspect of early Buddhism in India, according to Dalrymple, was that Buddhist monks here were not 'ascetic' practicing severe self-abnegation. Given their ties with trading guilds, the monasteries soon became beneficiaries of the growing trade networks of South, South East and Central Asia. The monasteries were not only wealthy due to the donations given by merchants but were lending money for interest, as banks do today, he says. According to Dalrymple, in one of the early Buddhist texts, the Buddha himself had enjoined that 'endowments for the sake of the Buddha, the Dharma and the Community, must be lent on interest and the they required dated, witnessed and written contracts.' Some early Buddhist scriptures even have currency conversion! The Buddha was open to the accumulation of wealth which, in his view, was a 'necessary evil' until Nirvana (total liberation) was achieved. Monks were lauded for their business acumen as well as their wisdom. Buddhists saw wealth as a sign of 'good karma' and poverty as a sign of 'bad karma.' In Buddhist mythology, Bodhisattvas 'saved' merchants form shipwrecks, robbers and 'sea monsters'. A Bodhisattva is a compassionate deity who has reached the highest level of enlightenment but chooses to delay entry into paradise to help others. The First Century BC, during which Buddhism had spread far and wide across continents, was also a 'terrific' period of urban growth and international trading networks. The flourishing Indo-Mediterranean trade brought enormous prosperity to India's Western coast, especially. Contrast with Vedic Hinduism The Buddhist attitude to international trade and money-making was in sharp contrast to Brahminical or caste-ridden Hinduism which frowned on trade, especially international trade across seas, because travel across the seas could mean eating and living with non-Hindus and losing caste as a result. Caste taboos shackled Hindu traders but Buddhist traders were free from these, hence the close link between Buddhism and international trade in ancient India. In the Buddhist India, due to the absence of fuss about 'pollution' all foreigners, Buddhists as well non-Buddhists, were welcomed. And Buddhist monks took the ideas of the Buddha to much of South, South East and East Asia taking both the land and the sea route. Indeed, the Buddhist era in India was a progressive and glorious era, not just for itself but for the whole of Asia.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfycL7TYHky8tRB809r9qnu	2025-01-01T16:13:41-08:00	
Influx Of Foreign Fighters Boosts Islamic State’s Presence In Som...	The Islamic State group has doubled its presence in Somalia in recent months due to an influence of foreign fighters, many of them coming from countries in Africa and the Middle East, according to the United Nations. The U.N. Sanctions Monitoring Team for Somalia estimates IS-Somalia now has 600 to 700 fighters. The expansion has enabled IS to expand its operations and challenge al-Shabaab, which is affiliated with IS’s rival al-Qaida. IS-Somalia has taken over some former al-Shabaab territory in the mountains of northern Somalia. Fighters are coming from Ethiopia, Morocco, Syria, Sudan, Tanzania and Yemen. In most cases, they enter Somalia through its northern Puntland state, which shares a border with Ethiopia and lies 300 kilometers across the Gulf of Aden from Yemen. Islamic State’s Yemen Province, which formed in 20014, has been engaged in Yemen’s civil war since 2015. The expansion of Islamic State in Somalia coincides with that group’s growing prominence among the broader IS organization. IS-Somalia has also become a key source of funding for IS operations in Africa. 'Despite being relatively limited inside Somalia compared to its rival in al-Qaida’s al-Shabaab, the Islamic State’s Somalia Province is punching well above its weight internationally and has become one of the Islamic State’s most important global branches,' analysts Caleb Weiss and Lucas Webber wrote for the Combating Terrorism Center at West Point. IS-Somalia took shape in 2015 after al-Shabaab fighters left that terror group and pledged allegiance to IS. After suffering military defeats by state and federal forces, IS-Somalia made progress expanding its presence in the Bari region of Puntland and attracted foreign fighters, according to the U.N. report. IS-Somalia now has footholds in the Balidhidin, Hunbays, Iskushuban and Qandala districts of the Bari region, according to the U.N. Bari makes up the northern tip of Somalia and lies across the Gulf of Aden from Yemen. Bari is the home of the port city of Bosaso, which both IS-Somalia and al-Shabaab use to import fighters and equipment. Both run extortion operations at the port and, to date, neither has been able to take complete control of the facility. 'IS’s small size and basing in more remote areas will continue to prevent it from exerting the level of physical control necessary to uproot al-Shabaab’s financial networks,' analyst Liam Karr wrote earlier this year for the Institute for the Study of War. In August, Puntland authorities intercepted five kamikaze drones that they believe entered the country through Bosaso, bound for either IS-Somalia or al-Shabaab fighters in southern Somalia. At the time, Puntland authorities described the seizure as a significant blow against terrorists in the country. Bosaso’s port is a major source of funding for IS-Somalia, which generates hundreds of thousands of dollars each month through extortion operations despite continued pressure from al-Shabaab, according to the U.N. IS-Somalia uses some of those resources to support terrorist groups in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Mozambique. As part of its effort to recruit foreign fighters to Somalia, IS’s media arm is creating propaganda videos in the major languages of Ethiopia, such as Amharic and Oromo. Observers say the arrival of more foreign fighters to Somalia is potentially a threat to other countries. Foreign fighters are often hardened ideologues uninterested in the parochial issues that often motivate local militants, according to Karr. Their goal is to launch larger-scale attacks beyond Somalia’s borders. 'An influx of foreign fighters would increase the risk that the group develops external attack aims,' Karr wrote. 'Many foreign fighters have also demonstrated interest in returning to their countries of origin to organize attack plots after being further radicalized in an active conflict theater.'	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfycL7TYHky8nx9MCMotad2	2025-01-01T16:10:44-08:00	
Far From Ignorant: The European Union, Arms Exports And Israel – ...	While international law can, at times, seem an ephemeral creature, vulnerable to manipulation, neglect and outright dismissal, its strictures can surprise. The evolving body of law stripping back the immunity of heads of state for gross human rights abuses, the potential complicity of third parties and powers in aiding such heads of states and their armies, are salutary reminders to politicians and officials the world over: mind your obligations, abide by your duties. Few more onerous obligations exist in this canon than the prevention and punishment of genocide, as outlined by the United Nations Genocide Convention. While claims that it is taking place against the Palestinians as a feature of Israeli policy have been dismissed by the United States and a core group of ministers in the European Union, the human rights fraternity are increasingly convinced: genocide is, and has taken place, in Gaza. Even if genocide were not ultimately found to be taking place by the International Court of Justice (ICJ) in the South African lawsuit against Israel, the broader scope of war crimes and crimes against humanity would be hard to rebut, from policies of deprivation and starvation, to the hefty civilian death toll. This makes the continued arms sales to Israel not only problematic, but potentially criminal in a secondary liability sense. As with the United States, the EU adopts a preferential approach to Israel on the issue of imposing arms embargoes, leaving the matter to individual member states. In no small part is this due to the EU being Israel’s second largest arms supplier after the US. The European External Action Service’s COARM database reveals that between 2018 and 2022, EU member states sold arms to Israel to the value of 1.75 billion euros. As reported in Al Jazeera, certain states – Italy, the Netherlands, Spain, and Belgium’s Wallonia – have made chirpy announcements on suspending arms transfers to Israel, though these have been tardily followed up. In any case, the measures are only temporary or partial in nature, a form of decorative diplomacy. While the European Union dithers and stalls on responding to this subject, despite the ICJ’s interim rulings that there was a risk of irreparable harm to the Palestinian right to be protected from genocide, bureaucrats have been busy. The EU special representative for human rights, Olof Skoog, has been particularly prominent in this regard in penning a harsh assessment of the conflict for EU ministers ahead of their November 18 council meeting. This was intended to inform debate about a proposal by the then EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell on whether political dialogue should be suspended with Israel. Borrell had hoped such a decision would bring pressure to bear on Israel to adhere to international law. The move encountered resistance, with Germany promising ahead of time it would oppose it. Little surprise, then, that the ministers eventually opposed Borrell’s suggestion, along with any move to ban arms sales to Israel. Skoog’s assessment, obtained by The Intercept, runs the whole gamut of evidence on the warring conduct by Israel, Hamas, and Hezbollah since October 7, 2023 when the Hamas-orchestrated assault killing of 1,200 people precipitated the current, unceasing phase of conflict. The origins of the paper are found in a request made in February 2024 by Spain and Ireland to the European Commission on whether Israel’s military actions in Gaza violated the human rights provisions of the EU-Israel Association Agreement. In October, the Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez was still waiting for a response. 'The European Commission must respond once and for all to the formal request by two European countries to suspend the association agreement with Israel if it is found, as everything suggests, that human rights are being violated,' the Spanish PM told an event held in Barcelona. With the European Commission refusing to entertain the matter, Skoog was commissioned by the European External Action Service to conduct a review. This led to an initial assessment in July, one that was subsequently updated in November. Skoog takes Hamas and Hezbollah to task but lashes the Israeli Defense Forces for failing to adopt a sterner, more discriminating position between civilian and military objects. 'Given the high level of civilian casualties and human suffering, allegations focus mainly on how duty bearers, including the Israeli Defense Forces (IDF), have seemingly failed to distinguish between civilians and combatants and to take all feasible precautions to protect civilians and civilian objects against the effects of the attacks, in violation of the fundamental principles of IHL [international humanitarian law].' As with a burgeoning number of reports, legal submissions and the arrest warrants issued by the International Criminal Court for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and former Defence Minister Yoav Gallant, the 'dehumanizing language' used by Israeli officials vis-à-vis Palestinians draws special attention. 'Incitement to discrimination, hostility or violence – such as that made in statements by Israeli officials – constitutes a serious violation of international human rights law and may amount to the international crime of incitement to genocide,' Skoog notes. On the subject of arms sales, the suggestion is made that export licenses be denied in cases where 'there is a clear risk that the military technology or equipment to be exported might be used in the commission of serious violations of international humanitarian law.' From the standpoint of culpability, this is significant. As Yanis Varoufakis, former Greek finance minister and secretary-general of the Democracy in Europe Movement 2025 reasons, EU ministerial ignorance can hardly be pleaded in this case were the ICC to find Netanyahu and Gallant guilty of violating International Humanitarian Law. 'The world now knows that they knew they were in breach of international law because they were explicitly told so by the EU’s own special representative on human rights. History will judge them harshly. And perhaps so will the ICC.' Lawyers across Europe are already drafting their briefs in anticipation, even as reputations get shredded and people continue dying.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfycL7TYHky8vhwhj6GpDnW	2025-01-01T16:09:06-08:00	
Arnold Rüütel, ‘A Washington For Estonia,’ Dead At Age Of 96 – Op...	At the age of 96, Arnold Rüütel passed away on Tuesday. He served as a senior official in the Estonian SSR during the occupation and later, in a variety of roles, including president of the Estonian Republic, played a key role in helping his country recover its rightful place in the world as part of the West. In reporting his death, Postimees noted that he had 'not a few supporters and ill-wishers,' with many in both camps focusing only on one aspect of his public activities and ignoring the others (rus.postimees.ee/8161935/bolshaya-galereya-umer-eks-prezident-arnold-ryuytel-tyazheloves-i-dolgozhitel-estonskoy-politiki). Many Estonians, especially in the emigration, could never forgive him for statements issued in his name attacking them and defending the Soviet Union; while many others, never forgave him for his role in ending the occupation of Estonia and leading his country into NATO and the European Union. That divide has prevented many from seeing him as a man in full. But that is changing and I believe will continue to change. Almost a decade ago, I was asked to write a comment about his life for a book Peeter Ernits put together (Viimane Rüütel (Tallinn, 2017). I entitled my submission 'A Washington for Estonia.' In it, I pointed out that it typically takes three kinds of people to make a successful national revolution, the philosophers who explain why it is necessary, the firebrands who lead the people to make it possible, and the members of the ancien regime who recognize the justice of the pursuit of revolutionary goals and make their institutionalization possible. Not surprisingly, in the US and almost all other cases, the philosophers and the firebrands get the better press at least initially. Their stories are more unambiguous and easier to tell, and they dominate the initial histories of the revolution. But over time, it becomes obvious that it is often officials who rose in the old regime but changed sides who are the more important. Arnold Rüütel was neither a philosopher nor a firebrand and so he has often been more criticized and less appreciated that those who were one or the other or even in some cases both. But with time, his role as a bridge who made the passage from the old to the new possible is being recognized. I believe that trend will continue. For more than 30 years, I have been proud to count myself his admirer and friend. I will miss him; and I believe that as time passes, ever more people will come to recognize just how enormous his contribution was however contradictory it has sometimes been presented.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfycL7TYHky8ubfkhDygXIg	2025-01-01T16:06:22-08:00	
Hold Ukraine Accountable For Corruption, Misspent Aid – OpEd	The shame of American military assistance in Iraq and Afghanistan is that while our troops and their local allies were fighting bravely, the leaders of our so-called allies were getting rich. We have seen something even worse in Ukraine: While Ukrainian military personnel and civilians fight valiantly in a fierce contest for independence, Ukrainian leaders have gotten fabulously wealthy. The American shame is that the U.S. heedlessly expanded NATO to the borders of Russia, and then, after Russia pushed back, enabled and funded the cynical maladministration by the Zelensky government, which will go down in history as one of the greatest examples of waste and theft of Western aid. What’s more, Ukraine’s casualties have permanently altered the country’s demography and will limit its prospects for economic recovery, leaving the country 'wrecked' and the scene of a future 'frozen conflict,' per Professor John Mearsheimer. The sheer scale of waste and fraud will only be revealed by independent investigations after the war’s end. The Zelensky government uses the war to quash media stories that dare to question Ukrainian spending of our taxpayer dollars. Still, many brave Ukrainian journalists and officers have exposed scandals of overpricing, shoddy equipment and embezzlement at the highest levels of Volodymyr Zelensky’s administration. They have risked being labeled as Russian saboteurs or sent to certain death at the front lines for reporting the truth. The real crime of the Zelensky administration, however, began in late 2023. In a November 2023 article for The Economist, General Valerii Zaluzhnyi, then commander in chief of Ukraine’s Armed Forces, said that without a substantial technological edge, Ukraine would face a stalemate. He said traditional attritional strategies were insufficient to overcome the numerical advantage of the Russian forces. Zaluzhnyi emphasized several key points: Stalemate on the front lines: The war had reached a deadlock, with both Ukrainian and Russian forces locked into positions reminiscent of World War I trench warfare. He noted, 'There will most likely be no deep and beautiful breakthrough.' Need for technological advancement: To break this stalemate, Ukraine required significant technological innovations. He highlighted the importance of drones, electronic warfare, anti-artillery capabilities, demining equipment and robotics. Zaluzhnyi stated, 'In order for us to break this deadlock, we need something new—like gunpowder once was, which the Chinese invented and which we are still using to kill each other.' Limitations of attritional strategies: Zaluzhnyi acknowledged Ukraine had miscalculated by assuming that inflicting heavy casualties on Russian forces would stop them. He noted that Russia had suffered at least 150,000 dead yet continued its aggression, indicating that such losses did not deter Russian leadership. In other words, it was time to focus on diplomacy. But Zelensky had no interest in diplomacy, because ending the war would mean ending the state of emergency, new elections and a change in the structure of international assistance. In his own political interest, he ousted Zaluzhnyi and continued a war he was warned would waste lives and money without result. In the end, Zaluzhnyi was too optimistic; lives and money were indeed wasted, but they did not achieve a stalemate. Russia regrouped and gained territory. Zaluzhnyi was not the only one warning about dynamics on the battlefield. In April 2024, the leadership of Ukraine’s military intelligence participated in a series of roundtable discussions at Washington think tanks and policymakers. A former American diplomat familiar with the visit told this author, 'They expressed their reservations about continuing full scale conventional warfare. They were concerned that Ukraine had lost momentum and would be overwhelmed. They advocated instead for increased asymmetric warfare inside Russia to gain an upper hand in negotiations to end the war.' The result of this engagement was that the chief of military of intelligence, Kyril Budanov, was muzzled by Team Zelensky in a series of media attacks in pro-government websites. His key deputies were fired without his consent, weakening his agency. The waste and corruption only spread from there. Czech Prime Minister Petr Fiala championed a European munitions initiative that wasted billions more dollars. Zelensky and his ambassador to the Czech Republic infamously praised Fiala even as the Czech munitions initiative procured overpriced and faulty shells that resulted in the maiming of Ukrainian soldiers and destruction of battlefield equipment. More scandals arose, involving Ukrainian Defense Minister Rustam Umerovand Ministry of Defense procurement official Oleksii Petrov buying faulty equipment for astronomical prices. These have been extensively reported by Ukrainian media. While Zelensky prevented his military commanders from openly speaking the truth about Ukraine’s chances to break through the stalemate, his loyalists at the Defense Ministry misspent record amounts of money in record time. They also tapped into assistance in kind, another lucrative source of enrichment. And in a case where corruption has merged with treason, weapons sent to Ukraine for its defense were diverted to Nigeria’s Lake Chad region, 'bolstering the strength of terrorist groups.' There are also unconfirmed reports that weapons donated to Ukraine have wound up in the hands of criminal gangs in Sweden. Zelensky and his administration should answer to the Ukrainian people for lives and territory lost because he silenced his military commanders. And they should also be held accountable by the U.S. Congress for the lost billions of American taxpayer dollars. (Total aid from the U.S. and its Western allies totals $260 billion.) It’s past time Washington stopped letting corrupt foreign officials steal American aid.

Imperial Hubris (And Its Consequences) In Syria – OpEd	The Syria story, it seems, is not so simple as ‘President Assad fell’ and the ‘technocratic Salafists’ rose to power. At one level, the collapse was predictable. Assad was known to have been influenced by Egypt and UAE for some years past. They had been urging him to break with Iran and Russia, and to shift to the West. For some 3-4 years he had been incrementally signalling and implementing such a move. Iran especially faced increasing obstacles over operational matters in which they were co-operating with Syrian forces. His shift was meant as a message to Iran. The financial situation of Syria – after years of U.S. Caesar sanctions, plus the loss of all agricultural and energy revenues seized by the U.S. in occupied north-east Syria – was catastrophic. Syria simply had no economy. No doubt, reaching out to Israel and Washington was presented to Assad as the only practical exit to his dilemma. ‘Normalisation’ could lead to the lifting of sanctions, they implored him. And Assad, according tothose in touch with him, (even at the eleventh hour before the HTS ‘invasion’) was believing that Arab States close to Washington would have opted for his continued leadership, rather than see Syria fall prey to Salafist zealots. To be clear: Moscow and Tehran had warned Assad that his army (as a whole) was too fragile, too underpaid, and too penetrated and bribed by foreign intelligence services, to be expected to defend the state effectively. Assad also was warned repeatedly about the threat from Idlib jihadists planning to take Aleppo, but the President not only ignored the warnings – he rebutted them. He was offered a very large external military force not once, but twice, even in ‘the last days’, as Jolani’s militia were advancing. Assad refused. 'We are strong', he told an interlocutor on the first occasion; yet shortly afterwards, on a second occasion, he admitted: 'My army is running away'. Assad was not abandoned by his allies. It was by then too late. He had flip-flopped once too often. Two of the principal actors (Russia and Iran) were frustrated and rendered unable to help – absent Assad’s consent. A Syrian who knew the Assad family, and who spoke with the President at some length just prior the Aleppo invasion, had found him surprisingly sanguine and unflustered – assuring his friend that there were forces enough (2,500) in Aleppo to deal with Jolani’s threats, and hinting that President Sissi might be ready to step in with aid for Syria. (Egypt of course feared Muslim Brotherhood Islamists taking power in a former secular Ba’athist state). Ibrahim Al-Amine, editor of Al-Akhbar, noted a similar perception by Assad: 'Assad seemed to have become more confident that Abu Dhabi was capable of resolving his problem with the Americans and some Europeans, and he heard a lot about economic temptations if he agreed to the strategy of exiting the alliance with the resistance forces. One of Assad’s workers, who stayed with him until the last hours before he left Damascus, says that the man was still hoping for something big to happen to stop the armed factions’ attack. He believed that 'the Arab and international community' would prefer that he remain in power, rather than Islamists take over the administration of Syria'. Yet, even as the Jolani forces were on the M5 highway linking to Damascus, the wider Assad family and key officials were making no efforts to prepare for a departure, or to warn close friends to think about such contingencies, the interlocutor said. Even as Assad was heading to Hmeimin en route to Moscow, no advice to ‘get out’ was sent to friends. The latter said that they did not know after Assad’s silent departure to Moscow who exactly, or when, ordered the Syria army to stand down and to prepare for transition. Assad briefly visited Moscow on 28 November – a day after the HTS attacks in Aleppo province and their swift advance south (and a day after the ceasefire in Lebanon). The Russian authorities have said nothing about the content of the President’s meetings in Moscow, and the Assad family said that the President had returned tight-lipped from Russia, too. Subsequently, Assad departed finally to Moscow (either on 7 December, after despatching a private plane on multiple flights to Dubai, or on 8 December) – again telling virtually nobody in his immediate and family circle that he was departing for good. What caused this out-of-character mindset? No one knows; but family members have speculated that Bashar Al-Assad had been seriously disorientated emotionally by the grave illness of his wife, Asma, to whom he is devoted. Put frankly, whilst the three main players could see clearly the direction events were heading (the fragility of the state was no surprise), nevertheless, Assad’s denial mindset and the consequent speed of the military dénouement was the surprise. That was the true ‘black swan’. What triggered events? Erdogan has for several years demanded that Assad firstly negotiate with the ‘legitimate Syrian opposition’; secondly that he re-draft the Constitution; and thirdly that he meet face-to-face with President Erdogan (something Assad consistently refused to do). All three powers pressed Assad to negotiate with the ‘opposition’, but he would not, and nor would he meet with Erdogan. (Both loathe each other). Frustration on these counts was high. Erdogan now indisputably ‘owns’ ‘former-Syria’. Ottoman irredentist sentiment is ecstatic and demanding more Turkish revanchism. Others – the more secular city dwellers of Turkey however – are less enthused by the display of Turkish religious nationalism. Erdogan however, may well be (or may soon be) experiencing buyer’s remorse: Yes, Turkey stands tall as Syria’s new landlord, but he is now ‘the responsible’ for what happens next. (HTS is plainly exposed as a Turkish proxy). Minorities are being killed; brutal sectarian executions are accelerating; sectarianism becoming more extreme. There is still no Syrian economy in sight; no revenues, and no fuel for the gasoline refinery (previously supplied by Iran). Erdogan’s espousal of a re-branded and westernised al-Qaeda always risked proving to be paper-thin (as the sectarian killings are cruelly demonstrating). Will Jolani manage to impose his al-Qaeda-in-a suit makeover across his heterodox followers? Abu Ali al-Anbari, al-Baghdadi’s top aide at the time (2012-2013), gave this scathing appraisal of Jolani: 'He is a cunning person; two-faced; adores himself; does not care about his soldiers; is willing to sacrifice their blood in order to make a name for himself in the media – glows when he hears his name mentioned on satellite channels'. In any event, one clear outcome is that Erdogan’s ploy has re-ignited formerly (and mostly) quiescent Sunni sectarianism and Ottoman imperialism. The consequences will be many and will ripple across the region. Egypt is already anxious – as is King Abdullah in Jordan. Many Israelis see themselves as the ‘winners’ from the Syrian up-ending – since the Axis of Resistance supply line has been severed at its middle. Israeli security chief Ronan Bar was most likely briefed by Ibrahim Kalin, Turkish Head of Intelligence, when they met in Istanbul on 19 November on the expected Idlib invasion – in time for Israel to institute the Lebanon ceasefire, and to obstruct the passage of Hizbullah forces into Syria(Israel immediately bombed all the border crossings between Lebanon and Syria). Nonetheless Israelis may discover that a re-kindled Salafist zealotry is not their friend – nor ultimately to their benefit. Iran will sign the long-awaited defence accord with Russia on 17 January 2025. Russia will concentrate on the war in Ukraine and stay aloof from the Middle East quagmire – to focus on the slow global restructuring that has been happening, and on the Big Picture attempt to have Trump in due course come to acknowledge Asian ‘Heartland’ and BRICS security interests, and to agree some frontier to the Rimland (Atlanticist) security sphere, such that cooperation on issues of global strategic stability and European security can be agreed.

How The McKinley Tariff Almost Destroyed The Republican Party – O...	By Thomas J. DiLorenzo President Trump’s first major speech on economic policy in 2017 was delivered in Lexington, Kentucky near the home of Henry Clay, the early nineteenth century leader of the Whig party and the epitome of a political tool of the moneyed plutocracy of the day. Clay championed Alexander Hamilton’s 'American System' of high protectionist tariff taxes that would plunder American consumers for the benefit of politically-connected businesses; corporate welfare for road- and canal-building and railroad corporations; and a national bank controlled by politicians who would use the bank to corrupt politics and solidify its supporters’ political power. It was really the rotten, corrupt, British mercantilist system of the eighteenth century against which the American Revolution was fought to secede from. As Edgar Lee Masters once wrote, Clay’s Whig party had no platform for its platform was 'political plunder and nothing else.' If your platform is indeed political plunder it is a good idea to keep quiet about it and don’t broadcast it. Proclaim to be selflessly serving all of humanity instead. To Hamilton and Clay such a system is not so bad if one is on the money-collecting end of the plunderers rather than the plundered, as the American colonists were. Lo and behold, President Trump has discovered a new political hero to idolize: President (1897-1901) William McKinley of Ohio whose election was orchestrated by the wealthiest man in Ohio (and the U.S.), John D. Rockefeller, who ran the Standard Oil Company out of his Cleveland home. President Trump’s new hero is his new hero because he was known in the U.S. Congress before being elected president as the most rabid Republican party protectionist in a party that was founded on the principle of protectionism (and of corporate welfare and a national bank) in the mid 1850s. The 1890 McKinley tariff was named after Representative William McKinley because of his notoriety as a tool of the Northern manufacturing plutocracy. It created the highest average tariff rate in U.S. history up to that point and targeted such items as wool and tin with especially high tariff taxes, some exceeding 100 percent. It caused such a spike in the prices of such items that in the next election the Republican party was wiped out, losing both houses of Congress and the White House, with the Democrat party having a 2-1 advantage in the House. McKinley himself was defeated and was installed by his Rockefeller handlers as the governor of Ohio. The Rockefeller cabal got McKinley elected president in 1896. One of his first 'accomplishments' in 1897 was to the political disaster of the McKinley Tariff Tax by signing the Dingley Tariff Tax which created another highest average tariff rate in history. McKinley was also a notorious imperialist, waging an imperialistic war against Spain (the Spanish-American War) during which the U.S. government conquered Cuba, Puerto Rico, and the Philippines, leading the great William Graham Sumner to author his famous article, 'The Conquest of the United States by Spain.' The Spanish-American War, Sumner wrote, turned the U.S. into an imperialist power, just like the thoroughly corrupt and bankrupted Spanish empire. (All empires, by the way, view their populations as good for two things: as taxpayers and cannon fodder in the empire’s wars). As General Smedley Butler wrote, 'war is a racket,' and this war was fought for the benefit of various American politically-connected corporate racketeers. This was all achieved under the stewardship of President-elect Trump’s new heartthrob, William McKinley. Just recently the president-elect pledged to change the name of Mount Denali in Alaska back to Mount McKinley in honor of the hyper protectionist and imperialist who is his role model of the day. The majority of Alaskans are reportedly against this, preferring a native American Indian name for the tallest mountain in America to a crooked Rockefeller-connected Ohio political hack. McKinley was assassinated in 1901 and was succeeded by his mentally disturbed vice president, Theodore Roosevelt. About the author: Thomas DiLorenzo is president of the Mises Institute.

In New Year Message, Zelenskyy Puts Hopes In Continued US Support	(EurActiv) -- Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said late on Tuesday (31 December) that no one would give peace to his country as a gift, but he believed the United States would stand alongside Kyiv as it fights to stop Russia's 34-month invasion. Zelenskyy, in a slick 21-minute New Year video greeting to his compatriots, also said only a strong Ukraine could secure peace and earn worldwide respect. 'We know that peace will not be given to us as a gift, but we will do everything to stop Russia and end the war, something each of us desires,' Zelenskyy said against a backdrop of the blue-and-yellow national flag, battlefield scenes and pictures of children. He recalled conversations with outgoing US President Joe Biden, President-elect Donald Trump and 'everyone who supports us in the United States'. 'I have no doubt that the new American president wants and will be able to bring peace and end (Russian President Vladimir) Putin's aggression,' Zelenskyy said. 'He understands that the former is impossible without the latter. Because this is not a street brawl where the two sides need to be pacified. This is a full-scale aggression by a deranged state against a civilised one. And I believe that, together with the United States, we are capable of the strength to force Russia into a just peace.' Russia, Zelenskyy said, was not to be trusted either in battle or in talks. 'If today Russia shakes your hand, it doesn't mean that tomorrow the same hand will not start killing you,' he said. 'Russians fear those who are free. What they don't understand. They fear freedom.' Biden's administration has provided by far the most military support for Ukraine among Western nations since the February 2022 full-scale invasion. Ukraine has been wary of Trump's criticism of aid to Kyiv and his pledge, during the US election campaign, to bring a quick end to the war, but Zelenskyy has expressed optimism about ensuring continuing US support. Ukraine has endured a difficult year, with Russian forces taking village after village in a quicker advance on the eastern front than since the beginning of the invasion. In recent months, Zelenskyy has said that any settlement to the conflict is predicated on receiving security guarantees from Western nations and Kyiv securing an invitation to join the NATO alliance, a notion Russia rejects out of hand. In his greeting, Zelenskyy said that in the past year, Ukraine had launched an incursion into southern Russia's Kursk region, staged long-range drone strikes against distant Russian targets and developed domestically produced drones and other weapons. 'Every day in the coming year, I and all of us must fight so that Ukraine can be strong enough,' he said. 'Only such a Ukraine is respected and heard - both on the battlefield and at the negotiating table.' Russia launches New Year drone strike Russia launched a drone strike on the Ukrainian capital Kyiv early on Wednesday, wounding at least three people and damaging buildings in two districts, city officials said. Explosions boomed across the morning sky shortly after Ukraine's air force warned of drones approaching the city. Mayor Vitali Klitschko said air-defences were repelling an enemy attack, and that two floors of a residential building had been partially destroyed in the strike. Debris had also damaged a non-residential premise in another neighbourhood, he said. Russia has carried out regular air strikes on Ukrainian towns and cities far behind the front line of its nearly three-year-old invasion.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfycL7TYHky8pzOW6M4lkqH	2025-01-01T15:55:24-08:00	
Polio Poppycock – OpEd	Polio.' That is a common go-to word for trying to silence people expressing any concern about any vaccine. The emotion-centered tactic relies on people having great fear of polio and great reverence for the polio vaccine commonly understood to have vanquished the disease. Voilà, all vaccines are wonderous medical tools, and anyone who questions them must want children to be struck by the horror of polio. It is poppycock. But, it can be persuasive poppycock, so it is brought up in vaccine discussion. Children’s Health Defense staff posted this week a succinct answer to some of the polio and polio vaccine hype trotted out routinely to silence people challenging the party line regarding any of the many shots pushed by government, media, pharmaceutical companies, and medical establishment. The article has four sections. Each sets things straight regarding an aspect of polio or polio vaccines. Here are the sections’ headings to give an idea of the kind of information, likely surprising for a majority of Americans, provided in the article: Polio vaccines used in U.S. don’t prevent infection or transmission. Global polio vaccine campaigns can lead to ‘vaccine-derived’ polio outbreaks. Risk of paralysis from poliovirus infection is roughly 0.001%. All polio vaccines used today are genetically modified. The article also challenges an assertion in a recent Fortune article that '20 million people who would’ve otherwise been paralyzed by polio are walking today' because of polio vaccinations of children since 1988. That number, the article explains — even using data from the polio vaccinations backing World Health Organization (WHO) — is exaggerated well over 200-fold. During the coronavirus scare and associated crackdowns, many Americans became aware of the deception of repeated assertions that everyone should take the 'safe and effective' coronavirus shots. But, the deception goes further than a new experimental coronavirus 'vaccine.' All the lauded vaccine shots, including for polio, should be looked at fresh. Skepticism is justified, and its broad application can help build an improved understanding among the public about the risks and benefits of different shots, whether shots long in use like polio shots or potentially soon to be rushed into distribution shots such as for bird flu or another new disease du jour.

Pakistani Shi’ite, Sunni Leaders Reach Peace Deal To End Regional...	(RFE/RL) -- Shi’ite and Sunni leaders in northwestern Pakistan on January 1 signed a peace agreement to end tensions and establish a permanent cease-fire after clashes believed to be linked to a tribal land dispute killed more than 100 people in the past 90 days. A traditional gathering of ethnic, religious, and political leaders known as a Loya Jirga concluded in the regional capital, Quetta, after the parties signed the agreement. The meeting had taken place over the previous three weeks with the support of the provincial government. The agreement comes after an attack on November 21, 2024, on a passenger convoy in the Kurram district killed around 46 Shi’ites and four Sunnis. Fighting between Shi’ite and Sunni groups subsequently broke out, killing around 130 people and injuring more than 200, including the initial attack on November 21. An earlier attack on October 12, 2024, initially injured three people traveling to Kunj Alizu mountain before the gunmen attacked a convoy of passenger vehicles in the same area, killing 17. Malik Abdul Wali Khan, a participant in the Loya Jirga, told RFE/RL on January 1 that Shi’ite leaders had first signed the agreement. Twenty leaders representing Sunnis then added their signatures on January 1. Some of the remaining leaders would sign the agreement soon, Khan said. He added that after the peace agreement is signed by all the leaders attending the Loya Jirga, roads in the Kurram district of the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Province that have been closed for nearly three months will be reopened and the government will be responsible for protecting them. Roads in Kurram have remained closed despite repeated calls from the public for them to be reopened. Though the two sides reached a cease-fire brokered by the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa government on December 1, 2024, key public roads have not reopened, according to local residents. The road closures have led to severe shortages of essential goods, including food, medicine, fuel, firewood, and gas. The provincial government had previously decided to deploy about 400 special police officers to secure the Parachinar road in Kurram by setting up checkpoints every few kilometers. According to the agreement signed at the Loya Jirga, a strategy is to be developed within 15 days for the handover of weapons to the government. In return, the bunkers built by both sides in the area will be dismantled, and all people displaced by the unrest will be resettled back home. The agreement also says that future land disputes will be resolved through oral and written documents and says the government will take action against those who spread hate on social media.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfycL7TYHky8hF0AU-gMurN	2025-01-01T15:51:35-08:00	
FBI Investigating Deadly New Orleans Truck Attack As ‘Act Of Terr...	A driver crashed a pickup truck into a crowd celebrating New Year’s early Wednesday in New Orleans and opened fire, killing 15 people and injuring more than 35 others. The FBI said it is investigating the attack as an act of terrorism and does not believe the driver acted alone. The bureau is looking at a 'range of suspects,' Alethea Duncan, an assistant special agent in charge of the FBI’s New Orleans field office, said at a news conference. Investigators found multiple explosive devices in the French Quarter, The Associated Press reported, citing a Louisiana State Police intelligence bulletin. Among the devices were two pipe bombs hidden inside coolers and wired to detonate remotely, the bulletin said. 'This is not just an act of terrorism. This is evil,' New Orleans Police Superintendent Anne Kirkpatrick said. The attack occurred at 3:15 a.m. on Wednesday in New Orleans’ lively French Quarter district at the intersection of Canal and Bourbon streets. The historic tourist destination filled with bars and music is also known for its large New Year’s Eve celebrations. After the vehicle crashed, the driver got out of the car and opened fire on responding officers, police said. Officers returned fire, killing the suspect, according to police. Two officers were wounded but are in stable condition, police said. The FBI identified the suspect as Shamsud-Din Jabbar, a 42-year-old U.S. citizen from Texas. 'An ISIS flag was located in the vehicle, and the FBI is working to determine the subject's potential associations and affiliations with terrorist organizations,' the FBI, which is leading the investigation, said in a statement. The suspect served in the U.S. Army for years but had been out of the military for some time, officials said. Investigators found weapons and a potential explosive device in the vehicle, the FBI said, along with the other potential explosive devices found in the French Quarter. It also said the vehicle appeared to have been rented. More than 300 officers were on duty at the time of the incident, police said. U.S. President Joe Biden said he has been continually briefed on the attack. He has also been briefed on a truck fire near the Trump International Hotel Las Vegas and has directed his team to offer any federal assistance needed, according to the White House. 'My heart goes out to the victims and their families who were simply trying to celebrate the holiday. There is no justification for violence of any kind, and we will not tolerate any attack on any of our nation’s communities,' Biden said in a statement on the social media platform X. The White House said it has been in touch with New Orleans Mayor LaToya Cantrell to offer support. 'The FBI is already on the ground supporting local law enforcement in the investigation and the President will continue to be briefed throughout the day,' the White House said in a statement. The Justice Department said Attorney General Merrick Garland was also briefed on the attack. President-elect Donald Trump condemned the attack in a post on his social media platform Truth Social. 'Our hearts are with all the innocent victims and their loved ones,' Trump said. 'The Trump Administration will fully support the City of New Orleans as they investigate and recover from this act of pure evil!' Video taken by an onlooker at the scene of the attack shows at least two twisted bodies lying in the street, with one of them in what appears to be a pool of blood. A bystander is seen kneeling over one of the bodies. Those injured in the attack were taken to five hospitals, according to NOLA Ready, the city’s emergency preparedness department. 'As we search for a motive, remember there is no making sense of evil,' New Orleans City Councilmember Oliver Thomas said. In a statement on X, Louisiana Governor Jeff Landry urged people to stay away from the site of the attack, calling the incident 'a horrific act of violence.' Crowds were also out partying in New Orleans because the city was set to host college football’s Sugar Bowl game Wednesday night. Officials later confirmed Wednesday afternoon that the game would be postponed until Thursday night. Additionally, New Orleans is set to host the NFL’s Super Bowl on February 9. New Orleans has experienced violence surrounding celebrations in the past. In November 2024, two people were killed and 10 others injured in two separate shootings along a New Orleans parade route and a celebration attended by thousands of people, according to local media. And in February 2017, more than 20 people were wounded when a man who police said appeared to be intoxicated rammed a pickup truck into a crowd of onlookers watching the main Mardi Gras parade in New Orleans.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfycL7TYHky8v60GFG68V6R	2025-01-01T15:45:46-08:00	
Robert Reich: The 20 Realities Of The American System – OpEd	As we come to the end of a difficult year, it’s important to establish a baseline for seeing how much worse Trump will make the American system starting January 20. Here are 20 current realities for where we are now — some brought on by Trump’s first term: 1. First, forget politics as you’ve come to see it as electoral contests between Democrats and Republicans. Think power. The underlying contest is between a small minority who have gained power over the system — really, an oligarchy of extraordinarily wealthy and powerful white men — and the vast majority who have little or none. Starting January 20, the oligarchy will be far more powerful. 2. Forget what you may have learned about the choice between the 'free market' and government. A market cannot exist without a government to organize and enforce it. The important question is whom the market has been organized to serve. Starting January 20, it will serve the oligarchy even more than it already does. 3. Forget the standard economic goals of higher growth and greater efficiency. The issues are who benefits from more growth and efficiency, and how we define growth and efficiency. Starting January 20, the major beneficiaries will be Trump, Musk, and other oligarchs. Growth will be defined to exclude climate change and wars over ever-decreasing arable land and fresh water. Efficiency will be defined as eliminating anything Musk and Ramaswamy define as wasteful, potentially including social spending that many Americans depend on. 4. Don’t be fooled by claims of 'corporate social responsibility.' Most of it is public relations. The oligarchy is opposed to what it calls 'woke'ism, or efforts to make corporations more diverse, equitable, and inclusive. But much of so-called 'corporate social responsibility' is a sham anyway. Corporations won’t voluntarily sacrifice shareholder returns unless laws require them to. 5. Even then, be skeptical of laws unless they’re enforced and backed by big penalties. Large corporations and the super-rich ignore laws when the penalties for violating them are small relative to the gains for breaking them. Fines are then simply costs of doing business. Musk and Trump are Exhibits A and B. 6. Don’t assume that we’re locked in a battle between capitalism and socialism. We already have socialism — for the very rich. CEOs today earn more than 300 times what their typical employee earns (up from 60 times in the 1970s). CEOs who are fired by their boards nonetheless get golden parachutes worth large multiples of their giant yearly compensation. Meanwhile, 60 percent of the wealth of the nation is in the hands of heirs who never earned it. Most Americans are subject to the harshest capitalism of any advanced nation. 7. Don’t define 'national competitiveness' as the profitability of large American corporations. 'American' corporations are now global, with no allegiance to America. This includes Musk’s SpaceX and Tesla, which have major factories in, and sales to, China. 8. Real national competitiveness lies in the productivity of the American people. This depends on their education and health and the infrastructure linking them together. But we spend relatively little on the education of poor kids. We spend more per person than any other advanced nation on health care but with the worst results of any advanced nation; our infrastructure still lags way behind that of China. 9. Look at the structure of the economy, not the ups and downs of the business cycle. Economic reporting focuses almost exclusively on the business cycle: the dangers of inflation and recession. The focus should be on systemic, structural changes that have caused the wealth and power of a few to dramatically increase over the last 40 years at the expense of the many — such as labor laws and antitrust laws. Starting January 20, labor laws will discourage workers from organizing, and antitrust laws will allow monopolies to flourish. 10. Forget the old idea that corporations succeed by becoming better, cheaper, or faster than their competitors. They now succeed mainly by increasing their monopoly power, leaving consumers and workers with fewer alternatives. Expect far more mergers, acquisitions, and monopolistic practices after January 20. 11. Forget any traditional definition of finance. Think instead of a giant gambling casino in which bets are made on large flows of money, and bets are made on those bets (called derivatives). Trump and Musk can be expected to further deregulate finance. Keep your eyes especially on crypto and private credit. Both are likely to endure major crashes under Trump. 12. Don’t assume that the billionaire financial titans who run hedge funds and private equity funds have better means of predicting market movements than anyone else. They have better access to inside information than anyone else. The Securities and Exchange Commission has steadily allowed them to benefit from access to inside information. Expect the SEC to allow even more of this under Trump. 13. Don’t confuse attractive policy proposals with systemic changes. Even if enacted, attractive policies at most mitigate systemic problems. Solving those systemic problems requires altering the allocation of power. Starting January 20, the biggest systemic challenges — climate change, nuclear proliferation, and artificial intelligence — are likely to become far more threatening. 14. Don’t assume the system is stable. It moves through vicious spirals and virtuous cycles. We are already in a vicious spiral in which great wealth has morphed into political power to change the rules of the game — taxes, labor, antitrust, bankruptcy, and finance — in ways that make the wealthy even wealthier and often harm those who are not wealthy. Expect far worse after January 20. 15. Don’t believe the system is a meritocracy in which ability and hard work are necessarily rewarded. Today the most important predictor of someone’s future income and wealth is the income and wealth of the family they’re born into. Over the next 15 years, as wealthy boomers die off and leave their fortunes to their millennial children, America will witness the largest intergenerational transfer of wealth in its history. Trump’s pending tax cuts will make all this worse; the oligarchy will become an aristocracy. 16. Don’t separate race from class. Racial discrimination is aggravating class divides, and wider inequality is worsening racial divides. But class is critical, and most Americans are in the working class — with no job security and wages only slightly higher than they were 40 years ago, adjusted for inflation. Starting January 20, the divide will widen. The middle class will shrink even further. The oligarchy will get even richer. 17. Forget the old distinctions between 'blue-collar' and 'white-collar' jobs. A four-year college degree, especially from a prestigious college or university, is now the most important marker of real opportunity. Don’t expect this to change under Trump, despite his populist rhetoric. 18. Think systemically. As noted, the incomes of most people are stagnant, and their jobs are becoming less secure. Combine these realities with climate change that’s intensifying competition for arable land and potable water around the world, generating larger flows of refugees and immigrants. This is allowing demagogues like Trump to fuel bigotry by blaming immigrants for the stagnant incomes and economic insecurity. After January 20, Trump has promised to deport at least 11 million people in the United States who are undocumented. 19. Understand the nature of power – who possesses it and why, how it is wielded, and for what purposes. Power means not being accountable for actions that hurt others but that increase your own power and wealth. Today’s most powerful include Trump, Elon Musk, Peter Thiel, David Sachs, Rupert Murdoch, Jeff Bezos, Stephen A. Schwarzman, Jamie Dimon, Samuel Alito, and Clarence Thomas. 20. Don’t treat power and wealth as separable. Great wealth flows from great power; great power depends on great wealth. Wealth and power are intimately connected to one another. After January 20, they will become one and the same. *** I don’t intend for these 20 realities to make you more cynical about the system or resigned to its intransigence. To the contrary, the first step toward changing the system is to understand it. We need to see where the system is today in order to have a baseline for measuring how much worse it will become under Trump and his lackeys in Congress and the Supreme Court. Seeing the system for what it is and what it will be under a second term of Trump will empower you to join with others to resist Trump, and eventually change the system for the better.

New Mekong Dam Project Sparks Concern In Laos And Thailand	Plans to proceed with a benefits-and-risks review of a proposed hydropower dam on the Mekong River have sparked concern in both Laos and Thailand about the impact on communities and the ecosystem. The U.S. $2 billion, 12-turbine Sanakham hydropower dam will be built about 155 kilometers (100 miles) west of the Lao capital of Vientiane, and 25 km (15 miles) upstream from Sanakham district of Vientiane province, near the Thai-Lao border. More than 62,500 people in Thailand and Laos will be forced to relocate due to rising waters, according to submitted documents. Lao residents say they have hardly had a chance to give feedback on the project. 'I’m so concerned that we’ll have to move to another village,' a Sanakham district resident told Radio Free Asia. 'They [the government] did not clearly explain it to us at all.' Dozens of hydropower dams have already been built on the Mekong and its tributaries, and there are plans to build scores more in the coming years. The Lao government wants to harness their power generation to boost the economy, which has been battered by soaring inflation and a weakening currency. Electricity generated by the dam, to be built by China-owned Datang (Lao) Sanakham Hydropower Co. Ltd. and Thailand’s Gulf Energy Development Public Co. Ltd., will mainly be exported to Thailand. Thailand’s Office of National Water Resources said on Dec. 17 that it would begin the consultation process during which Mekong River Commission member countries and other stakeholders review proposed projects to try to reach a consensus on whether or not they should proceed. The Thai National Mekong Commission is holding four public information forums about the dam for residents living in the eight Thai provinces along the Mekong River during the coming weeks. ‘Rushed ahead’ International Rivers, a group acting to protect rivers and the communities that depend on them, said there has been little up-to-date information publicly available about the project. 'It appears this process is being rushed ahead, with little regard for the needs of local residents to be able to make arrangements to attend the forums, let alone prepare and develop informed opinions about the project specifics,' the group said in a Dec. 21 statement. Villagers who will be affected by the dam don’t want to move, a resident of Kenethao district in Xayaburi province said. 'They don’t want to relocate at all [because] here they have their livelihoods,' he said. 'If they moved somewhere far away, what would happen to their lives? If they have no choice but to move, then they should get more compensation.' Phonepaseuth Phouliphanh, secretary general of the Lao National Mekong Committee, told Radio Free Asia that the project developer will take into consideration concerns raised about the dam. 'All project developments have both good and bad impacts which we cannot avoid,' he told Radio Free Asia. 'We have done research to ensure the impact is as little as possible.' After hearing the concerns from people in areas to be affected by the dam, the Lao government or the project developer will review and correct issues that may occur, he added. Thai concerns Meanwhile, some Thai residents and advocacy groups also oppose the construction of the dam. Channarong Wongla, a member of the Chiang Khan Conservation Group and Local Fisheries Group in Chiang Khan, a district in Thailand that will be affected by the dam, said other hydropower projects have already altered water routes and islands and caused erosion. With hydropower projects in the past, including Laos’ Xayaburi Dam, developers moved ahead with their projects regardless of the concerns raised by residents, he told International Rivers. 'Most importantly, for the Sanakham Dam project, the [Thai] ombudsman and the National Human Rights Commission have already provided a clear basis for a more precautionary approach recognizing the serious impacts on local people and ecosystems,' he was quoted as saying. A report by the ombudsman said there 'was still a serious lack of information on the transboundary impacts of the dam project and that clear commitments of accountability are required from both the developers and government agencies in Thailand,' he said. Construction of the Sanakham Dam was expected to begin in 2020, but was put on hold when government officials from Thailand’s National Mekong Commission raised questions about the impacts of the project and called for comprehensive technical studies on its environmental, social and transboundary effects, according to International Rivers. The 'snap decision' to schedule expedited public information sessions for the Sanakham Dam marked a distinct shift in the Thai government’s approach to the project, the group said.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfycL7TYHky8pPJf0VOjsVH	2025-01-01T15:41:43-08:00	
How AI-Powered Drones Are Shaping The Future Of Warfare – OpEd	The landscape of modern warfare is undergoing a seismic shift, driven by advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) and drone technology. The integration of these technologies is not merely enhancing traditional military capabilities; it is fundamentally transforming the nature of conflict itself. As nations race to develop and deploy more sophisticated drone systems, the implications for military strategy, ethics, and global security are profound. The Evolution of Drone Warfare Drones, or unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), have been utilized in military operations for decades, primarily for surveillance and reconnaissance. However, recent conflicts, particularly in Ukraine and the Middle East, have showcased their offensive capabilities. The early weeks of the Russian invasion of Ukraine highlighted the effectiveness of Turkish-made Bayraktar TB2 drones, which played a crucial role in countering armored assaults. Similarly, Hamas employed drones to target Israeli defenses, demonstrating their versatility as offensive weapons. As drone technology has evolved, so too has its application in warfare. Today's drones are equipped with advanced sensors and AI algorithms that allow for real-time data processing and autonomous decision-making. This capability enables drones to execute complex missions with minimal human intervention, marking a significant departure from their original role as mere reconnaissance tools. The Role of AI in Drone Warfare AI is at the forefront of this transformation. By enhancing data processing capabilities, AI allows drones to analyze vast amounts of information quickly and make split-second decisions on the battlefield. This capability is particularly critical in high-stakes environments where traditional command-and-control structures may be compromised. The integration of AI into drone systems has led to two major innovations: swarm intelligence and autonomous targeting. Swarm intelligence enables multiple drones to operate collaboratively, overwhelming enemy defenses through coordinated attacks. This tactic has been observed in various conflicts where swarms of drones have successfully penetrated sophisticated air defense systems. Moreover, autonomous targeting systems are being developed that allow drones to identify and engage targets without human oversight. This raises ethical concerns about accountability and the potential for unintended consequences in combat scenarios. As nations continue to refine these technologies, the prospect of fully autonomous weapons—often referred to as 'killer robots'—becomes increasingly realistic. Current Applications and Developments Recent developments in drone technology illustrate the rapid pace of innovation. For instance, companies like Helsing have introduced AI-powered attack drones capable of operating effectively in environments with electronic jamming—a common challenge in modern warfare. These drones can maintain target engagement even without continuous data connections, providing a significant tactical advantage. In Ukraine, the military has adapted its structure to incorporate drone warfare units across all branches. The introduction of first-person view (FPV) racing drones has enabled Ukrainian forces to conduct precision strikes against Russian tanks and troop formations. This shift highlights how drone technology can provide asymmetrical advantages in conflicts where one side may be outgunned by traditional artillery. The use of AI-driven algorithms also enhances drones' capabilities for intelligence gathering and reconnaissance. Drones can now autonomously navigate complex environments, identify patterns of life among enemy forces, and predict potential threats based on historical data analysis. This level of situational awareness is invaluable for modern militaries seeking to maintain an edge over adversaries. The Strategic Implications As drones become more sophisticated, their impact on military strategy is profound. The ability to deploy swarms of drones against enemy targets alters traditional notions of air power and ground warfare. Military planners must now consider how to defend against not just individual drone strikes but coordinated attacks involving hundreds or thousands of UAVs. Furthermore, the cost-effectiveness of drone warfare presents a compelling argument for their increased use. Drones are generally cheaper to produce than manned aircraft and can be deployed in greater numbers without risking human lives. This economic advantage may encourage nations to invest heavily in drone technology as a primary component of their military arsenals. The proliferation of drone technology also raises significant ethical questions regarding warfare conduct. The potential for autonomous weapons systems to operate without human oversight challenges existing international laws governing armed conflict. Advocacy groups have called for preemptive bans on fully autonomous weapons due to concerns about accountability and civilian casualties. Countermeasures and Future Developments As drone technology advances, so too do countermeasures designed to neutralize UAV threats. Nations are investing in electronic warfare capabilities that can jam or disrupt drone communications, rendering them ineffective during operations. Additionally, advancements in laser weaponry are being explored as potential solutions for intercepting swarming drones before they reach their targets. Looking ahead, the future of drone warfare will likely see further integration with other technologies such as robotics and machine learning. The development of hybrid systems that combine ground-based robots with aerial drones could create multi-domain operational capabilities that enhance battlefield effectiveness. Moreover, as countries like China and Russia ramp up their investments in drone technology, the global arms race surrounding UAVs will intensify. This competition will not only shape military strategies but also influence geopolitical dynamics as nations seek to assert dominance through technological superiority. The intersection of AI and drone warfare represents one of the most significant transformations in military history. As these technologies continue to evolve, they will redefine how wars are fought and won. While offering unprecedented advantages on the battlefield, they also pose ethical dilemmas that require careful consideration by policymakers and military leaders alike. The future of war is increasingly automated and reliant on artificial intelligence—a reality that demands new frameworks for regulation and accountability in armed conflict. As nations navigate this uncharted territory, the balance between leveraging technological advancements for security while safeguarding human rights will be critical in shaping the future landscape of warfare.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfycL7TYHky8qKA5KIhHLWI	2025-01-01T15:40:05-08:00	
End Of The Assad Regime: A Theory Audit – Analysis	By Dr. Philip Dandolov The ousting of the Assad regime in Syria in December 2024, which happened as a result of a major offensive by the opposition forces, could at a first glance be regarded as representing a rather unexpected development, especially if one considers the speed with which the military-strategic and political circumstances changed on the ground. However, while the rapid loss of morale among many of the former president’s loyalists and the token resistance put up by them could have hardly been anticipated, there were certainly a multitude of signs since at least the early 2020s that the ruling Ba’ath Party was in a precarious position. On the one hand, one cannot disregard the preoccupation of important allies or ‘Black Knights’ (international sponsors offering various forms of assistance to autocratic leaders) of the Assad regime with other military conflicts. Hezbollah, the Lebanese paramilitary group and Iranian proxy force, which had in the 2010s played a decisive role in propping up the Ba’athists during critical junctures of the Syrian civil war, was in a significantly weakened position due to its war with Israel, while the Russian Federation has since early 2022 almost exclusively concentrated on its full-scale invasion of Ukraine. From a theoretical standpoint, these military engagements of Hezbollah and Russia have represented disruptions with regard to the notion of regional autocratic linkage, which has been recognized as one of the potential pillars of stability when it comes to authoritarian political systems. On the other hand, if we are to shift the focus to the situation within Syria, a number of critical risk factors for autocratic breakdown manifested themselves in the years preceding the Syrian opposition’s ‘Deterrence of Aggression’ military operation. How does the fall of the Assad regime measure up to theory? Many scholars suggest that the robustness of the security forces is a pivotal factor in determining whether or not an autocratic ruler is likely to survive episodes of large-scale unrest. In particular, comparativist Eva Bellin argued in 2004 that the unique resilience of authoritarianism in the Middle East was in large part connected to the 'robustness of the coercive apparatus.' The security forces’ strength can be evaluated by drawing on a number of measures, amongst which are the fiscal health of a regime, its ability to apply repression without seriously compromising international support, and the extent of the anti-government popular mobilization. It could plausibly be argued that in the case of Syria all of these ingredients have been part of the picture since the early 2020s. Firstly, even though there was a lull in the Syrian civil war following the March 2020 Idlib ceasefire, with Bashar al-Assad managing to maintain an uneasy peace in the areas under his control (about two thirds of the country’s territory), in the same timeframe the effects of US sanctions were becoming more strongly felt, perhaps to a degree also exacerbated by the lingering impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, with some agencies estimating that at least 80% of Syrians were in need of humanitarian assistance. Furthermore, the worsening economic situation in Lebanon since 2019, as evidenced by the liquidity crisis in the country, which saw a plummeting of the GDP per capita, served to deprive the Syrian authorities of an important 'economic lung.' Many of the Syrian Army soldiers were not exactly insulated from the effects of these negative trends, with the poverty-related issues also causing food insecurity for the members of the armed forces. Thus, the intertwined factors of an unsatisfactory economic performance of the regime and a disillusioned security apparatus were certainly a feature of the Syrian political landscape in the years preceding the rebels’ successful offensive. As mentioned above, large-scale popular mobilization or at least passive support on the part of the general populace when it comes to the actions of anti-government forces also reduce the survival prospects of authoritarian regimes. There is some evidence that average citizens may behave strategically, relegating ideological concerns to the backstage, and show a willingness to cooperate with an extreme rebel movement if they feel that such a group is better-positioned to win a war and resist corrupting influences once it assumes power. In light of Syria’s negative economic indicators, it is worth considering that a pessimism-inducing economic situation may likely go hand-in-hand with grievances pertaining to real or perceived corruption. The willingness of religious moderates to band together with compatriots subscribing to a significantly more fundamentalist interpretation of the scriptures is not necessarily too novel of a development. Since the late 1990s, there have been instances in Middle Eastern countries such as Jordan, Iraq, and Yemen of leftists and liberals engaging in a constructive fashion with Islamists in order to pursue issues of common interest. In this regard, the power of political rebranding should not be underestimated. Even though Abu Mohammad al-Julani, the politically savvy leader of Hay’at Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), the Sunni Islamist political organization that is considered to be the vanguard of the anti-Assad opposition, has had a very checkered past and has been a far cry from a political moderate, he has certainly invested efforts towards throwing off the mantle of a jihadist and reinventing himself as a rebel statesman. In the summer of 2016 al-Julani severed ties with al-Qaeda, initially changing the Al-Nusra Front’s name to Jabhat Fatah al-Sham, and subsequently (in 2017) to the current HTS. Al-Julani explained that the main intention behind this move was to deprive external powers such as the United States or Russia of the justification to launch attacks, with Qatar likely playing a role in encouraging his hand. Even though there are ample grounds to doubt the extent to which the shift in ideological orientation could be considered to be genuine, HTS’ outreach to Syria’s diverse communities has been assessed as at least somewhat successful due to it being able to make inroads into some traditionally pro-Assad groups. For example, Ismaili Shias were supportive of or at least not too keen to oppose the rebel forces and there were even celebrations and chants for unity in Alawite strongholds such as Latakia. In the years prior to the offensive, the HTS militia had also displayed some tolerance towards religious minorities, such as Christians and members of the Druze community, in the areas under its control. A further point that the rebels have in their favor is that even though there are many competing factions and fissures within the HTS coalition, ranging from radical Salafists to Syrian nationalists associated with the Free Syrian Army, the rhetorical wiggle room for distancing from the more ideologically extreme fighters has not been in short supply. This is because the soldiers who consider Syria to be just one of many battlefields in a struggle to secure a global victory for Islamism and have steadfastly opposed the HTS’ rebranding effort are more likely to be of foreign origin. The HTS, which has previously been characterized as a relatively localized terrorist organization, has continued to emphasize the distinction between Syrian- and foreign-born fighters in its handling of incidents such as the burning of a Christmas tree on 24 December in Al-Suqaylabiyah, a town with a Christian majority. The HTS’ rebranding, whether reflective of true political maturation or pure pragmatism, has been important because it has arguably served to challenge the negative legitimacy cultivated by Assad, which has for a long time been regarded as the main saving grace of his government, mainly due to the perception that all of the alternatives to the Ba’ath Party’s rule were by definition significantly worse for the secularists and the religious minority groups in Syria. In recent decades there has also been a deepening of transnational bonds between national societies, contributing in certain instances to the 'diffusion of contention across borders.' While it is perhaps still too early to evaluate the salience of this phenomenon as it pertains to Syria, given that 2024 year has been notable for the relevance of the anti-incumbency factor in countries as different as the United States, France, South Africa, and Sri Lanka, the almost worldwide negative sentiment against political office holders may have played a small part in further emboldening the Syrian opposition or at least discouraging formerly pro-Assad Syrians from throwing their weight behind his government. What most Syrians are likely to cautiously hope for is that the inclusion-moderation hypothesis will prove its merits in the Syrian context, as a result of which the behaviorally and ideologically radical groups will not be in a position to dictate to or overly influence the agendas of the more moderate political forces, which could pave the way for a proper democratic transition.

Key Points Of China’s National Fiscal Work Meeting – Analysis	By Yang Xite From December 23 to 24, China's national fiscal work conference was held in Beijing, where the work report was delivered by the country's Minister of Finance Lan Fo'an. This conference serves not only as a comprehensive implementation and specific deployment of the ideals of the Central Economic Work Conference held earlier but also as a systematic arrangement for key financial tasks in 2025. As an important executive department of national economic policy, the Ministry of Finance (MOF)'s work plan not only concerns macroeconomic stability and social development but also guides local governments and relevant departments. Researchers at ANBOUND point out that the main theme of the conference is obvious: to fully implement the ideals of the Central Economic Work Conference and translate the established policy requirements into specific operational plans for the financial sector. Therefore, this is a typical meeting for execution rather than for innovation. The core task of this meeting is not to propose new policy breakthroughs, but to strengthen policy implementation, ensuring the efficiency of fund use and the achievement of policy objectives. Similar to the functions of the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC), the MOF, as an important component of China's economic governance system, is fundamentally positioned as an executor and guarantor. Hence, the fiscal policy must not only align with macroeconomic regulation but also provide support for economic stability and high-quality development through precise policy measures and efficient coordination of resources. From the content of the meeting, the fiscal work for 2025 will focus on six key areas. These areas are not entirely new proposals, but rather the concretization of the tasks outlined in the Central Economic Work Conference, further emphasizing the characteristic of the policy being execution-oriented and implementation-focused. First is the expansion of the overall demand through greater financial spending intensity. In 2025, the core task of economic policy will be to expand national demand through increased spending. Against the backdrop of a complex and ever-changing international environment and growing external uncertainties, the importance of domestic demand in China has become more prominent. Hence, the policy will simultaneously focus on both investment and consumption, aiming to activate the economy's endogenous growth drivers by expanding effective investment and boosting consumption. On the investment side, the fiscal focus for next year will be on reasonably arranging the scale of bond issuance, using government investment to drive social investment and promote high-quality development. To cite some examples, infrastructure construction, new energy development, and industrial upgrading will become key investment directions. Particularly, major projects such as the enhancement of national comprehensive freight hubs and supply chain improvements will receive focus, with fiscal funds playing a guiding and supporting role. The consumption side is also an important lever for expanding domestic demand. The meeting explicitly proposed that the basic pensions for retirees, basic pensions for urban and rural residents, and fiscal subsidies for medical insurance should be appropriately increased, fundamentally enhancing residents' purchasing power. At the same time, the 'old-for-new' policy for consumer goods will continue to be deepened, stimulating residents' purchasing power, particularly in emerging consumer sectors such as green home appliances and smart devices, where fiscal subsidies may be further increased. Therefore, more policies aimed at directly stimulating consumption are likely to be introduced next year. In addition, fiscal spending may be further increased next year, with the deficit ratio expected to rise to 4.0% or higher. This will release more fiscal funds, providing greater policy space and operational flexibility for expanding domestic demand. Compared to special bonds and special government bonds, the use of deficit funds is more direct, with higher fund efficiency and faster results, helping to inject stronger momentum into China's domestic demand in the short term. Second, the objectives of the policy are to ensure and improve people's livelihoods, reflecting a people-centered development approach. Livelihood issues have consistently been a key focus of fiscal policy. The meeting emphasized the importance of prioritizing employment, supporting the development of education, improving the social security system, and addressing the urgent concerns of the public. In line with these goals, China's fiscal policy in 2025 will continue to increase investment in sectors such as education, healthcare, and pensions. It is worth noting that the meeting proposed improving the population development support policy system. Subsidies and support measures for families with two or more children are expected to be further expanded. This may include increasing the scope of pre-tax deductions for childcare expenses or directly providing childcare subsidies, thereby reducing the cost of raising children for families. At the same time, fiscal policies are expected to alleviate the living pressures of key groups such as unemployed youth and rural elderly people and boost consumer confidence and social expectations through direct subsidies and expanded employment support programs. In terms of employment, it is expected that policy support for enterprises to stabilize and expand positions will continue to be strengthened, such as by reducing costs for businesses, while also encouraging companies to prioritize the employment of key groups like university graduates. Third, the key role of fiscal policy in preventing and resolving major risks will be emphasized. The meeting pointed out that in 2025, such efforts will be concentrated in key areas, especially the potential risks related to local government debt and the real estate market. Regarding local government debt, it proposed implementing comprehensive debt reduction plans while enforcing financial discipline and resolutely curbing the accumulation of new hidden debts. It is foreseeable that 2025 will be a critical year for tackling and resolving the local debt issue. At the same time, the central government will further increase transfer payments to help local governments stabilize the 'three guarantees' (i.e., safe housing, healthcare, and education), so as to ensure that basic living standards, wage payments, and institutional functions are not affected. In addition, the real estate market remains a key focus of fiscal policy. The meeting clearly emphasized the need to halt the market's decline and maintain stabilization. In 2025, fiscal policy is expected to provide more targeted support to the real estate sector, such as establishing a real estate stability fund to ensure the delivery of housing, stockpile existing properties, and acquire land from property companies. These measures aim to ease cash flow pressures on real estate companies, prevent further deterioration of market expectations, stabilize the industry's fundamentals, and avoid risks from spreading to the financial sector and other areas. Fourth, focus will also be given to promoting the construction of a modern industrial system and optimizing the supply structure. Achieving high-quality development requires fiscal policy to focus more on supply-side reforms. The meeting pointed out the need to strengthen technological innovation capabilities, fully support the breakthrough of key core technologies, and push for the transformation and upgrading of traditional industries. In 2025, fiscal policy is expected to invest more resources in supporting new productive forces. This means that fiscal measures will further increase support for original and disruptive technological innovations, such as through special funds for basic research and the development of cutting-edge technologies. In addition, support for manufacturing, particularly small and medium-sized enterprises that are specialized and innovative, will also be further strengthened. This may include policies such as research and development subsidies and tax incentives to help businesses reduce innovation costs. Fifth, support will be given to urban-rural integrated development. Urban-rural integration is a key strategy for addressing developmental imbalances. For instance, national food security and achievements in poverty alleviation are fundamentally about ensuring that people have sufficient food sources and enjoy a better quality of life. At the same time, rural development and new urbanization aim to modernize rural areas and make cities more inclusive, fostering complementary and coordinated growth between urban and rural regions. The goal of regional coordinated development is to allow each area to leverage its unique advantages, rather than focusing solely on one. This approach promotes not only economic integration but also social equity. Sixth, efforts will be made to strengthen high-level opening-up and ecological development. Opening up remains a key aspect of China's economic strategy and a driving force for future growth. Participation in global economic governance is important for gaining influence in rule-setting and engaging in multilateral and bilateral economic discussions. The Belt and Road Initiative and tariff policy adjustments are measures aimed at further integrating the country with the global economy. In terms of green development, fiscal policy will focus on sustainability by supporting a green and low-carbon transformation to balance economic growth and environmental protection. It is notable that this year's national fiscal work meeting unlike last year's, removed the expression of 'tightening the belts'. This suggests a shift in fiscal policy direction. This indicates that China's fiscal spending will be more active, targeted, and robust. It also signals the need for greater fiscal support to boost the economy, with an emphasis on increasing the domestic demand of the country. With a higher deficit ratio, increased special bonds, and financial support for local governments, more funds will be directed toward areas such as livelihoods, consumption, and employment. Final analysis conclusion: The key feature of China's national fiscal work meeting this year is more on the execution side rather than innovation. The fiscal policy for 2025 will focus on precise action more proactively, laying a solid foundation for the conclusion of the 14th Five-Year Plan and the start of the 15th Five-Year Plan. The country's local governments will need to fully understand the meeting's directives to grasp the central government's policy direction for the effective implementation of these policies.

Bring India’s Defence Ministry Into The Space Commission – Analys...	By Chaitanya Giri Why does India pursue a ‘space program’ at all? Is it only to satisfy the scientific curiosity of its intelligentsia? Is it only to fulfil the harmless aspirations of its entrepreneurs to bring an economic windfall to the nation? If these are the only motives for the Indian government to pursue the space program, the high table known as India’s Space Commission—the tallest decision-making body on all matters space—with its current organogram, is perfectly fine. However, if you ask two more simple questions—Who takes care of defending India’s space assets? Who secures our sovereign realms from the strategic and tactical dangers emanating from orbital and outer space threats?—the current structure of India’s Space Commission warrants a re-assessment. In 2019, India established the Defence Space Agency (DSA) under the aegis of the Integrated Defence Staff (IDS), with two other agencies, the Armed Forces Special Operations Division and the Defence Cyber Agency. It is, indeed, a fact that these are the initial formative years for the DSA, but does that mean it does not have a place in the Space Commission? This question is beginning to impact security thinkers and planners in the country tasked to monitor India’s comprehensive security needs. From their perspective, these are dangerous gaps that must be filled fast. The Indian government took some bold and long-pending decisions when it initiated the space reforms in 2020. The Space Commission, during these reforms, expanded its members and got new representatives: it invited the Chairman of the newly-created Indian National Space Promotion and Authorisation Centre (IN-SPACe), the Foreign Secretary, the Secretary of the Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (DPIIT), Chairman-Standing Committee of the Indian Institutes of Technology (IIT) Council, and the National Security Advisor to the Prime Minister. Since its formation, the Space Commission has been overly civilian, with a majority of its representation being from the civilian space agency Indian Space Research Organization (ISRO). Even after bringing in new members, the inordinately civilian influence on the Commission remains to this day, as its chairman is also the Secretary of the Department of Space and Chairman of the ISRO. What’s more of a concern is that ISRO is genuinely not in a position to execute ‘space defence’ measures, as such activities may fall under the purview of militarisation, an attribute it does not want to be associated with as an institution. The DSA is not structurally part of the Department of Space, which is understood. Still, it is difficult to comprehend why there are no attempts to make it a part of the Space Commission. The conspicuous absence of representation from the IDS or the DSA in the Space Commission begs the question of whether the Commission is a civilian-economic body by design. If yes, we must live with the fact that there is no other equally empowered Commission where these many secretaries, academics, and the National Security Advisor (NSA) would come together to assist the DSA and IDS in building assets necessary for the ‘space defence’ of India. If the current ‘civilian’ Space Commission has no room for the DSA or IDS, then a separate defence ‘Space Commission’ be created. If two ‘space commissions’ are not viable, there is only one eventuality: the reform of the Space Commission with equal representation that takes into account the civilian, commercial and military aspects of India’s space activities. Such a reform would first warrant the participation of the Chief of the Defence Staff to plug in the tactical feed of the DSA, the next-to-come Indian Space Command and the Indian Space Force into the Space Commission. There are three reasons why this topic has come about now. First, in October 2024, the Cabinet Committee on Security approved the third phase of the Space-Based Surveillance Project. The earlier two phases involved the launches of sets of four and six ‘spy’ satellites, respectively. The third phase features the launch of 52 ‘spy’ satellites, all managed by the IDS (read DSA) via the National Security Council Secretariat (NSCS). The civilian space agency will never build intelligence-gathering satellites. Even in the recent past, the electronic intelligence satellite, under Project Kautilya, was built by the Defence Research Development Organization. The 52 satellites, too, are likely coming from the domestic commercial space market. Second, the Ministry of Defence is fast emerging as a leading end-user, customer, and operator of space assets in India. It has begun to cultivate an ecosystem of commercial players and leading national R&D laboratories, which demands a separate infrastructure outside the civilian confines of ISRO. In the past couple of years, the Ministry of Defence’s Innovation in Defence Excellence, better known as the IDEX scheme, has financed several early-stage space companies under its ‘Mission DefSpace Challenge’ since 2022. This is only the beginning, and a large section of India’s commercial space enterprises will soon get business orders from the DSA and the forces. Third, the civilian and military space domains are not competitors but complement each other. The best example, which will be seen in the coming days, is the comprehensive operational role of the Indian Navyand the Indian Air Force in the Indian Human Spaceflight Programme. This relationship will only strengthen in the future as Gaganyaan and Bharatiya Antariksha Station begin to take shape. Just like space technology is always dual-use, the country's commission overseeing the development, deployment, and domestic and external trade of space technology and its sciences must include one of its fast-growing end users. The Space Commission was established when ISRO and its parent body, the Department of Space, were solo space technology designers, builders, operators, and commercialisers. Now that this solo authority is a thing of the past, a ‘defence’ representation in the Space Commission is warranted.

A Brief Note On A Historic Proposal By Argentine President Javier...	By Jesús Huerta de Soto The President of the Argentine Republic, Javier Milei, has stated that he is going to present a legislative proposal to declare it an imprescriptible crime for the state and the central bank to monetize the public deficit and create inflation. Consequently, heads of state and of the government, ministers, central bank officials, and representatives who, in one way or another, decide, promote, or participate in the creation of money and the inflationary financing of the public deficit will be tried and sentenced as criminals. Moreover, these acts will be declared imprescriptible offenses, and thus, even if—due to possible political changes in the future—this legislation were to be repealed, its subsequent restoration would, ipso facto, mean the prosecution and conviction of those persons involved in inflationary policies. In short, the intention is to discourage, in advance, the action of any authority, public official, or politician who might, in the future, decide to resort to inflation to finance and achieve political, economic, social, or any other goals. The ratio legis of this new legislation is clear: it is grounded in the extremely severe damage done by inflationary policies in general. In the particular case of Argentina, such policies have been on the verge of causing raging hyperinflation, which only the efforts of the new President, Javier Milei, and the sacrifices borne by the Argentine nation since the fall of the former Peronist government have made it possible to roll back. This former government and those that preceded it are primarily responsible for the severe prostration, poverty, and economic and social crisis which today have placed Argentina—once one of the richest countries in the world—among the relatively poorer and less prosperous nations, despite its enormous potential in terms of human and natural resources. Below, we will take a look at the enormous damage done by money creation and inflationary financing of the public deficit. This harm very clearly justifies the criminalization and harsh punishment of all who, whether directly or indirectly, become promoters of, collaborators on, or the main participants in inflationary measures. We will consider—from least to most dramatic—the effects of public-deficit monetization. First, it constitutes a direct attack on the very foundations of the democratic system. Indeed, the essence of democracy rests on democratic control, with complete transparency, of both the expenditure budget and the different sources of public revenue, which must be known and voted on by citizens. Monetization—financing via the mere issuance of any amount of new money—of public expenditure is profoundly antidemocratic. It breaks the necessary link between transparent public expenditure and revenue, by—in a concealed and diluted way—placing the cost of the portion of public expenditure not financed with taxes on the shoulders of the mass of holders of monetary units. Gradually, and without noticing it at first, or knowing its cause, these people are affected as their money balances undergo a drastic relative drop in purchasing power. This phenomenon occurs both when the deficit is monetized directly—as has, de facto, been happening for years in Argentina—and when at least, to keep up appearances, the deficit is financed with new public debt that the bank of issue immediately purchases on a massive scale in the secondary market with newly-created money. The European Central Bank, the Federal Reserve, and other central banks—under the false pretext and 'legal umbrella' of carrying out just another monetary policy—have been proceeding in this way and have acquired up to one-third of all public debt issued so far by the different governments. Second, monetization of the public deficit clearly equates to removing the essential restraint placed on politicians by transparent, democratic control of the budget and its implementation. Indeed, if any public spending can be financed with inflation practically 'on the sly' and in an apparently painless (at least in the short term) way, political incentives will obviously and inevitably be biased toward wastefulness and populism in a 'binge of public spending' and brazen, indiscriminate vote-buying that destroys the very foundations of democracy and thoroughly demoralizes and corrupts the electorate and the citizenry. Argentina is a prime example of this very perverse phenomenon. The Federal Reserve and European Central Bank have adopted policies of de facto monetization of the public deficit that have given rise to the phenomenon as well (though on a smaller scale). For instance, the moment the ECB launched its ultra-lax 'monetary' policies of 'quantitative easing' and lowering the interest rate to zero, the different governments of the Eurozone immediately halted the necessary austerity measures and reforms they had implemented. No government is willing to bear the political cost of adopting policies as painful as they are necessary if the usual deficit that derives from avoiding them will cost nothing, take no toll on those in power, and even be financed, directly or indirectly, by money newly issued by the central bank, and at practically non-existent interest rates. Third and furthermore, we must point out that the new money never reaches all citizens equally. Instead, it is injected, in the best of cases, to pay invoices for public spending, and hence, the relative prices of the first goods and services thus financed rise. The first recipients of the money come out ahead, at the expense of all other citizens. In the worst of cases, which are, moreover, the most common, central banks disguise their direct monetization of the public deficit under the seemingly more orthodox cloak of purchasing, on a massive scale, public-debt securities (and even other, fixed- and variable-income securities) in the secondary (stock and bond) markets. In this case, the redistribution of income in favor of a few is even greater. It can even reach the obscene extreme of greatly enriching the holders of the corresponding financial assets, either because they sell their portfolio securities to the central bank at an artificially exorbitant price or because the widespread drop in interest rates (to zero or even less than zero, low levels to which the Federal Reserve and European Central Bank indeed forced rates) makes the market value of fixed-income securities, other assets, and capital goods skyrocket. That is not to mention the tremendous, negative impact which such drastic and crude manipulation of the interest rate exerts on the real productive structure. The interest rate is the most important price in any free market and, when it is manipulated in this way, it ceases to function efficiently as an essential guide to entrepreneurial decisions on the intertemporal allocation between the production of consumer and capital goods. Central banks typically use two processes to create and inject money into the economy: 1) credit expansion, generated by the fractional-reserve banking system under central bank direction; and, 2) 'open market operations' or monetization of the public deficit. In both cases, a manipulated and artificially-low interest rate sparks waves of erroneous and unsustainable investments that give rise to deep economic cycles and crises of financial instability. The fact is the manipulation and lowering of interest rates gives the appearance of profitability to investment processes which are really unsustainable, because they do not correspond to the true desires of citizens, as consumers and savers. Fourth and finally, once the effects described above have run their course, every inflationary process ultimately and inevitably results in the gradual, masked decline in purchasing power of the monetary units all economic agents use. This decrease in purchasing power amounts to an odious (inflation) tax that hurts everyone, particularly the most vulnerable and needy, and thus, all inflation invariably becomes an especially odious and regressive tax. In conclusion, the monetization of the public deficit causes very grave harm which actually far exceeds, both quantitatively and qualitatively, that done by currency counterfeiters, whose activity is considered a crime in every penal code in the world. (In Spain, for instance, it is punishable by eight to twelve years’ imprisonment in articles 386 to 389 of the Spanish penal code.) Therefore, full justification exists for President Javier Milei’s historic proposal to criminalize and even place no statute of limitations on the monetization of the public deficit and to punish it with imprisonment and even higher monetary fines for all the heads of state and of the government, finance ministers, members of parliament, and governors and members of central bank governing boards who—by act or omission—are responsible for the corresponding money creation. And, once again, the reason for this is the very grave harm—on both an individual and social level—which such money creation always causes. Therefore, we hope President Javier Milei can push through and complete this momentous change in the law as soon as possible. Above all, we hope that his example—along with the popular awareness of the perverse effects and severe damage that result from public-deficit monetization—will spread throughout the world, and will especially reach economic areas which, like that of North America and, particularly, the Eurozone, have inflicted upon their citizens a devaluation of their monetary units that—though it does not even come close to Argentina’s near hyperinflation—has expropriated from them. For instance, in a very few years, 20 percent of the purchasing power of all their money has been expropriated. We hope this will be the case and that—in a not-so-distant future—it will also be possible to criminally prosecute and hold personally accountable the governors of central banks (the ECB, the Federal Reserve, etc.) and the members of their corresponding boards of directors for failing to achieve their objectives and for the severe social and economic harm they have inflicted on the citizenry.

Read Between The Lies: A Pattern Recognition Guide – OpEd	When Avril Haines, Director of National Intelligence, announced during Event 201’s pandemic drill in 2019 that they would 'flood the zone with trusted sources,' few understood this preview of coordinated narrative control. Within months, we watched it unfold in real time—unified messaging across all platforms, suppression of dissent, and coordinated narrative control that fooled much of the world. But not everyone stayed fooled forever. Some saw through it immediately, questioning every aspect from day one. Others thought it was just incompetent government trying to protect us. Many initially accepted the precautionary principle—better safe than sorry. But as each policy failure pointed in the same direction—toward more control and less human agency—the pattern became impossible to ignore. Anyone not completely subsumed by the system eventually had to confront its true purpose: not protecting health or safety, but expanding control. Once you recognize this pattern of deception, two questions should immediately arise whenever major stories dominate headlines: 'What are they lying about?' and 'What are they distracting us from?' The pattern of coordinated deception becomes unmistakable. Consider how media outlets spent three years pushing Russiagate conspiracies, driving unprecedented social division while laying the groundwork for what would become the greatest psychological operation in history. Today, while the media floods us with Ukraine coverage, BlackRock positions itself to profit from both the destruction and reconstruction. The pattern becomes unmistakable once you see it—manufactured crises driving pre-planned 'solutions' that always expand institutional control. Mainstream media operates on twin deceptions: misdirection and manipulation. The same anchors who sold us WMDs in Iraq, promoted 'Russia collusion,' and insisted Hunter Biden’s laptop was 'Russian disinformation' still occupy prime time slots. Just as we see with RFK, Jr.’s HHS nomination, the pattern is consistent: coordinated attacks replace substantive debate, identical talking points appear across networks, and legitimate questions are dismissed through character assassination rather than evidence. Being consistently wrong isn’t a bug—it’s a feature. Their role isn’t to inform but to manufacture consent. The template is consistent: Saturate media with emotional spectacles while advancing institutional agendas with minimal scrutiny. Like learning to spot a fake smile or hearing a false note in music, you develop an instinct for the timing: Money and Power: While the media fixated on January 6th, BlackRock and Vanguard quietly tightened their grip on the residential real estate market While coverage obsessed over Trump’s Twitter ban, Congress passed the largest upward transfer of wealth under cover of 'Covid relief' While breathless reporting tracked every move of the Johnny Depp trial, the Fed printed more money than in the entire previous century While media flooded us with Ukraine coverage, unprecedented restrictions on energy production reshaped the global economy While reporters breathlessly tracked Trump indictments, central banks accelerated plans for programmable digital currency Medical Control: While media focused on celebrity vaccine promotion, unprecedented numbers of young athletes collapsed on field While networks ran wall-to-wall coverage of school shootings, documents revealed Pfizer knew about hundreds of side effects While coverage fixated on anti-vax 'misinformation,' insurance data showed alarming excess death rates Digital Control: While media obsessed over Twitter content moderation, digital ID infrastructure was quietly built worldwide While coverage focused on TikTok privacy concerns, central banks accelerated digital currency development While endless AI chatbot debates dominated headlines, biometric surveillance systems expanded globally As these deceptions become more obvious, different forms of resistance emerge. The truth-seeking takes different forms. Some become deep experts in specific deceptions—documenting early treatment successes with repurposed drugs, uncovering hospital protocol failures, or exploring the impact of vaccine injuries. Others develop a broader lens for seeing how narratives themselves are engineered. Walter Kirn’s brilliant pattern recognition cuts to the heart of our manufactured reality. His tweets dissecting the United CEO murder coverage expose how even violent crimes are now packaged as entertainment spectacles, complete with character arcs and narrative twists. Kirn’s insight highlights a critical dimension of media control: by turning every crisis into an entertainment narrative, they divert attention from deeper questions. Instead of asking why institutional safeguards fail or who benefits, audiences become captivated by carefully scripted outrage. This deliberate distraction ensures that institutional agendas move forward without scrutiny. His insight reveals how entertainment packaging serves the broader control system. While each investigation requires its own expertise, this pattern of narrative manipulation connects to a larger grid of deception. As I’ve explored in 'The Information Factory' and 'Engineering Reality,' everything from education to medicine to currency itself has been captured by systems designed to shape not just our choices, but our very perception of reality. Most revealing is what they don’t cover. Notice how quickly stories disappear when they threaten institutional interests. Remember the Epstein client list? The Maui land grab? The mounting vaccine injuries? The silence speaks volumes. Consider the recent whistleblower testimonies revealing suppressed safety concerns at Boeing, a company long entangled with regulatory agencies and government contracts. Two whistleblowers—both former employees who raised alarms about safety issues—died under suspicious circumstances. Coverage of their deaths disappeared almost overnight, despite the profound implications for public safety and corporate accountability. This pattern repeats in countless cases where accountability would disrupt entrenched power structures, leaving crucial questions unanswered and narratives tightly controlled. These decisions aren’t accidental—they result from media ownership, advertiser influence, and government pressure, ensuring the narrative remains tightly controlled. But perhaps most striking isn’t the media’s deception itself, but how thoroughly it shapes its consumers’ reality. Watch how confidently they repeat phrases clearly engineered in think tanks. Listen as they parrot talking points with religious conviction: 'January 6th was worse than 9/11,' 'Trust The Science™,' 'Democracy is on the ballot' and, perhaps the most consequential lie in modern history, 'Safe and Effective.' The professional-managerial class proves especially susceptible to this programming. Their expertise becomes a prison of status—the more they’ve invested in institutional approval, the more fervently they defend institutional narratives. Watch how quickly a doctor who questions vaccine safety loses his license, how swiftly a professor questioning gender ideology faces review, how rapidly a journalist stepping out of line gets blacklisted. The system ensures compliance through economic capture: your mortgage becomes your leash, your professional status your prison guard. The same lawyers who prides themselves on critical thinking will aggressively shut down any questioning of official narratives. The professor who teaches 'questioning power structures' becomes apoplectic when students question pharmaceutical companies. The circular validation makes the programming nearly impenetrable: Media cites 'experts' Experts cite peer-reviewed studies Studies are funded by industry Industry shapes media coverage 'Fact-checkers' cite media consensus Academia enforces approved conclusions This self-reinforcing system forms a perfect closed loop: Each component validates the others while excluding outside information. Try finding the entry point for actual truth in this closed system. The professional class’s pride in their critical thinking becomes darkly ironic—they’ve simply outsourced their opinions to 'authoritative sources.' Most disturbing is how willingly they’ve surrendered their sovereignty. Watch them defer: 'I follow the science' (translation: I wait for approved conclusions) 'According to experts' (translation: I don’t think for myself) 'Fact-checkers say' (translation: I let others determine truth) 'The consensus is' (translation: I align with power) Their empathy becomes a weapon used against them. Question lockdowns? You’re killing grandma. Doubt transition surgery for minors? You’re causing suicides. Resist equity initiatives? You’re perpetuating oppression. The programming works by making resistance feel like cruelty. Something remarkable is happening beneath the surface noise: a genuine awakening that defies traditional political boundaries. You see it in the subtle exchanges between colleagues when official narratives strain credibility. In the growing silence at dinner parties as propaganda talking points fall flat. In the knowing looks between strangers when public health theatre reaches new heights of absurdity. This isn’t a movement in the traditional sense—it can’t be, since traditional movement structures are vulnerable to infiltration, subversion, and capture. Instead, it’s more like a spontaneous emergence of pattern recognition. A distributed awakening without central leadership or formal organization. Those who see through the patterns recognize the mass formation for what it is, while its subjects project their own programming onto others, dismissing pattern recognition as 'conspiracy theories,' 'anti-science,' or other reflexive labels designed to prevent genuine examination. The hardest truth isn’t recognizing the programming—it’s confronting what it means for human consciousness and society itself. We’re watching real-time evidence that most human minds can be captured and redirected through sophisticated psychological operations. Their thoughts aren’t their own, yet they’d die defending what they’ve been programmed to believe. This isn’t just media criticism anymore—it’s an existential question about human consciousness and free will. What does it mean when a species’ capacity for independent thought can be so thoroughly hijacked? When natural empathy and moral instincts become weapons of control? When education and expertise actually decrease resistance to programming? The programming works because it hijacks core human drives: The need for social acceptance (e.g., masking as a visible symbol of conformity) The desire to be seen as good/moral (e.g., adopting performative stances on social issues without deeper understanding) The instinct to trust authority (e.g., faith in public health officials despite repeated policy reversals) The fear of ostracism (e.g., avoiding dissent to maintain social harmony) The comfort of conformity (e.g., parroting narratives to avoid cognitive dissonance) The addiction to status (e.g., signaling compliance to maintain professional or social standing) Each natural human trait becomes a vulnerability to be exploited. The most educated become the most programmable because their status addiction runs deepest. Their 'critical thinking' becomes a script running on corrupted hardware. This is the core challenge of our time: Can human consciousness evolve faster than the systems designed to hijack it? Can pattern recognition and awareness spread faster than manufactured consensus? Can enough people learn to read between the lies before the programming becomes complete? The stakes could not be higher. This isn’t just about politics or media literacy—it’s about the future of human consciousness itself. Whether our species maintains the capacity for independent thought may depend on those who can still access it helping others break free from the spell. The matrix of control deepens daily, but so does the awakening. The question is: Which spreads faster—the programming or the awareness of it? Our future as a species may depend on the answer.

5 Absurd Examples Of Government Waste In 2024 – OpEd	By Patrick Carroll Defenders of fiscal sanity have received quite a surprise with Trump’s new Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). For the first time in what seems like forever, complaining about government waste has almost become…cool. To all of the newcomers to this issue, we’d like to extend a warm welcome. Whether it was the DOGE hype or Milei’s chainsaw that brought you in—or, you know, a quick glance at the national debt—we’re glad you’re here. We’d also like you to know about a tradition we have in these parts of the political compass. You see, long before there was DOGE and the chainsaw, there was Senator Rand Paul’s annual Festivus Report (and long before that was Senator William Proxmire’s Golden Fleece Award). Named after the fictional 'Festivus' holiday from Seinfeld, celebrated on December 23, the Festivus Report is a compilation of some of the most egregious examples of government waste from the year. Part of Festivus, you see, is the traditional 'airing of grievances.' This year marks the tenth edition of the Report, and as usual, it’s full of the most absurd boondoggles you’ve ever heard of. Here are some of the highlights. 1) Tax Dollars for…Pickleball? The Department of the Interior is apparently investing in pickleball. Specifically, it recently provideda $12 million grant for a 30-court pickleball complex in Las Vegas. Pickleball players in Vegas clearly benefit from this initiative. But is it really fair to force taxpayers in Connecticut to pay for sports complexes in Nevada? Bastiat’s famous comment comes to mind: 'Government is that great fiction by which everyone tries to live at the expense of everyone else.' 2) Ghost Towns on the Government’s Dime One of the surprisingly large sources of government waste is money spent on maintaining empty or largely-empty government buildings. Senator Paul cites a recent Government Accountability Office (GAO) report that identified nearly $10 billion in federal funds wasted on empty office space. 'Most federal offices are ghost towns, with 17 out of 24 agencies using only 25% or less of their space in 2023,' Paul notes. 'Even the busiest offices barely reach 50% capacity…The GAO calculated building capacity based on usable square feet per employee. It found that many of these buildings are just oversized, expensive storage units for empty desks.' 3) Promoting DEI Among Bird Watchers The National Science Foundation (NSF) recently spent close to $300,000 on what seems to be a DEI initiative for bird-watching groups. 'In yet another shining example of wasteful government spending, the National Science Foundation has decided that the world of bird watching needs a dose of diversity, equity, and inclusion,' Paul writes. 'To that end, they’ve approved a grant of $288,563 to create ‘affinity groups’ within ornithological societies—basically, birdwatching clubs—based on identity characteristics…The goal, they say, is to ensure that birdwatching communities are more ‘inclusive.’' Regardless of where you stand on DEI, this kind of spending should raise a red flag on fiscal responsibility grounds alone. Surely there are more pressing needs than this? (Do the birds care about the gender identity of the people watching them?) 4) Advancing Fertilizer Use in Foreign Countries The tragically misnamed United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) is spending money on, well, not only the United States. The 2024 Festivus Report highlights that the USDA is spending $20 million on the Fertilize Right initiative 'to advance fertilizer use in Pakistan, Vietnam, Colombia, and Brazil.' This was one of a number of items in the Report that involved American taxpayer dollars going to foreign countries. 5) Money for Circus Performances The 2024 Festivus Report highlights $365,000 that has been spent by the National Endowment for the Arts (NEA) to promote circuses in city parks. Paul quotes the late David Boaz in his comments on this story: 'Government funding of anything means government control. As we should not want an established church, so we should not want established art.' Concentrated Benefits and Dispersed Costs Why does such government waste persist year after year? A significant part of the explanation traces back to the concept of concentrated benefits and dispersed costs. Essentially, the beneficiaries tend to be a small, concentrated group, so they lobby hard for these outlays because they stand to gain a lot from them. Taxpayers, on the other hand, tend to be dispersed and only minimally affected by any single expense, so it’s not usually worth it for them to lobby against the spending, or even learn about it in the first place. Economist Gordon Tullock famously illustrated this concept with his fictional Tullock Economic Development Plan. The plan 'involves placing a dollar of additional tax on each income tax form in the United States and paying the resulting funds to Tullock, whose economy would develop rapidly.' Think about the incentive Tullock would have to advocate for this plan, compared to the incentive that an ordinary taxpayer would have to look into it and voice their objections. With campaign contributions and votes to be gained from the special interest beneficiaries, is it any wonder politicians often go for these kinds of wealth transfers? The ubiquity and stubborn persistence—year after year—of all this waste, combined with the economic theory that explains why it happens, suggests that there is a fundamental problem with the process of government as we know it. This is not, as many are itching to believe, a 'Democrat' problem or a 'Republican' problem. The degree of government waste changes very little with changing administrations. No, this is a problem with the government as such. To solve this problem, we need to ask not just who should run the government, but what the government should be allowed to spend money on in the first place, given what we know about its entirely predictable and repeatedly demonstrated propensity for waste and dysfunction. Milei has already started that conversation in Argentina. Let’s hope that with the new Trump administration and DOGE, that’s a conversation we can have here as well.

How Malaysia Is Descending Into ‘Banana Republic’ Status – Analys...	The barbaric public caning of a man, breaking the reverence of a Mosque in Terengganu, and the dismissal of criminal charges against high level politicians and family members have greatly tarnished the image of Malaysia. Malaysia now barbarically intimidates people guilty of moral crimes, akin to long forgotten desert tribal states, ultra vires of the constitution. Public onlookers are something akin to a circus in an environment something like Ali Baba and the Forty Thieves. In Malaysia, the Forty Thieves get off from the judiciary, not only scot-free, but given the highest political positions in the land. The present prime minister was convicted and served a jail term for corruption, the current deputy prime minister was discharged from over 40 criminal charges, and the new Governor of Sabah, was also discharged from his criminal trials. The decline of Malaysia into something resembling ‘Banana Republic’ status didn’t just occur overnight. The events described above represent only the tip of the iceberg. The decay of governance within the Malaysian state has been going on for decades, being acerated over the last two years. This article argues why Malaysia could be categorised as a member of states referred to as ‘Banana Republics'. The balance of political power is now tilted towards the Malay rulers The British took great effort to establish the Malay rulers as the prime authorities on the area proclaimed as the Malay Peninsula. They (the British) used this authority to rule. Now the power of the Malay rulers is in a renascence. The Anwar administration has allowed the power of the rulers to increase through the introduction of the 3Rs (speech about race, religion, and rulers), where discussion about those subjects is taboo. This has effectively eliminated any criticisms of the monarchy. Without any public criticism, the monarchy now escapes any transparency and accountability concerning interference in government affairs and business dealings. The rulers’ actions can go beyond constitutional limitations without question. The monarchy now has a free rein, they have never experienced since federation. There are no constitutional checks and balances because of the lack of public accountability. The role of the monarchy in ‘who rules’ is now very powerful. This is especially the case as much of the ‘Malay vote’ is split, leading to ‘hung parliamentary results’, where backroom negotiation determines which group or coalition becomes the government. This is the legacy of GE15, which will be most likely repeated in GE16. Governments are now made upon deals and pledges, which anchors future government decisions. The above drastically changes the nature of democracy in Malaysia today. Democracy cannot be understood without factoring in the role and influence of the monarchy. Foreign investors must be aware of these facts in the business sectors these circumstances affect, particularly at state level. Major political parties practising fraudulent democracy A warped democracy exists within the very foundations of most of the major political parties. The ‘no contesting’ rule for the top party positions and deferring elections two or even four years makes a mockery of democracy. The result of the above, is that the same old faces dominate most political parties, and by extension governments. This inhibits change and protects a group of Malay political elites, who have been at the top of the national political scene for decades. Even the current prime minister was a deputy prime minister in a previous administration almost four decades ago. There are a number of political dynasties across the political spectrum, where leadership has become a family business. This severely hinders the off the rise of fresh faces to come into government. This isn’t seen in many other countries. With the Malay old guard still in command policy development, ideas have become so bankrupt. The New Economic Policy (NEP) has been turned into something ideologically apartheid, as a tool of domination, allowing the development of a very wealthy elite. Such policies are destroying Malaysian competitiveness internationally. No level playing fields in the economy With government linked companies linked companies (GLCs) combined have a market capitalisation of RM 952 billion, this is almost half the total capitalisation on Bursa Malaysia. Many GLCs are rent-seekers supported by artificial monopolies The hopes of diversifying the Malaysian economy are slim. The government relies on a low-cost base to attract investors. Although Malaysia is successfully attracting investment in data centres, massive rises in the electricity tariffs in 2025, could change the minds of future investors. In addition, the growing uncertainty of social media licensing, could act as a further deterrent. Monopolies in strategic foods like rice are preventing innovation. Cronyism at state level in land, construction, and infrastructure development are a deterrent to new players and new investments. Most major consortiums in major projects at state level are made up of locally based-crony companies. Such an environment fixated upon rent-seeking activities and favouring politically connected consortiums just isn’t helping develop new sectors and badly needed innovation. An International Institute for Management (IMD), World Competitiveness Ranking 2024, saw Malaysia fall to 37th position, out of 67 countries. This corresponds to many other indexes that have shown the decline of Malaysia’s productivity over the last decade. Although Malaysian FDI has dramatically increased over the last two years, this must be compared with the foreign direct outflows over the same period. Net direct foreign investment hasn’t changed very much over the last two years. This may indicate that many foreign forms are leaving to seek lower cost countries. There is a potential issue of capital flight here. Many foreign investors to Malaysia are still facing bureaucratic issues that don’t exist elsewhere. These include simple things like the difficulty of opening a bank account, obtaining a work permit, obtaining necessary business licenses, and use their own paid-up capital. One of the most absurd requirements in the freight forwarding industry is that foreign investors can hold 100% equity, while local non-Bumiputeras are only able to hold 49%. A country that cannot develop a competitive economy, is a country doomed to remaining third-world, and fall behind the rest of the countries in the region. Neighbours, Indonesia and Thailand have shot up in the IMD competitiveness rankings, leaving Malaysia behind. The roots of poor competitiveness in apartheid ideologies The NEP, which promoted a resurgence in Ketuanan Melayu or Malay superiority ideology has left its mark in the institutionalisation of apartheid in Malaysia. The bloated 1.7 million civil service is traditionally used as a voter base for Malay-centric governments. The current one no exception. With the continual practice of giving pay rises to civil servants before elections, with no improved productivity goals, has led the civil service into mass inefficiency. Governments depend upon the civil service more than the civil service depends upon the government, so leaders within the civil service have much bargaining power over elected governments. The truth is that the civil service, sometimes with elite appointed consultants is the group that actually formulates much public policy. Sitting executive branch government actually has less influence upon policy than most believe. That’s partly why, governments don’t look much different from one another, only the narratives. The nation requires much administrative reform to make it more competitive, but for the above political reasons, this is unlikely to happen. The other major area where apartheid has shaped the nature of the nation’s institution is education. Public education is a domain of Malay apparatchiks, who have over the decades produced curriculums irrelevant to the society of today. Standards have declined since the British 'O' and 'A' levels were abolished. Systems of grading don’t even begin to measure meritocracy, where students graduate in this sheltered environment. At some universities, no students are failed, leading to an overall sub-standard cohort of workers in the economy. One only needs to look at education in neighbouring countries. Intrinsic skills of critical thinking, are much higher in students from Indonesia, Thailand, and Vietnam. This is very much reflected in those respective nations’ competitiveness. Apartheid doesn’t create meritocracy. With the majority of Malaysia’s senior positions in government reserved for Malays, the nation is only utilising a little more than half of its talent pool. A crooked legal system Since Anwar Ibrahim has become prime minister, a number of high-profile court cases were terminated with a 'Discharge Not Amounting to an Acquittal' (DNAA), allowing the political elite defendants to walk free from the courts. These included the deputy prime minister Ahmad Zahid Hamidi, former prime minister Najib Razak and his wife Rosmah Mansor. In addition, former prime minister Najib Razak had his prison sentence reduced by the pardons board from 12 years to 6 years, with a 75% discount on his fine reduced from RM 210 million to RM 55 million. The Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission (MACC) has acted as the government’s attack dog to investigate and humiliate Anwar’s former adversaries through call ups for interview regarding allegations in the Panama Papers, without laying any charges. The current modus operandi of the police is the bullying and intimidation of critics of the government with impunity. The police in collaboration with the MACC and the Islamic Development Department (JAKIM) conduct raids on citizens, rarely leading to any criminal charges ever being laid. Most of these raids are about public comments and moral issues not affecting third parties. Lawfare and persecution are now specialities of the state. A number of prominent opposition politicians have been dramatically arrested, while the press was accompanying the police and charged with draconian laws such as sedition. There is great conjecture as to whether the Attorney General’s Chambers has been purposely throwing cases involving political allies of Anwar and his ‘unity government’. This is as the judicial system is being used to attack and silence critics overseas. British journalist Claire Rewcastle Brown was sentenced to two-years prison in absentia over a book covering corruption in the 1MDB financial scandal. Malaysia clearly has a two-tier system of justice where politically aligned elites are ignored, while ordinary citizens receive harsh penalties for petty crimes. The Orwellian state The MCMC is becoming the most powerful government agency under the Anwar administration. The use of the MCMC’s powers have greatly increased since the ‘unity government’ came to power in 2022. The MCMC and its minister Fahmi Fadzil have been in the news on a weekly basis. Soon after becoming minister in early 2023, Fahmi said on live Tik Tok chat that if anyone criticized him, they should expect a ‘radio car’ outside there house. The MCMC has blocked a number of news and blogger websites that were critical of the government. notices to social media platform, over what the MCMC considers to be defamatory, fake or obscene. Malaysia fell 34 places, from 73 to 109 in the 2024 annual Reporters without Borders (RSF) Press Freedom Index. A social media licensing requirements commences on January 1, 2025, with most Big Tech platforms opposed to the new scheme. The MCMC has carved out a pseudo-judiciary role for itself, where it acts as investigator, judge, and punisher over Malaysia’s online environment. The mainstream media and most online news portals, with only a few exceptions, very rigorously practise self-censorship. Thus, the media today amounts to little more than a mouthpiece of the government. Towards a Banana Republic As the MCMC has been transforming itself into a cyber-gestapo, Muslims in Malaysia are becoming much more restricted about the way they can live, because of further encroachment by politicised Islamic institutions. Over the recent Christmas period Muslims were forbidden to attend any function with a Christmas tree present. Islam is being used as a means of control. With the opposition persecuted, the police, MCMC, and MACC weaponised to create a restrictive society, where citizens now live in fear. The Anwar regime is clearly neo-feudalistic, and widening the gap between the top wealthy elite and the middle classes. Ordinary Malays without ‘godfathers’, ‘cables’, or connections cannot expect to share any of the privileges the elite enjoy, under the pretext of positive discrimination towards Bumiputeras. The elites have a deep sense of entitlement, with crony corporations stripping natural resources such as forests for their own benefit, and selling off strategic assets to foreign companies at bargain basement prices. Those who criticise them face the full force of the law. The current leadership of the ‘unity government' are either convicted felons, or been released from corruption charges by courts under the current government. The economy cannot expected to become competitive if 30-40 percent of government spending disappears through leakage. These are the beginnings of a nation resembling what could be called a ‘Banana Republic’.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWdLCAd9F8tI7GzTrPWtOTXg	2024-12-31T15:36:19-08:00	
Year In Review: A Tectonic Shift Has Only Just Begun – OpEd	As we’re approaching the final hours of 2024, it is a good time to take a step back and remember what this year taught us. History might not repeat itself, but it does rhyme, as the saying goes, and the past is always the best teacher to prepare us for the future. For many of our fellow humans, 2024 was yet another turbulent year, filled with terrible strife, war, death, pain and indescribable suffering. The two ongoing war fronts and the images that reach us all directly and live through our phones, have proven that war is indeed the health of the State. There is no other explanation as to why these conflicts are still raging and why the human death toll is still climbing to this day. Over the last year, humanity has once again been defeated by special interests, politicians, lobbyists and all kinds of other misanthropes. However, those who know me also know that I am a hopeless optimist. Even in the face of such destruction and carnage, I still believe in our shared human bond and I am convinced that in virtue, kindness and decency will eventually prevail. I also see the silver linings, faint as they may be. For example, this past year didn’t only bring us darkness: it will also proved to us that rays of light and hope still exist. Many brave individuals did their best to make difference, either though their actions or their words. A lot of others, that normally wouldn’t even dream of questioning the State narrative, whatever it might be at any given time, started to do so. Many of them realized that if the evidence of their own eyes doesn’t match the 'official version of events' that is being pushed by their governments and regurgitated by every mainstream media outlet, then they should rather trust the former. And we must all keep in mind that this is no small feat. Opposing these narratives or even asking questions about them is becoming more and more risky these days. As the notion of free speech now already seems like a thing of the past, as citizens in the West are getting fines and even prison time for social media posts and as any sort of dissent is being brutally crushed by any and all means available, raising basic objections and concerns is becoming a dangerous act of rebellion. However, thanks to the global interconnectivity and sense of borderless community that the internet has brought us, these rebellious voices can no longer be that easily stifled. Social media platforms may try to silence them, but they still find each other, they debate and learn from each other. This gives me great hope for the future, as like-minded, freedom- and peace-loving individuals can come together and empower one another to break free from the State’s shackles and they can leave behind the all the absurdities, the deception and the exploitation of the current system. They can cooperate, 'opt-out' of the sociopolitical and economic order that the State has to offer and build something much better, much more productive, innovative, and most of all, free. Over the last year, we saw a lot of steps in the right direction. Chief among them, is the the massive political shift in the US, but also in Europe too. The Trump victory was a reflection of the frustration of the masses that were being asked for way too long to reject the evidence of their own eyes. The economy was not booming as they were told, at least not for them. Inflation was not under control as their political and institutional leaders insisted. The average voter’s paycheck was shrinking as the stock market was soaring, fueling their justified anger and resentment toward the 'ruling class', those connected to the State and all its institutions. Crime, inequality, education and healthcare and other very long standing structural problems were also not getting better, as the politicians and the media insisted. This is why a clear majority of the US voting population decided to bring back President Trump. A lot of people around the world also rejoiced at the victory, believing it would mean better days ahead on the geopolitical front at least, as Trump has always maintained his intention to end both wars as soon as possible. However, we must all remember that the least of two evils is not the equivalent of good. Just because the extreme Left was defeated, with all their absurd economic and social interventions, as well as their hawkishness, it doesn’t mean that one should embrace Trump as some kind of messiah. He is still a politician, he sought power (quite fiercely as well) over others and he is still just one piece in an enormous State machine that really doesn’t care who wins the election. The machine hums along no matter who is in symbolically at the helm. This is a lesson that Europeans need to understand too, and everyone else for that matter. Freedom doesn’t come from above, it isn’t merely handed to us by some benevolent dictator. It comes from within, as it is the individual mind that must be liberated first and foremost. That is my wish to all of us for the New Year.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWdLCAd9F8tI7FhdwK0ORpRD	2024-12-31T15:34:25-08:00	
The Czech Republic’s Shifting Support For Myanmar’s Democracy – A...	By Federica Cidale and Kristina Kironska The Czech Republic’s position as one of Europe’s most consistent supporters of Myanmar’s pro-democracy movement shows signs of weakening. Junta representatives gained unprecedented access to prominent Czech officials in 2024, giving the military regime in Myanmar propaganda victories. The Czech Republic’s support for democracy in Myanmar stems from the early 1990s friendship between Vaclav Havel and Aung San Suu Kyi. In 1991, Havel nominated Aung San Suu Kyi for the Nobel Peace Prize — which she won — believing it would bring international attention to the people’s struggle against Myanmar’s military regime, which ruled the country from 1962. Havel also wrote the preface to Aung San Suu Kyi’s essay collection Freedom From Fear. He also provided material support to her party, the National League for Democracy party. The Czech Republic granted asylum to dozens of Myanmar refugees in the early 2000s. Non-profit organisations like Burma Center Prague emerged to support people in exile and, in the 2010s, to assist Myanmar’s transition to democracy. After the February 2021 military coup, the Czech Republic demanded respect for the November 2020 parliamentary election results and allowed the National Unity Government (NUG), the anti-junta shadow government, to open a representative office in Prague. It remains one of only two NUG offices in the European Union, with the other in France. The Prague office is headed by Linn Thant, a former student protester jailed after the 1988 uprising and granted political asylum in the Czech Republic in 2011. NUG engagement with Czech officials proved substantial throughout 2022. NUG Human Rights Minister Aung Myo Min urged Czech Deputy Foreign Minister Jiri Kozak to address Myanmar’s human rights violations at the UN Human Rights Council. NUG Foreign Minister Zin Mar Aung met with Czech Chamber of Deputies Speaker, Marketa Pekarova Adamova, who reaffirmed that only the elected civilian government held Czech backing. In 2022, the Czech Republic informal Parliamentary Group of Friends of Democratic Burma/Myanmar was founded, led by politician Josef Flek. On the second anniversary of the coup in 2023, the group pushed a resolution through the Czech Parliament’s Foreign Affairs Committee condemning the junta’s human rights violations and calling for international support of the democratic movement. France has shown similar commitment, with its Senate recognising the NUG as Myanmar’s official government in October 2021, consistently condemning the junta’s actions and engaging with NUG officials on several occasions. Germany strongly condemned the coup in February 2021 and engaged with NUG representatives to a limited extent. Other EU states have shown less interest in the issue. Italy and Spain condemned the coup but limited their response to collective EU actions. Most other EU countries avoided significant engagement with the junta. The Czech Republic initially restricted contact with junta representatives despite allowing their presence at the Myanmar embassy in Prague. It even downgraded its diplomatic relations, leaving its Yangon embassy without an ambassador. Similarly, the German embassy in Myanmar is now led by a charge d’affaires, effectively downgrading its diplomatic ties. A concerning shift emerged in 2024. Junta representatives have started meeting with prominent Czech officials.Htuann Naung, charge d’affaires at Myanmar’s embassy in Prague, attended two diplomatic meetings in January 2024, the first hosted by Czech Foreign Minister Jan Lipavsky and the second by Czech Senate President Milos Vystrcil. Subsequent encounters included Czech Prime Minister Petr Fiala in February and Deputy Foreign Minister Eduard Hulicius in August, culminating in a handshake with Czech President Petr Pavel in October. The Global New Light of Myanmar, the junta’s mouthpiece, reported that Htuann Naung attended a Diplomatic Corps reception on Czech National Day and a State Decorations Ceremony on Czechoslovak Independence Day at Prague Castle. The junta uses photographs of Htuann Naung with Czech President Pavel at these events as propaganda to bolster its domestic and international legitimacy. The junta exploits such encounters to project legitimacy. It did the same when Htuann Naung met with Jakub Starek, a district mayor in Prague, in 2023. Though Starek emphasised the meeting’s non-political nature, the junta leveraged these photos as propaganda to validate its regime. This situation is concerning given the Czech Republic’s historical support for Myanmar’s democracy. While junta representatives gain visibility, NUG figures like Linn Thant face exclusion from high-profile events. The change risks undermining Czech solidarity with Myanmar’s democratic movement and demoralising democracy advocates who view the Czech Republic as an example of resilience against authoritarianism. Recent global crises in Ukraine and the Middle East might explain this position shift. These conflicts have diverted attention from Myanmar’s civil war in Myanmar, perhaps making Czech officials less mindful of their Myanmar encounters. The Czech position alone might not alter EU policy. The bloc adopted eight sanctions packages targeting the junta, suspended development funds and the ‘Everything but Arms’ scheme and its parliament supports the NUG. Yet Czech influence has been crucial in maintaining Myanmar’s presence on the EU agenda. Closer Czech ties with the regime could reduce EU allies advocating for Myanmar’s anti-junta resistance. This shift by a long-term democracy advocate risks damaging the EU’s credibility as a champion of global human rights and undermining its broader policy strategies.

Challenges And Opportunities For India In War-Torn Myanmar – Anal...	The unending war in North Myanmar between the Yangon-based military junta and the Ethnic Armed Organisations (EAOs) is posing a serious challenge to India's security in its own North Eastern region comprising the States of Nagaland, Mizoram and Manipur. The spill over from the war is disturbing the ethnic equilibrium in India's North East and also threatening its overall security, especially with a hostile China and an alienated Bangladesh being in close proximity to the scene of action. India has been supporting the junta despite the West's displeasure about the world's largest democracy not giving a helping hand to the struggling democratic movement in Myanmar led by Nobel Peace Laureate Aung San Suu Kyi. India has been supplying arms to Myanmar. It was the third-largest supplier of arms before the February 2021 military coup. And according to the UN, sales from Indian firms amounted to US$ 51 million in weapons and materiel for the junta since the coup. The other reason for India to support the military government is that the military could not be wished away in Myanmar politics given the history of the country in which the army, or the Tatmadaw as it is called, has ruled the country directly or indirectly since the 1960s. There is also a legitimate fear in India that the warring ethnic groups may balkanize Myammar, fomenting more chaos. The Bamar, who are the majority community in Myanmar, are entirely Buddhist. But most ethnic groups are mostly Christian. And the Rohingyas of Bengali origin in Arakan, are Muslim. They are together now but could well go at each other's throats once the junta is done away with. As pointed out earlier, EAOs operating on the India-Myanmar border, have links with kindred tribal groups in the North Eastern Indian States of Manipur, Mizoram and Nagaland. Local ethnic groups with cross-border social links have pressurised New Delhi to keep the border with Myanmar porous. For example, the Mizoram government has openly challenged the Indian Home Ministry's direction to barricade the border. India fears infiltration of gun runners and terror groups. In Manipur, the Christian Kukis attack the Hindu Meities with the help of the Chins and Zos from Myanmar as these are kindred tribes. At present these EAOs are kept under some control by the New Delhi-friendly junta in Yangon. But once the junta exits (after its military defeat), the EAOs will have a free hand to support movements of their kinsmen on the Indian side. For example, the Christian Kukis who have been battling the Hindu Meities in Manipur, are already getting the support of the Chin and the Zo tribes across the India-Myanmar border. The Kukis, Chins and Zos form one big ethnic conglomeration collectively called the Zo. Chin-Kuki gun-running across the boundary is on already. India-China Conflict India has, for long, supported the junta on the plea that if it did not do so, China would continue to enjoy a monopoly over the junta denying a place for India in Myanmar. Since the 2021 military coup, China has transferred military jets to the Junta. Indian officials had also confronted the junta over possible Chinese intelligence facilities on Myanmar's Coco Islands. China is said to be putting pressure on the armed groups in the Kachin and Shan states to make peace with the Myanmar junta. Kachin is Myanmar's northernmost State, bordering China. Shan State is also bordered by China. Given China's links with the junta, India should befriend the EAOs, some Indian commentators say. The EAOs are friendly with Aung San Suu Kyi's National League for Democracy (NLD), which heads the National Union Government (NUG). The NLD and NUG are anti-China and pro-West. Zo Tum Hmung and John Indergaard in a paper published by the United States Institute for Peace urge India to intervene in Myanmar in its own interest. They also urge the US to support India in this venture. According to them, over 50,000 civilians have fled across the border from Myanmar's Chin State and Sagaing Region into India's North East. This should worry India, they point out. According to these commentators, the People's Liberation Army of Manipur and Manipur Naga People's Front, which are fighting the Indian government for greater autonomy, have used Myanmar as a staging ground for attacks in India. In November 2021 they ambushed a convoy of the Assam Rifles. The authors of the paper welcome White House's April 4, 2023 statement rejecting China's claims on the Indian State of Arunachal Pradesh. Indo-US intelligence cooperation has the proven potential to check China's pressure tactics, they point out. More broadly, Washington should emphasize to New Delhi that a more assertive stance on Myanmar will blunt the expansion of Chinese influence in South Asia, they urge. 'The US Congress has shown real leadership on Myanmar, authorizing US$ 136 million in funding for pro-democracy groups and humanitarian aid with the BURMA Act of 2022,' Tum Hmung and Indergaard say. India's High Stakes India has a number of on-going development projects in Myanmar, but the most important among them is the Kaladan Multimodal Transport Transit Project (KMTTP). The objective of this US$ 400 million project is to transport goods from Kolkata port in West Bengal State to Mizoram through Myanmar, bypassing Bangladesh. Goods will be transported by ship from Kolkata and other places on India's eastern seaboard to Sittwe port in Rakhine State and then taken upstream along the Kaladan River to Paletwa in Chin State, from where they will be transported by road to Mizoram. India has already executed the dredging and construction of new jetties at Sittwe, and developed the Paletwa river port. Construction of the highway from Zorinpui in Mizoram to Paletwa has, however, been held up because of the war in that area, Swarajya says. This transit route is strategically and economically important for India because it offers a second and more secure route from West Bengal State in India to India's North Eastern States as compared to the existing one through the 'Chicken's Neck' corridor in North Bengal. The 'Chicken Neck' is a narrow corridor that can be easily closed by an invading Chinese army. And an anti-India Bangladesh can cooperate with China in closing the 'Chicken Neck.' Significantly, it was at Doklam near the 'Chicken Neck' that Indian and Chinese armies had a 73-day standoff in 2017. India has signed a number of transit protocols for the transportation of goods through Bangladesh. But given the on-going faceoff between the two countries after the ouster of the pro-Indian Bangladesh Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, transit through Bangladesh has become problematic. Hence the enhanced importance of the Kaladan project. India cosies up to EAOs Seeing the emerging scenario in Myanmar, India has started moving towards the rebel groups. Opponents of Myanmar's ruling junta attended a seminar in New Delhi on November 5 and 6, organized by the Indian Council for World Affairs (ICWA). The Indian External Affairs Ministry spokesman Randhir Jaiswal said on November 6 that the conference, was designed to 'help develop a Myanmar-led and Myanmar-owned solution to address the country's current challenges.' He went on to pledge India's 'steadfast support' for Myanmar's democracy and stability. With this, has India may have stolen a march over China. India's next steps are eagerly awaited by the pro-democracy groups in Myanmar. However, there is doubt about American backing given President-elect Donald Trump's inward-looking policies and his transactional approach in international relations. The Myanmar daily The Irrawaddy fears that if Trump strikes economically advantageous deals with China, he may turn a blind eye to Myanmar and to what Beijing is doing there. And the junta may still have the last word.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWdLCAd9F8tI7DL56dlwcthD	2024-12-31T15:31:27-08:00	
How Questions Of Sovereignty And Security Are Fueling Instability...	By Jonathan Lessware As a piece of geopolitical theater, the timing was hard to beat. Chad’s foreign minister announced the end of military cooperation with France just hours after his French counterpart left the country. That it took place on Nov. 28, as Chad celebrated its Republic Day—a key date in its move away from French colonial rule—only added to the symbolism. On the same day, Senegal also suggested French troops should leave. It was a seminal moment in post-colonial relations between France and the Sahel—the belt of nations south of the Sahara that stretches across Africa. The departure of French troops from Chad and Senegal means France will no longer have a military presence in a region where it has long held sway. The political dynamics of the Sahel have been rapidly shifting in recent years, and 2024 was no exception. Chad’s decision to end its defense pact with France was one of the most significant events in a year that saw a continuation of the shift away from Western influence. In the past three years, France has withdrawn troops from Mali, Burkina Faso and Niger, as a wave of coups brought military regimes hostile to French influence into power. These governments have looked elsewhere—to Russia, China, and Turkiye—for defense cooperation, dealing a major blow to Western hopes of maintaining a security presence in a region that has become a melting pot for extremist groups. The year began with Mali, Burkina Faso and Niger announcing they would leave the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS)—a regional bloc established to help maintain financial and political security. There is widespread concern that the shrinking of this influential bloc of nations will lead to further instability. Indeed, the backdrop for the past year of turmoil has been an ever-deteriorating security situation across the Sahel, with a growing number of civilians maimed and killed amid extremist insurgencies. Chad’s decision to end its defense cooperation with France came in stark contrast to the ambitious Sahel security policy it enacted more than 10 years earlier. In 2012, northern Mali was overrun by militants allied to Al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb. As they expanded south toward the capital, Mali appealed to its former colonizer for help. In early 2013, France deployed 1,700 troops as part of Operation Serval. The initial mission appeared to work as the militants fled northern towns. But the insurgency soon spread to neighboring countries. In response, France expanded the operation in 2014 to include five states—Burkina Faso, Chad, Mali, Mauritania, and Niger. It deployed more than 5,000 soldiers and rebranded it Operation Barkhane. Meanwhile, the insurgency grew, with militant factions aligning into two main groups: the Al-Qaeda offshoot Jama’at Nusrat Al-Islam wal-Muslimin and the Sahel branch of Daesh. The failure to suppress the militants in Mali in the long term was one of the reasons for the 2020 coup that led to a deterioration in relations with France. In 2022, President Emmanuel Macron withdrew French troops from Mali as Russian mercenaries increased their presence. A similar pattern followed in Burkina Faso and Niger, where populations turned against the French presence, military coups ensued, and France had to withdraw its troops. While Chad’s decision to evict French troops was not driven by a military coup, it came amid increasing hostility toward the French across the region. 'After 66 years since the independence of the Republic of Chad, it is time for Chad to assert its full sovereignty and redefine its strategic partnerships according to national priorities,' Abderaman Koulamallah, Chad’s foreign minister, said. 'This decision, taken after in-depth analysis, marks a historic turning point.' Many analysts feel this was a turning point of France’s own making, stemming from its neo-colonial policies that limited the sovereignty of Sahel nations. 'Since independence, France has intervened in Chad and other former colonies, providing regime survival packages and interfering in domestic politics,' Ulf Laessing, head of the Sahel program at the Konrad Adenauer Foundation, told Arab News. There has been increasing hostility toward the region’s monetary system, which many view as a relic from the colonial era that allows France to maintain excessive control over their economies. The African Financial Community (CFA) franc monetary zone applies across 14 countries in West and Central Africa and is pegged to the euro. Critics say it strips those countries of an independent national monetary policy. This has fed growing resentment of the French presence in the region. 'The continued French interference in domestic affairs has created substantial anti-French sentiment in its former colonies,' said Laessing. 'No ruler in Africa can be seen close to France as they would face a public backlash. This was one of the reasons why Chad decided to end the military partnership with France.' The deteriorating security situation has added to that resentment. An attack by the extremist group Boko Haram near the border with Nigeria in October killed at least 40 Chadian soldiers. Opposition parties said the French presence had failed to prevent the attack. Reports preceding the French foreign minister’s visit in November suggested France was already planning a major troop reduction in African countries, including cutting numbers in Chad from 1,000 to 300. However, the full withdrawal from Chad means that the last operational French base in Africa will be in Djibouti on the Red Sea coast, which Macron visited on Dec. 20. For Chad, losing French military support is a significant concern for the multinational force battling Boko Haram in the Lake Chad Basin—an area that includes parts of Chad, Cameroon, Niger, and Nigeria. 'The withdrawal is good news for Boko Haram,' said Laessing. 'I don’t think that the US and Britain will be able to contribute to the Lake Chad force without French logistical support.' In 2019, French jets stopped a rebel column approaching the capital to topple then-President Idriss Deby. He was killed in 2021 in further clashes with militants and replaced by his son, Mahamat Deby Itno. 'Chad’s decision to expel French troops is a dangerous move for President Mahamat Deby because the main function of the French jets based in the Chadian capital is to protect the government against rebel attacks, which are frequent in this fragile country,' said Laessing. The two Mirage 2000-D fighter jets left Chad for France on Dec. 10. It was not just France that saw its position in the Sahel eroded in 2024. In March, Niger announced it would end military cooperation with the US. By mid-September, the withdrawal of 1,100 American troops was complete, ending an extensive counter-terrorism operation run out of two air bases. As the Americans left, the Russians moved in, with military advisers arriving from Moscow in May. In 2024, the growing alliance of Mali, Burkina Faso, and Niger represented a seismic shift in the region’s balance of power. As violence surged, a record 7,620 people were killed in the Sahel in the first six months of 2024—a 9 percent increase from 2023 and a staggering 190 percent rise from 2021. Many fear the geopolitical changes in the region will make Sahel nations even more unstable. With little hope of political or military solutions, the conflicts are likely to persist, leaving vulnerable populations in greater peril in the year ahead.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWdLCAd9F8tI7NzduguKaRuc	2024-12-31T15:30:02-08:00	
Post-G20 Rio: Promises To Address Root Causes Of Migration, Globa...	By Aline Barros As G20 leaders convened in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, in November, they set an ambitious goal to lift 600 million people out of poverty by 2030, highlighting the urgent need to address poverty and global health care — the root causes of migration and forced displacement. During the summit, experts said the world's 20 largest economies have the capacity to lessen the impact of the root causes through social policies and regional migration agreements. Experts like Paulo Illes, founder of the Center for Immigrant Human Rights and Citizenship, emphasized the importance of recognizing migration issues as legitimate. 'That must always be addressed from a human rights perspective,' Illes told VOA. 'Additionally, G20 leaders should acknowledge that migration also occurs due to structural issues such as poverty, environmental disasters, wars and conflicts.' Euclimar Fuentes, a Venezuelan migrant living in Sao Paulo, Brazil, is an example of how these issues converged. Born in Venezuela, Fuentes remembers a happy childhood there. 'We would go to the beach for breakfast as a family. Culturally, life was beautiful in Venezuela,' she told VOA. Her father’s retirement after years as a police officer gave the family a comfortable life. The situation in Venezuela deteriorated during the COVID-19 pandemic because of a combination of preexisting economic, political and social crises compounded by the global health emergency. 'It’s difficult when a family, a whole community, is left without food, electricity, energy or water. It’s hard to live in a country where you have nothing to eat,' Fuentes said. Her family’s challenges intensified when her son was diagnosed with leukemia in December 2020. 'We tried to treat him there, but it was hard,' she told VOA, adding that many children died in the same circumstances: no resources, no treatment, nothing to eat. 'We didn’t want him to be part of that system [and die],' she said. On December 26, 2020, Fuentes and her family left Venezuela. They considered different countries, including the United States, but because of her son’s illness and the path for humanitarian status, they chose Brazil, which according to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees is home to about 61,000 Venezuelans. G20 declaration The G20’s official declaration highlighted the need to address the root causes of displacement, including hunger and poverty. The U.N. estimates that 2.4 billion people worldwide live in poverty, a crisis that has increased migration, Brazilian Development Minister Wellington Dias said. 'But beyond the migration issue,' Dias told VOA, 'Hunger and poverty are not just problems for those who are hungry or living in poverty. It’s a problem for the middle class, for the wealthy, for rich countries and for wealthy individuals.' The declaration included creating the Global Alliance Against Hunger and Poverty, which aims to implement policies such as cash transfers to 500 million people, school meals for 150 million children, and health services for 200 million women and young children. Funding is expected to come from at least 40 nations, 13 global organizations and various nonprofits and foundations, managed through several financial institutions. 'It’s no longer just giving food baskets,' Dias said. 'We are talking about implementing a development plan that must address education, which is a key foundation for eradicating poverty, as well as health, the economy, job creation and infrastructure.' The U.N. noted that food insecurity, migration and displacement are intricately linked to climate change, natural disasters, conflicts and poverty — all major conversations at the G20 summit. The challenges faced during the COVID-19 pandemic further highlighted these connections, with health crises, economic hardship and displacement driving increased migration in the Western Hemisphere, Dias said. Steve Seide, a 22-year-old political science student from Haiti, also embodied the struggles faced by many migrants. He left his homeland in 2023 because of a lack of jobs and increasing security concerns. 'I chose Brazil because I heard of work opportunities and how welcoming Brazilian people are,' he told VOA. Seide’s journey to Brazil was dangerous and expensive. To reach his destination, he crossed without documentation into the Dominican Republic. 'The first time, I did not get in. But I went back to the border,' he said. After spending a month in the Dominican Republic, he eventually secured a humanitarian visa and is on a path to a stable life in Brazil. 'In life, you can’t stop. If you need to get somewhere, you have to fight until the end,' he said. Future response efforts The global response to the pandemic also took center stage at the G20 summit, where the United States spearheaded efforts to secure new contributions toward a $2 billion pandemic fund, pledging up to $667 million by 2026. The goal is to help developing countries prepare for and respond to future pandemics. However, U.S. participation in this initiative is subject to congressional approval. Member countries also agreed to establish 'a governance mechanism that integrates the key players in the global health security and financing ecosystem, with the World Health Organization at the center.' As G20 leaders sought to address the interconnected challenges of migration, poverty and global health, stories like those of Fuentes and Seide underscored the importance of international cooperation and sustainable solutions. 'When you have your home, your piece of land, your family, you don’t think about leaving,' Fuentes said, adding that being separated from her loved ones is still 'very hard.' 'It’s been three years, but it’s still hard. Leaving everything behind, not knowing when you’ll see your loved ones again — it’s a pain that doesn’t go away. … Leaving was the hardest thing we’ve ever done. But sometimes, it’s the only choice you have to protect who you love,' she said.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWdLCAd9F8tI7AxB4abWU-yY	2024-12-31T15:28:16-08:00	
Robert Reich: How About If Canada Annexes Blue America? – OpEd	Trump wants to buy Greenland and annex Canada as the 51st American state. When I first heard these ideas I thought he was joking, but as with all things Trump, he’s not … quite. Last week, while naming a new ambassador to Denmark (which controls Greenland’s foreign and defense affairs), Trump made clear that his first-term offer to buy Greenland could, in the coming term, become a deal the Danes cannot refuse. He seems to want Greenland because of its strategic location at a time when the melting of Arctic ice is opening new commercial and naval competition. He’s also interested in Greenland’s reserves of rare earth minerals needed for advanced technology. But Trump isn’t stopping there. He also wants to annex Canada. This proposal appears more a public needling of Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau than a serious plan. Yet Trump has continued to tease the idea of annexing Canada on social media. 'I think it’s a great idea,' he wrote in a recent post. This is all bonkers, of course. But as long as we’re considering changing national borders, why not do it in a more sensible way? How about the West Coast states of Washington, Oregon, and California becoming the 11th province of Canada? After all, the politics of these blue states would fit much better with Canada’s than with Trump’s America. Meanwhile, the New England states (Maine, Vermont, New Hampshire, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, and Connecticut) and New York could become the 12th Canadian province, for much the same reason. While Trump is toying with the idea of annexing Canada, these blue American states should bid him goodbye and be annexed by Canada. Hell, Trump might just go along. He doesn’t like these blue states anyway. They all voted against him in 2016, 2020, and again in 2024. He’s been looking for ways of getting even. Why not simply disown them? Letting Canada annex these blue states would also simplify Trump’s war on undocumented immigrants, since many of them reside in these states. America First Legal, a nonprofit run by Trump’s incoming deputy chief of staff for policy, Stephen Miller, has already written to local elected officials in California and New York warning them not to try to become sanctuaries — threatening that the officials could be personally 'criminally liable' if they refuse to support federal government efforts to detain and deport illegal immigrants. But if California, New York, and other blue states were annexed by Canada, the problem disappears. Of course, this leaves the pesky question of whether Canada would accept America’s West Coast as its 11th province and New York and New England as its 12th? I’ll leave that question to Canadians.

North Korean Soldiers Fighting With Outdated Weapons, Ukrainian S...	By Park Jaewoo and Lee Sangmin North Korean soldiers are fighting with deteriorated supplies and outdated weapons and may have been carrying no food rations during their recent combat operations in Russia’s Kursk region, a Ukrainian special operations sergeant told Radio Free Asia. Mykhailo Makaruk of the 8th Special Operations Regiment said he came to the realization after searching through uniforms of North Korean soldiers who had been killed in Russia’s Kursk region. 'They have no military food in their bags. They have some grenades but it’s not even the Soviet type,' Makaruk said in an interview with RFA on Friday that was conducted in English. 'It’s bullshit grenades. And they have lower level military medicine kits.' Up to 12,000 North Korean soldiers are in Russia to support its war efforts against Ukraine in Kursk, according to Ukraine and the U.S. Ukraine has reported more than 3,000 North Korean casualties while South Korea estimates at least 1,100 North Koreans have been killed or wounded. In a briefing on Friday, White House National Security Communications Advisor John Kirby said there have been more than 1,000 North Korean casualties in the past week alone. The North Korean military has been mounting 'hopeless' attacks on Ukrainian forces in Kursk on the orders of the Russian and North Korean military leadership, Kirby said, adding that North Korean human wave tactics 'haven’t really been all that effective.' There have been no signs of an additional deployment of soldiers from North Korea, despite the recent high casualty numbers, the Pentagon’s Deputy Press Secretary Sabrina Singh told reporters in Washington on Monday. 'Can’t say that we’re seeing more being sent, but that doesn’t mean that they won’t send more in the future,' she said. Cigarette lighters Makaruk said the North Koreans appear to have Soviet standards for training, and all of their equipment –- including Kalashnikov AK-47 rifles -– seem to have been provided by the Russians. That included smaller items, such as Russian cigarettes as well as multiple lighters that they may have been collecting as souvenirs or for use as barter currency, he said. Makaruk spoke to RFA after rotating from the combat zone to a rear Ukrainian military operations area. He said he also found ID cards that labeled the North Korean troops as 'non-combat soldiers' who were carrying out 'civilian occupations.' The Ukrainian military has previously said that North Korean soldiers are using fake ID cards with Russian-style names to hide their identities. The signature field on the cards seen by Makaruk contained just a handwritten Korean name that appeared to have been written with a different type of writing instrument. Makaruk didn’t provide any relevant documents or photos, and RFA was unable to independently verify his claims. Language barrier Meanwhile, a Russian prisoner of war said in a video released on Telegram that the North Korean military has its own command system separate from the Russian military. The prisoner, identified as Alyoshin Alexey, also said that there is a serious language barrier between the Russians and North Koreans, most of whom don’t speak Russian. There are no interpreters built into North Korean units, he said. The video was posted to Telegram on Monday by the pro-Ukrainian international civic group InformNaplam. Alyoshin Alexey said he is a member of the Russian Army’s 352nd Motorized Infantry Regiment and was active in Kursk when North Korean soldiers began appearing in the area on Dec. 10. There have been several friendly fire incidents between the two sides that have resulted in casualties, he said. Also, he noted that the North Korean military usually attempts to collect the bodies of dead soldiers from the battlefield possibly because they don’t want to leave evidence that could identify them as North Korean. Neither Russia nor North Korea have confirmed the presence of North Korean troops in the region. Earlier in December, President Volodymyr Zelenskyy accused Russian forces of burning the faces of dead North Korean soldiers to keep their deployment secret.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWdLCAd9F8tI7JSdnWMRYJTU	2024-12-31T15:24:44-08:00	
Ukraine Says It Downed Russian Air Target With Sea Drone For Firs...	(RFE/RL) -- Ukraine claims that for the first time one of its sea drones has downed a Russian military target in the air during a day of intense attacks by both sides as the war edges closer to its three-year anniversary. Ukraine's military intelligence agency (GUR) said in a post on Telegram on December 31 that a Magura V5 sea drone equipped with missiles shot down an Mi-8 helicopter in a battle near Cape Tarkhankut on Crimea's west coast. Another Russian helicopter, the GUR said, was hit by fire but managed to return to a Russian airfield. 'GUR soldiers destroyed an air target for the first time in the world using a Magura V5 naval drone,' the intelligence agency said in the post, which had grainy video of what it said was evidence of the attack. The video has not been independently verified. The GUR claim came hours after air-raid sirens blared across Ukraine as Russia launched another countrywide massive air attack, with explosions heard in some parts of Kyiv. Warnings were issued in the Chernihiv, Sumy, Poltava, Luhansk, Dnipropetrovsk, Zaporizhzhya, Kyiv, Cherkasy, Kirovohrad, and Vinnytsya regions and local media said cruise and ballistic missiles launched in the attack. The Kyiv military administration reported that three private buildings and two cars in the Darnitsky district were damaged by falling debris as air-defense systems repelled the Russian missile strikes. There were no casualties, according to the head of the administration, Serhiy Popko. The head of the municipal administration in Shostka in the Sumy region, Mykola Noga, said 12 multistory residential buildings and two educational institutions were damaged, while several individual infrastructure facilities were destroyed. No information on possible casualties was given. A woman told RFE/RL at the scene that she and her husband ran into a hallway of their third-floor apartment after hearing explosions. She said they taped up a broken window before more explosions and damage occurred. 'We put a blanket [on the window], but it did not help,' she said. She described her home as 'half intact' and said the wind is blowing through it. She and her husband planned to spend the night at their daughter's home. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy told the nation later in an address to mark the new year that Ukraine must fight in 2025 to bolster its position both militarily and ahead of any talks to end Russia's three year invasion. 'Every day in the coming year, I, and all of us, must fight for a Ukraine that is strong enough. Because only such a Ukraine is respected and heard both on the battlefield and at the negotiating table,' he said in his address. 'May 2025 be our year,' he added. 'We know that peace will not be given to us as a gift, but we will do everything to stop Russia and end the war. This is what each of us wishes for.' Earlier on December 31, Ukrainian drones attacked an oil depot in Russia's Yartsevo district of the Smolensk region. Smolensk regional Governor Vasily Anokhin said the fire was caused by falling debris when the drones were shot down. 'As a result, a fuel spill occurred and flammable materials began to ignite. There is no threat to residential buildings,' he wrote on social media. The new attacks come a day after the United States pledged additional security assistance for Ukraine to help strengthen its defenses along the front line. The White House said in a statement on December 30 that the pledge includes an additional $1.25 billion drawdown package for the Ukrainian military and a $1.22 billion Ukraine Security Assistance Initiative package. Hours later, the Treasury Department announced a separate $3.4 billion disbursement to Ukraine in direct budget support. The announcements came as the White House ramps up support to the war-torn country before President Joe Biden's term ends next month. Biden pledged to continue ratcheting up support, but the package is likely to be the last brought forth during his administration amid concerns that President-elect Donald Trump will significantly reduce or halt arms supplies to Ukraine in order to push Kyiv to negotiate a peace settlement with Russia. Trump is scheduled to be inaugurated on January 20. Russia has been pushing back Ukrainian troops on the front lines for weeks and claimed on December 29 to have seized another town in Ukraine's Donetsk region as it continues its long, bloody drive against the strategic -- but nearly destroyed -- southern logistics hub of Pokrovsk. Russia's Defense Ministry said on December 30 that its forces captured Novotroyitske, a settlement with a prewar population 6,300 about 16 kilometers south of Pokrovsk. The Ukrainian military did not comment specifically about Novotroyitske, but it said Russian troops had carried out 133 attacks on its positions, most of which were in the Pokrovsk area. Analysts have speculated on what the Kremlin forces' next steps will be for the city, a strategic logistics hub for Kyiv. The U.S.-based Institute for the Study of War (ISW) said geolocation data suggested the Russian military was about 10 kilometers from the border of the Donetsk and Dnipropetrovsk regions. '[Russian President Vladimir] Putin may be putting pressure on the Russian military command to advance to the border, and not to cover Pokrovsk at this time,' it wrote. In an interview with RFE/RL, Viktor Muzhenko, the former Ukrainian military commander, said any truce between Kyiv and Moscow that leaves swaths of Ukrainian territory under Russian control would represent a victory for the Kremlin and 'fully compensate [it] for its costs of the war.' Muzhenko, who led the military from 2014-19, said the situation with the occupied territories of Donetsk and Luhansk regions and parts of Zaporizhzhya and Kherson regions is 'critical' -- 'not only for the loss of territories, but also [the loss of] half of the resource base of Ukraine.' The General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine said late on December 30 that during the day, some 153 combat clashes occurred on the front lines as Russia presses forward. The ISW estimates territorial gains by the Russian army in 2024 reached about 3,300 square kilometers. Counterattacks by Ukraine also took place in 2024, though only a few square kilometers of Ukrainian territory was recaptured. The bulk of the Russian advances, it said, took place at the end of the year, when Russian troops captured 20 to 30 square kilometers per day, the ISW said.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWdLCAd9F8tI7L0azLbRlgyM	2024-12-31T15:22:50-08:00	
US Treasury Says Chinese Hackers Stole Documents In ‘Major Incide...	(EurActiv) -- Chinese state-sponsored hackers breached the US Treasury Department's computer security guardrails this month and stole documents in what Treasury called a 'major incident,' according to a letter to lawmakers that Treasury officials provided to Reuters on Monday. The hackers compromised third-party cybersecurity service provider BeyondTrust and were able to access unclassified documents, the letter said. According to the letter, hackers 'gained access to a key used by the vendor to secure a cloud-based service used to remotely provide technical support for Treasury Departmental Offices (DO) end users. With access to the stolen key, the threat actor was able to override the service’s security, remotely access certain Treasury DO user workstations, and access certain unclassified documents maintained by those users.' The Treasury Department said it was alerted to the breach by BeyondTrust on 8 December and that it was working with the US Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency and the FBI to assess the hack's impact. Treasury officials didn't immediately respond to an email seeking further details about the hack. The FBI did not immediately respond to Reuters' requests for comment, while CISA referred questions back to the Treasury Department. A spokesperson for the Chinese Embassy in Washington rejected any responsibility for the hack, saying that Beijing 'firmly opposes the US's smear attacks against China without any factual basis.' A spokesperson for BeyondTrust, based in Johns Creek, Georgia, told Reuters in an email that the company 'previously identified and took measures to address a security incident in early December 2024' involving its remote support product. BeyondTrust 'notified the limited number of customers who were involved,' and law enforcement was notified, the spokesperson said. 'BeyondTrust has been supporting the investigative efforts.' The spokesperson referred to a statement posted on the company's website on 8 December sharing some details from the investigation, including that a digital key had been compromised in the incident and that an investigation was under way. That statement was last updated on 18 December. Tom Hegel, a threat researcher at cybersecurity company SentinelOne said the reported security incident 'fits a well-documented pattern of operations by PRC-linked groups, with a particular focus on abusing trusted third-party services - a method that has become increasingly prominent in recent years,' he said, using an acronym for the People's Republic of China.'	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWdLCAd9F8tI7GxLSrgo37j0	2024-12-31T15:20:00-08:00	
Malaysia’s Sabah State Arrests Artist Over Caricature Despite PM ...	By Iman Muttaqin Yusof Parties in Malaysia’s ruling coalition and free speech activists have slammed the arrest of artist-activist Fahmi Reza in Sabah on suspicion of sedition for a caricature criticizing the appointment of a politician once accused of graft as the state’s next governor. Fahmi was remanded for a day by a Magistrate’s Court on Tuesday, following his arrest a day earlier in the Malaysian Bornean state under the colonial-era Sedition Act, Sabah Police Commissioner Jauteh Dikun told BenarNews. 'Fahmi is currently under detention,' Jauteh said, adding Fahmi was remanded so police could conduct an investigation. Local media reports said the activist was being investigated for allegedly insulting the Sabah governor with his satirical artwork. The youth wing of the People’s Justice Party (PKR) noted that party chief and Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim had stated that Fahmi should not be arrested for his caricature. Fahmi’s sketch shows Musa, who’s from ruling coalition member-party UMNO, dressed as a governor and with a 100-ringgit note clenched between his teeth. 'The Prime Minister himself has publicly stated that he does not support the arrest or prosecution of Fahmi Reza in relation to his artwork,' said a statement by PKR Youth. 'Fahmi Reza has merely expressed his views and criticisms through his art and satire. Can this truly be considered a crime?' On Dec. 21, Anwar stated at a press conference that cases such as cyberbullying, pornography, or abusive behavior should be punished. 'However, in cases like Fahmi Reza’s, I want to tell … police: Just leave it, lah,' the PM said. 'I don’t believe [Fahmi] should be charged or arrested …. Criticizing the government or me is fine.' Fahmi, a graphic artist, has run into trouble with Malaysian authorities in the past over his satirical art pieces that skewered leaders, including Najib Razak when he served as PM. ‘Controversial acquittal’ Sultan Ibrahim Iskandar, Malaysia’s king, appointed Musa as Sabah governor on Dec. 17 to replace the current ceremonial head of the state, starting on Jan. 1, 2025. Musa’s 15-year tenure as Sabah chief minister, from 2003-2018, was overshadowed by allegations that he had accepted U.S. $63 million in bribes for logging contracts, though all charges were dropped in 2020. Still, anti-corruption activists and many Malaysians on social media criticized the appointment of Musa, who was controversially acquitted in the logging case after the Attorney General’s Office withdrew 46 corruption charges against him without stating a reason. The acquittal came after Musa’s party, the United Malays National Organization (UMNO), regained power in 2020 as a member of Malaysia’s unelected ruling coalition. Musa is seen as an ally of Najib Razak, who’s currently in prison for corruption. ‘High-handed action’ A rights group, Aliran, criticized Fahmi’s arrest and said all charges against Fahmi should be dropped. 'Such high-handed action conflicts with the spirit of political reforms that the people have long sought. … The misappropriation of public assets undermines the nation’s socioeconomic development and the people’s well-being,' Aliran said, referring to the accusations against Musa. 'People have a constitutional right to peacefully express their concerns about such public interest issues, as Fahmi has done through his art.' Aliran also called on the government to amend or repeal any laws that curb basic rights. 'Pending a legislative review of such laws, we call for a moratorium on the enforcement of repressive provisions in those laws,' the group said. The Sedition Act carries a prison sentence of up to three years, or a fine of up to U.S. $1,100, or both. It outlaws speech deemed as insulting the Malaysian royalty or inciting racial or religious tensions. Malaysian civil society groups and human rights activists have accused Prime Minister Anwar of breaking campaign promises to cancel laws that curb free speech and stifle dissent. Meanwhile on Tuesday, more than 200 youths in Sabah held a rally against Musa’s appointment as governor and calling for an end to what they said was entrenched corruption in the state. The Sabah Anti-Corruption Peace Rally, organized by university students and youth activists, demanded accountability and transparency in the state government. The protest saw participants march 5 kilometers (3.1 miles) from the campus of Universiti Malaysia Sabah to Menara Kinabalu, the administrative headquarters of the Sabah government. Fadhil Kasim, who coordinated the rally, said it was meant to send 'a clear message to those high up in the Sabah government' that the state’s residents had had enough. 'We’re youths demanding a clean, transparent state government. Enough with corruption,' he told reporters. The rally came on the heels of a viral video by a whistleblower and an exposé by local publication Malaysiakini, which alleged that the Sabah chief minister, some assemblymen and state ministers had discussed getting payoffs to facilitate a mining project. The current Sabah government is led by Gabungan Rakyat Sabah (GRS), which like UMNO is a member of Malaysia’s ruling coalition led by PM Anwar. Political analyst Azmi Hassan said the Tuesday rally was significant because young activists staged it. 'This rally could have a strong impact on [next year’s] election [in Sabah],' Azmi, a senior fellow at the Nusantara Academy for Strategic Research, told BenarNews. James Chin, a political scientist from the University of Tasmania, said Musa’s appointment had also tainted the governor’s office. 'While the governor’s role is largely ceremonial, Musa Aman’s reputation drags the institution into controversy,' he said. '[But] Malaysians regard corruption as part and parcel of the political system.'	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWdLCAd9F8tI7DP4DRGWh0FW	2024-12-31T15:16:52-08:00	
Why The Trump Administration Needs To Mend US Relations With Turk...	The incoming Trump administration might want to focus on domestic affairs, but this will prove to be impossible. The Trump administration will enter office with crises in the Greater Middle East and the Russia-Ukraine war that it cannot ignore before focusing its attention primarily on combating China, the main threat to US national interests. The Trump administration’s best ally to resolve the crisis in the Greater Middle East and bring to an end the Russian-Ukrainian war is Turkey. Pandering to the domestic Armenian lobby and human rights advocates the Biden administration made Turkey, the second biggest military power in NATO and hosting two US military bases, a punching bag for its foreign policy failures in the South Caucasus and Greater Middle East. Relations between Presidents Joe Biden and Recep Tayyip Erdoğan fell to their lowest level. US bias was evident in how Turkey was portrayed by Freedom House, which receives financing from USAID, which wrongly ranked Turkey as a fully authoritarian regime. Türkiye holds relatively free elections that would be the envy of the Russians and Chinese and has many cities which are controlled by the opposition (which is not something that is found in Russia or China). Turkey has promoted Western interests by taking advantage of the preoccupation of the Russian military with Ukraine and singlehandedly taken on Russian interests in four regions. The first was to support Azerbaijan’s drive to regain control over its territories that had been illegally occupied by Armenia since the early 1990s. Most of this territory was recaptured in the Second Karabakh War in 2020 with the last remaining land – Karabakh itself – retaken three years later. The Kremlin-controlled CSTO (Collective Security Treaty Organisation) did not intervene in both military engagements. Russian peacekeepers, which were introduced by the November 2020 trilateral peace agreement between Armenia-Azerbaijan-Russia, did not intervene to prevent Azerbaijan retaking Karabakh. The second was to support the UN-recognised Government of National Accord which is recognised by the UN as the sole legitimate executive authority in Libya. Turkish forces supported the UN-backed Government of National Accord by assisting it to halt the Russian-backed attempt using Wagner mercenaries to capture Tripoli by General Khalifa Hifter. The third was to support Ukraine after Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine. Turkey refused to supply Bayraktar drones to Russia forcing it to turn to Iran which has supplied Shaheed drones that have been extensively fired against Ukrainian cities and energy infrastructure. Türkiye is completing the building of a Bayraktar drone producing factory in Ukraine and is building three corvettes for Ukraine’s navy. Türkiye is a staunch supporter of Ukrainian membership of NATO and has repeatedly condemned Russia’s occupation of Crimea. The fourth was to back opposition forces in Syria who defeated Assad’s military and security forces and took power after the dictator fled to Moscow. Russia, which had intervened in 2015 to prop up Assad, has lost its Tartus naval base which the Soviet Union received in 1971 and Khmeimim Air Base. Russian President Vladimir Putin was humiliated for a fourth time after losing its influence in the Armenian-Azerbaijani, Libyan, and Russian-Ukrainian wars. Iran lost its major Syrian ally, Syria as a staging post for anti-Western terrorist activities, and a transit route for arms supplies and logistical support to its proxy forces in the Greater Middle East. Turkey accomplished in Syria what President Barack Obama baulked at undertaking. Obama’s ‘red lines,’ conveyed over the regime’s use of chemical weapons, were ignored by Assad and Putin who continued to murder hundreds of thousands of Sunnis Muslim opponents and force out millions as refugees to Turkey and Europe. Turkey’s policies have promoted Western interests and undermined Russian imperial outreach. In all three countries – Azerbaijan, Libya, Ukraine and Syria – Turkey has supported the international principle of the territorial integrity of states. The Trump administration should view Turkey, as well as Israel, as allies in its likely adoption of a more robust approach to Iran’s terrorist regime. First Israel and then Turkey severely impaired Iranian military assets and its geopolitical sphere of influence. Turkey and Israel have had difficult as well as mutually beneficial relations. The Trump administration should take a leaf from Azerbaijan which developed a strategic partnership with Israel in the 2000s a few years before developing a similar relationship with Turkey. Azerbaijan used Israeli and Turkish military equipment and drones to defeat Armenia in the Second Karabakh War. The Trump administration should give the green light to Israel and Turkey to further undermine the Iranian theocratic regime. This would further the Trump administrations goals of bringing peace to the Greater Middle East and ending the Russian-Ukrainian war. The Russian military would be unable to wage war against Ukraine without Iranian, Chinese, and North Korean support. Turkey is the key to achieving the Trump administration’s goals in the Greater Middle East and Eurasia. Turkey’s national interests would be furthered by supporting Israel in continuing to weaken and undermine the Iranian theocratic regime which, coupled with additional tough US sanctions, could usher in its downfall. The removal of Iran as a geopolitical player in the Greater Middle East would in turn impair its ability to provide military supplies to Russia to wage its war of aggression against Ukraine. The incoming Trump administration should repair relations with Turkey to achieve its goals of bringing peace to the Greater Middle East and ending the Russian-Ukrainian war. Removing the threat from Iran’s theocratic regime and parking Russia would provide the Trump administration with the resources to focus on its main threat and challenge – China.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWdLCAd9F8tI7IZ66A9StjFH	2024-12-31T15:15:13-08:00	
Bishop Expelled From Nicaragua Asks For Prayers For The People	By Walter Sánchez Silva Expelled last month by the Nicaraguan government of President Daniel Ortega and his wife, Rosario Murillo, the bishop who serves as president of the Nicaraguan Bishops’ Conference thanked the Catholic Church in Guatemala for its support and called for prayers for the people of Nicaragua. Bishop Carlos Enrique Herrera Gutiérrez, OFM, of the Diocese of Jinotega made his appeal at the end of the opening Mass for the 2025 Jubilee, which was celebrated in the Archdiocese of Guatemala’s cathedral. 'I welcome your prayers: Pray not only for me but for the people of Nicaragua, so that one day we can be together and see each other, as brothers, and take our place again, where we were also born. Thank you and I commend myself to your prayers,' Herrera said. 'I would like, in a very special way, to thank Gonzalo [de Villa y Vásquez], the archbishop of this diocese, for welcoming me, for his prayers, his words of encouragement, since a few days after arriving, crossing over from there, from Nicaragua, he came to visit me, to encourage me,' Herrera said. 'Just like the Franciscan community [who took him in when he arrived], and you too, I know that when something happens concerning our Central American people, we are always attentive, praying,' the Nicaraguan prelate added in his comments. The bishop of Jinotega also thanked the local clergy for their prayers and for the assistance they give to the 'pilgrims [migrants] who pass through here on their way north, to the different institutions or associations who provide a space, a time to help them to keep going, as happened to the Holy Family as well, who had to go through those difficult moments to be able to defend life.' 'And since this is a year of hope, I hope that hope does not disappoint me. Through the faith that the Lord himself gives us, we always hope that the future will be better. Thank you all!' he concluded. Herrera’s expulsion from Nicaragua The Ortega-Murillo dictatorship expelled Herrera from Nicaragua on Nov. 13, a few days after he had criticized the town mayor, Leónidas Centeno, an Ortega regime supporter, who interfered with a Sunday Mass by blasting loud music in front of the local cathedral. The prelate was abducted by the police after participating in a meeting in the capital Managua with the other bishops of the Nicaraguan episcopate. With the expulsion of Herrera and bishops Silvio Báez, Rolando Álvarez, and Isidoro Mora, only five out of Nicaragua’s nine bishops now remain in the country. The remaining bishops are Cardinal Leopoldo Brenes, archbishop of Managua; Bishop Jorge Solórzano of the Diocese of Granada; Bishop Francisco José Tigerino of the Diocese of Bluefields; Bishop Socrates René Sándigo of the Diocese of León; and Bishop Marcial Humberto Guzmán of the Diocese of Juigalpa.

Prime Minister Manmohan Singh’s Indian Foreign Policy Legacy – An...	By C Raja Mohan When he became prime minister of a coalition government in 2004, Dr Manmohan Singh inherited a positive diplomatic legacy from his two immediate predecessors – P V Narasimha Rao and Atal Bihari Vajpayee navigated many external crises. Singh’s own contribution in laying the foundations for India’s economic modernisation as finance minister under Rao was now paying diplomatic dividends as the world was eager than ever before in a productive engagement with India. On his part, Singh sought to convert the emerging diplomatic opportunities to transform India’s major bilateral relations. His intellectual recognition of India’s new global possibilities, however, did not find the necessary domestic resonance. The lack of adequate political support at home, bureaucratic inertia and the opposition from the foreign policy community limited his room for external diplomatic manoeuvres. The visit by Pakistan’s military ruler, General Pervez Musharraf, to India in April 2005, ostensibly to watch a cricket match in Delhi, provided the occasion for Singh to explore the outlines of a Kashmir settlement. Serious back-channel negotiations on Kashmir could not, however, be brought to a close. The Congress party’s leadership was deeply uncomfortable making bold moves with Pakistan. The party would not even support Singh’s plans to visit Pakistan. As Delhi hesitated, momentum dissipated on Pakistan’s side as Musharraf’s power began to ebb, and relations reverted to crisis mode after the terror attacks from Pakistan on Mumbai in November 2008. Singh had greater success with Bangladesh in negotiating a land boundary settlement with Dhaka and an agreement to share the waters of the Teesta River in 2011. However, his party could not muster support from a key regional party, the Trinamool Congress, on water-sharing and the opposition Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) on parliamentary approval for the land boundary settlement. Singh was also successful in negotiating an agreement on guiding principles and political parameters on the resolution of the boundary dispute with China in April 2005. It was the first time such an agreement was finalised and raised hopes for the long overdue breakthrough in the relations with China. However, boundary negotiations soon stalled as Beijing began reinterpreting the agreement’s provisions. While Delhi was eager for a settlement, Beijing grew reluctant as the power gap between the two nations rapidly widened in China’s favour during the 2000s. As a rising China under Xi Jinping turned politically assertive and adopted muscular approaches to boundary disputes with its neighbours, Sino-Indian relations entered a complex phase. This manifested in a series of military crises, with the first major border flareup occurring in 2013 toward the end of the United Progressive Alliance’s (UPA) rule. Singh’s American story proved vastly different and consequential. In March 2005, Condoleezza Rice, President George W Bush’s National Security Adviser, went to Delhi promising to resolve the longstanding nuclear dispute with India. This was part of a new United States (US) initiative to reorganise the Asian security order, with India as a strong regional partner. Swift diplomatic action led to Delhi and Washington signing a defence cooperation agreement in June 2005 and a historic civil nuclear initiative in July 2005. The scale and scope of this new diplomatic engagement with the US unsettled the Congress party amid vigorous opposition from the UPA’s Left allies. Though Vajpayee had created the nuclear opening with the US, Lal Krishna Advani’s BJP attacked Singh’s historic deal with Bush. The Left and the BJP joined forces to try to topple Singh’s government. The Singh government survived this challenge, but the Congress leadership had no political appetite for completing the nuclear initiative with the US. It took Singh’s threat to resign to push the Congress party to formalise the initiative in 2008. Though he returned as prime minister in 2009 with a stronger mandate, Singh struggled to implement the many new agreements with the US. The Congress leadership showed little political interest in that project. It took Narendra Modi’s government, with its Lok Sabha majority and full control over party foreign policy, to advance the strategic partnership with the US. However, had Singh not acted with great conviction by putting his leadership on the line in 2008, it would have been much harder for the Modi government – though bolder and more self-assured – to rapidly transform the US relationship over the last decade. Transforming the US relationship amid widespread political, intellectual and bureaucratic hostility will endure as Singh’s greatest strategic legacy as prime minister. It complemented and reinforced his contribution to India’s economic rise in the 1990s. Willing partners in Washington – successive American presidents Bush, Barack Obama, Donald Trump and Joe Biden – helped make the US’ most valuable partner today. Singh had a supportive partner in Dhaka, but the Congress party could not get sufficient internal support. It was left to Modi to wrap up the boundary settlement with Bangladesh. Neither Singh nor Modi had such fortune with Pakistan and China, which remain major challenges for India. One can only speculate whether greater internal coherence and stronger political will in Delhi could have helped India gain much more than it did from the strategic opportunities that came its way in the UPA years. What does stand out, however, is the importance of leaders seizing ephemeral moments and turning them into concrete strategic outcomes. Equally important is the need for strong elite consensus at home on foreign policy.

Narcissistic Leadership In The 21st Century – OpEd	Leadership is the art of blending vision, discipline, courage, integrity, and intelligence with the science of selflessness. A leader is a person who is confident about his beliefs and has uncompromising values that are driven by a goal or a mission and who takes his people along in his journey. Narcissist leaders are different. They are fueled with excessive self-regard, lack of empathy, constant admiration, and self-centered vision. Narcissist leaders are reshaping the political landscape of global politics. It is not just about America or Russia, or Turkey or Brazil, the whole world is suffering from selfish leadership posing a risk to the global risks associated with democracy and global peace. Narcissism is not a new political phenomenon. Julius Caesar is the best example of a narcissistic leader whose overly self-centered actions led to the destruction of the Roman Republic. His narcissistic attitude can be seen clearly with his famous statement 'I came, I saw and I conquered' and his infamous statement 'It is only hubris if I fail'. These justifications came with the cost of the Roman Republic’s downfall. In the modern world, characteristics like over-confidence, selfishness, and ruthlessness are increasing among political leaders worldwide. These leaders start with a promise of restoring national pride, fighting for the national interest, and being willing to sacrifice all things for the sake of the prosperity and growth of the nation. They insist on convincing their followers that they are just representatives and are conveying the masses’ viewpoint to the higher authorities. The real problem arises when people begin to place their trust in these leaders and unquestioningly follow their words. They are unable to understand and process the unspoken intentions of their leaders which are later depicted by particular actions that indicate them as an individual. Donald Trump’s stance on 'I alone can fix it' during the 2016 election campaign and his refusal to accept the defeat he faced in the 2020 election showed that he put himself above democracy. Under his leadership, the relationship of the USA with the allies and adversarial states is evident in his narcissistic views. He used social media to launch campaigns that favored him and were against every other state, adversaries or persons. His dismissal of climate science and handling the pandemic situation was even worse. The game of power without accountability comes under the leadership umbrella of Vladimir Putin. His attitude towards the leadership style was more authoritarian with a blend of narcissistic self-obsession. He has a history of frequently manipulating national crises, policies, laws and regulations, and even the circumstances at war with Ukraine. Putin portrayed him as a central figure in the history of Russia with his manipulative tactics to keep the hold and the power. He never accepted or tolerated dissent. His government's opponents were punished and imprisoned, and there was constant evidence of free expression being suppressed. In correspondence to Ceaser’s viewpoints, Putin also believes that the destiny of Russia is only linked to his personal views and threat to Putin’s power is a threat to Russia. Like Russia and the USA, another case of narcissist leadership is seen in Brazil. Nationalist populism was the root cause of bringing Jair Bolsonaro to power. Experts without any doubt marked his leadership as completely narcissistic, particularly in handling crises during the pandemic and the policies regarding public welfare. His self-obsession and indifferent stance to public welfare lead to tens of thousands of unnecessary deaths. Frequent attacks on media, opposition and institution can be anything but a true leadership. Recep Tayyip Erdogan is a textbook example of his narcissistic leadership style. He has slowly dismantled Turkey’s democratic institutions replacing them with the system that gives power to the president. Another example of a Muslim nation is Pakistan. Imran Khan won the election as a popular leader but as he came into power, putting the interest of his people, he put himself first. He started the blame game politics and ended up in the national division. It is not the end here. There is a long list of such leaders ruling globally for the sake of risk to global peace. These examples are included not only to illustrate their narcissistic leadership styles but also to highlight the long-term effects on nations and the world. Behind building the self-image, using propaganda against opponents and political manipulation there exists undermined democratic norms. The foreign policies designed under the narcissistic viewpoints of these leaders are driven by their need for validation and a sense of entitlement. They refuse to take responsibility of acknowledged failure. Social media has made communication easier for all of us, but the use of social media by narcissistic leaders can affect the nation as a whole and the allies and adversarial states as well. Regardless of long-term loss, they use this medium for building their image, propagating their agenda, gas lighting the nations with twisted facts and news. Likes and reach give them a sense of constant validation and supporters of such leaders go into the keyboard war with the opponents constantly rejecting their viewpoints and bashing and bullying them all over social media. This makes the voices of the opponents suppressed and the narrative of that particular narcissist leader propagates. The echo of the unwanted voices all over the globe regarding the praises of narcissistic leaders makes a nation adapt to narcissistic policies. People stop thinking about the real and straight facts and in the end, the whole nation becomes part of this narcissistic propaganda. It only gives power and self-satisfaction to these leaders and destroys the nations endangering global peace. Now, as the stakes are highest, the right time is to act. We should look for narcissistic behaviors in our leaders and instead of supporting them and empowering them, make them accountable. This unchecked narcissism in leadership leads to instability, division and the collapse of democratic systems and the world cannot afford to allow narcissistic leaders to continue their unchecked power for the sake of global peace.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfEeil4B54rMi_HkpBIiqSE	2024-12-30T09:16:22-08:00	
Pakistan And Tajikistan Deepen Bilateral Cooperation Through Land...	The recently concluded seventh Joint Commission meeting between Pakistan and Tajikistan in the signing of two landmark Memorandums of Understanding (MoUs) and protocols, which marks the deepening of ties between the two countries. The agreements reflect a shared vision to improve multilateral cooperation in the spheres of trade, energy, sports and cultural ties. This event highlighted ingrained historical, religious and cultural bonds between two nations. Pakistan expressed strong support for Tajikistan, which has been a principle of the Pakistani policy since Tajikistan’s emergence as an independent state in 1991. Key Agreements and Initiatives The two MoUs signed during the meeting aim to fortify regional and cultural ties. One agreement is to form a provincial cooperation between Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Tajikistan’s Khatlon province. The second MoU is presented on sports generally and especially football aiming at encouraging and enhancing cooperation between the football federations of the two countries. Federal Minister for Power Awais Leghari also highlighted that Pakistan is in a central geographic place for Tajikistan to diversify its investment and enhance regional integration. He explained existing projects including CASA-1000 electricity project and trade corridors under the CAREC Programme as proof of Pakistan’s contribution to regionalism. Awais Leghari also proposed the establishment of a Joint Coordination Committee on Transit Trade to tackle barriers hindering trade. Moreover, Moreover, he also focused on people-to-people contacts, which are inviting the Tajik citizens to visit Pakistan and witness its natural scenic beauties and cultural diversities. Peaceful relations, diplomatic, tourism, reciprocal exchange of cultural attachments and interpersonal amity and understanding were considered as some of the elements that would help Nigeria and Peru to sustain long-term relationships. Opportunities for Collaboration The Tajik Minister for Energy and Water Resources was equally optimistic about the partnership, and the positive developments in bilateral relations. He stressed on the importance of Pakistan in the development of progress in the region and pointed out that the cooperation in hydrocarbon sector, agriculture, trade and educational sector is possible. The Tajik delegation said that they have positive expectations for the result of the Joint Commission meeting as the talks provided the basis for achieving the stated objectives. They reassured once again the leadership of Tajikistan on the importance of improving bilateral relations in economic and cultural cooperation with Pakistan. A Vision for the Future The agreements signed and discussions held at the meeting create new opportunities in relations between Pakistan and Tajikistan. Both sides emphasized trust that these measures would create more successful cooperation and actual outcomes for their people. Enhanced connectivity, integration of trade, and cultural collaboration remain at the forefront of their bilateral agenda. As Pakistan and Tajikistan continue to work together, these initiatives highlight the potential of regional cooperation to unlock economic growth and foster mutual prosperity in Central and South Asia.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfmSexPmH6EFYfjrwjYW0C_	2024-12-30T09:15:06-08:00	
CPEC: Addressing Deficits And Diversifying Sources – OpEd	The CPEC, a flagship project of China’s BRI, has been signifying a very significant development towards the integration of regional economy. Commonly initiated as an energy project with Chinese investment in Pakistan’s infrastructure, CPEC has much expanded to an economic cooperation project of diverse infrastructure, energy production, industrial development and, most recently, digital integration. This article offers a critical analysis of the changes CPEC has brought into Pakistan and how it affects the region and comes as a driver of developmental connectivity. CPEC is an important factor in the BRI, an international project promoting integrated cooperation and exchange in Asia, Africa, Europe. CPEC forms part of Pakistan’s strategic plan of reversing infrastructure deprivations, energy scarcities and seeking to position the country as a regional economic powerhouse. With regard to investment worth $62 billion, CPEC is an integrative model of bilateral cooperation that contains FDI, low-interest financing, and grant. Housing one of the world’s largest infrastructure development projects, one would not be wrong to say that CPEC has transformed the scenery of Pakistan. More than 3,000 kilometres of highways and motorways have been built linking Gwadar with northern Pakistan and going further to China. These marginal improvements have cut transportation time on goods by half hence has freed $1 billion a year on transport costs. Also, the improved infrastructure of roads has helped increase imports and exports between the two nations and Afghanistan improved by 72% from the year 2018 to 2024. Chinese financed energy projects under CPEC have largely helped Pakistan in managing existing perennial power crises. In CPEC projects by 2024, Pakistan has added more than eight thousand mega watts to the generating capacity of the country and all around the year 2015, Pakistan was generating twenty four thousand mega watts but in the year 2023 the generating capacity has touched thirty one thousand mega watts. These improvements have lowered power outages in the least served provinces including Balochistan and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s by a third. Separately, solar and wind projects among others are contributing new types of energy into the energy capacity of Pakistan and subscribing to global climate change solutions. Nevertheless public finance issues remain a potential problem. Increasing cost implications of imported fuels for thermal power plants has brought to the fore, the need for diversification towards domestic and sustainable energy sources. This paper has argued that achieving transparency in tariff setting and correcting operational cost note can improve sustainability of these energy projects. Also, connectivity of SEZs with global value chain can enhance the role of SEZs on diversification of economy of Pakistan. CPEC and digital silk road and became an IT services and digital trade country of Pakistan. Internet usage increased from 11% in 2015 to 54% in 2024 for the e-commerce business for cross border digital trade of which tripled in 300% between 2020 and 2024. Digital transformation under CPEC has also facilitated the growth of Pakistan’s startup ecosystem. With over $500 million invested in tech startups by 2024, Pakistan’s digital economy is projected to contribute 10% of the GDP by 2030. Expanding digital literacy programs and enhancing broadband accessibility will further accelerate this growth. CPEC’s economic benefits extend beyond Pakistan. By integrating South Asia, Central Asia, and the Middle East, CPEC has increased regional trade by 50%, with Gwadar Port emerging as a hub for international shipping. This enhanced connectivity underscores Pakistan’s strategic relevance in regional trade dynamics. However, geopolitical tensions and competing interests among neighboring countries pose risks to CPEC’s long-term success. Pakistan has also benefited from an increase in startup culture under the CPEC digital transformation process. Investment in technology startups also has touched a cumulative of $500 million by 2024, the digital economy of Pakistan is expected to amount to 10% of the Gross Domestic Product by 2030. Additional steps to increase the availability of digital literacy initiatives or increase the access to broadband services should thus promote a faster growth. Besides Pakistan, CPEC has the potential to boost economic activities in many countries. Connecting southern Asia, central Asia and the Middle Eastern Countries, CPEC has boosted the trade by 50 % and turned Gwadar port into an international shipping terminal. These improved connections have underlined the Operational significance of Pakistan in the ongoing patterns of the trading bloc. However, threats hindering the sustainability of CPEC include current political instabilities within the region and continuing rivalry between neighboring countries. There will be the need to strengthen cooperation with neighbourly countries on policies and measures to dismantle non-tariff barriers as a way of realizing the envisaged benefits from CPEC.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfmSexPmH6EFdhVaL_UTFh6	2024-12-30T09:13:40-08:00	
What Awaits Moscow Under Trump – Analysis	By Rajoli Siddharth Jayaprakash President-elect Donald Trump’s second term marks a policy shift from the previous Biden administration. He aims to shift Washington’s focus from Europe to the Indo-Pacific to counter China’s rise. Trump wants to do so by ending the Ukraine war by facilitating negotiations between Kyiv and Moscow. Further, he hopes to split the maturing Moscow-Beijing and the Moscow-Tehran partnership. The President-elect, however, has not mentioned how he plans to do so. Despite the nature of United States (US) policy towards Ukraine likely changing under Trump, the Kremlin has reacted cautiously to his victory because Trump, despite wanting to improve relations with Moscow in his first term, was unable to do so. Second, Moscow is sceptical of Trump’s ability to deliver on Moscow’s demands about European security architecture. Meanwhile, Trump wants North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) countries to increase their defence spending and wants to continue arming Ukraine while pursuing a ceasefire. Endgame in Ukraine? Since the early days of his campaign, Trump has claimed that he would end the war 'in 24 hours' if elected. While Trump has not outlined his plans, a few proposals have emerged from his aides. In September, Vice-President-elect J.D. Vance presented the plan of freezing the conflict along current lines, creating a heavily fortified demilitarised zone, offering security guarantees to Ukraine and assuring Moscow that Ukraine would not join NATO. Another plan was presented by Keith Kellogg and Fred Fleitz, former Chiefs of Staff in the National Security Council under Trump, which suggested that US military aid to Ukraine would be contingent on Kyiv negotiating with Moscow and imposing a moratorium on its NATO membership. Easing of sanctions would be contingent on Moscow’s willingness to negotiate, and levies would be imposed on the revenue generated from Russian energy exports, which would be used for Ukraine’s reconstruction. With the nomination of Keith Kellogg as the special envoy for Russia and Ukraine, Washington’s policy approach to the war will likely reflect this plan. While Ukrainian ruling elites are aware that the terms for ending the conflict will lead to the ceding of some territory to Russia, the official stance for negotiations remains that Russia would have to withdraw from all of the occupied territories, including Crimea, which Russia annexed in 2014. However, for Russia, the war in Ukraine is not about territory alone, as Moscow wants guarantees that Ukraine will not join NATO and remain neutral. However, outgoing US President Joe Biden granted Ukraine permission to use long-range Army Tactical Missile Systems (ATACMs), significantly escalating the conflict. Biden’s last-ditch efforts to arm Ukraine, which are exacerbating the conflict, are probably driven by his desire to drag the Trump administration into continuing support for Kyiv. Ukraine currently fires ATACMS and Anglo-French Storm Shadow missiles into Bryansk and Kursk regions in Russia. This has led to Putin approving changes to the Russian nuclear doctrine, lowering the threshold for the use of nuclear weapons. Also in a show of determination to the West, and to reemphasise red lines and stop further escalation, Putin launched the intermediate-range ballistic missile ‘Oreshnik’ on an industrial plant in the city of Dnipro, Ukraine. For Putin, despite scepticism, there is some hope for marginal de-escalation in the conflict. He will also seek a dialogue with the US about European security, but Washington’s position on this is unclear. On splitting the Russia-China and Russia-Iran partnership Trump’s desire to break the Russia-China and Russia-Iran partnership may be more difficult to achieve than he anticipates. Beijing is Moscow’s largest trading partner, with bilateral trade increasing from US$88 billion in 2014 to US$240 billion in 2024. With markets shrinking in the West because of sanctions, China has emerged as a pivotal partner to Russia, with cooperation spanning across military, economic, critical technology, energy, and other sectors. Beijing is an important stakeholder in Moscow’s strategy to pivot eastwards and move its supply chains from Europe towards Asia. With the invasion of Ukraine, Moscow’s reliance on China has increased further, with the Chinese yuan becoming an important reserve currency in Russia. Despite growing asymmetry with concerns over Chinese banks not processing ruble transactions, and China complying with certain sanctions and export control regulations due to its business interests in the West, China still remains an important partner for Moscow, as both nations have shared grievances with the West. This is reflected in Russia-China cooperation within regional and plurilateral organisations like the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) and BRICS, where both countries aim to carve out an alternative geoeconomic framework to the West. Thus, along with increasing political-economic interaction, the prospect of Moscow de-linking from China looks highly unlikely. Similarly, in the case of Iran, the Moscow-Tehran partnership improved in the 21st century, with Russia assisting Iran in developing its nuclear energy, and with talks to expedite deliveries of advanced military platforms such as the S-400 Anti-Missile System. Since 2022, Iran has increased its supply of drones to Russia. Further, Iran is an important regional player for Moscow, as it is a critical node in the International North-South Trade Corridor, connecting Russia to the Indian Ocean. Further, Iran is an important partner in intergovernmental and plurilateral organisations like the SCO and BRICS. Trump 2.0 a repeat of Trump 1.0? Trump’s arrival in the White House in 2016 came with the possibility of a reset in America’s relationship with Russia and was thus well-received by Moscow. Still, despite the campaign promises, Moscow’s hopes were unaddressed. Sanctions imposed by Trump’s predecessor continued and required the assent of US congressional committees for its revocation. The first Trump administration continued to impose more sanctions against Russia, particularly on Russian energy, with the sanctioning of the Nord Stream 2undersea gas pipeline, which aimed to transport gas from Russia to Europe via the Baltic Sea. Further, it was during Trump’s first term that the US withdrew from the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty (INF) treaty. For these reasons, uncertainty looms over what the future holds for Moscow under Trump 2.0. While Russia’s concerns about European security remain unaddressed, it is unlikely that US sanctions on Moscow will be lifted, as certain sanctions, such as sanctions on Russian Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG), profit the USas it increases American LNG exports. Further, it is doubtful that Russia’s frozen sovereign assets (worth US$300 billion) will be unfrozen, and it is unlikely that Russia will agree to these funds being used in Ukraine’s reconstruction or to pay a tax on its future energy sales to contribute to the reconstruction. Thus, while Trump may attempt to end the conflict in Ukraine by offering certain concessions to Moscow, it is unlikely that a lasting, long-term peace will be achieved in 2025.

Against The Tide: Narendra Modi’s 2024 Ordeal – Analysis	As 2024 approaches its conclusion, the year leaves behind an indelible mark, particularly in the realm of global politics. Dubbed the 'Year of Elections,' 2024 saw more than half of the world’s population casting votes in pivotal contests. From India to Venezuela and Senegal to the United States, the world witnessed democracy being put to the test as record numbers of voters participated in elections. Early in the year, Time magazine called it a 'make-or-break year for democracy,' while others described it as 'democracy’s biggest test.' Over 60 countries held elections in 2024, including some of the world’s most influential nations. India, the world’s largest democracy, went to the polls alongside the United States, a global superpower, and Russia, often criticized for its authoritarian regime. Tunisia, the birthplace of the Arab Spring, dealt a severe blow to democratic experiments, highlighting the ongoing challenges facing nascent democracies. A prominent political analyst Thomas Carothers, observed several key trends this year. First, right-wing parties made notable gains globally, securing victories in major countries like France and the United States, as well as in smaller nations such as Austria, Belgium, Panama, and Portugal. Second, 2024 proved to be a challenging year for incumbents, with many losing power in countries like the United States, the United Kingdom, Botswana, Panama, and Sri Lanka. However, some leaders defied the odds and returned to office, including those in El Salvador, Finland, Indonesia, Ireland, Mexico, Moldova, Mongolia, Palau, and Taiwan. In India, Japan, and South Africa, ruling parties retained power but suffered electoral setbacks. A bright spot for democracy was Senegal, where a successful election thwarted the outgoing president’s unconstitutional bid to remain in power. Meanwhile, Donald Trump’s reelection as U.S. President sparked significant controversy, yet his victory underscored the enduring mechanisms of democratic elections. However, the year also revealed troubling patterns. The Guardian’s Jonathan Yerushalmy and Oliver Holmes highlighted that between 2020 and 2024, one-fifth of all election results faced formal challenges. Losing candidates publicly rejected outcomes in 20% of elections, and opposition parties boycotted 10% of contests. This persistent undermining of electoral legitimacy sowed doubts among voters about the reliability of voting systems and the broader democratic process. The most significant blow to democracy occurred in Bangladesh, where a democratically elected government was overthrown with external support. The primary motive behind this upheaval centered on the Saint Martin’s Island dispute, which Sheikh Hasina refused to concede. The so-called 'student protests' against job quota systems were later exposed as a façade. Mohammad Yunus, head of the interim government, admitted during an event hosted by the Obama Foundation in the U.S. that these protests were orchestrated to destabilize the government. Following this coup, Bangladesh has witnessed unprecedented violence against minority Hindus, with radical groups—some linked to the interim government—targeting vulnerable communities. The year 2024, therefore, stands as a complex chapter in the history of global democracy. It was a year of electoral milestones and democratic resilience, but also one marred by setbacks, controversies, and challenges that underscore the fragility of democratic systems worldwide. How Modi Survived the Storm in 2024 As noted earlier, 2024 was a challenging year for incumbent leaders worldwide, and among them, one of the most scrutinized was Narendra Modi, leader of the world’s largest democracy, India. With nearly two billion people casting their votes globally during the year, more than half participated in India’s general elections alone. Modi faced the most formidable challenge of his political career as opposition parties united under the banner of the Indian National Developmental Inclusive Alliance (INDI Alliance), a coalition formed with the sole objective of unseating him. The INDI Alliance, established in December 2023, brought together over two dozen parties. Yet, Modi’s challenges were not limited to domestic adversaries; external forces also sought to influence the outcome. Prominent among these external actors was billionaire George Soros, whose alleged involvement in India’s elections became a major controversy during the winter session of Parliament. The ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) presented documents purportedly linking Soros to the leader of the opposition and his family, igniting widespread debate. In addition to the general elections, eight Indian states held legislative assembly elections in 2024, including Arunachal Pradesh, Sikkim, Andhra Pradesh, Odisha, Jammu and Kashmir, Haryana, Maharashtra, and Jharkhand. The BJP emerged victorious in five of these states, notably securing Haryana and Maharashtra, which delivered a severe blow to the Congress-led INDI Alliance. These defeats fractured the coalition, with member parties blaming each other for their failures. The general election was a litmus test for Narendra Modi. After ten years in power, he faced significant anti-incumbency sentiment and a united opposition armed with potent narratives. The opposition’s primary attack centered on the Indian Constitution, alleging that if Modi were re-elected, his government would amend provisions protecting reservation policies for Scheduled Castes and Other Backward Classes. This narrative resonated with some segments of society, narrowing BJP’s electoral margin. Despite the opposition’s efforts, the BJP emerged as the single-largest party but fell short of a majority, ending a decade of single-party rule. Modi swiftly formed a coalition government with two of BJP’s prominent allies: N. Chandrababu Naidu’s Telugu Desam Party (TDP) and Nitish Kumar’s Janata Dal (United). For Modi and the BJP, the victory was critical for India’s right-wing movement and for the forces struggling for the India’s revival at global stage, but the battle was far from over. The opposition, emboldened by their partial success, openly declared their intention to obstruct the government at every turn. However, Modi, known for his decisive leadership over his 23 years in public office, refused to be deterred. He initiated bold reforms, including a review of the Waqf Board Act, signaling his intent to govern assertively. The opposition’s aggressive posturing began to crumble as cracks within the coalition deepened. The BJP’s victories in Haryana and Maharashtra dealt significant blows to the INDI Alliance’s unity. Even their wins in Jammu and Kashmir and Jharkhand failed to provide much-needed momentum. After these victories, alliance partners marginalized Congress, denying it influential positions in state governments. The discord became glaring during the November by-elections in Uttar Pradesh, where Congress’s ally, the Samajwadi Party, offered Congress only one out of nine seats. Feeling humiliated, Congress chose to abstain from the elections entirely. Narendra Modi’s survival in 2024 was a testament to his resilience and strategic acumen. Despite facing a united opposition, external pressures, and ten years of anti-incumbency, Modi managed to secure another term, proving once again his ability to navigate and withstand political storms. Modi Under Pressure: Navigating Internal and External Challenges The pressures on Prime Minister Narendra Modi in 2024 were not limited to domestic opposition; external forces were equally active in challenging India’s stability. Self-proclaimed defenders of democracy and proponents of the so-called 'Regime Change Band' sought to encircle India with their activities. Following the destabilization of governments in Sri Lanka and Pakistan, the ousting of Sheikh Hasina’s government in Bangladesh dealt a significant blow to India’s strategic interests, both regionally and internationally. Sheikh Hasina had closely collaborated with India while adeptly balancing ties with China. Her removal has now put both India’s strategic foothold in Bangladesh and the safety of the Hindu minority there at considerable risk. Yet, as the year drew to a close, India found a silver lining in Myanmar. The weakening grip of Myanmar’s junta presents new opportunities for India. This shift opens the door to revitalizing the Kaladan Multi-Modal Transit Transport Project, neutralizing militant groups, and expanding India’s influence in the region. Domestically, the political climate was also rife with attempts to capitalize on international controversies. Ahead of every parliamentary session, opposition parties would latch onto developments abroad to criticize the government. This time, it revolved around the U.S. Department of Justice filing cases against Indian entrepreneur Gautam Adani’s company. However, instead of retreating under pressure, Modi and his team adopted an offensive stance, exposing what they described as deep-state efforts to destabilize India and undermine its economic progress. India’s Global Recognition Through Modi Prime Minister Narendra Modi has achieved remarkable global recognition, having been honored with 19 highest civilian awards from various countries. Notably, in 2024 alone, Modi received seven of these prestigious awards, a record unmatched by any leader worldwide in a single year. The countries bestowing their highest civilian honors on Modi in 2024 included Bhutan (The Order of the Gyalpo), Russia (The Order of the Saint Andrew), Nigeria (The Order of the Niger), Dominica (Dominika Award of Honor), Guyana (Award of Excellence Guyana), Barbados (Order of Freedom of Barbados), and Kuwait (Order of Mubarak Al Kabeer). Previously, Modi had been awarded by Saudi Arabia, Afghanistan, the Philippines, the Maldives, the UAE, Bahrain, the USA, Fiji, Papua New Guinea, Egypt, France, and Greece. This unprecedented number of awards is not only a personal achievement for Modi but also a testament to India's growing influence on the global stage. It symbolizes international acknowledgment of India’s rising power and prestige. For Modi and his team, such recognition serves as a morale booster, especially amid relentless criticism from opposition parties. While detractors aim to undermine Modi, the global community continues to acknowledge his leadership and India's ascent. India’s Year of Civilizational Resurgence and Modi The year 2024 will be remembered as a milestone in India’s civilizational journey, marked by the restoration of the Ram Mandir in Ayodhya—a project that lay dormant for five decades. The temple, built on the birthplace of Lord Ram, represents the revival of India's spiritual heritage and cultural identity. On January 22, Prime Minister Modi presided over the consecration ceremony, with nearly half a million devotees gathering in Ayodhya the next day to celebrate. For many Indians, the temple’s completion symbolizes the resurgence of a Hindu golden age, harking back to a time before foreign invasions and colonial rule. At the foundation stone ceremony in 2020, Modi described the Ram Mandir as 'a modern signifier of our ancient culture, an example of patriotic fervor, and a testament to the willpower of our citizens.' To some, however, the temple’s construction also highlights the BJP’s consolidation of political support by emphasizing Hindu cultural identity. The Indian National Congress, India’s main opposition party, notably refrained from attending the temple inauguration. Narendra Modi envisions India as a developed nation by 2047, and the revival of cultural and spiritual symbols is seen as an integral part of this journey. The Ram Mandir’s construction is not merely a religious achievement but a moment of national healing—a symbolic act of a civilization reclaiming its identity. The temple’s completion is aptly described as 'when the soul of a nation long suppressed finds utterance.' While the Supreme Court’s landmark judgment paved the way for the temple, there is no denying the pivotal role played by Modi and the BJP in realizing this vision. Since its formation in 1984, the BJP consistently championed the construction of a grand temple in Ayodhya, encapsulated in the slogan 'Mandir Wahi Banayenge' (We will build the temple at the same site). Modi, deeply committed to this cause, was part of L.K. Advani’s Rath Yatra and actively worked for the temple’s construction long before his rise to prominence. Thus, the realization of the Ram Mandir in Ayodhya stands as a significant accomplishment credited to Modi’s leadership and dedication. Conclusion Narendra Modi began the year with high ambitions, rallying behind the slogan ‘Ab ki baar 400 ke paar.’ However, the general election results mid-year dealt a significant blow to his momentum. The loss in Uttar Pradesh—a crucial state with the highest number of parliamentary seats—was particularly alarming for Modi and the BJP. Given that Uttar Pradesh's overwhelming support had been instrumental in BJP’s rise to power, the defeat raised serious concerns about the party's future prospects. Despite this setback, Modi managed to recover by the year’s end. The BJP regained its footing in the bye-elections, securing victory in 7 out of 9 contested seats, which proved to be a major morale booster. This resurgence was evident during the winter session of Parliament, where Modi and his team operated with renewed vigor, effectively countering opposition leaders and reclaiming their political momentum. The year 2024 posed challenges for many incumbent leaders, yet Narendra Modi demonstrated his ability to thrive against the odds. Matching Jawaharlal Nehru's record of becoming Prime Minister for a third consecutive term, Modi also solidified his stature as a prominent international leader. He has become a key voice for Global South nations, earning recognition as one of the world's most influential leaders. Under his leadership, Indian foreign policy has adeptly balanced relations with diverse countries, while the Indian economy has strengthened significantly during his tenure.

When Information Had Weight – OpEd	Every Saturday morning in the mid-1980s, my mom would drop me off at the Commack flea market in central Long Island. While other kids were watching cartoons, I spent hours at Albert’s baseball card table, absorbing stories about Mickey Mantle’s rookie year, and understanding how to spot counterfeit cards by the subtle variations in cardstock texture. The early morning light would filter through the market’s canvas tarps, the musty smell of old cardboard mixing with coffee from nearby vendors. Albert, well into his eighties, wasn’t just a vendor – though he didn’t know it, he was a curator, historian, and mentor. Having witnessed the golden age of baseball firsthand, his stories were living history – tales from a time when baseball was America’s true national pastime, knitting together communities in the post-war boom. He taught me that real knowledge wasn’t just about memorizing statistics; it was about understanding context, recognizing patterns, and learning from those who came before. While I loved the game, the cards were physical manifestations of data, each one a node in an intricate web of information. The baseball card market was my first lesson in how information creates value. Price guides were our search engines, monthly card shows our social networks – gatherings where collectors would spend hours trading not just cards but stories and knowledge, building communities around shared obsessions Baseball wasn’t just a sport for me – it was my first religion. I treated batting averages like verses of scripture, memorizing them with the devotion of a scholar poring over ancient texts. I knew every detail of Reggie Jackson’s three home runs in the ’77 World Series, but what really captivated me were the almost mythological tales of baseball’s distant past – Jackie Robinson’s electrifying career and flair for the dramatic, Babe Ruth calling his shot in the ’32 Series, and Christy Mathewson and Walter Johnson’s duels in the dead-ball era. These weren’t just facts to me; they were legends passed down through generations, as rich and detailed as any ancient mythology. Adults would either marvel or become slightly unnerved at my encyclopedic knowledge spanning nearly a century of baseball history. This wasn’t just memorization; it was devotion. (Though nowadays, if my parents regularly left me with an octogenarian we hardly knew at a flea market, they’d probably face a visit from Child Protective Services.) The flea market was just one part of a Gen X childhood where discovery took different forms. While Albert taught me about organizing and valuing information, our neighborhood adventures – governed by the single rule 'be home by dark' – taught me about exploration and independence. Our bikes were our passports to the world, taking us wherever curiosity led. Whether pedaling to distant neighborhoods, building rickety forts, or learning through scraped knees, we were constantly discovering through direct experience rather than instruction. Each space offered its own lessons on how to learn, think, and find meaning in the world around us. As high school arrived, my obsession shifted from baseball cards to music, and the local record store became my new sanctuary. Like something out of High Fidelity, the guys behind the counter at Tracks on Wax in Huntington were my guides through musical history, just as Albert had been with baseball history. My journey began with inherited vinyl – my parents’ well-worn copies of Beatles albums, Crosby, Stills & Nash records that had survived countless moves, and Marvin Gaye LPs that carried the sonic DNA of a generation. The guys behind the counter had their own curriculum – ‘If you like Bob Dylan,’ they’d say, pulling out a record, ‘you need to understand Van Morrison. Each recommendation was a thread connecting genres, eras, and influences. The posters and pins I bought became badges of identity, physical markers of who I imagined myself to be – my evolving taste becoming my evolving self. College brought a whole new dimension to musical discovery. The dorm rooms became laboratories of shared taste, where knowledge flowed peer-to-peer rather than from expert to novice. We were no longer just studying musical history – we were living it, discovering our generation’s own sound. We’d spend hours exploring each other’s collections, from Seattle’s emerging grunge scene to the innovative beats of A Tribe Called Quest and De La Soul. At the record stores I discovered near campus, the physical act of discovery was sacred – you’d flip through crates until your fingers were dusty, squint at liner notes until your eyes hurt, and carry your finds home like treasures. The limitations of physical space meant every shopkeeper had to make careful choices about their inventory. These constraints created character; each store was unique, reflecting its curator’s expertise and community’s taste. Unlike today’s infinite digital shelves, the physical constraints demanded thoughtful curation – every inch of space had to earn its keep. After graduation in ’95, while the digital revolution was just beginning, I found myself building websites for businesses – my first ‘real’ job in what would soon be called the internet economy. That obsessive knowledge of baseball stats then found a new outlet when my buddy Pete and I started one of the first fantasy sports communities on the internet. We’d gone from hunting through magazines and desperately seeking other fans to building an entire online community. When Ask Jeeves acquired our company, I was riveted by what seemed like the ultimate promise: unlocking the world’s information. The ability to instantly search and access any piece of knowledge felt like having the keys to the universe. Looking back, I probably should have realized that a kid obsessed with organizing baseball statistics would end up working in fantasy sports and search engines. Some people find their calling early – I just happened to find mine in the nerdiest possible subcultures. By the late ’90s, I was making grandiose predictions about how the world would change – though honestly, I barely understood how the real world worked. Here I was, having gone from a teenager selling ice cream on the beach and waiting tables to suddenly pontificating about digital transformation – a kid who had never held a real job, completely clueless about supply chains, labor, manufacturing, or how businesses actually operated. Still, even in my naivety, my instincts weren’t wrong. Our generation straddled a unique divide – we were the last to grow up fully analog but young enough to help build the digital world. We understood both the limitations and the magic of physical discovery, which gave us a perspective that neither our parents nor our children had. We became the translators between these two worlds. The transformation wasn’t just happening in sports and careers. By the early 2000s, Napster made every song freely available, Google made information infinite, and Amazon made physical stores optional. The promise was democratization of knowledge – anyone could learn anything, anytime. The reality was more complicated. As Noam Chomsky once observed, 'Technology is just a tool. Like a hammer: you can use it to build a house, or you can use it to smash someone in the face.' Every technological advance was simultaneously creation and destruction – building new ways to access information while demolishing old ways of discovering it. The digital revolution built incredible things – unprecedented access to information, global communities, new forms of creativity. But it also demolished something precious in the process. Yes, information became abundant, but wisdom became scarce. The Alberts and record store guys were supplanted by recommendation algorithms optimized for engagement rather than enlightenment. We gained convenience but lost serendipity. The digital card catalog might be more efficient than the physical one, but it doesn’t teach you how to think about information – it just serves it up. When Albert would tell me about a baseball card’s value, he wasn’t just quoting a price guide; he was teaching me about scarcity, condition, historical context, and human nature – lessons about authenticity that feel especially relevant in today’s age of carefully curated online personas and AI-generated content. When those record store clerks made recommendations, they weren’t just matching genre tags; they were sharing their passion, transferring not just knowledge but a piece of their humanity. These weren’t algorithmic suggestions but moments of genuine connection, rich with context and alive with shared enthusiasm. You remember not just what they taught you, but the smell of the store, the afternoon light through dusty windows, the excitement in their voice when introducing you to something new. These weren’t just transactions – they were apprenticeships in how to think critically about the information in front of us. These lessons about human connection and discovering took on new meaning as I watched my own children navigate today’s digital landscape. Recently, helping my kid study for a geometry test about finding the length of a hypotenuse, I found myself turning to ChatGPT – both as a refresher for concepts I’d long forgotten and as a teaching tool. The AI broke down the Pythagorean theorem with a clarity that reminded me of Albert’s baseball card lessons. But there was a crucial difference. While Albert was giving me not just facts but crucial context and meaning, AI platforms – as powerful as they are – can’t replicate that human wisdom that knows when to push, when to pause, and how to spark that critical love of learning. Mark, one of my oldest friends and an expert in this area, has gone much deeper than me in exploring these technologies, helping me understand both their power and risks. His advice: test AI only on questions you already know the answers to, using it to understand the system’s biases and guardrails rather than treating it as an oracle. We’re still learning how to integrate these technologies into our lives, much like we did with search engines and the internet – remember when answering a simple historical question required a trip to the library? Or on a more frivolous level, when you couldn’t instantly check IMDB to see if an actor was in a movie? Each new tool requires us to develop new literacy about its strengths and limitations. This echoes what Brownstone author Thomas Harrington, one of my favorite writers and thinkers, warns about in his thoughtful analysis of modern education: we’re increasingly treating students as information processors rather than developing minds that need human guidance. He argues that while our culture venerates mechanical solutions, we’ve forgotten something fundamental – that teaching and understanding are deeply human processes that can’t be reduced to mere data transmission. Each student is, in his words, ‘a flesh and blood miracle capable of the most radical and creative acts of mental alchemy.’ Technology can make information more accessible, but it can’t replicate the human wisdom that knows when to push, when to pause, and how to spark that critical love of learning. This balance between technological tools and human wisdom plays out daily as we watch our teenagers navigate their digital landscape. My wife and I find ourselves simultaneously fighting and embracing modernity. I taught our oldest chess, but he honed his skills through an app. Now we play with a physical board most nights, talking through strategies and sharing stories between moves. The same dynamic shapes their relationship with basketball – they combine hours of physical practice with endless scrolling through social media and YouTube tutorials, studying moves and strategies in ways that were not available to us. They’re creating their own blend of physical and digital mastery. As parents of teens, we can’t direct their journey anymore; we can only put wind in their sails, helping them understand when to embrace technology and when to step away from it. The pattern recognition I gained through baseball cards, the record stores that showed me how to curate knowledge, and yes, even the freedom to roam until dark – to explore, to fail, to learn from our mistakes – these weren’t just nostalgic experiences. They were lessons in how to think, discover, and learn. As we navigate this AI revolution, perhaps the most valuable thing we can teach our kids isn’t how to use these powerful capabilities, but when not to use them – preserving space for the kind of deep, human learning that carries real weight – the kind no algorithm can replicate.

Greenland Redux: Trump And America’s Continuing Obsession – OpEd	History shows that empires acquire territories in various ways. Dynasties link arms through marriage, as the Habsburgs were famous for doing. Territories are pinched by means of arms or stolen through sham contracts and undertakings. They might also be purchased. The United States made much of the vast property sale in acquiring an empire. The Louisiana purchase of 1803 for a mere $15 million was daring, opportunistic and extra-legal. It was also initiated by a US president who had romantically insisted that the fledgling republic confine itself to the agricultural good deeds of a model yeomanry. But Thomas Jefferson could be cunningly devilish, and France, then under the firm rule of Napoleon Bonaparte, worried him. 'There is on the globe one single spot, the possessor of which is our natural and habitual enemy. It is New Orleans.' Boney, his interests more focused on Europe, was open to giving up the land for a fee. The natives, naturally, were not consulted. Jefferson, having previously advocated the need to observe the Constitution with pious dedication, ignored it on the issue of purchasing territory, there being no allowance for it in the document. And so the first signs of the imperial presidency showed. In 1868, the hungry eye of US officialdom showed that conquering and controlling the continent was not merely a matter of westward expansion that would eventually see, in the lofty observation of Frederick Jackson Turner, its closing. Acquisitive desires pointed to Iceland and Greenland as possible eastward options. A 1868 publication for the US State Department compiled by Benjamin Mills Peirce takes more than a fleeting interest in the resources of Iceland and Greenland, acknowledging the treaty with Denmark which was intended to cede control of the Caribbean islands of St. Thomas and St. John to the US. The 1868 report encouraged the acquisition of Greenland for two important reasons: commercial opportunities arising from exploiting the natural abundance of 'whale, walrus, seal, and shark, cod, ivory-cod, salmon, salmon-trout, and herring' and the political soundness of attaining a territory flanking 'British America on the Arctic and Pacific'. Greenland could thereby 'become a part of the American Union' and diminish British influence in the area. The treaty with Denmark concerning the Danish West Indies was a reminder that things were not going to be smooth. The acquisition of what would become the US Virgin Islands was the brainchild of Secretary of State William Henry Seward, a move seen by the US State Department as admirably benign. The treaty’s fate was chequered: initial rejection by the US Senate, directed mostly at Seward’s support for President Andrew Jackson during his impeachment proceedings, followed by Danish rejection in 1902. There was also some rancour about whether a plebiscite would be held for local inhabitants, given Danish fears about what would befall the black inhabitants under US rule, one hardly famed for its generosity to the swarthy races. The First World War finally saw the Danish West Indies formally transferred on March 31, 1917, along with $25 million in gold coin, an outcome assisted in some part by the bullying antics of US Secretary of State Robert Lansing. The Secretary was not shy in hinting that occupying the islands to prevent them falling into German hands was a distinct possibility. Interest in acquiring Greenland was further kindled by the Second World War. Again, worries about Germany featured, given its uneventful occupation of Denmark in 1940. The United States subsequently built the Thule Air Base in 1943. The Truman administration, at the conclusion of the war, failed to bait the Danes with a purchase price of $100 million, though the base continued to function under US control and the kingdom’s blessing. During President Donald Trump’s first term, the purchase obsession resurfaced like an itch, with any acquisition of Greenland being likened to a 'large real estate deal.' Denmark, he advised, carried it 'at a great loss. And strategically for the United States, it would be nice.' By most accounts, this had less to do with realpolitik than real estate. According to Peter Baker and Susan Glasser’s account of Trump’s first term, Denmark would receive the benighted territory of Puerto Rico in the exchange. They also suggest that the cheeky proposal came from the president’s longtime friend Ronald Lauder, heir to the Estée Lauder cosmetics empire. Typically, Trump insists it was all his idea. Trump subsequently found the Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen unimpressed, unwilling, and 'nasty'. For her part, the Danish PM had decided that 'the time when you buy and sell other countries and populations is over. Let’s leave it there.' Trump’s imminent return to the White House has revived old idiosyncrasies. Over the holiday period in December 2024, he had moments of Jeffersonian fancy, promising to take over the Panama Canal, which he regarded as being operated illegally, albeit lovingly, by 'the wonderful soldiers of China', turning Canada into the 51st State with former hockey professional Wayne Gretzky installed as governor, and purchasing Greenland. The president-elect’s choice of US ambassador to Denmark is seemingly premised on wooing Copenhagen, with Trump declaring Washington’s ownership of the territory 'an absolute necessity.' The views of Greenland’s Prime Minister Múte Egede suggest that such a project is unlikely to succeed. 'Greenland is ours. We are not for sale and will never be for sale.' It’s dangerous to be so unequivocal in the field of politics. In April last year, the Thule Air Base was renamed the Pituffik Space Base in a fit of advertised cultural sensitivity. The Department of Defense claimed that this better recognised 'Greenlandic cultural heritage' and more appropriately reflected 'its role in the US Space Force.' Greenlandic cultural heritage otherwise plays little role in the imperial vision of the base, with the US Space Force insisting that it 'enables Space Superiority', performing missile warning, missile defence roles, and space surveillance missions. In the scheme of things, owning Greenland in any official sense hardly matters, and the second Trump administration would be wise to just let the Danes deal with the icy mass and its incumbent problems. Washington already has what it needs – and more besides.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWeFji24WXB7IB8w23QCkPP1	2024-12-29T17:10:04-08:00	
Australia Now Has To Create New Economic Luck – OpEd	By EAF Editorial Board Australia is said to be the lucky country. With abundant natural resources, producing more than three times its own energy needs and exporting 70 per cent of its agricultural production, Australia helps to power and feed East Asia — the world’s most economically dynamic region to its north. Australia’s geographic isolation from its European political–cultural metropole and economic partners was once bemoaned as the ‘tyranny of distance‘. Its geography is now unquestionably an advantage, with relative proximity to East Asian markets and absolute distance from military security threats. The economic embrace of East Asia and transformative economic reforms in the 1980s helped Australia achieve three decades of economic growth without recession until the COVID-19 pandemic. Flexible markets at home, a macroeconomic framework that targets full employment and international openness meant that the Australian economy continued to grow through the Asian Financial Crisis of the late 1990s, even with two-thirds of its trade directed to the region, and avoided recession during the Global Financial Crisis a decade later. That experience in part helps to explain why Australia has largely avoided the backlash against globalisation seen in other advanced industrial economies. So do its political institutions: an independent electoral commission, compulsory voting and a preferential voting system that incentivises the major parties to prioritise the pragmatic concerns of median voters over firing up partisans. The benefits of growth have thus been shared across a relatively egalitarian society. Australia was never going to amount to much unless it took advantage of its luck. In this week’s lead article, Adam Triggs and Charlie Barnes explain that Australian living standards are now going backwards. ‘One statistic summarises the challenges facing the Australian economy’, they argue: ‘since the last federal election in 2022, Australians have lost more than 10 years of real wage growth’. While real household disposable income per capita grew 8.9 per cent across the OECD between the end of the 2018–19 financial year and the same time in 2024, it fell 1.4 per cent in Australia. The structural problems that have seen productivity growth stalling have been mounting for at least a decade, but have been masked by the terms of trade windfalls from exporting iron ore and other minerals to a resource-hungry China. In 2018 the Economist magazine described Australia as ‘perhaps the most successful rich economy’ in the world because of its rising incomes, low public debt, affordable welfare state and popular support for immigration. Today, incomes are sliding backwards, public debt is rising, the welfare state is under pressure from a rapidly growing disability insurance system and the government is having trouble managing the politics of a huge surge in post-pandemic immigration. The perceived impact of high migration on housing prices has caused both political parties to call for sharp cuts to immigration, Triggs and Barnes note. That includes foreign students, ‘despite international education being Australia’s third-largest export’. Without immigration, Australia would have been in recession by 2022. The policy to limit international student numbers and this damage to the higher education sector because of rising housing rents is akin to restricting the export of iron ore — Australia’s largest export — because its success appreciates the exchange rate. The source of Australia’s high living standards is its international specialisation in a narrow range of commodities and services and openness to foreign investment. Its institutions — such as a flexible exchange rate and relatively well-managed macroeconomic framework — help the economy adjust to the big shifts in global demand for its commodities without going into recession. The centre-left Labor Party government of Prime Minister Anthony Albanese has joined the global fashion of activism and interventionism in the market, announcing a Future Made in Australia plan to help decarbonise the economy, make it more resilient and to turn Australia into a renewable energy superpower. It has committed A$22.7 billion (US$14.2 billion) in subsidies, grants and investment incentives to drive green technology and advanced manufacturing. Without a clear framework, Future Made in Australia is likely to be a recipe for waste, with subsidies going to manufacturing that is better and more cheaply done elsewhere. In the name of making the economy more resilient and secure, it is more likely to achieve exactly the opposite. With an abundance of renewable energy resources, Australia is positioned to create its own new luck through the transformation of its economic relations with China, Japan and the rest of East Asia through embedded renewable energy exports. But what is missing from the Australian political agenda are the reforms that are needed in labour and other markets and a foreign investment regime that is open again to the massive foreign investment, including from China, that will deliver it. With an election due in the first half of 2025, neither of the two major political parties has a reform strategy that would lift living standards and restore real growth in this way. If it is to avoid having its luck run out, Australia needs a reform agenda suited to the structure of the Australian economy and its new position in the world.

From Youth Inclusion To Democratic Renewal: Reassessing Banglades...	Bangladesh currently stands at a pivotal juncture in its political development, triggered by the chief adviser Muhammad Yunus's proposal to reduce the minimum voting age from 18 to 17. Although immediate criticism has centred on potential administrative burdens and the possibility of postponing national elections, this initiative raises larger questions about the state's commitment to democratic legitimacy, civic education, and institutional responsiveness. Lowering the voting age transcends minor procedural reform and addresses deeper themes of governance, intergenerational equity, and how a nation fosters informed political consciousness among rising cohorts. Within this complex environment, the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) has cautioned that reconfiguring voter rolls could introduce further delays or doubts about electoral credibility. Yet evidence from diverse contexts underscores that extending the franchise to younger citizens, if accompanied by robust institutional measures and political education, can reinvigorate democratic systems. This article draws upon an expanded conception of youth participation, emphasising the ways in which inclusive electoral norms, carefully managed, can fortify democratic foundations, enhance rule of law, and promote a culture of accountability. The Foundations of Democratic Legitimacy Effective democracies derive their legitimacy from the active and meaningful participation of all capable citizens in shaping public decisions. Historically, limiting voting to those above 18 has frequently been interpreted as a presumed norm. Over recent decades, however, mounting research has questioned whether 18 truly represents an indispensable threshold of political maturity. Empirical studies increasingly suggest that political consciousness and the ability to make informed judgements often mature well before the eighteenth birthday, particularly when fostered through systemic engagement—namely, robust civic education and opportunities for genuine participation. A deeper rationale for lowering the voting age arises from the realisation that democracy flourishes through continual renewal and inclusivity. If younger citizens, who bear the long-term social, environmental, and economic consequences of policy, lack formal representation, a democratic deficit emerges. Contemporary challenges such as climate change, digital governance, and demographic transitions often draw acute attention from teenagers who might conceive of policy horizons differently than older cohorts. By enfranchising them earlier, the polity broadens the perspective embedded in its collective electoral decisions, reinforcing the fundamental requirement that no segment of the populace, capable of rational participation, is systematically excluded. Additionally, meaningful engagement typically nurtures its own momentum—when people experience firsthand the weight and responsibility of voting, they develop patterns of civic involvement and political inquiry that persist through adulthood. This self-reinforcing nature of political participation not only benefits individuals but also bolsters the legitimacy of democratic institutions, as a more diverse electorate compels politicians and policymakers to reflect more attentively on the concerns of future generations. Political Socialisation and Democratic Development Bangladeshi adolescents nearing the culmination of their secondary education occupy a decisive developmental phase that shapes their attitudes to public life. During these late teen years, individuals often form the cornerstone of their political identities and learn to navigate the institutional framework of governance. Cognitive development research and experiential studies affirm that adolescents can evaluate policy proposals with comparative sophistication, particularly if sustained by structured educational experiences and mentorship. The significance of political socialisation also highlights the gradual formation of civic competence—no single birthday confers abrupt political wisdom. Rather, the capacity for reasoned decision-making emerges incrementally, aided by discussions with peers and family, media exposure, and guided encounters with policy debates. Lowering the voting age to 17 amplifies the role of this transitional stage: instead of passively awaiting adulthood, young citizens step into the electoral domain at a juncture when their curiosity, sense of justice, and desire for autonomy are poised to intensify. One of the strongest arguments for earlier suffrage is the view that participation is inherently educative. By actively engaging in the electoral process rather than merely absorbing lessons from textbooks or witnessing others vote, these newly enfranchised citizens refine their critical faculties and learn to interpret manifestos and public policy. Such experiential learning, widely regarded as more profound than theoretical instruction, fosters autonomy, civic literacy, and accountability-oriented mindsets. In this manner, the proposal to lower the voting age essentially harnesses a phase of heightened receptivity in young people, channelling it into positive democratic involvement. Institutional Transformation and Systemic Adaptation Though rife with potential, lowering the voting age cannot succeed as an isolated amendment; it necessitates broad-based institutional adaptation. Electoral commissions must integrate 17-year-olds into registration records seamlessly, preventing confusion over the updated voter list. Educational bodies, likewise, should recalibrate civic curricula, ensuring that adolescents have ample scope to learn about governance structures and analytical debate. If carefully orchestrated, these adjustments can provoke beneficial ripple effects throughout Bangladesh's political landscape. Previous global instances of expanding voter eligibility suggest that such changes often trigger deeper institutional innovations. When new cohorts enter the electorate, parties and electoral agencies are compelled to alter their messaging, forging issue-based dialogues that resonate with younger perspectives. Over time, these electoral expansions can also galvanise calls for transparency, anti-corruption measures, and equitable resource allocation, precisely because energetic youth activism puts fresh issues on the political agenda. Yet the risks remain if reform appears rushed or poorly managed. Critics are correct to stress that abrupt changes must not infringe upon constitutionally mandated election periods or disrupt long-awaited polls. For this reason, incremental planning, pilot implementation, and close consultations with political stakeholders become critical. Rather than fuelling suspicion, the process should reassure the public that the move to enfranchise younger voters will neither undermine the electoral timetable nor compromise procedural integrity. Political Education and Democratic Capability One of the clearest lessons from experiences in other jurisdictions is that youth enfranchisement must intersect with quality political education. Absent this synergy, concerns about immaturity, superficial voting patterns, or susceptibility to populist appeals gain traction. If, however, schools, civil society organisations, and local governments invest in comprehensive training that demystifies institutional structures, illustrates policy trade-offs, and facilitates respectful political dialogue, young voters are more likely to wield their ballots thoughtfully. Civic education must go beyond rote memorisation of constitutional articles or historical events. Instead, it should highlight real-time policy challenges and teach students critical thinking. Meaningful opportunities—simulated parliaments, debates on contemporary laws, community service—help contextualise the notion of 'casting a vote,' turning it from a dry exercise into a deeply consequential act of citizenship. Adolescents who delve into local governance, volunteer in electoral commissions, or shadow political representatives develop tangible competence and a sense of ownership in their country's future. Additionally, beyond formal curricula, extracurricular channels have proven effective in enhancing political cognition. Debating clubs, student councils, and cross-school forums equip teenagers with networking skills, confidence in public speaking, and adaptability when evaluating rival positions. Pairing these outlets with the actual right to vote elevates the entire educational experience from theoretical engagement to practical democracy-building. Bangladesh, by strengthening these pathways, can concretely demonstrate how lowering the voting age aligns with a holistic vision of building a more literate and activist electorate. Impact on Democratic Culture and Institutional Accountability The emergence of a younger electorate frequently reshapes democratic culture and compels institutional actors to take long-term societal concerns more seriously. By endowing those aged 17 with the legal right to vote, Bangladesh would bring novel perspectives to bear on the national policy agenda. Issues previously overlooked or shelved—such as environmental sustainability, technological innovation, equity in education, and digital governance—might find urgent articulation, reflecting the future-oriented vantage point of newly enfranchised citizens. Such a recalibration of priorities often catalyses renewed pressure for institutional accountability. When fresh electorates challenge entrenched practices, political parties cannot ignore the dynamism of youth demands. They may be impelled to build stronger alliances with student bodies, adopt clearer stances on corruption, or articulate more transparent policies regarding resource distribution. Over the long term, this generationally expanded discourse can enhance democratic quality, as officeholders must respond to an electorate that is vibrant, civically educated, and motivated to hold them answerable. The concept of continuous democratic renewal thereby resonates profoundly in the Bangladeshi case. Rather than conceiving of elections as cyclical events limited to older electors, a broader participatory model fosters constant reinvention of public priorities. And although sceptics might foresee complexities and transitional strain, evidence from other nations confirms that opening electoral doors to younger people typically fosters a stronger ethos of civic engagement and a deeper commitment to lawful, equitable governance. Conclusion Muhammad Yunus's proposal to reduce the minimum voting age in Bangladesh from 18 to 17 is neither trivial nor merely administrative. It is, rather, a bold reimagining of how democratic participation could evolve, enabling adolescents at a formative stage of development to engage directly in shaping their country's future. The immediate scepticism voiced by political factions such as the BNP underscores real concerns over logistical complications, potential election delays, and public perception. Yet an extensive body of international and developmental research suggests that deliberate, well-structured reforms can yield substantial rewards—strengthening civic competences, enhancing institutional responsiveness, and expanding the horizon of policy discourse. The key lies in approaching the measure holistically. Robust electoral planning must be matched by effective civic education, bridging theoretical instruction with practical forums that cultivate the dispositions of critical thinking and democratic responsibility. Far from undermining democratic norms, a carefully implemented expansion of the electorate to 17-year-olds could revitalise them, offering a generational infusion of energy that prompts greater transparency, accountability, and respect for the rule of law. By embracing this proposed change, Bangladesh can signal a progressive commitment to a democracy that continuously refines itself to include rising social groups and adapt to evolving public challenges. If guided prudently, lowering the voting age becomes a catalyst for deeper engagement, forging a more equitable and inclusive political order, and reinforcing the central premise that the vitality of democratic governance rests upon broad-based participation. Through measured implementation, comprehensive education strategies, and a firm adherence to democratic principles, this initiative has the potential to fortify Bangladesh's evolving political landscape, bringing forth a renewed sense of purpose and accountability that transcends short-term electoral considerations.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWeFji24WXB7IFgEurx4QEDv	2024-12-29T17:05:28-08:00	
Deborah Birx’s Bird Flu Fearmongering Campaign – OpEd	In June, I wrote about Deborah Birx, one of the key 'public health' officials from the orchestration of the American coronavirus scare, being back in action stirring up fear of another disease. This time Birx’s fearmongering was about bird flu. And she was advocating for government to follow a similar disastrous course to supposedly counter this disease as had been pursued in regard to coronavirus in the crackdown begun years back. Here is an update. Birx is continuing on her quest to stir up a new bird flu scare in America, and to build public support for a government response harmful to health and liberty. A recent stop on Birx’s bird flu fearmongering campaign was a Friday interview at CNN in which she warned that, like coronavirus early on, bird flu is not being addressed sufficiently by the United States government. Now, she said, routine weekly testing of people who may have been exposed to bird flu needs to be undertaken. This testing Birx suggested mirrors testing that was pursued to build up fear of coronavirus through jacking up the number of coronavirus cases via testing that shot out many false positive results. Indeed, Birx stated in the interview that with bird flu much increased testing is needed because 'we know from covid most of the spread was asymptomatic.' Got that? The testing is purposed to identify people as sick despite the fact that they are not sick. Birx has her pandemic propaganda process down pat. In her CNN interview pitch, Birx tried to butter up her potential victims, declaring 'I find the American public to be incredibly smart.' Hopefully, most Americans will prove too smart to fall for Birx’s new fearmongering campaign and the attacks on health and liberty it supports.

Can Europe Afford To Pay For Its Own Defense? – OpEd	By Mohamed Chebaro Many voices in Europe have recently been claiming that the continent would not be able to defend itself without the US. They have been warning that NATO without the US also could not defend Europe. Alarming as that sounds for Western democracy, one wonders if Western nations have lost their way, as well as their will to modify their nations and their economies in the interest of preserving their freedoms. Above all, they still seem too politically divided to protect their way of life, which has been so visibly under attack since Russia invaded Ukraine in February 2022.The leaders of the three front-line states bordering Russia — Latvia, Estonia and Finland — last week urged NATO to stop 'endlessly debating' how it might deal with the looming threat from Russia. They urged members of the alliance to increase defense spending to meet the level of the threat emanating from their eastern neighbor.The election of Donald Trump — at best a skeptic regarding the mission of NATO and America’s role in defending European countries — has no doubt focused minds on the need for European states to urgently bolster the continent’s defenses. This is something that has proven elusive for decades; a problem that is easier to discuss than to act on.But the issue may not be restricted to whether Washington will withhold its commitment to defending Europe or if simply raising their spending will achieve a self-sufficient defense. There is also the fact that Europe’s research and industrial sectors are now more than ever at the mercy of market forces and of profit, rather than securing the group of nations’ security and defense interests.Trump’s statement in February that he would encourage Russia to do 'whatever the hell they want' to NATO nations that do not pay their fair share no doubt rattled many countries that are still totally reliant on the alliance and its treaty’s Article 5 on collective defense. By the admission of many defense ministers of countries that are members of the transatlantic alliance, the grouping needs America in both the short and the longer term, even if they all started spending in excess of 5 percent of their gross domestic product on defense, not just the current target of 2 percent that only two-thirds of members will achieve this year.The three front-line nations raising the alarm are among those that have been spending the highest ratio of GDP on defense.The NATO target of 2 percent has been deemed by many as too low even for peacetime. Russia, for example, is projected to spend in excess of 6 percent of its GDP on defense in 2025. The UK, in comparison, is likely to spend 2.3 percent, while France might only just cross the 2 percent threshold in 2024, having spent only 1.94 percent in 2022. Germany spent 2 percent in 2024 but is not expected to spend more than that until 2028.It is clear to many that European nations need to correct their defense deficits and quickly find ways to compensate for years of downgrading their military capabilities after the end of the Cold War. But this is likely to take time, especially considering the constantly changing nature of warfare in the wake of recent technological revolutions and the uncertain future impacts of cyberwarfare and the artificial intelligence realm. These uncertainties have wreaked havoc on planning, research, manufacturing and procurement for many armies around the world. Take the UK as an example. The government in London is about to embark on its third strategic defense review in the space of four years. And that is not just due to emerging threats, but also their multiplication and their differing nature.What should defense be focused on: conventional or unconventional capabilities? Previous reviews guided military commanders to draw down on conventional capabilities, such as large standing armies and tank battalions, to make way for more advanced cyber supremacy that would blind the operability of enemy forces.Should Britain reduce or increase its naval fleet and at what cost to its overall force posture and power projection? Should it renew its nuclear arsenal or reduce it? Counting the money when it comes to defense is not a fun game. In the case of the UK, the nation has been doing a little bit of everything, but less well than before, to the point that its standing army, it is said, could be 'expended' after as little as six months of war.London is not alone in this, as France and Germany are unlikely to fare any better due to budgetary, political and geostrategic adversities. Strategic reviews have always necessitated tradeoffs in a world of ever-increasing sources of insecurity and instability, both state and nonstate, as well as hybrid and asymmetric threats. That makes any spending less impactful, even the ambitious 5 percent of GDP called for by some European countries that are fearful of US priorities shifting further east.Short of rejigging their political and military alliances, as well as their research, development and manufacturing capabilities, European nations are likely to spend their time plugging holes in an ever more demanding security landscape. It is not simply a matter of money or survivability, but also the need to come clean with voters. They need to clarify that the world is today a more dangerous place and that greater defense spending can be paid for either by cutting services or raising taxes. Only then will the future look less bleak and the enemies and friends of Europe might — but only might — take note. • Mohamed Chebaro is a British-Lebanese journalist with more than 25 years of experience covering war, terrorism, defense, current affairs and diplomacy.

Robert Reich: Why Musk Is Wrong About Opening America To Skilled ...	When I was secretary of labor, America’s emerging big tech industry pushed to raise the cap on the number of skilled workers allowed into the United States under the H1B visa program. I resisted the pressure, telling business that if they wanted skilled workers so badly, they should train Americans for these jobs, including their own workers. Apparently the same controversy has emerged among Trump advisors over whether and how many skilled foreign workers should be allowed into the United States on work visas. On the one side are billionaire techies such as Elon Musk, the world’s richest person who sunk more than a quarter of a billion dollars into Trump’s reelection effort, and David Sachs, a venture capitalist who also poured a fortune into Trump’s campaign. (Trump has rewarded Musk by picking him to be co-chair of the so-called department of government efficiency, and rewarded Sachs by naming him czar for artificial intelligence and cryptocurrency policy.) Both Musk and Sachs are from Big Tech and want more skilled workers from around the world. Both built or financed businesses that rely on the government’s H-1B visa program to hire skilled workers from abroad. Trump’s immigration hard-liners don’t agree. Their goal is to radically restrict immigration, deport anyone who’s undocumented, and put up high tariffs to discourage imports from other nations (and their workers). Which side is right? On balance, it’s important to keep the pressure on American businesses to educate and train Americans for skilled jobs in the United States. Allowing many more skilled workers into the United States reduces any incentives on American business to invest in the American workforce. Why do so when they can get talent from abroad? Allowing many more skilled workers into the U.S. also reduces the bargaining power of skilled workers already in America — and thereby reduces any incentive operating on other Americans to gain the skills for such jobs. And opening America to skilled workers also reduces the incentive on foreign nations to educate and nurture their own skilled workforces. Why should they, when their own skilled workers can easily migrate to America? The major beneficiaries in the U.S. of opening the nation to skilled workers from abroad are CEOs and venture capitalists like Musk and Sachs, whose profits and wealth would be even higher if they could siphon off cheaper skilled workers from abroad.

Azerbaijan’s Pragmatism: How Media Speculation Fails To Stir Cont...	Although the news of the emergency landing of an AZAL Embraer190 passenger plane near the city of Aktau, Kazakhstan, as a result of serious damages from external interference, made headlines on world news portals, it did not satisfy many media speculators in terms of creating a bigger scandal. For example, at the time of the incident, some political insiders dreamed of watching a blood-curdling gladiator fight in the Colosseum. But the result was not what they had imagined... Some anti-Russian groups actually saw this incident as another hostile front against Russia. Against the backdrop of the investigation that had been going on for several days after the plane crash, various versions were already being invented and the foundations were being laid to create a chaotic picture between Russia and Azerbaijan. Although the support was not unanimous, subtexts such as 'Hey, you were an ally', 'Russia must respond!' and inflammatory campaigns began to affect a sensitive public audience. At that time, many influential Western media outlets were expecting a response from Azerbaijan to Moscow rather than a Russian admission for circulation. Let us recall the recent past: On November 9, 2021, on the eve of the sensitive situation in Garabagh after the Patriotic War, the Azerbaijani side accidentally shot down a Russian military helicopter in the air. This incident not only caused a stir in the media but also began to be discussed in terms of Russia's reaction to Azerbaijan. The same media organizations that are currently twisting the issue in the same way were interpreting the incident three years ago in a similar way. Some claimed that the official Kremlin would open a serious criminal case against Baku and believed that the issues could deepen and become a source of extensive topics. However, the pragmatic approach of the parties to the issue accelerated the resolution of the case in a positive direction. The incident involving the AZAL passenger plane on December 25 formed another topic and focused news hunters on the motives of the incident. So what were they hoping for? What kind of reaction did they expect from Baku? The West often acts as a catalyst, getting things done, and then retreats. This has been observed in long practice, and Azerbaijan has not allowed outside interference to get close to the issue. The determined struggle of President Ilham Aliyev against the background of clarifying the incident and revealing the motives of the crime prevented a sharp reaction in both internal audience and external circles. Some circles, wanting to use the situation for their own benefit, forgot about the unity between the people and the head of state of Azerbaijan. At such a sensitive moment, the reaction of the people was of ripple effect for them. As the images reflected on social networks described the incident, the sensitive cords between Baku and Moscow were further strained. Only pragmatism could play an important role here. After all, Baku and Moscow are allied states, and this alliance is reflected in important points in the document signed in 2022. Azerbaijan could have discussed the incident with Russia in a different way, and it is no longer noted or commented on who would benefit more from burning bridges between the two states. Such incidents happen often, and relations between the parties do not become strained unless the incidents are deliberate. Russia stated that it needed time to investigate the incidents and to get more insight into the matter, and after 2 days of intensive investigations, an apology message was sent to Azerbaijan. This was a confession that demonstrated Russia's ability to admit its mistakes and its commitment to the partnership between the two states. It also reduced the importance of external forces to zero and emphasized the importance of stability in the South Caucasus.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWeFji24WXB7IHsTEUSXbVxo	2024-12-29T16:47:58-08:00	
The Geopolitics Of Elite Insanity: Creating Eretz Yisrael To Resh...	As the multifaceted Elite program to reshape world order, capture ownership and control of all key resources, kill off a substantial proportion of the human population and impose a technocratic dictatorship over those ‘transhumans’ left alive advances rapidly, increasing parts of the geopolitical chessboard are being reshaped in accord with these Elite purposes. See ‘The Brave New World of 1984 2030: 'You’ll Own Nothing. And You’ll Be Happy.'’ Thus, against the backdrop of the war in Ukraine and other less publicized tragedies taking place – including the war and famine in Sudan and the war in Mozambique (see ‘Mozambique conflict has left 1 million displaced but Western media still focuses on Ukraine’) – the Zionist head of the Global Elite has implemented its plan to create Eretz Yisrael (Greater Israel), the biblical homeland of the Jews in West Asia, as part of ‘the [long-standing] Zionist plan... for the Middle East which is based on the division of the whole area into small states, and the dissolution of all the existing Arab states.’ See ‘A Strategy for Israel in the Nineteen Eighties’. With various meanings since its origin, these days ‘Greater Israel’ is understood to include part or all of the various countries in immediate proximity to Israel, perhaps in accordance with the ‘map’ of ‘Greater Israel’ displayed by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in his address to the United Nations General Assembly in New York on 22 September 2023 – see ‘In UN speech, Netanyahu holds map showing West Bank, Gaza as part of Israel’ – or, more likely, as displayed and discussed in this article: ‘'Greater Israel': The Zionist Plan for the Middle East. The Infamous 'Oded Yinon Plan'’. Consequently, since Israel’s genocidal war on the Palestinians was launched in response to the carefully-scripted assault by Hamas on Israel on 7 October 2023, key Elite agents have been deployed to reshape the geopolitical map of West Asia to consolidate Elite control of the peoples and resources of that region and facilitate a multitude of ‘follow on’ impacts elsewhere. Most notably, these Elite agents have included the governments of Israel and the United States along with a range of mercenary and terrorist groups, as well as the usual raft of prominent Western European governments, major weapons corporations and government/corporate media. The media agents have been assigned the role of sanitizing Israel’s genocide of the Palestinians while condemning any solidarity words and action on behalf of the Palestinians as ‘anti-Semitism’ and justifying the aggressive war by the US and Israel as well as the terrorist groups they sponsor against various countries in West Asia while demonizing those governments and movements that are removed/defeated. Of course, there is nothing secret about what is happening: after all, it is being televised. But devoid of even the remotest idea of how the world actually works and the nature of the Elite program being implemented, even those considered well-informed are easily duped by Elite propaganda to readily misinterpret the conflict configuration. In any case, only the rarest individual has sufficient comprehension of what is happening and the courage to take the personal, strategic action to effectively resist it. Hence, the Elite program proceeds unimpeded with virtually all ‘resistance’ confined to meaningless activities. Let me offer four examples of analysts who do not understand the conflict configuration. In a recent interview, Vanessa Beeley was highly critical of Russia for ‘abandoning Syria’ and also lamented that the primary government and corporate journalists who were reporting recent events in the West were deliberately misrepresenting what they were witnessing ‘on the ground’ in Syria. Listen to ‘Syria Podcast Episode 2’. In a recent article, Paul Craig Roberts asked ‘why is Putin helping Washington succeed? Putin complains about the growing instability and violence in the Middle East. Does he realize that he contributed to it by withdrawing Russia’s defense of Syria? Did Putin forget 'seven countries in five years'? Did Putin forget 'Greater Israel'? Did Putin forget Turkey’s ambition against the Kurds?’ See ‘Will Putin Fight or Surrender?’ Meanwhile, Professor Jeffrey Sachs laments what has transpired, noting that ‘American interference, at the behest of Netanyahu’s Israel, has left the Middle East in ruins, with over a million dead and open wars raging in Libya, Sudan, Somalia, Lebanon, Syria, and Palestine, and with Iran on the brink of a nuclear arsenal, being pushed against its own inclinations to this eventuality. All this is in the service of a profoundly unjust cause: to deny Palestinians their political rights in the service of Zionist extremism….’ See ‘US & Israel Destroyed Syria & Called it Peace’. And Mike Whitney argues that ‘These are Israel’s wars, and they are prosecuted to pursue Israeli interests not American interests. The US military (and political class) has been hijacked by the maneuverings of strongarm lobbyists who know how to work the levers of power to achieve their own ends. Their rate of success speaks for itself. Much of the Middle East lies in ruins which was the plan from the get-go. But now comes the hard part, because nothing has really been resolved in Syria.’ See ‘Has Bibi Achieved His Dream of Obliterating the Arab World?’ But what is transpiring in West Asia goes vastly beyond what is being described in articles such as these and without a full understanding of what is happening, it is impossible to recognize the full extent of the threats or to effectively resist them. And at this point in history, we do not have the luxury of time. So what is happening? The Elite plan – as noted above: to reshape world order, capture ownership and control of all key resources, kill off a substantial proportion of the human population and impose a technocratic dictatorship on those ‘transhumans’ left alive – is being advanced by a wide range of methods. One method is to use its agents in national governments and elsewhere to simply destroy nation-states, one way or another, with each state destroyed also representing another step in the progressive neutralization of any prospect of effective resistance to the overall Elite program as more people’s attention inevitably turns to personal survival. Of course, it does not have to destroy countries in the way it has destroyed Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Palestine, Lebanon and now Syria, the plan for which was originally exposed by U.S. Army Gen. Wesley Clark in ‘[US] Plans for Middle East’ [to attack Iraq, Syria, Lebanon, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Iran] from confidential information he received at the Pentagon on 20 September 2001. But it has no compunction about doing so when it is judged the best option. And it is easy to do this when you can use national military forces, special operations forces, mercenaries (‘military contractors’ in the sanitized jargon), terrorists and/or just a range of agents to incite the fear, hatred and anger among a diverse range of marginalized ethnic, religious and other groups, flood these groups with military weapons and training, and incite them to fight among themselves (causing further destabilization and chaos in the impacted regions). So beyond the countries just listed and while Syria is already being dismembered – see ‘Netanyahu says Golan Heights will always be 'part of Israel'’ – now Yemen has been attacked – see ‘Massive Israeli Attack on Sanaa During Houthi Leader’s Speech Nearly Kills Visiting WHO Head’ – and Israel has signaled its intentions in relation to the most important ‘prize’ on the list. See ‘Israel informs Trump of its resolve to act against Iran’. Of course, President Putin of Russia did not ‘abandon Syria’ or ‘help Washington’, as he made clear in his recent end-of-year address and interactive session with Russians. See ‘Results of the Year’ summarized in relation to Syria here: ‘Putin weighs in on the Syrian situation’. And it was not ‘American interference, at the behest of Netanyahu’s Israel’ or even ‘Israel’s wars... prosecuted to pursue Israeli interests not American interests’ as the four authors cited above respectively claim. So what did happen? In fact, what happened is that Presidents Putin, Netanyahu and Biden (or his handlers) as well as other ‘national leaders’ simply acted in accord with Elite imperatives, with which they are respectively familiar, in the context. After all, their records of complicity with Elite imperatives are impeccable even though just playing their roles facilitates maintenance of the popular delusion that nation-states are key actors in the international system and primary agents in international conflict. For evidence of Putin’s complicity in the wider Elite program, see ‘The War in Ukraine: Understanding and Resisting the Global Elite’s Deeper Agenda’ which notes, among other points, that he is a wealthy member of the World Economic Forum. But all other national leaders were submissive to the Elite program or, in the case of the five national presidents (of Burundi, Swaziland/Eswatini, Tanzania, Ivory Coast and Haiti) who were not submissive in relation to enforcing mandatory Covid-19 injections on their populations, they were assassinated. See ‘All Three Presidents Who Declined the Covid Vaccine are now DEAD’. (Predictably, perhaps, four references I had discussing these deaths are no longer accessible at their original links and yet several corporate ‘fact checkers’ are still online purportedly ‘disproving’ that the cause of death of these five presidents was as originally reported!) Understanding the Conflict Depending on the context, most people believe that conflict is direct (that is, not structural, cultural or ecological) and is between two or more highly visible and ‘different’ parties that are discussed in the corporate media and that each conflict is unrelated to most others. For example, in the context of the genocide of the Palestinians and the recently generated wars between various countries in West Asia, most people believe that the primary conflict is between Israel and the Palestinians – or between Israel and various neighboring countries (whether Arab, Islamic or Persian) – with an ongoing and parallel debate over whether Israel wags the US tail or the US wags the Israeli tail as discussed in ‘Palestinian Syndrome’. The idea that the Global Elite generated these conflicts and many others using a worldwide multitude of (mostly unwitting) agents throughout global organizational structures and national political, economic and social systems to achieve a long-planned and wider outcome for the Elite at the expense of humanity as a whole, is rarely even considered and, to most people, sounds preposterous. Which means that the system works more or less perfectly. The Elite program is systematically implemented with virtually all people rendered scared and ignorant, and certainly powerless to act effectively, in each context and in relation to the whole. Again, let me illustrate this in relation to the Elite’s Eretz Yisrael project. So when I mentioned ‘the Zionist head of the Global Elite’ above, who do I mean? In 1917 British Foreign Secretary Arthur Balfour wrote to Zionist Lord Lionel Walter Rothschild in which he expressed the support of the British government for the establishment of a Jewish homeland on Palestinian land in the Middle East. The Balfour Declaration justified the brutal seizure of Palestinian land for the post-WWII establishment of Israel. However, Israel would serve not as some high-minded ‘Jewish homeland’, but as the lynchpin in Rothschild control (including through other Elite families which act as ‘fronts’ and agents) over the bulk of the world’s fossil fuel supply (located in the Middle East). Baron Edmond de Rothschild built the first oil pipeline from the Red Sea to the Mediterranean to bring BP Iranian oil to Israel. He founded Israeli General Bank and Paz Oil. He is considered by many the father of modern Israel. See Rule by Secrecy: The Hidden History that Connects the Trilateral Commission, the Freemasons and the Great Pyramids pp.84-85 and Big Oil & Their Bankers in the Persian Gulf – Four Horsemen, Eight Families, and Their Global Intelligence, Narcotics & Terror Network p.490. Consequently, what we are witnessing now is a new and decisive stage in the Zionist plan to occupy a substantially larger proportion of the Middle East in which not just Palestine but Syria, Iran and parts of other countries will be violently seized and occupied by the Israeli and US militaries, or the various terrorist groups under their control, on behalf of the Rothschilds and other families at the head of the Global Elite. This will mean capture of total control of strategic oil and gas reserves in the Middle East and facilitate other projects, including the construction of highly profitable oil and gas pipelines across the region and the Ben Gurion Canal (to compete with the Suez Canal). These fossil fuel reserves include the gigantic Leviathan maritime natural gas resources in the Mediterranean Sea off the coast of Gaza – see ‘'Wiping Gaza Off The Map': Big Money Agenda. Confiscating Palestine’s Maritime Natural Gas Reserves’ – in which the BG Group expressed interest in early 2016 before becoming part of Shell Global. See ‘Combining Shell and BG: a simpler and more profitable company’. Of course, Shell has been a Rothschild corporation since the very early 20th century. According to the Rothschild Archive: ‘As it turned out, Rothschilds had a decisive influence in shaping Royal Dutch Shell, more so than anyone had previously imagined.’ See ‘Searching for oil in Roubaix’. But Shell does not represent the only Rothschild investment in energy supplies. By the way, if you doubt that one family (using other wealthy families as fronts and agents) has the power to orchestrate all of this ‘below the radar’, you are welcome to consider the evidence of their power acquired over many generations summarized in Historical Analysis of the Global Elite: Ransacking the World Economy Until ‘You’ll Own Nothing.’ And in his latest book just published, another analyst of Elite power, Paul Cudenec, argues that even ‘the Rockefeller empire, a 19th century Big Oil rival to the Rothschilds, was absorbed by them and transformed into yet another front’. See The Single Global Mafia: The Rockefeller Foundation’s multiple links to Zionism and military-industrial-financial neo-imperialism. p.5. For one estimate of Rothschild wealth by a scholar highly qualified to make the calculation, here is Dean Henderson’s article on the subject from 2012: ‘The Money Changers: Rothschild Banking Dynasty Said To Be Worth $100 Trillion’. When one considers the laughable ‘lists of the world’s wealthiest individuals’ published by corporate media (which tend to focus on the Elite’s attention-seeking minions like Bill Gates, Elon Musk, Jeff Bezos and Mark Zuckerberg, among others), it is clear that their ownership of such media ensures that families like the Rothschilds are simply not considered (or mentioned). What Can We Do? Most vitally, I encourage you to not make the mistake of believing that the Elite is not coming for you. If you do not take personal action to defend yourself against the Elite program, then you will either be killed outright or enslaved in one of its technocratic prisons. After all, as I have explained many times ‘The Global Elite is Insane Revisited’, and virtually all humans are utterly submissive as an outcome of the violence they each suffered during childhood. See ‘Why Violence?’ and ‘Fearless Psychology and Fearful Psychology: Principles and Practice’. Nevertheless, if you wish to better understand and respond powerfully to what is happening in Ukraine, see: ‘The War in Ukraine: Understanding and Resisting the Global Elite’s Deeper Agenda’. If your primary concern is Palestine: ‘Nonviolent Strategy to Halt the Genocide in Gaza, Liberate Palestine and Defeat the Global Technocracy’. Or your focus is the wider wars now happening in Central Asia and West Asia: Strategic Goals for a Nonviolent Struggle to End a War. But whether or not you act in response to these Elite projects, resisting the advancing technocracy is crucial for your own future: ‘Fighting for Our Humanity, Fighting for Our Future’. Each article above also links to the ‘We Are Human We Are Free’ campaign – which identifies the strategic action necessary to defend yourself from this technocracy (explained, most simply, on the ‘We Are Human We Are Free’ one-page flyer, available in 23 languages). Conclusion As I have explained previously, your death or transhuman slavery in a technocratic prison is now imminent. Thus, tragically, even if the Palestinians won the war against Israel, Fatah and Hamas have already signed off on a deal – see ‘Hamas and Fatah 'to form joint committee [of technocrats] to administer Gaza'’ – to enslave Palestinians in the technocratic state that is being rapidly built around them. So, unless Palestinians also successfully resist the advancing technocracy as well, there is no good outcome for the people of Palestine whatever the outcome of the current war. If history is any guide, our time to resist effectively the various threats to humanity in each of these (and other) conflicts will be wasted by either doing nothing (because the threats go unrecognized and/or people are afraid to act), signing a petition, lobbying a politician for a vote on this or that issue, attending a demonstration or otherwise directing our effort to changing the behavior of someone who has no influence within the global power structure. And sadly, people you believe are ‘on your side’ will encourage you to waste your time in these ways. Of course, I am well aware, that you also believe that you have ‘no influence within the global power structure’. And yet, you do. If the Elite is to complete its program to control all people and all resources, which is what makes each of the conflicts nominated above just part of the larger whole, then it needs your cooperation, in very precise ways, between now and the envisaged program’s completion. Or it needs your circumstances to be such that you are in no position to resist, even if you had the knowledge and commitment to do so. And that is why creating chaos in your country is a viable Elite strategy, particularly in those contexts where capturing resources is a crucial part of the Elite program as well. So if you resolutely withhold your cooperation in the precise ways nominated in the strategies above, and we can mobilize enough people to join you, then we can defeat the Elite and continue to live some version of a free and independent life based on our own volition.

Trump 2.0 And Bangladesh 2.0: Redefining Dynamics In A New Era Of...	Donald Trump’s re-election as the 47th President of the United States and his anticipated inauguration on January 20, 2025, herald the beginning of Trump 2.0. This coincides with transformative political developments in Bangladesh following the July Revolution. Together, these shifts have set the stage for a recalibration of the U.S.-Bangladesh bilateral relationship, presenting a mix of opportunities and challenges against the backdrop of global realignments. The July Revolution: Charting a New Political Era in Bangladesh The July Revolution marks a watershed moment in Bangladesh’s political trajectory. Triggered by systemic corruption, dwindling public trust, and authoritarian governance under the long-standing rule (2009-2024) of Sheikh Hasina and the Bangladesh Awami League (BAL), the revolution was spearheaded by youth protests, largely driven by Gen Z activists. This movement culminated in the ousting of Hasina, whose government had been criticized for voter suppression, media censorship, and political persecution. The revolution installed an interim government led by Nobel laureate Dr. Muhammad Yunus. This transitional administration faces daunting challenges, including dismantling politicized state institutions, managing violent disruptions by pro-BAL factions, and addressing public demands for sweeping democratic and socio-economic reforms. There is also an underlying fear of counter-revolutionary efforts. Moreover, the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP), the primary opposition party, is pressuring the interim government to hold elections swiftly. While the interim government initially garnered widespread support, frustrations over slow reforms and political instability have tempered public optimism. This period of political upheaval presents an opportunity for Bangladesh to redefine its foreign policy and rebalance relations with global powers, particularly the U.S. and China. However, navigating these competing influences will require deft diplomacy and careful prioritization of national interests. U.S. Frustrations with the Hasina Regime For years, Washington expressed concern over the erosion of democratic norms in Bangladesh under Sheikh Hasina’s government. Her administration faced consistent criticism for suppressing dissent, curbing press freedoms, and consolidating power through manipulated elections. These issues led to Bangladesh’s exclusion from President Biden’s Democracy Summits and drew pointed criticism from U.S. officials. Ahead of Bangladesh’s 46th Independence Day, President Biden sent a letter emphasizing the importance of democracy, human rights, and free elections—clear signals of U.S. discontent with Hasina’s governance. Now, Dr. Yunus’ interim government provides an opportunity for a reset. At the UN headquarters in September 2024, President Biden publicly congratulated Yunus on his appointment, expressing optimism about Bangladesh’s democratic transition and pledging U.S. support for the country’s reform agenda. This marked a shift in tone and opened avenues for greater bilateral cooperation, particularly in governance and institutional rebuilding. Trump 2.0: A Different U.S. Approach to Bangladesh Donald Trump’s re-election signals a return to his hallmark 'America First' policy. He prefers bilateral deals over multilateralism, and he is skeptical of treaties and alliances, preferring competition to cooperation. This approach, combined with his administration’s heightened focus on countering China’s influence, presents both opportunities and challenges for Bangladesh as it navigates its transitional period. However, Trump’s personal animosity toward Dr. Yunus complicates the potential for collaboration. Yunus’ longstanding ties to prominent Democratic figures, including Bill and Hillary Clinton, Alexander Soros, and President Joe Biden, have placed him at odds with Trump and influential Republicans. Yunus has been a vocal critic of Trump, describing his 2016 victory as a 'solar eclipse' that brought 'dark clouds' over the world. He said, 'Trump's win has hit us so hard that this morning I could hardly speak. I lost all strength. Should I even come here? Of course, I should, we must not allow this lapse into depression, we will overcome these dark clouds.'. These comments, coupled with allegations that Yunus contributed to anti-Trump efforts during the 2016 election, reportedly angered Trump. In the wake of Trump’s first victory, a Bangladeshi delegation visiting Washington was met with pointed remarks from Trump himself. Reportedly, Trump asked, 'Where is the micro-finance guy from Dhaka?' and followed with, 'I heard he donated to see me lose.' This animosity highlights personal grievances that could hinder productive U.S.-Bangladesh relations under Trump’s leadership. More recently, during the 2024 U.S. presidential campaign, Trump stoked controversy by condemning alleged violence against Hindus in Bangladesh in a Diwali message posted on X (formerly Twitter). Referring to these events as 'barbaric violence,' Trump claimed such incidents 'would have never happened' under his administration, aligning his critique with an anti-Democrat narrative and seeking to appeal to Hindu-American voters. Such statements add further strain to the already delicate relationship between the Trump administration and Bangladesh’s interim government. Strategic Dynamics in U.S.-Bangladesh Relations Geopolitical Imperatives Bangladesh’s strategic position in the Bay of Bengal and its integration into China’s Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) make it a critical player in South Asia. Under Trump 2.0, the U.S. is likely to intensify efforts to counter China’s influence, presenting Bangladesh with both risks and opportunities. On one hand, Washington may seek deeper economic and security cooperation with Dhaka; on the other, overdependence on the U.S. could strain Bangladesh’s ties with China, a key trade and infrastructure partner. Bangladesh must carefully navigate these dynamics. China remains a significant economic partner, but concerns over Beijing’s 'debt-trap diplomacy' loom large. Diversifying economic partnerships, particularly with the U.S., could help mitigate risks while fostering growth. However, Dhaka must also ensure it retains sovereignty and avoids entanglements that compromise its independence. Economic and Trade Considerations The U.S. is a vital market for Bangladeshi exports, particularly in textiles, which constitute a major share of the nation’s economy, contributing 11% to the country's GDP and accounting for over 80% of its total exports. However, Trump’s protectionist policies, including potential tariff increases, could disrupt this critical trade relationship. To mitigate such risks, Bangladesh should actively engage U.S. stakeholders to preserve favorable trade terms and explore new avenues for investment in technology, energy, and infrastructure. Policy Prescriptions for Bangladesh Bangladesh must prioritize strengthening its diplomatic engagement with the United States to reinforce bilateral relations. Direct dialogues with the Trump administration are crucial to emphasizing shared economic and strategic interests, while addressing any personal and political tensions, such as those between President Trump and Dr. Yunus. Dr. Yunus’s congratulatory message to Trump following his election victory has been regarded as a positive step, signaling an opportunity for fostering improved cooperation. This reflects the interim government's pragmatic approach to maintaining constructive relations with the U.S., a key player in global politics and trade. Simultaneously, the interim government must take decisive steps to counter allegations of minority persecution. Indian media’s dissemination of misinformation, which exploits the sensitive issue of minority rights, poses a significant challenge to the government’s legitimacy. To address this, the interim government should leverage both domestic and international platforms. Domestically, Bangladeshi media must play a proactive role in disseminating accurate information to build a counter-narrative. Internationally, the government must engage directly with U.S. policymakers, think tanks, and advocacy groups to prevent misrepresentation and ensure a balanced understanding of the ground realities in Bangladesh. This two-pronged strategy would help mitigate the negative impact of misinformation and strengthen the country’s image globally. In terms of regional and global engagement, Bangladesh should align itself with the U.S. vision for a free and open Indo-Pacific, emphasizing economic collaboration rather than military alliances. This would allow Bangladesh to benefit from increased trade and investment opportunities while avoiding actions that might alienate key partners like China. Additionally, Bangladesh must deepen its cooperation with multilateral organizations, such as the United Nations, the World Bank, and the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB). These platforms offer critical avenues for advancing development goals, securing climate finance, and promoting economic growth. By enhancing its contributions and visibility in these institutions, Bangladesh can diversify its partnerships and reduce its dependency on any single actor. The government should also prepare for potential shifts in U.S. foreign aid policies, particularly reductions in funding for climate change and humanitarian initiatives. In response, Bangladesh must proactively engage with alternative donors, including the European Union, Japan, and Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) states, to secure necessary resources. Leveraging Bangladesh’s vulnerability to climate change, the government should advocate for increased climate financing through mechanisms like the Green Climate Fund (GCF) and the Global Environment Facility (GEF), while also pursuing regional initiatives under BIMSTEC and SAARC to address shared challenges. Conclusion The convergence of Trump 2.0 and Bangladesh’s political transition presents a unique moment in U.S.-Bangladesh relations. While challenges abound, particularly due to personal and political tensions, there are also opportunities for mutual growth. By adopting a proactive, balanced, and strategic approach, Bangladesh can turn this period of uncertainty into a foundation for stronger bilateral cooperation and lasting stability. The path ahead requires diplomacy, pragmatism, and a clear-eyed understanding of the complexities of global politics under a renewed Trump administration.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWeFji24WXB7INfDWTQ2HAI0	2024-12-29T16:39:04-08:00	
Afghanistan: A Friendly Brother Country And The Target Of Airstri...	Afghanistan and Pakistan have long shared deep historical, cultural, and geographical ties. As neighboring countries, they have always recognized the significance of maintaining peaceful and cooperative relations, despite the challenges they both face. Pakistan has consistently expressed its desire to nurture friendly relations with Afghanistan, with the hope of fostering mutual understanding and addressing shared concerns. However, this relationship has at times been tested, especially in the context of transnational terrorism and regional security dynamics. In this light, recent military actions by Pakistan have sparked discussion, but it is critical to clarify that Pakistan’s airstrikes were not aimed at the Afghan people or their forces. Instead, the target of these operations was the Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) Khawarjis, a faction that has become a significant threat to both nations. Pakistan has always maintained that it wishes to cultivate a strong and friendly relationship with Afghanistan. Both countries share a long border and a complex history, one that has seen periods of cooperation and tension. Despite past political frictions, Pakistan has consistently sought peace and prosperity for Afghanistan. This commitment to peace was evident in various diplomatic overtures and support for Afghanistan's stability. Pakistan has provided humanitarian assistance, participated in regional dialogues, and offered economic cooperation to help Afghanistan address its socio-political challenges. However, Pakistan also has legitimate security concerns that must be addressed. The rise of terrorist groups along the border has been a persistent issue, with many of these groups operating with impunity in Afghanistan. Among these groups, the TTP has emerged as a particularly dangerous and disruptive force. It is a transnational group that seeks to destabilize both Pakistan and Afghanistan. Pakistan has repeatedly urged Afghanistan, under its Interim Afghan Government (IAG), to take decisive action against the TTP and other such militant factions. Unfortunately, the lack of effective measures to curb the activities of these terrorists has led to tensions between the two nations. The TTP Khawarjis, a militant faction, have long been a thorn in the side of Pakistan. This group is an offshoot of the Taliban, and its members are notorious for their brutal attacks on Pakistani civilians, security forces, and critical infrastructure. The term 'Khawarji' is used to describe individuals or factions that deviate from mainstream religious or ideological paths, often through violent means. The TTP Khawarjis have shown an utter disregard for human life, engaging in terror tactics, including suicide bombings, target killings, and cross-border attacks. These activities have instilled fear and disrupted the lives of ordinary Pakistanis, especially in areas bordering Afghanistan. The TTP's recent activities have escalated significantly, with the group claiming responsibility for numerous attacks on Pakistani security forces. In one such attack, 16 Pakistani soldiers were killed in a targeted assault. The TTP Khawarjis celebrated the 'shahadat' (martyrdom) of these soldiers as a victory, demonstrating their increasing boldness and resolve in their violent campaign against Pakistan. This tragic incident led Pakistan to take decisive action in self-defense, as the growing presence and activities of the TTP in border areas could no longer be ignored. Pakistan's decision to conduct airstrikes along its border areas was a direct response to the rising threat posed by the TTP Khawarjis. These airstrikes were not targeted at Afghan civilians or Afghan forces but were focused on eliminating key terrorist elements within the TTP. Pakistan’s primary objective was to curb the spread of terrorism and protect its citizens and security forces. The situation along the border had become untenable, as TTP militants had established safe havens in Afghanistan, from which they launched attacks on Pakistan. In response to these mounting threats, Pakistan’s military acted in self-defense, targeting the TTP Khawarjis who were actively involved in terrorist activities. The timing of the airstrikes was also significant, as they occurred in the wake of the TTP’s celebration of the martyrdom of Pakistani soldiers. This added an emotional layer to the conflict, as Pakistan viewed the killing of its soldiers as an affront to its sovereignty and a direct challenge to its security. The Pakistani government and military made it clear that these actions were not aimed at Afghanistan or its people but were necessary to protect Pakistan from the escalating terrorism emanating from the TTP Khawarjis. While Pakistan has made efforts to resolve its security issues through diplomatic channels, the reality on the ground has been far more complex. Pakistan has long called on the Afghan government to act against the TTP and other militant groups operating on Afghan soil. It is Pakistan’s belief that without addressing this core issue, peace and stability in the region cannot be achieved. Pakistan has expressed its hope that Afghanistan, under the leadership of the IAG, will reciprocate Pakistan’s goodwill and take concrete steps to dismantle terrorist networks within its borders. Pakistan’s actions should not be seen as an act of aggression, but as a necessary response to an existential threat posed by the TTP Khawarjis, whose actions have endangered the lives of people in both Afghanistan and Pakistan. Finally, it is crucial to understand that Pakistan’s airstrikes were not directed at the Afghan people or the Afghan government. The target of these military operations was the TTP Khawarjis, a terrorist group that has caused immense harm to Pakistan and continues to undermine regional security. Pakistan’s actions were a measure of self-defense in the face of increasing terrorist activities along its borders. Pakistan has always sought peaceful relations with Afghanistan and continues to urge the Afghan government to take decisive action against the TTP and other such groups. The stability of both nations hinges on cooperation in combating the forces of terror, and only through mutual understanding and action can both countries hope to build a peaceful and prosperous future.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWeFji24WXB7IJYgsT78IPbW	2024-12-29T16:36:22-08:00	
Addressing the Arakan Army: Bangladesh Should Focus On Myanmar’s ...	It is an irony of fate that the Myanmar Army, which was involved in expelling the Rohingyas to Bangladesh, is now counting their regime’s expulsion from the country itself as various rebel groups across Myanmar have united to counter the junta. In recent times, waves of autocratic overthrows have been seen in countries including Bangladesh and Syria, and now the question arises; could Myanmar follow suit? Meanwhile, the Arakan Army has gained significant momentum in Rakhine State, having ousted the junta from the state, except for its capital, Sittwe. Undoubtedly, the Arakan Army has become an undeniable force in Myanmar's new reality, since the rebel group now controls the 270-kilometer land border between Bangladesh and Myanmar. Consequently, Bangladesh cannot disregard the potential for correspondence and dialogue with the Arakan Army if needed. In Ukhia and Teknaf of Bangladesh, nearly 1.25 million Rohingyas are currently registered in 33 refugee camps. Over the past years, Bangladesh has been unable to repatriate even a single Rohingya to Myanmar. After the fall of Maungdaw, it has become a significant concern for Bangladesh whether the Arakan Army would facilitate Rohingya refugee repatriation or push even more refugees into their neighboring countries. This remains a matter of grave concern since the Arakan Army also holds notorious records for hostility toward Rohingya Muslim community. Next Move from Arakan Army Having a militia of 30 to 40 thousand troops and controlling almost the entire Rakhaine state, the Arakan Army has gained significant leverage in negotiations with potential partners. The AA has also arrested several Junta top Junta officials and is determined to drive the Junta forces out of the country’s capital. Having a coalition with other rebel groups like Chin National Army (CNA), they have formed a broader alliance with various Ethnic Armed Organizations (EAOs). Drawing parallels to the situation in Syria, where rebel coalitions have been successful to drive the former autocrat Bashar Al Assad out of the nation's capital, the rebels in Myanmar seek hope of doing the same. China undeniably is the most predominant actor here, playing significant role in this geopolitical scenario. Its economic, historical, and strategic influence provides the country with leverage over Myanmar than its regional and global counterparts like India and USA. As a result, the Arakan Army is expected to support Chinese-led initiatives, such as the deep-sea port project in Kyaukphyu, which will facilitate the passage of oil and gas to Kunming, China, rather than backing India's Kaladan project. For Bangladesh, the situation is crucial. The Arakan Army’s stance must be clear with friendly relations at its western border. The group now controls most of the trade between Rakhine and Bangladesh, creating uncertainties for future export-import of Bangladesh and Myanmar. Key imports from Myanmar to Bangladesh, including onions, garlic, ginger, fish, and dried fish would be disrupted if the Arakan Army does not play rational. On top of that, Bangladesh seeks restoration of navigation through the Naf River which is vital for the economy of its southernmost region. Bangladesh should take a proactive approach to establish some sort of communication with the Arakan Army to secure its territorial and economic interests as well as the Rohingya refugee crisis in the face of ongoing instability. Arakan Army's Credibility to International Actors There have been allegations of genocide and ethnic cleansing of Rohingya Muslim Communities in Myanmar's Rakhine state. In the past, the Myanmar Army as well as the Buddhist mob's campaign of murder, torture, arson, and mass rape has been found out. At present, the Arakan Army (AA) is now facing similar accusations, as they are still persecuting the Rohingya people and expelling them from their homelands. Sources say that the Arakan Army is deliberately burning the remaining Rohingya villages and wards in Maungdaw Township. 28 Rohingya organizations have also called out to the AA to uphold and respect Rohingya rights after its taking control over Maungdaw and Buthidaung. The Arakan Army has to ensure that the Rohingyas in Myanmar must find peace, and justice and can live in prosperity. Otherwise, the persecution of the Rohingya people by the Arakan Army will undermine the AA's credibility with international actors, complicating efforts to negotiate significant state matters. On December 19, 2024 representatives from six nations—Bangladesh, China, India, Laos, Thailand, and Myanmar—met in Bangkok to discuss the situation in Myanmar. The Myanmar Junta representatives were also present at the talks. However, it is more likely that future international forums regarding Myanmar may see representatives from the rebels, who now grab substantial power. In such cases, the Arakan Army and other Ethnic Armed Organizations (EAOs) must adopt a diplomatic approach, especially regarding dealing with minorities and safeguarding basic human rights. Failure to do so can lead to further hindrances to national power. The Arakan Army also should prioritize the safe repatriation of the Rohingya people to their homeland and ensure a secure and inclusive environment within its controlled territories. This is essential if they are to create a leadership that sincerely represents all communities under their jurisdiction. Foreign country role & communication with the Arakan Army The ongoing developments in Myanmar have drawn significant interest from global powers, each with its strategic objectives. Although China, the USA, India, and Bangladesh all play key roles in the conflict, China has an upper hand in the situation. China’s Interests in Myanmar China's involvement in Myanmar is driven by economic, geopolitical, and security interests. The Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), particularly through projects like the Kyaukphyu Deep Sea Port and the China-Myanmar Economic Corridor (CMEC), enhances China’s access to Indian Ocean bypassing Malacca Strait, giving China an advantage over India. China’s influence over Myanmar’s rebels also helps to counterbalance Western powers and maintain its dominance in its southern border. However, its relationships with both Myanmar’s military junta and ethnic armed groups are complicated, as both the belligerents in Myanmar are supported by Chinese authority. Bangladesh sees this as an opportunity to engage with Myanmar’s different stakeholders, as gaining Chinese support will lead Bangladesh to do so. Beijing’s influence in Myanmar is crucial, but Bangladesh must seek assistance from China, particularly to solve the Rohingya repatriation issue, as China holds significant sway over both the junta and the rebels. US and India’s Interests in Myanmar The United States, often supported Myanmar's rebels as well as pro-democracy factions, but struggled to counter China's dominance in the region. In contrast, India faces a grave concern with Arakan Army's control over Rakhaine. Critical projects like the Kaladan Multi-Modal Transit Transport Project (KMTTP), which links India with its Southeast part, can go to a halt because of Chinese reluctance. Bangladesh’s Position Alongside Bangladesh’s primary concern over Rohingya refugee repatriation, Bangladesh must be proactive in the decision-making and peace-building process amidst the recent developments in Rakhine. Traditionally, Bangladesh does not engage with any non-state insurgency groups, instead, it maintains ties with the government of the day. Moreover, the Myanmar rebels provide training and shelter to the Chittagong Hill Tracts (CHT) region-based insurgency groups. AA’s other actions, including attacks on Rohingya villages, complicate Bangladesh’s position. The Kuki-Chin National Front (KNF) which receives shelter, training, logistics, and other support from the Chin National Army (CNA) and other EAOs of Myanmar turned to grave concern for Bangladesh’s integrity. As a result, Bangladesh can not deny the stake of these entities. A feasible approach for Bangladesh is to maintain Track II diplomacy with the rebel groups, enabling the government to render its message regarding the potential repatriation of Rohingyas, as if the groups become a political force in the national government of Myanmar, should engage with Bangladesh. The Arakan Army’s controlling border and taking over most of Arakan is now a reality that demands some sort of communication with them. A communication with the AA could also safeguard the remaining Rohingyas who are allegedly facing persecution at the hands of the Arakan Army at present. Ending on an important note, Bangladesh must balance its engagement with Myanmar's military as well as ethnic groups, especially given China’s influence over both sides.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWeFji24WXB7ICiBJ-uV0kw1	2024-12-29T16:16:42-08:00	
Indonesia To Directly Export Durians To China – OpEd	Indonesian Coordinating Minister for Food Affairs, Zulkifli Hasan said the high demand for durian from China could reach US$8 billion (approximately Rp128 trillion). Thus, he said, the ministry is undertaking durian exports to China, a process that the government started a while ago, the Tempo magazine said. 'We have been in the process of exporting durian to China for a long while because of its significant value, amounting to $8 billion, if I’m not mistaken,' Tempo reported quoting Zulkifli as saying on Dec.18. 2024. In a similar vein, the Director General of National Export Development, Didi Sumedi, confirmed that durian is recording a booming demand in China. He then conveyed the good news to durian farmers. Meanwhile, Zukifli said Indonesia is currently only able to produce durian paste for exports. The products, commonly used for ice cream, have a complicated and lengthy manufacturing process and a lower selling price. Thus, the minister said, the government seeks to export the whole durian fruit in the near future, as well as exporting them directly to China without transit. Thus, the minister said, the government seeks to export the whole durian fruit in the near future, as well as exporting them directly to China without transit. 'We have a lot (of durian) from Central Sulawesi. To reach China, they must first be transported to Thailand. That’s another cut to our profit,' Tempo reported quoting Zulkifli as saying. He explained that based on the results of the Indonesian Quarantine Agency meeting, China will run a direct inspection of Indonesia’s durian commodity early next year. According to the South China Morning Post (SCMP) newspaper, China’s middle class consumers have been tightening their purse strings, but their appetite for durian – pungent, spiky fruit mostly imported from Southeast Asia – continues to grow. In Chinese cities, durians have transcended their status as a fruit to become a fashionable choice for young consumers. The catering sector has responded with 'everything can be + durian' promotions that have spawned a proliferation of durian-themed restaurants with offerings ranging from drinks and desserts to hotpots and buffets. According to the SCMP, the consumption of durians has been growing. For example, the imports of China in $1.2 billion has jumped to $6.2 billion in 2024 After Indonesian durians enter the Chinese markets, the market will grow further in Chinese cities and towns. On Douyin, the Chinese version of TikTok, topics such as 'durian barbecue' and 'durian buffet' have amassed more than 1.24 billion views. According to the VnExpress newspaper, based on results of the Indonesian Quarantine Agency meeting, China will run a direct inspection of Indonesia’s durian early next year. After the process is completed, the two countries can sign an MoU so that Indonesian durian can directly access the Chinese market, Zulkifli added. In Southeast Asia, Indonesia’s competitors will be Vietnam, Malaysia and Thailand. According to Dang Phuc Nguyen, general secretary of the Vietnam Fruit and Vegetable Association, Vietnam typically has an edge over Thailand around year-end when it has off-season durian to export to China unlike Thailand, whose harvest ends well before that. According to the VnExpress. Chinese demand also rises at that time as consumers ramp up purchases for the year-end holidays and the Lunar New Year. Vietnam enjoys transport advantages such as road and rail links with China, which helps its exporters save time and costs, he added. In a bid to boost its competitiveness, Thailand’s Digital Economy Promotion Agency recently rolled out a project called One Tambon, One Digital that aims enhance durian farmers' productivity, strengthen consumer trust in Thai durians, and promote high-value products on a global scale, particularly amid competition from China and nearby nations, the Bangkok Post newspaper reported. The initiative will help over 6,100 farming households adopt digital platforms to record cultivation data and train 12,200 farmers in 23 provinces in e-commerce and Good Agricultural Practices, which is required to export durian. The country has 163,200 hectares under durian, and grows 1.53 million tons of the fruit annually. Durian accounted for 69 percent of its fruit exports in 2023, with China being the primary export market. Vietnam shipped 500,000 tons of durian worth $2.3 billion that year, with 90 percent going to China. It has 154,000 ha under the fruit and an output of 1.2 million tons. According to the latest data, Vietnam exported $3.1 billion durians in 2024. It previously surpassed Thailand in durian exports to China earlier this year, shipping 32,750 tons in the first two months of 2024. Thailand’s exports in the same period plunged by half to 19,000 tons. According to the Vietnam Plus website, Vietnam’s efforts in expanding export markets for its fruits and vegetables in 2024 has paid off as for the first time, the export of these products has brought home US$7.2 billion, much higher than the figure of $3.3 billion two years ago.Vietnamese pomelos have officially entered the Republic of Korean, while passion fruits have made their way to Australia. Additionally, Vietnam and China signed protocols to facilitate Vietnamese fresh coconuts and frozen durians to enter the Chinese market. Particularly, Vietnam’s fruit and vegetable exports to China exceeded $4 billion this year. Vietnam is also poised to overtake Thailand as the leading exporter of durian to China within the next one to two years. This year saw Vietnam surpass Thailand’s durian exports during its off-season for the first time ever. Durian continues to lead fruit export value at approximately $1.7 billion in the first seven months of 2024, accounting for 41% of the total, according to the government's news portal.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWeFji24WXB7ILTlHaSdsw7b	2024-12-29T16:15:06-08:00	
The Politics Of Unreason – OpEd	The 'politics of unreason' refers to a phenomenon where rational discourse and evidence-based decision-making are replaced by emotional appeals, ideological dogmatism, and conspiracy-driven narratives. This dynamic, fueled by social and political polarization, undermines public trust in democratic institutions and replaces critical thinking with blind allegiance to charisma or ethnic affiliations. Historically exemplified by authoritarian regimes, such as those led by Adolf Hitler and Joseph Stalin, and more recently evident in populist movements worldwide, the politics of unreason thrives in environments marked by societal discontent, institutional mistrust, and the weaponization of misinformation. In Pakistan, the politics of unreason has increasingly come to define the rhetoric and strategies employed by political leaders like Imran Khan, reflecting broader global trends while exposing unique local vulnerabilities. At its core, the politics of unreason exploits human psychology. It taps into fears, anxieties, and desires for certainty in uncertain times. This strategy is evident in how authoritarian regimes have historically manipulated public perception. Hitler’s propaganda machine, for instance, used emotionally charged rhetoric to present Jews and other marginalized groups as scapegoats for Germany’s post-World War I woes. Similarly, Stalin’s purges and the accompanying rhetoric framed dissenters as 'enemies of the people,' erasing any space for rational debate or opposition. These historical examples highlight the central tenet of unreason: its ability to replace logical argumentation with emotional manipulation, turning complex socio-political issues into simplified, binary narratives. In modern democracies, the politics of unreason often manifests in populist rhetoric that pits 'the people' against an 'establishment' or 'elite.' European populist leaders like Viktor Orbán in Hungary and Marine Le Pen in France have utilized these tactics effectively. Orbán’s framing of liberal democratic values as existential threats to Hungarian identity exemplifies how the politics of unreason thrives on creating false dichotomies. Le Pen’s rhetoric, which often scapegoats immigrants as the root cause of France’s socio-economic challenges, similarly eschews nuance in favor of emotional appeal. These leaders exploit societal divisions, presenting themselves as defenders of national identity and sovereignty against external or internal 'threats.' In Pakistan, the politics of unreason has found fertile ground, particularly in the rhetoric of Imran Khan. Since his removal from office in April 2022, Khan has employed narratives that resonate deeply with a disillusioned populace. His claims of a foreign conspiracy orchestrating his ouster, asserted without definitive evidence, reflect the same unreasoned tactics used by leaders like Orbán and Le Pen. By framing his political struggle as a battle against corrupt elites and foreign interference, Khan has successfully cultivated a loyal base that views his narratives as unquestionable truths, regardless of empirical validation. The effectiveness of unreason in Pakistan is amplified by structural factors, including widespread distrust of traditional political institutions and the pervasive influence of social media. Platforms like Twitter and Facebook serve as echo chambers, where emotionally charged and polarizing content spreads rapidly. This digital environment facilitates the politics of unreason by amplifying unverified claims and suppressing dissenting voices. In Khan’s case, his adept use of social media has allowed him to bypass traditional media gatekeepers, directly reaching his supporters with simplified, emotionally resonant messages. This mirrors the propaganda techniques of historical regimes but adapted to the digital age. The politics of unreason also undermines democratic norms by eroding public trust in institutions. In Pakistan, this is evident in Khan’s repeated assertions that the establishment is manipulating the political system to prevent his return to power. Such rhetoric preconditions his supporters to reject any electoral outcome unfavorable to his party, Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI). This strategy echoes historical instances, such as Hitler’s use of the Reichstag fire to delegitimize political opponents and Stalin’s framing of purges as necessary for the survival of the Soviet Union. By delegitimizing institutions and processes, the politics of unreason not only deepens polarization but also creates a self-reinforcing cycle of mistrust and instability. The emotional appeal of unreason is further bolstered by its ability to simplify complex issues. For instance, Khan’s narrative of an all-powerful establishment colluding with foreign powers to undermine Pakistan’s sovereignty reduces intricate geopolitical and domestic challenges into a single, digestible storyline. This simplification is crucial to the politics of unreason, as it transforms multifaceted problems into battles of good versus evil, leaving little room for nuanced discourse or critical analysis. The result is a polarized political landscape where dialogue is replaced by cult following, and allegiance to leaders becomes more important than engagement with facts or policies. The global implications of the politics of unreason cannot be ignored. As countries like Hungary, France, and Pakistan grapple with its consequences, the erosion of democratic values becomes a shared concern. In Pakistan, the stakes are particularly high given the country’s fragile political system and history of military interventions. The normalization of unreason in political discourse risks further destabilizing democratic processes, with long-term consequences for governance and public trust. To counter the politics of unreason, a multifaceted approach is required. First, strengthening democratic institutions and ensuring their independence is crucial to restoring public confidence. Second, fostering media literacy and critical thinking skills can help citizens discern fact from propaganda, reducing the effectiveness of unreasoned narratives. Finally, political leaders and civil society must prioritize evidence-based discourse, rejecting the temptation to exploit societal divisions for short-term gains. To sum it up, the politics of unreason represents a profound challenge to democratic governance and social cohesion. By prioritizing emotional appeal and ideological loyalty over rational discourse, it undermines the very foundations of democracy. In Pakistan, as in many parts of the world, addressing this challenge requires a commitment to rebuilding trust in institutions and promoting a culture of reasoned debate. Without these efforts, the politics of unreason will continue to erode public trust, deepen polarization, and threaten the democratic fabric of societies.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWeFji24WXB7IHaW42jO4oa7	2024-12-29T16:11:51-08:00	
South Korea: Most Aboard Killed As Airliner Crashes, Burns Upon L...	By Taejun Kang At least 179 people were killed when a JejuAir flight arriving from Bangkok burst into flames after skidding off the runway as it was landing at an airport in South Korea on Sunday. Two flight attendants were the only survivors among the 181 people aboard the Boeing 737-800 operated by JejuAir, a South Korean budget airline, according to news reports. Most of the passengers and crew were South Korean nationals and there were two Thais aboard the plane that crashed at Muan International Airport in southwestern South Korea, Thailand’s embassy in Seoul said. According to the Associated Press, the plane’s front-landing gear apparently failed to deploy as the 737 touched down on the runway. The plane skidded off the runway and burst into flames after crashing into a concrete wall, AP reported. South Korean authorities said that a bird strike could have caused the front gear to fail to deploy as the passenger jet was landing amid adverse weather at around 9 a.m. Witnesses said they heard explosions and saw flames in an engine of the Jeju Air flight as it was trying to land, the Yonhap News Agency reported. Video footage broadcast by TV stations showed the 737 descending on the runway without deploying its front landing gear. It skidded across the ground, hit a concrete wall, and exploded in a fireball. 'The plane body was almost destroyed, and the dead are difficult to identify. It is taking time to identify the location of the remains and recover them,' the Jeollanam-do Fire Department said. The official death toll climbed through the day to 179, AP reported, as bodies were recovered from a smoldering crash site where some 1,500 rescue workers sifted through the wreckage. The two crew members who survived were pulled from the broken off rear section of the aircraft, BBCNews reported. They were in hospital. The dead included 85 women, 84 men and 10 whose genders could not be immediately determined, AP reported. Two Thai nationals who were among the dead, Thailand’s foreign ministry confirmed. A 'black box' flight data recorder had been recovered, the BBC reported. Jeju Air chief Kim E-bae made a public apology and extended condolences to the family members who lost their loved ones, promising to provide all necessary support to the victims’ families. 'Regardless of the cause, I take full responsibility,' Kim said. Choi Sang-mok, South Korea’s acting president, visited the crash site and told officials to make all-out efforts in their search, and he expressed deep condolences to the bereaved. He promised all possible government assistance. Choi has been serving as acting president since Friday, after the National Assembly voted to impeach Prime Minister Han Duck-soo, who was suspended less than two weeks after assuming the role from President Yoon Suk Yeol on Dec. 14. 'I believe no words of consolation will be enough,' Choi said. 'The government will spare no effort in supporting the bereaved families.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWeFji24WXB7IFnlmWYDW4kc	2024-12-29T16:06:04-08:00	
Afghanistan’s Exploitation Of Fragile Law And Order Situation In ...	The geopolitical dynamics between Pakistan and Afghanistan have historically been fraught with complexity, marked by moments of cooperation and conflict. Amidst these fluctuations, the ongoing situation in Kurram, a volatile region in Pakistan’s Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, underscores a delicate balance of law and order that Afghanistan is seemingly exploiting to undermine Pakistan's security and political stability. While Pakistan has consistently sought cordial relations with its neighboring country, the actions of the Afghan Interim Government (IAG) and the Taliban appear to be taking advantage of Kurram’s fragility, exacerbating the already tense security situation and threatening regional stability. The Kurram Agency, strategically located in the tribal areas along the Pakistan-Afghanistan border, has long been a site of insurgent activity. The region’s topography, coupled with cross-border militant movements, has made it a hotspot for instability. In recent months, however, the security situation has taken a disturbing turn, with the IAG’s increasing involvement in the region. The Afghan Taliban, in collaboration with elements of the Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), have escalated tensions through unprovoked cross-border attacks and firing incidents. These actions are not only a direct affront to Pakistan’s territorial integrity but also serve to destabilize the area at a time when Pakistan is already grappling with the challenges of maintaining law and order within its own borders. One of the most alarming aspects of this situation is the apparent disregard by Afghanistan’s Taliban government for Pakistan’s ongoing efforts to restore peace and stability in Kurram. As Pakistan continues to battle militancy within its borders, particularly in the tribal areas, it has been investing significant resources and manpower to curb the growing insurgency. The region’s already fragile state of security is exacerbated by the Afghan Taliban's actions, which appear to undermine these efforts. By allowing, or in some cases actively facilitating, cross-border militant incursions, Afghanistan is making a concerted effort to escalate tensions in a region that Pakistan is trying desperately to stabilize. The involvement of the TTP, a Pakistani militant group with significant presence in both Afghanistan and Pakistan, further complicates the situation. The TTP has long used Afghanistan as a safe haven, operating with impunity in areas controlled by the Taliban. The collaboration between the IAG and the TTP in launching attacks on Pakistani soil not only emboldens these insurgent elements but also perpetuates the cycle of violence that continues to destabilize the region. These acts of aggression come at a time when Pakistan is already facing immense pressure from both internal and external sources, including the threat of ISIS-Khorasan (ISIS-K) and the residual Al-Qaeda influence in the region. In the face of these mounting challenges, Pakistan has continued to extend goodwill towards Afghanistan, hoping for a cooperative relationship based on mutual interests. Historically, Pakistan has supported the Afghan Taliban, even hosting millions of Afghan refugees for decades, providing them with sanctuary during times of conflict. Despite these efforts, the response from Afghanistan’s Taliban government has been less than reciprocatory. Rather than recognizing Pakistan’s support and working towards stability, the IAG’s actions in Kurram reflect a level of ingratitude that is hard to overlook. The recent increase in cross-border violence and the Taliban’s tacit support for TTP militants is, in many ways, a betrayal of Pakistan’s longstanding assistance. This behavior by the Afghan Taliban, who have benefited from Pakistan’s support in the past, can be described as that of a 'Namak Haram'—an ungrateful betrayer who has repaid kindness with hostility. Pakistan’s support for the Afghan Taliban was instrumental in facilitating their rise to power, and in return, one might have expected a more collaborative approach in addressing mutual security concerns. Instead, Afghanistan’s actions suggest that the Taliban leadership is more focused on exploiting the instability within Pakistan’s borders rather than contributing to the collective peace and security of the region. The deteriorating relationship between Pakistan and Afghanistan is not just a matter of bilateral animosity; it has far-reaching consequences for regional security. The growing influence of insurgent groups in the region threatens not only Pakistan’s territorial integrity but also the broader stability of South Asia. The border areas, particularly in Kurram, have become increasingly porous, allowing militants and extremist groups to move freely across the boundary. This fluidity, combined with the lack of effective governance on both sides of the border, creates a perfect storm for the spread of militancy and extremism, which could have disastrous consequences for both countries. Furthermore, Afghanistan’s actions are also impacting Pakistan’s broader foreign policy objectives, particularly in its efforts to secure support from the international community in combating terrorism. The continued instability in Kurram and the region at large undermines Pakistan’s ability to present itself as a stable partner in counterterrorism efforts. This undermines Pakistan’s diplomatic standing on the global stage and complicates its relations with key international allies, including the United States and China, who have a vested interest in the region’s stability. Finally, Afghanistan’s exploitation of the fragile law and order situation in Kurram to destabilize Pakistan is a deeply troubling development that threatens to unravel years of efforts towards regional peace and security. While Pakistan has consistently sought to build a cooperative relationship with Afghanistan, the actions of the IAG and the Taliban leadership are a stark betrayal of that goodwill. Pakistan’s patience and support, particularly in hosting Afghan refugees, have been met with aggression and ingratitude, which risks deepening the rift between the two countries. As Afghanistan continues to undermine Pakistan’s stability, the path to peace in the region looks increasingly uncertain, with significant consequences for the broader geopolitical landscape of South Asia.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWeFji24WXB7INvZ7qDHkLeF	2024-12-29T16:02:42-08:00	
Way Out Of The Bangladesh Crisis – OpEd	During Sheikh Hasina’s long stint in power, an intense anti-India feeling had seeped into the Bangladeshi society over issues like; BSF firings along the Indo-Bangladesh border, her inability to ink the Teesta river water sharing pact with India, the Citizenship Amendment Act of 2019 which gave New Delhi the geopolitical leverage over vulnerable populations in India’s neighborhood, the higher prices for electricity supplied by Adani’s Godda power plant, Delhi’s unwavering support to her government despite its rising unpopularity and unchecked authoritarianism, and finally, India opening the sluice gates of the Dumboor Dam on the Gumti River without prior warning to the Bangladeshi authorities, which wrecked havoc in certain parts of eastern Bangladesh in August this year, proved to be the last straw that cracked the very foundation of bilateral relations, even when India showed that the floods were caused by unprecedented rains in the contiguous areas of India and eastern Bangladesh, only to be rebuffed by the leadership of the student’s movement. New Delhi may not have reached out energetically to contacts across the socio-political spectrum, which is why the conflict between the two countries is now taking an ominous turn, with reports of Indian security forces beefing up the border defenses, and Bangladesh deploying Turkish drones to keep vigil over its borders with Meghalaya and Tripura. The growing salience of Islamist parties will have detrimental effects on the policies of the interim government led by Muhammad Yunus, and that does not bode well for Indo-Bangladesh relations. Then there are advisers to Yunus who are rabidly anti-India. Lt. Gen. (retd) Jahangir Alam Chowdhury’s animosity towards India is well-known since his days as Director General of Bangladesh Rifles, and Mohammad Nashid Islam who is holding multiple portfolios, including I&B. However, a mature India must handle the fraying relationship with a smaller and suspicious neighbor with profound calmness, unperturbed by provocations in words and deeds; else there is a risk of alienating Bangladesh. Both countries must resist the temptations of playing communal politics for domestic political interests which often influence foreign policies, and vitiate neighborly ties. Bangladesh must not forget that it is surrounded by India on three sides, and Feni - a small coastal district located along the Dhaka-Chittagong transportation corridor - is bordered by India to the north and the Bay of Bengal to the south. The vulnerability of Feni puts Chittagong at a great risk, where Bangladesh has its primary sea port. Bangladesh is also heavily dependent on India for trade and river waters with both countries sharing 54 trans-boundary rivers. India too needs Dhaka’s co-operation to keep Pakistan at bay, while preventing the revival of Northeastern militancy, and countering Chinese designs in the Bay of Bengal. Only with a friendly Bangladesh can the Northeast take advantage of India’s SAGAR policy, for Bangladesh can serve as the region’s ‘maritime gateway’. Additionally, Bangladesh is vital for India’s connectivity with the Northeast in case of security-related contingencies in the strategic Siliguri Corridor. Bangladesh unrest has delayed execution of some vital Indian projects. The 1.9 km long ‘Maitri Setu’ or ‘Friendship Bridge’ over the Feni river built by India at a cost of Rs 133 crores, connecting Sabroom in southern Tripura with Ramgarh in Bangladesh, is ready for operation but cannot be utilized yet due to the unrest. The bridge would be the gateway for the NE region to various parts of the world through the Chittagong port, located just 72 kms from southern Tripura. Besides the ‘Maitri Setu,’ there are other Indian projects which have hit a snag in view of the burgeoning turmoil. The Bangladeshi garment industry has been hit severely due to the escalating tensions, while the medical tourism industry of Bengal and Tripura has suffered setbacks owing to India’s own reactions against anti-minority atrocities in the neighboring country. The business communities of both countries must press their respective governments to resume normal relations. Under their pressure, Indian and Bangladeshi authorities have been forced to keep open the largest land port between the two countries connecting Petrapole in India with Benepole in Bangladesh. The trading class in Bangladesh, dependent on India for various goods and services, must further push the Yunus government to immediately restore confidence among the minorities by reinforcing the safeguards enshrined in the Bangladeshi constitution for all its citizens. Initiatives to protect religious sites, prosecute perpetrators of communal violence, and transparently address minority grievances, are vital to maintaining communal amity. These measures are crucial not only to reassure minorities, but also to burnish the country’s credentials as a nation capable of managing its own internal affairs. Equally important is the role of the media in creating an atmosphere of mutual respect, tolerance, and understanding. Indians tend to see the ouster of Sheikh Hasina as a 'Pakistan-US' plot aimed at eroding Indian presence in Bangladesh, and curbing China’s growing footprint in the region. When Bangladesh eased visa rules for the Pakistanis, and established shipping trade between Chittagong and Karachi for the first time since 1971, and Mahfuz Alam – a student leader and Yunus’ advisor who has called for the inclusion of Assam, Bengal, and Tripura in Bangladesh – was feted by Yunus at the Clinton Global Initiative as the mastermind behind the July Movement, on the sidelines of the UNGA in September this year, India watched with utter dismay the rekindling of the 'US-Pak axis' against India. Knowing full well that Pakistani spymasters had never taken their feet off the pedal in Bangladesh, the US fell back on its Cold War ally to hold on to a country that it sees as a vital bridge to South and Southeast Asia. Veteran diplomats like Ajay Bisaria have opined that ‘India needs to encourage international pressure on Bangladesh.’ But ‘international pressure’ (read ‘pressure from the Western countries’) on the new regime in Dhaka is hardly forthcoming, since the US itself was behind the students movement which ousted Hasina, and installed the Yunus-led interim government. Now that India-China relations are back on track, it would not be an exaggeration to say that, both the countries which have an abiding interest in the stability of Bangladesh, could co-operate and pile pressure on the Yunus government for restoring normalcy in the country. Both India and China attach great importance to peace and security in Bangladesh for the unhindered execution of their infrastructure projects, and also for the legitimate utilization of their financial assistance to Dhaka. Of the country’s total external debt of $ 103.8 billion, Dhaka owes $ 6.1 billion to China, and over $ 1 billion to India. Beijing has enormous clout over Pakistan. Given the newfound bonhomie, India is now in a position to nudge Beijing to use its clout with the Pakistanis to cool things down in Bangladesh. During his recently concluded visit to Beijing, India’s Special Representative Ajit Doval may have already discussed Bangladesh with his Chinese counterpart, Wang Yi.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWeFji24WXB7IGBvg9t5Ng9W	2024-12-29T15:59:43-08:00	
Georgia’s New President Sworn In Amid Political Showdown	(EurActiv) -- Georgia inaugurated ruling party loyalist Mikhail Kavelashvili as president on Sunday (29 December) amid a political showdown, shortly after Tbilisi's outgoing pro-EU leader declared herself the only legitimate president. Salome Zurabishvili said in a speech outside the presidential palace, 'I remain the only legitimate president.' 'I will leave the presidential palace and stand with you, carrying with me the legitimacy, the flag, and your trust,' she added before mingling with thousands of gathered supporters. For the first time in Georgian history, Kavelashvili was sworn in at a closed-door ceremony in parliament. In a break from protocol, foreign ambassadors, who were reported to be planning to boycott the event, were not present. 'Our history clearly shows that, after countless struggles to defend our homeland and traditions, peace has always been one of the main goals and values for the Georgian people,' Kavelashvili said after taking the oath. Kavelashvili, known for his far-right views and derogatory comments about LGBTQ people, went on to praise 'our traditions, values, national identity, the sanctity of the family, and faith'. The inauguration of a former footballer and hardline critic of the West is set to escalate further a months-long political crisis that has seen the government freeze EU membership talks, followed by huge pro-EU demonstrations. Zurabishvili argues that Kavaleshvili was chosen by lawmakers who were elected in an October election marked by fraud. Meanwhile, the ruling Georgian Dream party maintain that Kavalashvili is the duly elected president. The party has also presented itself as the sole guarantor of peace in the country, accusing the West of trying to drag Tbilisi into the Ukraine conflict. Calls for election re-run The presidential standoff is a watershed moment in Georgia, a mountainous country of 3.7 million recently regarded as among the most democratic and pro-Western of the former Soviet states. Zurabishvili has become a last hope for pro-EU protesters, who accuse Georgian Dream of steering Tbilisi away from the West and back towards Moscow. She is backed by the country’s four main pro-EU opposition parties, which have boycotted parliament since the election. They say she will remain the legitimate president until fresh elections are held. On Sunday, she repeated that a re-run of the 'illegitimate' election would be the 'formula to resolve such a crisis'. However, Prime Minister Irakli Kobakhidze has said that new elections will not be called.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWeFji24WXB7IN2XSO3H3KkE	2024-12-29T15:57:03-08:00	
Sarawak After 61 Years In The Malaysian Federation: Where To Now?...	Abstract Sarawak was thrust into a federation, along with Malaya, Singapore, and Sabah (Noth Borneo) on September 16, 1963. Sixty-one years later, Sarawak finds itself still reconning with history, due to continued negotiation with Putra Jaya on the Malaysia Agreement (MA63), and a cultural and political void between itself and peninsula Malaya. There are now a number of contentious issues between Sarawak and Putra Jaya, plus a rebound in Sarawak nationalism which are shaping the region’s future directions. This article will look at these issues and canvas aspirations for further governmental autonomy and/or eventual independence from Malaysia. Part 1: The past makes the present On September 4, 1841, the land extending from Tanjung Datu to Samarahan River in north-west Borneo was ceded as a reward by Sultan Omar Ali Saifuddin of Brunei to James Brooke. Brooke became Rajah and governor for suppressing the rebels against the Sultan of Brunei. The expansion of Sarawak to today’s borders was secured in successive stages with the takeover of Brunei’s territories by the second Rajah Charles Brookes, taking in the districts of Lawas and Limbang by 1917. The land, known as Sarawak, recognized by the United States in 1850, and Great Britain in 1864, is bordered by Indonesian Kalimantan to the south, Brunei and Sabah to the east, with the shores of the South China Sea running along the north of the territory. In 1888, Great Britain and Sarawak signed a protectorate treaty. In 1867, a legislative council, formally called the Sarawak General Council was established by Rajah James Brooke in the small fishing village of Bintulu, with 5 British officers, 16 Malay and Melanau community leaders, and Rajah Brooke as the president.

The third Rajah Vyner Brooke in 1941 proclaimed the Sarawak Constitution, with Nine Cardinal Principles (1) to mark a century of Brooke rule. The aim was to prepare Sarawak for self-rule, where power from Rajah Brooke would be eventually be devolved to the people of Sarawak, as a secular, democratic, and pluralist state. After the Japanese occupation ended in 1945, the British had planned to consolidate all British colonies in the Malay-archipelago, into what was described as the Malayan Union. With Sarawak’s treasury practically empty after the war, Rajah Vyner Brooke was ‘convinced’ to cede the sovereignty of Sarawak to the British, even though there was already a long-standing protectorate agreement. Amid protests by representatives of the indigenous people, Sarawak, (2) became a crown colony on May 17, 1946. This wasn’t accepted very well by a number of native teachers and civil servants of Sarawak, who expressed their disappointment through organized protests against cession of Sarawak to the British. This cession of Sarawak was denounced, where the restoration of an independent state under Rajah Brooke was demanded. This led to mass resignations from the civil service in what is now called ‘338’ (the number of native civil servants who resigned). Civil unrest climaxed on December 3, 1949, where the and commander-in-chief Governor Sir Duncan Stewart was assassinated in Sibu. The two youths that were involved in Stewart’s assignation were convicted of murder and hanged along with two other conspirators, (3) who were believed to be members of a political group, aiming for union which the newly independent Indonesia (Thomson 2016). The United Nation’s stand against colonialism, and the need for the British to let go of its colonies in the ‘Far East’ by United Nations pressure, eventually led to the independence of Malaya on August 31, 1957, after lengthy negotiations with Tunku Abdul Rahman and group of multi-ethnic leaders. Similarly, negotiations by the British in Singapore, Sarawak, Brunei and North Borneo (no Sabah) continued. Moving forward to 1962, the Committee for Greater Malaysia or the Cobbold Commission of Inquiry was well aware of opposition to the formation of Malaysia by natives and some political parties, (4) although this was not made clear in the final report. The commission heavily supported the positions of the Malayan prime minister Tunku Abdul Rahman, and the chief minister of Singapore Lee Kwan Yew. There was great concern that the Borneo territories were not ready for self-government, and lacked respect for the rule of law. The members of the Cobbold Commission believed that ‘one man one vote’ in the Far East has not been a wild success, especially with unsophisticated peoples. Subsequently, no plebiscite in North Borneo or Sarawak was ever undertaken. The Commission made the conclusion that the entry of North Borneo and Sarawak into Malaysia would be in the territories’ best interests. The Commission report had the firm belief that those groups in North Borneo and Sarawak opposed to a merger would eventually dissipate (Cobbold Commission, 1962). The report ignored the strength of the anti-Malaysia campaign. The Sarawak United Peoples Party (SUPP) had a membership of 41,386 scattered across Sarawak, with a primary platform to create a sovereign independent nation. Many minority groups feared the domination of a Malaysia by the Malays. (5) The monarch of the nation Malaysia would never come from Sarawak, the national language Bahasa Malaysia, and Islam as the state religion ran all against the tenets of life for a great majority of Sarawakians. Any independence by merger into Malaysia would not be regarded as any fulfilment of the aspirations of the people for independence. It would merely be a transfer of political power from Great Britain to Malaysia, a continuation of colonialism. SUPP had concerns that any Malaysian military house more than 300 miles away across the South China Sea would not be adequate in protecting Sarawak. Sarawak could easily make alternative security arrangements with Great Britain (like Brunei later did). In addition, Sarawak had been economically sufficient on its own for hundreds of years, and didn’t need to be part of a greater Malaysia. Consequently, the Malaysia agreement was considered by SUPP to be detrimental to the interests of the peoples of Sarawak. Moreover, the pledge made by the Crown when Sarawak was ceded to Great Britain by Rajah Brooke, was for Britain to uphold the 1941 Sarawak Constitution and Nine Cardinal Points. SUPP submitted a memorandum to the Cobbold Commission in the form of a petition, signed by 114,000 Sarawakians. (6) This was supported by public meetings opposing the merger all over Sarawak, which was not reported in the Cobbold Commission Report. Tunku Abdul Rahman took the opportunity to paint SUPP as a communist influenced organization. In December 1962 after uprisings in Brunei, Sultan Omar Ali Saifuddin III, decreed that Brunei would not join the Federation of Malaysia. In Sarawak, British authorities, undertook a country-wide sweep, leading to the arrest and detention of 6,000 ‘subversives’ suspected of being against the formation of Malaysia. Around 1,500 youths fled across the border to Kalimantan, Indonesia to begin a guerilla war of liberation. On July 22, 1963, Sarawak’s first chief minister Stephen Kalong Ningkan, was sworn in by the Governor Sir Alexander Waddell. Five Assembly members were then sworn in as council members. This was self-government, but has been reframed as pseudo independence (The Borneo Post, 2015) by the former chief minister, the late Adenan Satem in 2016. The day has been officially gazetted as a holiday, which became known as ‘Sarawak Independence Day’ (Goh, 2016). Just before the formation of Malaysia, Indonesia and the Philippines requested that the support of the people of the Borneo territories be ascertained by an independent and impartial authority, through a referendum, by the United Nations. A nine person UN Mission travelled to Kuching in August 1963, and was met by demonstrations against the merger into Malaysia. The UN group saw signs of resistance to the merger all around Sarawak as they travelled. The UN team on September 2, reached the conclusion, based upon a ‘grassroot survey’ that the people of Sarawak were pro-Malaysia. (7) It found little evidence of articulate and organized opposition to the Federation, which quelled Indonesian and Philippine disquiet. The proclamation of Malaysia didn’t achieve the August 31 target to coincide with Malayan independence day, and the Federation of Malaysia came into being on September 16, 1963. According to a telegram dated August 21, 1963 Tunku Abdul Rahman caused resentment in both Jesselton (now Kota Kinabalu) and Kuching on the news that Sabah and Sarawak would only be states in the new Federation, alongside the other states in the peninsula. (8) Part 2: The Kuching-Putra Jaya relationship today After 61 years in the Malaysian Federation, Sarawak has contributed more to the nation’s revenue, through oil and gas, than it has received. While the peninsula is almost fully developed with a good road system, and modern infrastructure, Sarawak’s roads and infrastructure outside of major towns is very poor. In terms of absolute poverty, Sarawak ranks third in Malaysia, after Sabah at 19.5 percent, Kelantan at 12.4 percent, and Sarawak at 9 percent, on 2019 figures (Koh, 2023). To Sarawak’s benefit, the historical, demographic, language, and cultural differences with the peninsula have spared the territory the race tainted political and Islamic fervour, wrapped up in Malaysia nationalism or Ketuanan Melayu. Such politics is not practiced in Sarawak. Peninsula based political parties only hold two seats in the Sarawak State Assembly. Unlike Sabah, where migrants were assisted in a clandestine program, in what was dubbed 'Project IC' to assist on influencing elections, Sarawak with a population of 2,907,500 (at 2020) is largely unaffected by migration, except from Kalimantan, where the culture is similar. There is an estimated 138,027 foreign workers from Indonesia, Philippines, Myanmar, China, and India, under a controlled immigration program (Lumayang, 2020). Dr Johan Ariffin Samad, the former executive director of the Sabah based think tank Institute of Development Studies (IDS) said in a CNA interview that 'the two states (Sabah & Sarawak) have been relegated to the sidelines of the nation’s decision-making process' (Aqil and Bedi, 2024). Samad felt there was a blatant disregard of the Malaysia Agreement 1963 (MA63), the legal document that forms the basis of the formation of the Federation of Malaysia. Sarawak’s Parti Bumi Kanyalang (PBK) president Voon Lee Shun puts the above argument much stronger when he says 'Sabah and Sarawak and are in-fact ‘colonies’ of Malaya, and Malaya is in control of power – education, health, Government service, economy, social life, politics and Religion' (New Sarawak Tribune 2021). The major source of contention between Kuching and Putra Jaya has been the MA63. The MA63 guarantees autonomy for Sarawak, but there is disappointment by some professional and educated people, that this was not honoured by the Federal Government, over the last 61 years. The MA63, recognises Sabah and Sarawak as equal partners with Malaya in the formation of Malaysia, but Sabah and Sarawak have been treated as mere states. Article 1 (2) of the Malaysian Constitution still lists Sabah and Sarawak as states, alongside other states in the Peninsula. Negotiations on MA63 between Sabah, Sarawak and the Federal government are ongoing, where both Sabah and Sarawak want increased financial autonomy, with a 40 percent share of revenue collected, and a much larger number of seats in the current 222 member Dewan Rakyat or lower house. Currently, Sabah has 25 seats and Sarawak 31 seats. This is perhaps one of the very few issues Sabah and Sarawak are politically unified on the point of wanting Borneo to have 35 percent of the seats in the Dewan Rakyat. Other contentions with Putra Jaya concern control of the continental shelf of Sarawak. Currently, Sarawak has rights over a 3 (5.3km) nautical mile limit from the shores, where the Federal government controls the rights the exclusive economic zone (EEZ) reaching 200 nautical miles (371km) from shore. At stake are oil and gas reserves and future revenues. Sarawak possesses at least 800 million barrels of proven oil reserves, with recent discoveries extending this figure greatly. This accounts for more than 60 percent of Malaysia’s oil and gas reserves. Sarawak’s Premier Abang Johari Openg has given The Malaysia national oil and gas producer until October 1, 2024 to come to an agreement with Sarawak. At the time of writing, Petronas is seeking a court injunction to delay the deadline (Battersby 2024). Sarawak holds 90 percent of Petronas gas stocks, and the Sarawak state-owned Petroleum Sarawak Berhad (Petros) is now the sole gas aggregator, pushing Petronas out of buying and selling gas in Sarawak. Sarawak is relying upon a state law, the Oil and Gas Mining Ordinance 1958, which was passed before the formation of Malaysia in 1963. The Sarawak government is claiming this law is still in force. The federal government has left this issue to Petronas to settle. A change in the balance of power nexus In November 2022, the balance of power dramatically changed between Kuching and Putra Jaya after the last general election. With the general election resulting in a hung parliament, the first of its kind in Malaysian federal election history, the support of Sarawak’s Gabunan Parti Sarawak (GPS) coalition with 23 parliamentary seats was necessary to create a stable federal administration under prime minister Anwar Ibrahim. This forced Anwar, to make a number of concessions to the Borneo parties. For the first time in federal history, a deputy prime minister position was given to Fadillah Yusof, a member of Parti Pesaka Bumiputera Bersatu (PBB), a member of the GPS coalition. Ten out of 43 minister came from Borneo (8 from Sarawak), and 13 out of 35 deputy ministers (6 from Sarawak) came from Borneo. This gave the Borneo parties, particularly Sarawak an unprecedented position in the federal government in recognition of being the kingmaker in the formation of the Anwar government. Sarawak has not been slow to use its position to takeover powers and responsibilities at state level. With a perceptively weak prime minister, the current Sarawak state government has pushed back on a federal government directive to use Bahasa Malaysia in the civil service, and strongly stated that the Sarawak government would continue to utilise English as the official medium (FMT Reporters, 2024). Sarawak would also create its own school assessments (FMT Reporters (a) 2024), and is on-track to provide free higher education at Sarawak owned universities in 2026 (Tawie, 2024). In addition, Sarawak has taken over an airline MASwings to begin operations at the end of 2024 (Curran, 2024), finalising conditions for the takeover of Bintulu Port from the Federal Government (Tawie (a), 2024), and negotiating the purchase of Affin Bank (Bernama, 2024) to specifically serve the needs of Sarawak. Under Sarawak’s own immigration jurisdiction, the state has developed its own expatriate migration program, called Sarawak Malaysia My Second Home (MM2H) to compete with the Federal program to attract expatriate retirees (Ling, undated). Such initiatives would have not been possible under previous federal governments. Political analysts differ on their views about how far the Sarawak government can push the current Anwar administration, where one pundit believes the recent pledges of loyalty from six opposition Bersatu MPs to the government, would enable the Anwar administration to survive anymore pressure from Abang Johari’s government in Kuching (annon., 2024). Part 3: The way ahead for Sarawak Many consider the MA63 agreement the major stumbling block between Kuching and Putra Jaya. Lina Soo, President of the Sarawak People’s Aspiration Party (SPAP) describes the MA63 as 'a broken mirror, which cannot be patched up to serve its purpose of providing a good reflection', metaphorical of a broken-down relationship which can’t be healed or salvaged. (9) UMNO vice president Mohamad Hasan (Tok Mat) said a new Malaysia Agreement is the best approach to restore the rights and interests of Sabah and Sarawak (FMT, 2022). The Democratic Action Party mentor Lim Kit Siang went even further saying there should be a complete reappraisal of all federal-state relations, greater decentralization, and autonomy from Putra Jaya. (10) There have also been suggestions of Borneo having ‘veto power’ in some way or the other in the federal parliament (Sarawak Rose, 2024). Such a new agreement, according to Soo would be far sighted and potentially change the dynamics between Sarawak and Putra Jaya. A new agreement may solve much political instability. This could be an opportunity for a new Malaysia that not just Sarawakians hope for. (11) Sarawak’s future options There are three major options ahead for Sarawak; 1. No change, just stay the same The vote on constitutional amendments and changing the status of Sabah and Sarawak from Negri or state to Wilayah or region is more symbolic than any great substance. What is more important are the MA63 discussions now ongoing. However, the inertia for the status quo is now being challenged by the Sarawak state government itself. The moves it has been taking over the last couple of years indicate this. Increased pressure by PBB on peninsula based political parties like Parti Keadilan Rakyat (PKR) and the Democratic Action Party (DAP), which holds two state seats not to run in the coming Sarawak state election, due in 2026 is increasing. Issues that prevent Sarawak further developing economically are additional push factors against the inertia of just staying the same. A major structural problem is the domestic economy. The local economy lacks enough diversity to provide sufficient jobs for Sarawak’s youth. This forces Sarawakians to travel to the peninsula or Singapore in search of jobs, due to lack of industry, and well-rounded and growing agricultural and SME sectors. In addition, lack of agricultural development beyond corporate owned plantations brings food security issues to Sarawak (Rosni & Hunter, 2014, pp. 23-30). Sarawak lacks competitive merchant shipping to enable the state trade with the rest of the world. A National Cabotage (12) policy was introduced into Malaysia in the 1980s, mandating all ships plying Malaysian ports must be registered in Malaysia, where foreign vessels cannot off-load or on-load cargo except in Port Klang in the peninsula. The need to trans-ship goods greatly stifles the potential future economic growth, due to these increased costs. Exports and imports into and out of Sarawak are unnecessarily expensive, preventing both the development of a domestic private economic sector and international trade (Wong PPM, 2023, P. 39). 'No change, just staying the same' will depend on Sabah and Sarawak remaining as 'king makers' in federal politics. This will greatly depend upon whether the Malay vote remains split between Perikatan Nasional (PN) and Pakatan Harapan-UMNO in the next federal election due by 2027. 2. Secession-independence The nomenclature, secession or independence, depends upon one’s interpretation of history, something beyond this review. Much has been written about this subject. An independent Sarawak would remain just a romantic sentimental notion, unless the economics can be substantiated. Only a small number of urban middle-class and professionals inside of Sarawak strongly support the secession option, fuelled on by a vocal diaspora domiciled in cities like London, Melbourne, Sydney, and Adelaide. In addition, national defence must now be considered a major issue with the Chinese Coast Guard regularly in Sarawak’s waters (Bernama (a), 2024). Another factor would be the potential damage done to the Sarawak economy if a Trump presidency resulted in crippling tariffs on Malaysia for assisting Iran (Hunter 2024). Moves towards independence and leaving the Federation of Malaysia would revive the anguish of the Malayan elite in the loss of Singapore, when it left the federation in 1965. The Malay rulers would exercise a great say on this issue, and its uncertain what their views would be, thus taking any decision away any final decisions from the politicians. Any attempt of Sarawak to leave the Federation could lead to a violent road, which would be met with hyped up security surveillance, and suppression. The symbolic deployment of the Royal Malaysian Army 10th Rangers in Kuching attests to this, and is a constant reminder to Sarawakians. Any independence would presumably occur after an exercise of self-determination, ideally an independent referendum with international observers. However, even if this currently unimaginable scenario occurred, achieving a positive vote for secession from the federation, referred to as 'Sarexit', would not be straight forward for the reasons mentioned above. It would be doubtful Putra Jaya would recognise any positive result for leaving the federation. The elephant in the room Any secession from the Malaysian Federation would be purely futile if the same Melanau elite rule Sarawak. PBB with its coalition partners garnered 62.2 percent of the popular vote in the last state election. There are very close patriarchal political relationships across Sarawak through all levels of government and the judiciary. Many are the result of family and clan ties. Sarawak has its own version of Ketuanan Melayu or Malay nationalism, being redefined as 'Ketuanan Malanau', or Melanau dominance in government. This is evident in the Sarawak civil service. To some degree the Dayaks and Ibans and other minority groups are subservient to the Malanau and Brunei Malays. Thus, what is probably more important for Sarawak today is developing a more inclusive notion of politics, democracy and governance. Indigenous sovereignty of tribes in the deep inland areas of Sarawak is another major unreconciled issue. Ancestorial and tribal lands are continuing to be leased to ‘crony corporations’ with close connection to the Sarawak political elite. Historical injustices, discriminatory practices and a grossly inadequate share of state resources are issues to be overcome if there was ever to be any equitable independence. The focus on Putra Jaya as the oppressor takes attention away from which group is the real 'feudal lord in residence'. However, all is not black and white. GPS has been able to maintain the integrity of Sarawak much better than Sabah over the last 61 years. Sarawak is the only region in Malaysia not to have a state religion, and the only region to have pushed back on edicts from Putra Jaya. This has been at the cost of what ‘Marxists’ would call a lumpen bourgeoisie in Sarawak, made up of connected people who have accepted roles in government, serving the interests of the elite who put them there. This creates a system of privilege, patronage, nepotism, and exclusion, and an environment of exploitation. The question for political scientists in the future is which is best, an ethnically and politically concentrated government that is strong-minded about the mission, or an inclusive government that continually bickers over issues? These are ‘value judgement’ arguments. 3. Greater autonomy The relatively weak position of the prime minister Anwar Ibrahim towards Sabah and Sarawak today, due to his need to keep the federal coalition intact, has allowed Sarawak to gain greater autonomy over the last 18 months. However, autonomy itself is a wide continuum which in the extreme would mean Putra Jaya would be restricted to looking after defence and foreign policy, and the Sarawak government responsible for all other matters. This would imply an extremely complex revenue agreement, which would take a long time to negotiate and implement. Greater autonomy is the most likely pathway for Sarawak, where the current state government and many ‘activists’ see as a realistic alternative in the future – 'a state within a state' solution. This is an option that requires imagination, education, and negotiation on reaching a vision in both government and the people of Sarawak could share. However, this is where it becomes a naivety to think such collaboration could possibly occur. In addition, one of the collateral spillovers of Sarawak autonomy is that it will lead to a ‘chain reaction’, where more states would seek the same or similar degrees of autonomy. Sabah would be next, with Kelantan and Terengganu following suit. Johor and Penang would also have aspirations for more autonomy. This would completely redraw Malaysia’s current nexus of federal-state relations, which have been in the federal government’s favour for the last six decades. Attitudes of the Sarawak Government What is important is the attitude of the state government, which is controlled by GPS coalition, made up of three parties, Parti Pesaka Bumiputera Bersatu (PBB), Parti Rakyat Sarawak (PRS), and Sarawak United Peoples’ Party (SUPP). All three parties are Sarawak-centric, receiving 62.2 percent of the vote at the 2021 state election. A very senior figure within PBB told the author that seniors within the party believe Sarawak cannot go alone, and fundamentally must remain in Malaysia (mainly security and economic reasons), but with maximum autonomy and little interference in state affairs from Putra Jaya. (13) The prime disenchantment with Putra Jaya is over oil revenue issues, which appear to encourage official resurgences in calls for more autonomy from time to time. Counterintuitively, GPS abstained from voting on a constitutional amendment to restore Sabah and Sarawak as equal partners back in 2019 for domestic political considerations (Ling, S, 2019). Sarawakians still need more deployment of basic education that reaches deep into the interiors, so people can understand the issues involved in civics and community. The reinstatement of local elections would widen the scope of future discussion, and provide new leaders from diverse backgrounds. Democracy must be opened up at the grassroots and nurtured up the hierarchy of governance to give a real sense of what Sarawakian’s really think and how their destinies should be intertwined. There are those who feel that Sarawakians have been betrayed by many parties through history and they have been prevented from sovereignty, once guaranteed to them by Clause 7 of the Nine Cardinal Principles in the preamble of the 1941 Sarawak Constitution which read 'The people of Sarawak shall be entrusted in due course with the governance of themselves, and that continuous efforts shall be made to hasten the reaching of this goal by educating them into the obligations, the responsibilities and privileges of citizenship.' Then questions can be asked about what Sarawak should look like in the future. How should Sarawak be governed? Should Sarawak focus on development? If so, what type of development? Should Sarawak focus on maintaining cultural integrity? Should Sarawak open up to the world, or maintain a sense of isolation? These are all questions for the next generation.

Indonesia Prepares To Bring Ex-ISIS Families Home – Analysis	By Adlini Ilma Ghaisany Sjah Following a four-year moratorium on the repatriation of individuals affiliated with the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS), Indonesia is reportedly considering resuming the repatriation of its citizens from Syria’s Al-Hol and Roj camps. Approximately 529 Indonesians are believed to be living in the two camps, primarily women and children. In May 2024, the Indonesian National Counterterrorism Agency submitted a proposal to then president Joko Widodo for the repatriation of Indonesian ex-ISIS members from Syria. This follows years of preparation by the Foreign Terrorist Fighters taskforce — a unit of 15 government agencies — that was formed by the Coordinating Ministry of Political, Legal and Security Affairs in 2021 and rejuvenated in 2023. The repatriation proposal consists of three phases — before the border, at the border and after the border. The first phase involves identity and data verification of Indonesians in Syrian camps. Then at the border, returning Indonesians will be assessed for medical and psychological conditions, radicalisation and threat risk. After the border, individuals will be prosecuted for any charges related to their case and, in the absence of such charges, will be sent to a rehabilitation centre before reintegration into society. Repatriation will prioritise children, women and elderly men. Though this still leaves many ex-ISIS Indonesians in Syria, it is a significant improvement from the 2020 policy which restricted repatriation to orphans under 10 years old in Syria and arranged for them to return on an ad hoc basis. The exclusivity and informality of this policy resulted in the repatriation of only four children from Syrian camps between 2020 and 2023. Three factors make the case for repatriation more favourable now — a sympathetic political climate, Indonesia’s readiness to receive the returnees and long-term security considerations. Both the domestic and international political climates lend themselves to the establishment of a repatriation program. While former Indonesian president Joko Widodo was against repatriation, the newly-elected President Prabowo Subianto said that he supported the repatriation of ex-ISIS Indonesians as long as the returnees have their identities verified and are investigated to ensure they do not pose a significant security risk. Indonesia has made considerable progress in this regard — at least 375 Indonesians have been located and assessed as in need of repatriation in the two Syrian camps, among them 145 children. Internationally, Indonesia faces increasing pressure from the international community to rescue its citizens from the deplorable living conditions in the Al-Hol and Roj camps. The UN Independent International Commission of Inquiry on the Syrian Arab Republic reported in March 2024 that Indonesia is among 35 countries that have made no effort to repatriate children with foreign citizenship held in northeast Syria. In May 2024, the Indonesian National Counterterrorism Agency Inspector General of Police, Ibnu Suhendra, admitted that of all countries that had citizens travel to Syria to join ISIS, Indonesia is one of only three countries that have yet to repatriate their citizens, highlighting the urgency for action. Indonesia is much better equipped to handle returnees now compared to just a few years ago. The 2020 moratorium was implemented after Indonesia’s disastrous experience handling the first batch of returnees in 2017, which was unsurprising given there was no ‘systematic or planned reintegration process’. At the time of the first returnees’ arrival in 2017, the designated rehabilitation centre, Sentra Handayani, had no experience working with radicalised individuals as it was designed to be a shelter for juvenile offenders and child victims of violence. There was no mechanism to structure the rehabilitation process according to the unique needs of formerly radicalised children returning from conflict zones. Consequently, recidivism occurred, including the notorious case of Rullie Rian Zeke and Ulfah Handayani — a couple who had been briefly placed in Sentra Handayani before conducting a suicide bombing in the Philippines in January 2019. Indonesia’s deradicalisation and rehabilitation infrastructure has improved considerably since 2019. Sentra Handayani now has a standard operational procedure for handling ‘child victims of radicalism’. Stakeholders involved in the repatriation process, including civil society organisations, social workers, psychologists and government workers, have also undergone various capacity-building programs to better handle cases of violent extremism. Indonesia’s approach to preventing and countering violent extremism has also expanded. The newly implemented National Action Plan on Preventing and Countering Violent Extremism (RAN PE) empowers local governments to establish action plans for preventing extremism, increasing awareness and community resilience. This is especially beneficial for long-term monitoring when returnees are sent back to their hometowns across Indonesia. Importantly, RAN PE itself is a product of strengthened coordination between the government and civil society organisations with a Thematic Working Group which has actively involved civil society organisations in the formulation, advocacy and implementation of RAN PE. This collaboration allows stakeholders to leverage each other’s assets in preparation for handling returnees. It is also in Indonesia’s security interest to repatriate children from internment camps in Syria as soon as possible, else they become further radicalised and potentially recruited by militant groups. Many children currently stuck in Al-Hol and Al-Roj camps were either unaware that they were being brought to Syria and for what reason or have since become disillusioned with the promises of extremist groups and wish to return. According to field research by Julie Chernov-Hwang, a sense of both disillusionment and perceived costs outweighing the benefits of involvement with extremist groups is necessary for individuals to make the decision to disengage from terrorism. Access to an alternative social network is essential for successful disengagement from terrorism. It is imperative to bring individuals, especially children, back to Indonesia before they get recruited by terror networks. It is well-documented that ISIS grooms children to commit combat and suicide attacks in their name. In 2022, there were reports that Indonesian members of ISIS living in Al-Hol camp had smuggled children out of the campto join ISIS as new recruits. Without effective repatriation and rehabilitation policies, Indonesian children stuck in Syria risk becoming entrenched in terror networks like ISIS. Indonesians indoctrinated to subscribe to extremist ideologies and who possess advanced weapons training, could pose a significant threat to Indonesia, especially if ISIS or other militant groups resurge in the region, which is more likely following the collapse of the Ba’athist regime in Syria. The risks associated with repatriating ex-ISIS Indonesians cannot be eliminated entirely. But Indonesia has sufficient resources and has learnt from experience to better manage such risks.

Fall Of Syria Could Be Major Blow To Russia’s Strategy In Africa ...	After years of propping up Syrian despot Bashar al-Assad with a combination of military and mercenary might, Russia ultimately could not protect him from a rebel offensive that quickly toppled the government in December. While the downfall of Assad has worldwide geopolitical implications, it reverberated particularly strongly in Africa, where Russia is supporting military juntas and autocratic leaders. '[It] is a strategic political defeat for Moscow and has thrown the Kremlin into a crisis,' the Institute for the Study of War wrote on December 8. 'Russia’s inability or decision to not reinforce Assad’s regime as the Syrian opposition offensive made rapid gains throughout the country will also hurt Russia’s credibility as a reliable and effective security partner.' Long convoys choked Syria’s roads as Russian troops and military assets retreated to their two main posts — Khmeimim air base and Tartus naval base. Warships, cargo vessels, fighter jets and transport planes scrambled back to Russia to avoid the chaos, as it became apparent that Russian President Vladimir Putin had backed the losing side in Syria’s long, bloody civil war. 'This will be humiliating for the Kremlin and potentially damaging, too,' Sky News correspondent Ivor Bennett said in a report from Moscow. 'After doing so much to keep Assad in power over the past decade they’ve now lost a key strategic ally, which in turn could seriously harm Russia’s regional influence.' The two main bases served as crucial logistical hubs between Africa and Russia. Experts say it is unclear whether Syria’s new leaders will allow Russian forces to retain them. 'Without a reliable air bridge, Russia’s ability to project power in Africa collapses,' Anas el-Gomati, director of the Libya-based Sadeq Institute, told Bloomberg. 'Russia’s entire operational strategy in the Mediterranean and Africa is hanging by a thread.' The Khmeimim air base was a key stop for military and cargo planes refueling on their way to Africa. According to Rybar, a well-known Russian military blogging channel on Telegram, cargo planes can only reach Libya directly from Russia if they are empty. Rybar said the Kremlin will need 'alternative options,' including boosting its presence in Libya and Sudan. John Foreman, a former British defense attache in Moscow, said that the loss of Russia’s bases in Syria would make it much more difficult to support the estimated 20,000 mercenaries based primarily in Burkina Faso, the Central African Republic, Libya, Mali and Niger. 'Their likely loss is a significant strategic setback for Russia on its southern flank,' he told British newspaper The Telegraph. 'Russia lacks permanent bases generally, so both are important, and both had significant investment over the past seven years.' With Assad now in exile in Moscow, many of Russia’s most important investments in the Middle East and Africa are in jeopardy. But the reputational damage could carry the most weight on the continent. When Assad fled his home just hours before Damascus was overrun on December 8, he and his family were the sole beneficiaries of the same 'regime survival package' that Russia touts to military junta rulers in Africa. Experts say Russia’s failure likely will stick in the minds of its partners in Sub-Saharan Africa. 'The ruling authorities in Mali, the Central African Republic and in other countries that depend on Russian security forces may begin to question whether Moscow has the capacity — or the will — to come to their aid in times of crisis,' Federico Manfredi Firmian, an associate research fellow at the Italian Institute for International Political Studies, told The Africa Report. 'The Kremlin’s preoccupation with Ukraine has already limited its ability to act elsewhere. Losing Syria further amplifies doubts about Russia’s ability to deliver on its promises, signaling to current and prospective partners that they might need to look elsewhere for support.'	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWcJ2GkwDpXjHRn6CWnESyXZ	2024-12-28T16:44:16-08:00	
Seoul’s New Political Saga Won’t Affect Its Resilience And Appeal...	A majority in South Korea's parliament has voted to impeach acting President Han Duck-soo. Finance Minister Choi Sang-mok is next in line to assume the acting presidency, according to South Korean law.South Korea is seeing a change of the presidency three times in less than a month, as the ongoing political turmoil in the Asia's fourth-largest economy threatened to plunge the region further into economic and political uncertainties. The opposition Democratic Party (DP) that controlled the parliament decided to impeach Han after it deemed him to be yet another Suk-Yeoul's puppet for failing to appoint three justices to fill vacancies that the DP backs at the constitutional court. At least six judges on the constitutional court must uphold Suk Yeoul's impeachment to remove him from office. This new turmoil brings historical learnings and perspectives into South Korea's colourful past. Decades ago, iron-fisted leaders seized power and maintained it through force, but the country has since transitioned into a matured and stable democracy, where into a stable, but sometimes raucous, democracy. Since the democratic embrace in 1987, a new social transformation is seen through the lenses of capitalism and democratic overtures. Most citizens now are determined to not go back to such times, where martial law evokes painful memories of past abuses. Suk Yeol has defended his martial law declaration as legal and aimed at tackling 'anti-state forces', but he is already deeply unpopular before declaring martial law with a sagging economy and constant wariness surrounding his competency and his wife's Dior bag controversy and , he now faces a huge challenge in ever winning the confidence of an angry public. Polling data released by Gallup Korea showed that Suk-Yeol's approval rating fell to 16% this week after he declared martial law, with 75% of respondents saying he is doing a poor job as president. Suk-Yeol came into power by the slimmest margins in March 2022 as a hardline conservative, remaining a divisive victory that set the tone for now. He tapped into cohorts and segments of disenfranchised young men, who were dissatisfied with the policy of the previous administration under the banner of gender equality that they argued were giving women a free pass. Suk-Yeol's approval rating has steadily fallen since he came to power, with voters pointing out the lack of communication and worsening economic issues as well as controversy surrounding the first lady. Suk Yeol has since been at a tug of war with the parliament and struggled to implement his agenda amidst the opposition-controlled parliament. Most recently, he was forced into accepting a watered down budget, where the opposition slashed around 4.1 trillion won ($4.4 billion) from the government's proposed 677 trillion won budget plan. The reserve fund was cut, along with activity budgets for the prosecution, police and the state audit agency, and most significantly, the president's office. The Democratic Party also voted to impeach several of the country's top prosecutors including the head of the audit agency for failing to investigate the first lady. In declaring martial law, he justified his decision by citing North Korean threats and believes the opposition is too soft on Pyongyang. Under his watch, relations between the neighbours have further plunged, where Pyongyang has been firing ballistic missiles, and has been upping the psychological warfare by sending rubbish-filled balloons across the border, playing loud disturbing noises towards border villages, and has also charting new frontiers by sending troops to help Russia's invasion of Ukraine. By using the increased threats from Pyongyang and in accusing the opposition of sympathising with North Korea and paralysing the government with anti-state activities, the decision to impose the short lived martial law proved to backfire not only on Suk Yeol, but also in dragging the People Power Party further into a spiralling chaos of increased public discontent, distrust and plunging level of confidence in the government. This fuels a lose-lose situation for South Korea, as both the disjointed and fragmented political system and a fed up public on the power play by the political elites, all of which would create a new opening for Pyongyang to have a greater leverage and chips in winning the mind game and capitalising on its long held propaganda of denouncing its southern neighbour's capitalist and messy democratic system. However, not all is rosy for Pyongyang as it faces a renewed wave of optimism and openness from the masses of South Korea, as reflected in the recent poll where more are increasingly open to the country going nuke as the ultimate fallback option of deterrence, facing new wariness of the level of support in the future from the West. The South Korean public has embraced a new opening of possibilities as opposed to previous conventional perspectives, on how best to defend the country and relying less on the goodwill of external support. It remains to be seen how much this new political turmoil and the toying of the idea of embracing nuclear will go down in the halls of the policymaking arena in Washington and Tokyo and with the future prospects of the Camp David Pact among the three powers. The incoming Trump administration and the underlying uncertainties on the pledge of support also fuel the new wave of independent defence support on its own for Seoul. In a similar security setting with Japan, South Korea is facing one of its most significant security fears and vulnerabilities in decades, and with renewed Pyongyang threat, it continues to seek and outward expansion of defence and security friendhsoring, beyond traditional reliance on the US and Japan as the main security assurance and partner. Even with existing security mechanisms including the Camp David pact and renewed positive ties with Japan especially in the realm of defence and security, Seoul is feeling the concerns and wariness especially with the new uncertainties of America's commitment and the consistent new fearmongering by Pyongyang. Seoul is trying to increase greater extended deterrence efforts and fallback capacity beyond East Asia alone, and while toying with the idea of supporting Ukraine militarily, he still sees Southeast Asia as critical in a three pronged factor. First, as a vital economic, trade and natural resources support point for Seoul which will be vital in providing it with the needed food, energy and supply chain security which is needed especially during times of conflicts Second, the region is also growing as a source of military and defense export factors for South Korea, and the region also is facing renewed threats and instability with the growing thirst and demands for military deterrence and assets. Third, South Korea is seeing this region as a potential support system in its dealings with threats from Pyongyang, and as also another front providing a distraction and diversion for China in the potential conflict in South China Sea, which will reduce the severity and scale of any potential implications of a direct conflict with China or spin off impact of conflicts between China and the US or with Taiwan. With the ongoing political dilemma choking Seoul's highest power arena, the trust and support from neighbouring powers especially Japan and the new friendshoring efforts in Southeast Asia and beyond will be crucial, where the ultimate decision-making by the Trump administration will certainly alter the power game in East Asia. Beyond the transactional and quid pro quo approaches that are deemed by many as further incentivising Pyongyang and Beijing in their power quests, Trump might just be the much needed game changer in getting the conventional allies to spend more on their own defence but just being moulded and nurtured enough to lessen the burden of Washington without creating a new abyss of an all-out nuclear sabre rattling. Camp Humphreys in Pyeongtaek remains the ultimate symbol of the solid Washington presence and deterrence, and is the largest U.S. overseas military base. Strategic ambiguity remains in play, with a new sense of strategic clarity and a touch of expected and controlled containment policy against any threats of instabilities. The political saga of South Korea will soon pass, and the essence of the core tenets of the resilience of the people and the security and stability of the country and the region will endure.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWcJ2GkwDpXjHY1Zni5pjlPY	2024-12-28T16:41:25-08:00	
10 Times Faster Than A Bullet: Mastering Of Orbital Alignment Dyn...	India is gearing up for an important step in its space journey. On December 30 this year, ISRO will launch the Space Docking Experiment (SpaDEx) using the PSLV-C60 rocket. The launch is scheduled from Sriharikota for 9:58 PM (IST). This mission is a significant milestone, as it will demonstrate India’s ability to dock two spacecraft in orbit, a key technology for future space missions. Docking is the process of connecting two satellites in space after carefully aligning them. This technology is essential for future missions that ISRO plans to undertake—such as Chandrayaan-4 and building India’s own space station, the Bharatiya Antariksh Station. Mission Overview and Goals In the SpaDEx mission, two satellites—SDX01 (called Chaser) and SDX02 (called Target)—will perform a series of important tasks. First, they will align themselves in the same orbit and then, gradually, move closer to each other. Once close enough, they will connect, share electrical power and then separate again. After separating, the payload on both satellites will continue to operate for the next two years. A payload is the main equipment, or set of instruments, on a satellite or spacecraft that performs the mission’s purpose, such as cameras, sensors, or communication devices used for research or specific tasks. India’s reliable Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle (PSLV-C60) will carry the SDX01 and the SDX02, each weighing 220 kilograms. These satellites will be placed in a 470-kilometre low-Earth (circular) orbit (LEO). After being placed in the targeted orbit, the rocket will give the two satellites a slight difference in speed. This difference will cause the satellites to gradually move apart, creating a distance of about 10 to 20 kilometres between them within a day. The propulsion system on the Target satellite will be used to stop the two satellites from moving farther away from each other. This means both satellites will keep moving at the same speed while staying 20 kilometres apart. This phase is called the ‘far rendezvous’. Rendezvous means two objects meeting—or coming close together—in space, often after starting from different positions or paths. Coming to speed, the two satellites will be traveling at an incredible 28,800 kilometres per hour—about 36 times faster than a commercial airplane or 10 times faster than a bullet. To safely dock, the Chaser satellite will slowly approach the Target satellite, step by step, carefully reducing the distance between them. The approach will follow a sequence, closing in gradually from 5 kilometres to 1.5 kilometres, then to 500 metres, 225 metres, 15 metres, 3 metres—finally docking. Using special thrusters and advanced sensors, their relative speed will also be reduced to almost zero—around 0.036 kilometres per hour, or just 10 millimeters per second—ensuring a smooth and safe connection. After the satellites connect, they will test transfering electrical power between them. They will also show how both satellites can be controlled as a single unit. Once these tests are complete, the satellites will separate and begin working on their individual tasks using their onboard equipment. The Chaser satellite is equipped with a high-resolution camera, which is like a smaller version of a surveillance camera. The Target satellite has a multi-spectral device to monitor natural resources and natural vegetation. It also has a radiation monitor to study space radiation and collect data for future use. Since the satellites are small and lightweight, docking them is more difficult. It needs much greater precision compared to docking larger spacecraft because even tiny mistakes can have a bigger impact. Mission Wants to Achieve… This mission, happening at year-end, will achieve many things for the first time. The satellites will use advanced new technologies, including a special docking system and a set of sensors that help them move closer carefully and connect without colliding. They will also use a unique navigation system that calculates their positions and movements in orbit with high accuracy, ensuring everything works smoothly. So far, only Russia, the US and China have successfully developed this advanced technology and none of them shares the detailed process behind it. Apart from the docking experiment, the PSLV-C60 rocket will also carry 24 small payloads on its fourth stage, known as PSLV Orbital Experimental Module-4 (POEM-4). These will be activated after the two main satellites are released into space. Of the 24 payloads, 14 are developed by ISRO’s own teams. The remaining 10 come from non-government organizations, including universities and start-ups. Karnataka’s Role in SpaDEx: Blend of Academia/Startups The SpaDEx mission highlights Karnataka’s significant contributions to space technology, with three of the 10 non-government payloads provisioned from the state. These payloads, developed by academic institutions and start-ups, showcase innovation and a commitment to advancing space exploration. RVSat-1: Created by students and researchers at RV College of Engineering, Bengaluru, this experiment studies how a gut bacterium—Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron—grows in space. Understanding this can help improve astronaut health, developing better antibiotics and creating recycling systems for future long-duration space missions. BGS ARPIT: Designed by SJC Institute of Technology, Chickballapur, this payload works as a transmitter that sends messages, including audio, text and images, from the satellite to Earth using FM signals and the VHF band. This technology supports amateur radio services across the globe. SJC Institute of Technology is a renowned engineering college established in 1986. Located near Bengaluru, it is managed by the Sri Adichunchanagiri Shikshana Trust (R.), which operates under the blessings of Jagadguru Sri Sri Sri Dr Balagangadharanatha Maha Swamiji and the guidance of Jagadguru Sri Sri Sri Dr Nirmalanandanatha Maha Swamiji. RUDRA 1.0 HPGP Payload: Developed by Bellatrix Aerospace Pvt. Ltd, Bengaluru, this payload demonstrates a cutting-edge green propulsion system that is both efficient and environment-friendly. Contributions from these Karnataka-based institutions and start-ups underscore the state’s growing prominence in India’s space exploration efforts. The combination of academic research and entrepreneurial innovation is helping push the boundaries of what is possible in space technology.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWcJ2GkwDpXjHSwiZdXWxRkh	2024-12-28T16:32:54-08:00	
Abolition And Libertarian Principles – OpEd	By Wanjiru Njoya In 'Abolition: An Acid Test,' Murray Rothbard criticized libertarians who defended slavery as part of their defense of property rights. Those libertarians had argued that slaves were classified as property and, therefore, abolishing slavery would be tantamount to expropriation of the slaveowners’ property. This was indeed one of the arguments put forward by slaveowners who claimed compensation from the British government when the British Empire abolished slavery. Similarly, in the Amistad case, the owners of a Spanish slave ship argued that black people seized from their ship by US authorities were slaves and, therefore, their property. The US Supreme Court ruled that these black people were free, as they had been 'illegally kidnapped from Africa,' and, therefore, were not slaves and could not be held on that basis. But US President Martin Van Buren had previously 'stood ready to hand the blacks over to Spanish authorities,' partly 'due to 'diplomatic considerations.' If the people seized had been legally proved to be slaves, the property rights argument for their return to the owner would have been accorded more weight. As Rothbard points out, the view that slavery can be defended by reference to theories of property rights lacks any moral foundation. Property rights emanate from self-ownership, so any attempt by one man to 'own' another is itself a violation of the most basic principle of property rights. Rothbard explains: For these libertarians indeed go to the grotesque length of upholding property rights at the expense of the human right of self-ownership of every person. Not only that: by taking this fetishistic position these pro-slavery libertarians negate the very concept, the very basis, of property right itself. For where does property right come from? It can only come from one basic and ultimate source—and that is not the pronouncement of the State that Mr. A belongs to Mr. B. That source is the property right of every man in his own body, his right of self-ownership. From this right of self-ownership is derived his right to whatever previously unowned and unused resources a man can find and transform by the use of his labor energy. But if every man has a property right in his own person, this immediately negates any grotesquely proclaimed 'property right' in other people. However, Rothbard’s robust defense of the moral and ethical foundations of property rights does not resolve all the complexities that arise in relation to the abolitionist arguments. Two further questions arise that merit deeper reflection. First, whether it is justified to wage war on those who violate property rights, or indeed those who violate the human rights of others. Second, whether land worked on by slaves becomes the property of the slaves or the slaves’ heirs in title. Declaring legal rights to exist is only half the task: working out the appropriate response or remedy when rights are violated is quite another. Some Practical Problems Slavery is a violation of the principle of self-ownership and, therefore, militant abolitionists in the nineteenth century thought the appropriate response would be to wage war against slaveowners. Presumably this would entail waging war against any slaveowner whether that might be in Mississippi, Kentucky, Delaware or New Jersey—all of which were states with slavery. To be consistent with their principles, militant abolitionists would have had to wage war against slaveowners wherever they might be found. In War Letters, Andrew Carroll includes a letter from one such abolitionist, who argued that war is justified in the cause of abolition. In the letter writer’s view, slavery causes the death of slaves and, therefore, launching a war against slaveowners is not an act of aggression, but an act of 'defense' for which he proclaimed himself willing to lay down his life. In his article 'The Anti-War Abolitionists,' Sheldon Richman observes that some abolitionists favored military solutions to eradicate slavery. They 'favored violent slave uprisings, if necessary, and praised John Brown’s methods of terror.' The problem with this worldview should be obvious. If domestic terrorism and waging war on slaveowners is 'defense,' would it follow that waging war on anyone around the world who is violating human rights is also a justified war of 'defense'? That this could be a template for open and endless war was one of the concerns of the anti-war abolitionists. Richman observes that the Northern 'Copperheads,' who were against any violent resolution to the question of slavery, were supported in their anti-war stance by some abolitionists who were against any war between the free states and the cotton states. Richman explains that: The Copperheads, however, were not the only opponents of the War and its militarization of American society. Other groups and individuals coupled a disgust for state warfare with abolitionist passion. In general, while wishing to see the horror of chattel slavery ended at once, they recognized that state warfare, total or limited, would bring horrors of its own. They were confident that abolitionist ends could be attained by other than military means. Indeed, some abolitionists thought the peaceful breakup of the United States was the best solution to the slavery question. Richman adds that: 'In 1844, at the urging of the great abolitionist leader William Lloyd Garrison and others, the American Anti-Slavery Society passed a resolution calling for dissolution of the United States,' their aim being that by letting the South go 'slavery ceases to pollute our soil.' Richman also cites the journalist Horace Greeley, who wrote that, If the cotton states shall decide that they can do better out of the Union than in it, we insist on letting them go in peace… We hope never to live in a republic whereof one section is pinned to the residue by bayonets. Abraham Lincoln was, however, not prepared to let the cotton states, with their lucrative tariffs, go in peace. He repeatedly expressed that he had no particular commitment for or against the abolition of slavery. His priority was to keep the Union together by peace or by war if necessary. A further question that arises is what is to be done after emancipation of slaves. Slavery being a crime against property rights, the question of punishment and retribution must be faced. Rothbard thought that general principles of homesteading would apply. He argued that, 'On the libertarian homesteading principle, the plantations [in the South] should have reverted to the ownership of the slaves, those who were forced to work them, and not have remained in the hands of their criminal masters.' In this context, Rothbard uses the term 'criminal' to mean violation of the right to self-ownership, as he argues in the Ethics of Liberty that any violation of property rights is a crime in libertarian law. He expounds on the question of compensation for slavery in the Ethics of Liberty: A vital part of such necessary compensation would have been to grant the plantation lands not to the slavemaster, who scarcely had valid title to any property, but to the slaves themselves, whose labor, on our 'homesteading' principle, was mixed with the soil to develop the plantations. In short, at the very least, elementary libertarian justice required not only the immediate freeing of the slaves, but also the immediate turning over to the slaves, again without compensation to the masters, of the plantation lands on which they had worked and sweated. However, this statement of libertarian justice does not comprehensively address all aspects of the Lockean homesteading principle. Lockean homesteading does not simply state that anyone who works on a resource becomes its owner. It is, rather, a theory of first acquisition or just acquisition of title. Indeed, in his critique of the pro-slavery libertarians, Rothbard explains that self-ownership gives rise to the 'right to whatever previously unowned and unused resources a man can find and transform by the use of his labor energy.' It would be wrong to suppose that all plantations on which slaves worked were previously 'unowned and unused,' as seems to be presumed by Rothbard’s phrase 'reverted to the ownership of the slaves.' If libertarian principles required that forced or unpaid labor should automatically vest ownership of the land in the laborer, all cases of uncompensated labor would automatically vest title to the property in the laborer. For example, workers who—for whatever reason—are not paid for their labor would be entitled to claim ownership of the resource on which they had labored. There are analogous situations in the English common law, under principles of equity, where expending time and effort on a farm or a business, under a legitimate expectation of acquiring an ownership interest in it (based, for example, on principles of detrimental reliance) may be deemed, in some circumstances, to give rise to equitable interest or 'true ownership' despite not holding the legal title. However, as a detailed analysis of acquisition of title shows, this is a heavily fact-dependent outcome and cannot be taken as an assertion that all property belongs to those who labor on it. The same is true of libertarian principles, where justice depends not simply on the exposition of theories but also on the pertinent facts of the case.

Murdering Eagles To Save The Climate? Wyoming’s Wind Energy Boom ...	By Joshua Frank Like many roads that cut through Wyoming, the highway into the town of Rawlins is a long, winding one surrounded by rolling hills, barbed wire fences and cattle ranches. I’d traveled this stretch of Wyoming many times. Once during a dangerous blizzard, another time during a car-rattling thunderstorm, the rain so heavy my windshield wipers couldn’t keep pace with the deluge. The weather might be wild and unpredictable in Wyoming’s outback, but the people are friendly and welcoming as long as you don’t talk politics or mention that you live in a place like California. One late summer afternoon on a trip at the height of the Covid pandemic, I stopped off in Rawlins for lunch. There wasn’t a mask in sight, never mind any attempt at social distancing. Two men sat in a booth right behind me, one in a dark suit and the other in overalls, who struck me as a bit of an odd couple. Across from them were an older gentleman and his wife, clearly Rawlins locals. They wondered what those two were up to. 'Are you guys here to work on that massive wind farm?' asked the husband, who clearly had spent decades in the sun. He directed his question to the clean-cut guy in the suit with a straight mustache. His truck, shiny and spotless, was visible out the window, a hardhat and clipboard sitting on the dashboard. 'Yes, we’ll be in and out of town for a few years if things go right. There’s a lot of work to be done before it’s in working order. We’re mapping it all out,' the man replied. 'Well, at least we’ll have some clean energy around here,' the old man said, chuckling. 'Finally, putting all of this damned wind to work for once!' I ate my sandwich silently, already uncomfortable in a restaurant for the first time in months. 'There will sure be a lot of wind energy,' the worker in overalls replied. 'But none of it’s for Wyoming.' He added that it would all be directed to California. 'What?!' exclaimed the man as his wife shook her head in frustration. 'Commiefornia?! That’s nuts!' Right-wing hyperbole aside, he had a point: it was pretty crazy. Projected to be the largest wind farm in the country, it would indeed make a bundle of electricity, just not for transmission to any homes in Rawlins. The power produced by that future 600-turbine, 3,000 MW Chokecherry and Sierra Madre wind farm, with its $5-billion price tag, won’t, in fact, flow anywhere in Colorado, even though it’s owned by the Denver-based Anschutz Corporation. Instead, its electricity will travel 1,000 miles southwest to exclusively supply residents in Southern California. The project, 17 years in the making and spanning 1,500 acres, hasn’t sparked a whole lot of opposition despite its mammoth size. This might be because the turbines aren’t located near homes, but on privately owned cattle ranches and federal lands managed by the Bureau of Land Management. Aside from a few raised eyebrows and that one shocked couple, not many people in Rawlins seemed all that bothered. Then again, Rawlins doesn’t have too many folks to bother (population 8,203). Wyoming was once this country’s coal-mining capital. Now, with the development of wind farms, it’s becoming a major player in clean energy, part of a significant energy transition aimed at reducing our reliance on fossil fuels. Even so, Phil Anschutz, whose company is behind the Chokecherry and Sierra Madre wind farms, didn’t get into the green energy game just to save the climate. 'We’re doing it to make money,' admitsAnschutz, who got the bulk of his billion-dollar fortune from the oil industry. With California’s mandate to end its reliance on fossil fuels by 2045, he now sees a profitable opportunity, and he’s pulling Wyoming along for the ride. Since 1988, Wyoming has been the country’s top coal-producing state, but its mining has declined steeply over the past 15 years, as has coal mining more generally in the US where 40% of coal plants are set to be shuttered by 2030. In addition to the closed plants, the downturn in coal output has resulted largely from cheap natural gas prices and the influx of utility-scale renewable energy projects. Wyoming’s coal production peaked in 2008, churning out more than 466 million short tons. Today, its mines produce around 288 million short tons of coal, accounting for 40% of America’s total coal mining and supplying around 25% of its power generation. Coal plants are also responsible for more than 60% of carbon dioxide emissions from the country’s power sector. As far as the climate is concerned, that’s still way too much. The good news is that the US has witnessed a dramatic drop in daily coal use, down 62% since 2008, and few places have felt coal’s rapid decline more than Wyoming, where a green shift is distinctly afoot. Despite being one of the country’s most conservative states (71% of its voters backed Donald Trump this year), Wyoming is going all in on wind energy. In 2023, wind comprised 21% of Wyoming’s net energy generation, with 3,100 megawatts, or enough energy to power more than 2.5 million homes. That’s up from 9.4% in 2007. The winds of change On the surface, Wyoming’s transition from coal to wind is laudable and entirely necessary. When it comes to carbon emissions, coal is by far the nastiest of the fossil fuels. If climate chaos is to be mitigated in any way, coal will have to become a thing of the past and wind will provide a far cleaner alternative. Even so, wind energy has faced its fair share of pushback. A major criticism is that wind farms, like the one outside Rawlins, are blights on the landscape. Even if folks in Rawlins aren’t outraged by the huge wind farm on the outskirts of town, not everyone is on board with Wyoming’s wind rush. 'We don’t want to ruin where we live,' says Sue Jones, a Republican commissioner of Carbon County. 'We can call it renewable, we can call it green, but green still has a downside. With wind, it’s visual. We don’t want to destroy one environment to save another.' Energy from the Chokecherry and Sierra Madre wind farms will also reach California via a 732-mile transmission line known as the 'TransWest Express,' which will feed solar and wind energy to parts of Arizona and Nevada as well. To be completed by 2029, the $3-billion line will travel through four states on public and private land and has been subject to approval by property owners, tribes, and state, federal and local agencies. The TransWest Express passed the final review process in April 2023 and will become the most extensive interstate transmission line built in the US in decades. As one might imagine, the infrastructure and land required to construct the TransWest Express will considerably impact local ecology. As for the Chokecherry and Sierra Madre wind farm, it might not encroach on residential neighborhoods, but it does risk destroying some of the best natural wildlife habitats in Wyoming. Transmission towers connecting thick high-voltage power lines will stand 180 feet tall, slicing through prime sage-grouse, elk and mule deer habitat and Colorado’s largest concentration of low-elevation wildlands. The TransWest Express will pass over rivers and streams, chop through forests, stretch over hills and bulldoze its way through scenic valleys. Many believe this is just the price that must be paid to combat our warming climate and that the impact of the Chokecherry and Sierra Madre projects, and the TransWest Express will be nothing compared to what unmitigated climate chaos will otherwise reap. Some disagree, however, and wonder if such expansive wind farms are really the best we can come up with in the face of climate change.'This question puts a fine point on the twin looming disasters that humanity has brought upon the Earth: the climate crisis and the biodiversity crisis,' argues Erik Molvar, a wildlife biologist and executive director of the Western Watersheds Project, a Hailey, Idaho-based environmental group. 'The climate crisis and the biodiversity crisis are of equal importance to humans and every other species with which we share this globe, and it would be foolhardy to ignore either in pursuit of solutions for the other.' Molver is onto something often overlooked in discussions and debates around our much-needed energy transition: What consequences will these massive renewable energy projects have on biodiversity and the wild creatures that depend on these lands for survival? Is It really clean if it kills? Biologists like Mike Lockhart, who worked for the US Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) for more than 30 years, claim that these large wind farms are more than just an eyesore and will negatively affect wildlife in Wyoming. Raptors, eagles, passerines, bats and various migrating birds frequently collide with the blades, which typically span 165 feet. 'Most of the [Wyoming wind energy] development is just going off like a rocket right now, and we already have eagles that are getting killed by wind turbines — a hell of a lot more than people really understand,' warns Lockhart, a highly respected expert on golden eagles. In a recent conversation with Dustin Bleizeffer, a writer for WyoFile, Lockhart warned that wind energy development in Wyoming, in particular, is occurring at a higher rate than environmental assessments can keep up with, which means it could be having damning effects on wild animals. Places with consistent winds, as Lockhart explains, also happen to be prime wildlife habitats and most of the big wind farms in Wyoming are being built before we know enough about what their impact could be on bird populations. In February 2024, FWS updated its permitting process under the Bald and Golden Eagle Protection Act, hoping it would help offset some of wind energy’s effects on eagles. The new rules, however, will still allow eagles to die. The new permits for wind turbines won’t even specify the number of eagles allowed to be killed and companies won’t, in fact, be out of compliance even if their wind turbines are responsible for injuring or killing significant numbers of them. Teton Raptor Center Conservation Director Bryan Bedrosian believes that golden eagle populations in Wyoming are indeed on the decline as such projects only grow and habitats are destroyed — and the boom in wind energy, he adds, isn’t helping matters. 'We have some of the best golden eagle populations in Wyoming, but it doesn’t mean the population is not at risk,' he says. 'As we increase wind development across the US, that risk is increasing.' It appears that a few politicians in Washington are listening. In October, California Representative Jared Huffman and Pennsylvania Representative Brian Fitzpatrick introduced a bipartisan bill updating the Migratory Bird Treaty Act of 1918. The legislation would authorize penalties of up to $10,000 per violation for harm to birds. Still, congressional staffers tell me it’s unlikely to pass, given the quiet lobbying efforts behind the scenes by a motley crew of oil, gas and wind energy developers. The Department of Energy projects that wind will generate an impressive 35% of the country’s electricity generation by 2050. If so, upwards of 5 million birds could be killed by wind turbines every year. In addition to golden eagles, the American Bird Conservancy notes that 'Yellow-billed Cuckoos, Golden-winged Warblers, and Kirtland’s Warblers are particularly vulnerable. Wind energy poses special risks to endangered or threatened species such as Whooping Cranes and California Condors, since the loss of even a few individuals can have population-level effects.' And bird kills aren’t the only problem either. The constant drone of the turbines can also impact migration patterns, and the larger the wind farm, the more habitat is likely to be wrecked. The key to reducing such horrors is to try to locate wind farms as far away from areas used as migratory corridors as possible. But as Lockhart points out, that’s easier said than done, as places with steady winds also tend to be environments that traveling birds utilize. Even though onshore wind farms kill birds and can disrupt habitats, most scientists believe that wind energy must play a role in the world’s much-needed energy transition. Mark Z. Jacobson, author of No Miracles Needed and director of the Atmosphere/Energy Program at Stanford University, notes that the minimal carbon emissions in the life-cycle of onshore wind energy are only outmatched by the carbon footprint of rooftop solar. It would be extremely difficult, he points out, to curtail the world’s use of fossil fuels without embracing wind energy. Scientists are, however, devising novel ways to reduce the collisions that cause such deaths. One method is to paint the blades of the wind turbines black to increase their visibility. A recent study showed that doing so instantly reduces bird fatalities by 70%. Such possibilities are promising, but shouldn’t wind project creators also do as much as possible to site their energy projects as close to their consumers as they can? Should Wyoming really be supplying California with wind energy when that state already has plenty of windy options — in and around Los Angeles, for example, on thousands of acres of oil and brownfield sites that are quite suitable for wind or solar farms and don’t risk destroying animal habitats by constructing hundreds of miles of power lines? Wind energy from Wyoming will not finally reach California until the end of the decade. As Phil Anschutz reminds us, it’s all about money, and land in Los Angeles, however battered and bruised, would still be a far cheaper and less destructive way to go than parceling out open space in Wyoming. Wind is still a resource In that roadside cafe in Rawlins, the two workers paid their bill and left. I sat there quietly, wondering what that couple made of the revelation that the wind farm nearby wasn’t going to benefit them. Finally, nodding toward the men’s truck as it drove away, I asked, 'What do you think of that?' 'Same old, same old,' the guy eventually replied. 'Reminds me of the coal industry, the oil industry, you name it. The big city boys come and take our resources and we end up having little to show for it.' Shortly after lunch, I left Rawlins and made my way two hours north to the Pioneer Wind Farm near the little town of Glenrock that began operating in 2011. I pulled over to get some fresh air and stretch my legs. As I exited the car, I could hear the steady hum of turbines slicing through the air above me and I didn’t have to walk very far before I nearly stepped on a dead hawk in the early stages of decay. I had no way of knowing how the poor critter was killed, but it was hard to imagine that the hulking blade swirling overhead didn’t have something to do with it.

New Cold War In South Asia As The BRICS Rise – OpEd	By Darini Rajasingham-Senanayake There will be no honeymoon for the newly minted National People’s Power (NPP) Government that got a massive people’s mandate for debt justice. The storm blowing from Washington DC across the Indian Ocean World—targeting China to the East, Iran to the West, and now, India at the centre—is growing and expanding. So too, the US led NATO sanctions regime is expanding and impacting many countries. These include Sri Lanka, which is caught in the crosshairs of hybrid economic war on the rise of BRICS and China’s Belt and Road Initiative. Seemingly unable to re-negotiate International Monetary Fund (IMF), and odious debt Eurobond Exchange agreements drafted by the previous Ranil Rajapakse regime that it had accused of corruption, the new NPP government this month signed Sri Lanka up to being 'pumped and dumped' once again into a second staged Sovereign Default. Sri Lanka, South Asia’s richest country by the metric that matters—Purchasing Power Parity (PPP) GDP per capita– was declared ‘bankrupt’ and in Default in March 2022 amid distracting US National Endowment for Democracy (NED) funded Araglaya protests—simply due to a purported lack of exorbitantly privileged US dollars! While the IMF engineered Bond Exchange has got stock markets on a Christmas high with seasonal good news hype in the corporate media echo chamber with Fitch and Moody’s upgrades despite significant deflation, the pain would soon set in as Sri Lanka commenced Odious debt payments to predatory creditors in 2025 and the EPF pension funds whittle down. A new round of social unrest and protests at high taxes and the IMF’s bitter austerity measures to shrink the economy and pay predatory International Sovereign bond holders with a fire sale of national assets are on the cards, and very likely a second staged Default curtsey the IMF’s Extended Fund Facility. US Sanctions and Regime Change Aragalayas in South Asia Simultaneously, shades of an increasingly hot, new regional Cold War are apparent across South Asia and the Indian Ocean world. There were two regime change operations in Pakistan and Sri Lanka in 2022 amid Victoria Nurland inspired 'colour revolution’ or Arab Spring Araglaya ‘protests'. This year, 2024, saw regime change in Bangladesh and just a few weeks ago members of the ruling BJP in India accused the US of targeting Prime Minister Modi’s government for regime change. The SOROS foundation and the NED funded NGO complex were identified as part of local-global networks that were implicated in tarnishing the Modi brand. Meanwhile, development projects that promised needed foreign investment in Sri Lanka have been thrown into disarray by the United States expanding sanctions regime on the BRICS leaders, this time on Russian firms, as well as court action against the Indian conglomerate, Adani. Two months ago, India’s Shaurya Aeronautics Pvt Ltd and Russia’s Airports of Regions Management Company’s plans for joint development of the Chinese built Mattala International Airport in southeast Sri Lanka were put on hold due to US sanctions.[i] The U.S. Department of the Treasury had sanctioned India-based Shaurya Aeronautics Private Limited, among 275 individuals and entities involved in supplying Russia with advanced technology and equipment. The airport near the Hambantota Port is located near some of the world’s busiest trade, energy and submarine Data Cable routes. Meanwhile a bribery case was filed in New York last month against the Adani conglomerate, which is a partner of BlackRock, that is in turn Sri Lanka’s largest private predatory International Sovereign Bond (ISB) creditor. Although China is routinely blamed in the global corporate media echo chamber for debt trap lending, analysis of Sri Lanka’s loan profile clearly show that ISBs are the cause of the geostrategic island’s first ever Sovereign Default in March 2022. Adani was set to develop the Western Terminal of the Colombo port in partnership with local conglomerate John Keells holdings with significant US Development Finance Corporation (DFC) funding. This was before US authorities had accused Adani of bribery in Andhra Pradesh and filed a court case in New York. Adani, said to be Asia’s richest man is seen to be personally close to Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi.Adani which partners with BlackRock, Sri Lanka’s biggest private creditor had already got a sweetheart deal ex-ante the Odious debt restructure Bond Exchange agreements signed this month– for various ‘green energy’ projects! Sanctions and Visits As sanctions bit, US Assistant Secretary of State, Donald Lu visited India, Sri Lanka and Nepal earlier this month. Lu met government, the NGO complex and other civil society members to discuss ‘capacity building’ assistance, presumably, for more institutional capture. The Central Bank of Sri Lanka has been already effectively privatized to serve the interests of predatory ISBs rather than citizens via International Monetary Fund ‘reforms’. US moves against Indian firms have likely given Sri Lanka Foreign Minister Vijitha Herath a big headache, much like the pending debt trap International Sovereign bond debt restructure agreements that are being forced on the new government in Colombo by the IMF and Lazard and Clifford Chance that represent ISBs that have debt trapped the county in collusion with local politicians and business cronies. Will Mr. Herath be able to persuade Lu to hold back US sanctions and the ISB vulture funds to make an exception for debt trapped Sri Lanka, and enable the Mattala International Airport and Colombo port west terminal projects to proceed with Indian and Russian investment? A USDFC, which had agreed to lend $500 million to Adani’s port development in Sri Lanka said it was conducting due diligence on the project. Targeting Indian Projects and Sri Lanka’s BRICS application Indian firms are being targeted by Washington, which has long sought access to geostrategic Sri Lanka’s energy, transport, telecom infrastructure. This was evident in the US Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC) Compact, rejected by Sri Lanka back in 2019. At the time there were fears of the US establishing military bases under the Status of Forces Agreement (SOFA), in the geostrategic island nation. The Colombo harbour is South Asia’s busiest port but that development is also now on hold. Of course, the US promise to fund Adani’s port development to the tune of over USD 500 million was in any case a tall order! The sum was much more than the aborted MCC project, after which the mysterious ISIS-claimed Easter Sunday hybrid war attacks targeted tourist hotels and churches, crashing economy and society. The IS-claimed attacks were clearly designed to set off a ‘cascade of violence' in the multi-religious island nation. The Mattala International Airport in Hambantota, initially built by the Chinese was perceived to be a 'White Elephant’ development project but is actually located near one of the world’s busiest maritime trade, energy and submarine Date Cable routes in the world. The Indian Shaurya Aeronautics plan to develop the airport would bring needed foreign investment and showcase collaboration among the big three Asian powers- China, India and Russia but is now on ice due to US sanctions. Sri Lanka, clearly caught in the crosshairs of big power rivalry, had formally submitted an application to join BRICS and the New Development Bank at the meeting in Kazan in October where President Putin hosted China’s President Xi and Indian Premier Modi along with other Global South leaders. The new government in Colombo would be hoping to leverage regional growth and support from the Global South in the 'Asian 21stCentury'. However, no senior Minister from Sri Lanka attended the meeting in Kazan where de-dollarization and trading in national currencies was a hot topic– an opportunity missed in deference to Washington? Sri Lanka’s application to join the New Development Bank has been accepted but the BRICS application remains pending at this time. A New Regional Cold War? A new Cold War is clearly ramping up across the Indian Ocean–and not just on China. Having pushed Russia and China into ever close partnership Washington seems keen to ensure that India warmly embraces its erstwhile foe – China and the BRICS. India had defied US sanctions on Russia over the past two year and ramped up Rupee-Ruble trade and Russian oil and gas purchases, benefiting from Russia’s decoupling from Europe and the war in Ukraine, also given historically strong and deep relations with the Soviet Union during the Cold War (1945-1991). Was India rewarded with regime change in Bangladesh for defying US Sanctions and drawing nearer its neighbouring BRICS? India was also embroiled in a Canadian Sikh spy murder mystery with Woke Diaspora identity political overtones also emanating from Washington. More concerning for India and indeed the South Asia region as a whole is the latest regime change operation with the obligatory student protests directed via social media right under India’s nose in neighbouring Bangladesh, and the weaponization of Hindu-Muslim-Buddhist regional religious identity politics that has followed. Departing President Joe Biden seems to have run out of patience with India. The G-20 afterglow in Delhi now seems like a prelude to the parting of ways between India and the West, as Delhi appears to pivot to BRICS. Or perhaps it’s just Biden’s farewell to South Asia and the world, which increasingly seems like: ‘Apres moi le deluge!’ Debt Neocolonialism as a new Cold War takes Shape in South Asia Will Sri Lanka caught in the IMF’s neocolonial debt and Eurobond bailout business be able to withstand US pressures as India has and turn its back on Indian and Russian investments? Will Colombo be asked to choose between Washington and New Delhi again? During the previous Cold War, Delhi armed and trained the Liberation Tigers (LTTE), against any possible US bases in its backyard as Colombo moved close to Washington under J.R. Jayawardena. This ensured that Sri Lanka’s so-called internal 'ethnic conflict’ which was really a regional Cold War proxy war, with India closely allied with the Soviet Union, would run for 30 years. Geostrategic Sri Lanka’s ports and airports at the center of the Indian Ocean and a choke point of Submarine Data Cables are again of great interest to Washington’s neocons and the NATO war machine, which now aspires to Full Spectrum Dominance (FSD)–over earth, air, sea and Cyber operations. The targeting of energy and electricity systems as well as transport and telecom infrastructure in the South Asia region– from MCC in Nepal in the north to IMF’s privatization push in Sri Lanka in the south may have much to do with the rush to setup Data Centers, as well as, control over trade and energy choke points as a new Cold War ramps up. Cold War Redux: Regime Change and Debt Neocolonialism Back in 2022 the Pakistan premier Imran Khan accused Donald Lu of running a regime change operation against him. Simultaneously, a soft regime change operation unfolded in Sri Lanka with the US National Endowment for Democracy (NED) funded and social media remote platforms directed Aragalaya ‘protests’. This was shortly after Victoria Nurland had visited Colombo. The 2022 regime change in Colombo was masked, Arab Spring/ colour revolution style, with people’s protests against a no doubt unpopular regime, to ensure that Sri Lanka staged a smooth Sovereign Default into the waiting arms of the lender of last resorts- the International Monetary Fund (IMF). The new Washington backed President Ranil Wickramasinghe was installed to stage the default and deepen the Eurobond debt trap ex-poste. Two years later, Imran Khan for his impudence in naming Donald Lu as the instigator of regime change in Pakistan in 2022 languishes in prison in Islamabad amid huge protests. Fate has been slightly kinder to Sri Lanka’s erstwhile president Gotabaya Rajapakse who was also ousted in the soft Aragalaya coup in 2022. Rajapakse remains a free man albeit an ex-American citizen barred from travel to the US. He was dispatched and humiliated amid the Woke Aragalaya protests directed via remote controlled social media platforms that rocked Colombo, after the dreaded Victoria Nurland’s visit in early 2022 to triggered the regime change. Nurland is widely credited with the Ukraine Maidan Square colour revolutions that enabled the rise of Zelinski to precipitate war with Russia. Thus, South Asia’s only Upper Middle Income County (MIC) was declared bankrupt overnight and forced to stage a first ever Sovereign Default. This was as Lawfare unfolded once again in a New York Court when the shadowy, off-shore Hamilton Reserve Bank filed a case against Sri Lanka in 2022 for non-payment of a small amount of interest. The HRB Lawfare triggered rapid local Rupee currency depreciation against the exorbitantly privileged US dollar in tandem with rating agency downgrades. A quiet parting of Ways? Weaponizing Diaspora Identity Politics Regime change operations in Colombo and Islamabad in early 2022 notwithstanding, India, the South Asian regional hegemon, now grapples with yet another US instigated regime change operation right under her nose – this time in Dhaka, Bangladesh. Deposed secular Prime Minister, Sheikh Hasina had sought refuge in Delhi given historic ties but religion/s have been again weaponized in Bangladesh. Of course, the weaponiztion of religion/s, particularly, Buddhism and Islam, in South and South East Asia was a Cold War project to destabilize the region and counter God-less Communist and Socialist de-colonization, national liberation and independence movements in Asia. Yale University historian Eugene Ford’s book 'Cold War Monks: Buddhism and America’s Secret Strategy in Asia' is especially enlightening in this regard. Is a quiet parting of ways unfolding at this time with India’s Adani and various BRICS partnerships being targeted by Washington? The side show with Canada and India expelling diplomats, may well be a distraction from the far more serious issue of regime change in Bangladesh and its regional implications: Religious minorities (Hindus, Buddhists and Christians), are now under threat from the same Saudi-funded Islamist Cat’s paw and handmaiden that the CIA with partner in crime Israel’s Mossad deploys around the world to destabilize countries and regions. Call it the ISIS, ISIL, Al Qaida, the Muslim Brotherhood, rebranded HTS in Syria or ISIS-K in Afghanistan, or whatever. The recent regime change operation, weaponizing transnational networks and religious identity politics in Bangladesh that saw the ouster of Prime Minister Hasina a close ally of Delhi certainly put a spanner in the works in the West’s wooing of mother India– with the Indian Diaspora in the west in tow: From Rishi Sunak to Kamala Harris who embodied the I-2 (Israel-India) partnership given her Indian name and Jewish husband, to all those Indian Diaspora CEOs of big US and EU corporations, it is increasingly clear that the Indian Diaspora in the Euro-American world and Australia had been weaponized and mobilized for the charm offensive to persuade India to fight a proxy war on China and crash the Asian 21st Century. That kite did not fly. The I2U2, or West Asia QUAD, comprising Israel, India, UAE and US, was designed to help ‘normalize’ Israel’s occupation of Palestine via the Abraham Accords, and the current genocide in Gaza. But the U2- UAE and US part may be fraying at this time. ISUS was also set up to cement the I-2 (India-Israel) alliance brokered as part of Washington’s Judeo-Christian-Hindu fundamentalist outreach via I2U2 (India, Israel, UAE, US), with the Islamist Cat’s paw to destabilize South Asia – old Cold War style when there was a proliferation of regional security groupings like SEATO. The new twist is the Indian Diaspora in the West. Will developments before and during the BRICS summit in Kazan where China and India made relative peace, and the regime change in Bangladesh break the I2U2 partnership, or at least the I2, India-Israel part? As winds of change blow in Washington come January when Donald Trump would be ensconced President of the United States, Donald Lu would be perhaps saying a fond farewell to South Asia on this trip to the region.

Joe Biden Quietly Checks Out, But Does It Really Matter? – OpEd	By Graham J Noble America’s four-year ordeal is almost at an end. Since January 2021, the nation has staggered under the weight of runaway inflation, soaring crime rates, and a virtual invasion of illegal aliens. At the same time, the worst excesses of extreme progressive ideology have all but shredded the cultural and moral fiber of the country. Shortly before embarking on one last taxpayer-funded vacation, Joe Biden delivered a final insult with a mass pardon – or, to be more accurate, a mass commutation of sentences – for many of America’s most brutally violent killers, sparing them the death penalty. It is a sad and insulting final chapter in the story of what may have been the most inept, wasteful, dishonest, censorious, and secretive administrations in modern American history. 'I think people, including probably a lot of people in the White House, are just ready for it to be over,' one veteran Democratic donor and bundler told The Hill. 'There’s just such a great level of sort of disappointment on the way this presidency is ending. It’s almost like a resignation at this point,' a Democratic lobbyist observed, adding: 'Among Democrats, nobody’s looking forward to Donald Trump being president, but everybody’s ready for the Biden presidency to be done.' A National Sigh of Relief That last remark seems to sum up the mood of the nation. It’s almost as if everyone breathed a collective sigh of relief when Joe Biden first announced that he would not seek re-election. And then, when November 5 came and went, and the possibility of Kamala Harris subjecting America to four more years of Biden-esque leadership – or worse – disappeared, the nation exhaled once more. Harris’s electioneering mantras, 'We’re not going back' and 'We’re turning the page,' proved accurate after all – just not in the way she and her party expected. History will almost certainly not be kind to the Joe Biden legacy – although that may depend on who writes the history books. A lot of people on the political left tried for the past four years to portray Biden as the greatest American president. Yet it appears that there will not be any ceremonies and celebrations to honor the man as he shuffles off to retirement in Delaware. The Joe Biden Years and the Reckoning During the coming Trump years, there are bound to be some savage postmortems of the Biden presidency conducted on Capitol Hill and, quite possibly, at the Department of Justice. And, since a few people have now quietly admitted that Biden’s physical and cognitive decline was apparent to White House insiders from his earliest days in the Oval Office, perhaps Americans will find out who was really making all the big decisions. There is good reason to speculate that Joe Biden may not have always been personally calling the shots. Does that get him off the hook for some of his administration’s disastrous – and, in some cases, unconstitutional – actions? On the contrary, he was supposed to be the chief executive, and if he was unable to fully carry out his duties, then, for the good of the country, Joe Biden should have stepped down. This is why those postmortems will be necessary because everybody also needs to know the names of the people who were aware of his infirmity and covered it up. Though Donald Trump is already acting very much like a commander-in-chief in some ways, he is not yet back behind the Resolute Desk at 1600 Pennsylvania Ave. That means there’s something of a power vacuum at the center of the executive branch for the last 20-something days of the Joe Biden presidency. Does it really matter, though? In the absence of a direct military attack on the US or a massive natural or man-made disaster, can America survive a couple of weeks with no decisions being made at the White House? Yes, of course it can. And considering some of the decisions that have been made there over the past four years, perhaps it would be for the best. Biden appears to have been using his last few weeks in office to put as many flies in ointment jars as he can so Democrats can later wail and gnash their teeth over the terrible state of things after Trump is sworn in as the 47th president. It is maybe a good thing that Biden is once again on vacation. An awful lot of people, probably including many within his party, are perhaps wishing he would stay on vacation until January 20.

Trump’s Key Foreign Policy Challenges – OpEd	By Kerry Boyd Anderson As ever, a new year comes with new challenges and opportunities. For US foreign policy, the new Trump administration, which will take office on Jan. 20, will shape the country’s approach to the world. As with all presidents, Donald Trump will have significant power to determine foreign policy but will also have to determine how to respond to events that are unexpected or outside of US control.When Trump once again becomes president, he and his senior advisers will face two major wars — in Ukraine and Gaza — that have bedeviled the outgoing administration. Trump has repeatedly said that he could very quickly end the war between Russia and Ukraine and now he will have an opportunity to attempt to do so. Trump and some of his top advisers have expressed skepticism about or opposition to America’s provision of weapons and aid to Ukraine. It is very likely that Ukraine will face a major reduction in US assistance once Trump returns to the White House.Trump recently appointed Keith Kellogg as his special envoy to address the war. Kellogg has proposed using the threat of cutting off future aid as leverage to force Ukraine to negotiate, while offering incentives such as putting off NATO membership for Ukraine and alleviating sanctions to persuade Moscow to negotiate. Regardless of the policy specifics, Ukraine will find itself in a weaker position vis-a-vis Russia, which indeed might lead to negotiations to end the war, but probably on terms that are more disappointing to Kyiv than to Moscow.A related challenge will be managing relations with European allies. Trump’s lack of commitment to NATO, as he expressed during his first term in office, will pose a challenge for the organization, which gained strength from new members during Biden’s term but also faces multiple threats from internal tensions and Russia. Advocates for greater European cooperation on security and autonomy from the US on defense matters are hoping that their efforts will gain momentum during the second Trump presidency.The war in Gaza is likely to still be ongoing when Trump is inaugurated. The Trump administration’s approach will feature enthusiastic support for Israel. Trump’s picks for foreign policy advisers are all extremely pro-Israel. For example, his nominee for secretary of state, Marco Rubio, recently wrote that 'Israelis rightfully living in their historic homeland are not the impediment to peace; the Palestinians are.'Trump’s choice for ambassador to Israel, Mike Huckabee, has said that 'there is no such thing as the West Bank — it’s Judea and Samaria,' and that 'there is no such thing as an (Israeli) occupation.' Other senior foreign policy officials chosen by Trump express similar sentiments. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu will have even greater US support under Trump and will face no serious pressure from the new administration to change his approach toward Gaza or the West Bank.The Trump administration will face the continuing risk that the war in Gaza helps to drive other regional conflicts. Even if the ceasefire between Hezbollah and Israel holds through Trump’s inauguration, the risk of renewed fighting is high. The outgoing administration has also struggled to respond to evolving risks posed by the Houthis in Yemen and Trump will inherit that challenge.The new administration’s pro-Israel lens will be applied to the challenge of dealing with Iran, including less pressure on Israel to restrain its potential actions. Many of Trump’s top foreign policy advisers take a hawkish approach toward Iran; however, Trump does not seek another protracted war in the Middle East that might involve US troops. His desire to avoid direct involvement in a war that could be costly in terms of American lives and funds might constrain some of his advisers’ more hawkish tendencies. One of the few areas of bipartisan agreement in Washington is that China poses the greatest long-term threat to the US. Over the years, Trump has spoken both negatively and positively about China and Chinese President Xi Jinping, but his advisers are mostly hawkish toward Beijing. Furthermore, the US defense establishment sees China as its 'pacing threat' and the top potential challenger to American power and interests. Trump’s administration is very likely to view China as a key competitor and threat and to seek to shift resources away from the Middle East toward East Asia — though the same was true for the last several presidents, with limited success.It will be important to watch how the Trump administration shapes the details of its approach toward China. Trump has promised very high tariffs against Beijing, but he has both official and unofficial advisers who oppose that. Some of his advisers want to back Taiwan, but Trump appears less likely to be willing to risk significant military losses to protect the island. He may prefer to engage in economic rather than military conflict with Beijing. China will loom large in US foreign policy, but the details on how the Trump administration will manage the challenge are not yet fully clear.Increasing US-China competition, combined with uncertainty regarding Washington’s future policy, creates a challenge for US allies in the Pacific, including South Korea and Japan. South Korea has particular reason to worry about the depth of US commitment to its alliance, given statements from Trump that suggest he wants a more transactional relationship. Recent media reports suggest that Trump would like to renew talks with North Korea. Security in East Asia will depend significantly on how Trump approaches China and North Korea, as well as how Beijing and Pyongyang respond.The Biden administration placed significant emphasis on cooperation to address global concerns, such as climate change, but Trump and many of his advisers express disdain for international institutions. For example, his nominee for ambassador to the UN, Elise Stefanik, is very critical of the institution. Trump has called climate change 'a hoax' and will likely withdraw from the Paris Agreement, as he did during his first term.As the Trump administration determines how to respond to new challenges that might arise in 2025, it will do so on a unilateral basis or by working with specific countries, rather than through multilateral institutions.Elsewhere, Trump’s strong opposition to illegal immigration will define Washington’s relations with Central and South America. Trump’s 'America First' approach opposes sending US taxpayers’ dollars abroad without clear, concrete returns, so US aid to developing countries is likely to drop, especially where previous aid was based on concepts of soft power and promoting American values. Relations with India will likely see continuity, as Trump and Prime Minister Narendra Modi get along well and Trump’s advisers do not see India as a major concern.The world is more prepared for a second Trump term than it was for the first, which came as something of a surprise to many global actors. However, Trump’s second presidency will be different from his first in many ways, as already evidenced by his selection of advisers based more on their strong alignment with him and less on their experience within the political or national security establishments. Washington’s approach to foreign policy challenges in 2025 will diverge significantly from its approach in 2024 — and possibly from Trump’s first term.

Croatia’s Outspoken Milanovic Tipped To Win Second Presidential T...	By Vuk Tesija Zoran Milanovic is the frontrunner in Croatia’s presidential election on Sunday but will likely face a run-off against the governing party’s candidate to secure a second term as head of state. Milanovic, 58, is polling at almost 39 per cent, two percentage points more than a month ago and well ahead of Dragan Primorac of the governing Croatian Democratic Union, HDZ, on almost 23 per cent. The incumbent’s first five-year term was marked by frequent and often fiery criticism of the HDZ-led government of Prime Minister Andrej Plenkovic, as well as a string of controversial statements by Milanovic that seemed designed to appeal to the political right. He is backed by the opposition Social Democratic Party, SDP, which he led between 2007 and 2016. Trailing behind Milanovic and Primorac are six other candidates, including independent Marija Selak Raspudic and Ivana Kekin, a party ally of Zagreb mayor Tomislav Tomasevic, who are both polling at around nine per cent. Sunday’s vote is the third this year following a parliamentary election won by the HDZ in April and European elections in June; local elections are also due early next year. Nada Zgrabljic Rotar, a former professor of journalism and communication studies at the University of Zagreb, said the campaign had been 'lukewarm'. 'We should also keep in mind that people are tired of the elections and rhetoric that is similar and repeated,' Zgrabljic Rotar told BIRN. That rhetoric frequently revolves around the issue of Croatian soldiers being deployed abroad as part of NATO operations, notably concerning Ukraine; immigration; the rights of Croats in neighbouring Bosnia and Herzegovina; and what conditions to set of Serbia in exchange for voting in favour of its accession to the European Union at some unknown point in the future. In debates, Milanovic has taken a softer line than Primorac and some of the other candidates; he has ruled out sending the army to secure Croatia’s borders, deporting migrants, or setting any particularly radical conditions on Serbia. Political analyst Jaroslav Pecnik said the incumbent is the clear frontrunner, but the HDZ 'must not allow itself the catastrophe' of Primorac not making the run-off on January 12. Observers are also watching closely how Kekin performs on behalf of Mozemo! [We Can!], the party that holds power in the capital, Zagreb. 'Her participation should be seen as preparation and profiling for the local elections in May,' said Pecnik. Milanovic the best orator Primorac has taken a significantly tougher line than Milanovic on the key issues of the campaign. On Croatia’s public broadcaster on Monday, the 59-year-old doctor said he would deport 'every illegal migrant' on Croatian territory and condition Serbia’s EU accession on it declassifying Yugoslav People’s Army papers on the fall of Vukovar and the killing of wounded Croatian fighters and civilians taken from the city hospital in 1991. He also ruled out sending Croatian soldiers to Ukraine, but criticised Milanovic’s opposition to the participation of two Croatian army officers in the NATO training of Ukrainian soldiers in Germany. Zgrabljic Rotar, however, noted Primorac’s failure to make much of public concern over the state of the public health service, given his medical expertise. Primorac’s chances have possibly been hurt by a scandal involving his HDZ colleague Vili Beros, who was dismissed as health minister in November over allegations of graft in the procurement of medical equipment. Most analysts agree that Milanovic is the best orator in the race. 'His style can sometimes be a bit over the top, but at least he has the ‘taste and smell’of a politician,' said Pecnik. 'He is not attacking anyone in the campaign for now because he doesn’t need to, because he is the favourite, and no one dares to touch him too much because they know he has a sharp tongue.' Zgrabljic Rotar similarly cited Milanovic’s speaking skills. 'He has a rhetoric that is sometimes poetic, sometimes rough; he is a good speaker, which we don’t have many opportunities to hear,' she told BIRN. 'In general, our politicians don’t work hard enough on themselves. In politics, it is not enoughjust to be smart, you have to know how to speak.' Second term the time for ‘decisive steps’ Pecnik said Milanovic should seize the opportunity offered by a second term to cement his legacy, with his 'greatest potential' in the field of foreign policy. 'If he wants to be remembered in history – and I believe he is sufficiently narcissistic and ambitious to aspire to that – he must take decisive steps. The second term is the time for such actions,' Pecnik told BIRN. 'He should launch a series of initiatives aimed at Prime Minister Plenkovic and the government, putting them in a position where they are compelled to respond. Plenkovic may not need to accept these initiatives, but he cannot ignore them. If Milanovic achieves that, he will have accomplished a great deal.' Pecnik said regional initiatives, involving Bosnia, Serbia and Montenegro, would be 'crucial'. 'A balanced approach toward these countries is necessary, alongside a clear commitment to supporting their EU accession,' he said.'Of course, this does not depend solely on Milanovic but also on the government and these countries themselves. It’s essential to approach them as equals, demonstrating a willingness to help while maintaining clear criteria.' Alluding to some of the most controversial of Milanovic’s public pronouncements, Pecnik said Milanovic should 'move away from pandering to Tudjman’s politics and instead establish his own authentic policies', a reference to Croatia’s first president, the nationalist Franjo Tudjman. Political analyst Davor Gjenero said the only potential for surprise on Sunday is in possibility of Milanovic taking enough votes to win outright, a feat no one has managed since Tudjman. He would then be protected against ideas, aired now and then by some in the media, about trimming the powers of the presidency. 'In that case, everything that was said about limiting the powers of the president of the republic is hardly an option,' Gjenero said.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWcJ2GkwDpXjHdybhY9v9IG4	2024-12-28T16:05:49-08:00	
Growing Role Of Private Sector Tn Boosting India-Vietnam Trade An...	India-Vietnam trade and investment ties have traditionally been led by investments by government-supported public sector undertakings. The slow and steady change in Indian investments began about a decade-and-a-half ago when Tata and Essar Group started investing in the country. However, Vietnam’s impressive economic growth and emergence as a major investment hub in the Indo-Pacific region in recent years caught the attention of industry giants from India, brightening prospects for stronger India-Vietnam trade and investment relations. Vietnam’s rapid industrial growth has resulted in fast-paced urbanisation and demand for diverse sources of renewable and non-renewable energy resources. A major development in this context happened earlier this year when Adani Port and Special Economic Zone Limited (APSEZ) received 'in-principle approval' from the Vietnamese government to develop a new greenfield port, Lien Chieu, in Da Nang, Vietnam. The project, currently in its planning stage, would include container terminals and multipurpose berths, with the total investment yet to be formally announced. Furthermore, the Adani group has partnered with Vietnam Maritime Corporation, a majority stakeholder of Da Nang Port Joint Stock Company, to explore a joint venture for broader port investment. Since their bilateral relations were upgraded to a ‘Comprehensive Strategic Partnership’ in 2016, India-Vietnam strategic coordination has deepened, particularly in defence and maritime security cooperation. India is among the seven countries with which Vietnam has a ‘Comprehensive Strategic Partnership.’ However, economic ties between New Delhi and Hanoi still lag. India’s exports to Vietnam have not shown consistent growth over the last five years, partly due to Vietnam's heavy reliance on China. Nonetheless, Hanoi has been actively working to diversify its economic partnerships, evidenced by signing an FTA and Investment Protection Agreement with the EU in 2019, along with its membership in the CPTPP (Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership) and RCEP (Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership). India has taken steps to promote economic integration with Vietnam through initiatives like the India-CLMV (Cambodia, Laos, Myanmar, and Vietnam) Business Conclave and the Mekong-Ganga Cooperation Initiative. Despite these efforts, challenges such as underutilized Lines of Credit and limited physical connectivity persist, keeping economic relationships somewhat modest. New Delhi’s absence from the CPTPP and RCEP—both of which include Vietnam—further complicates matters. Currently, Vietnam is India’s 21st-largest trading partner. Indian private sector companies, particularly those in the infrastructure and energy sector can play a pivotal role in bridging the gap between expectations and the reality in India-Vietnam trade. Leading Indian pharmaceutical companies - SMS Pharmaceuticals, BDR Pharmaceutical, and Sri Avantika Contractors - are also poised to invest in Vietnam, including a $5 billion eco-industrial park. Investments and Challenges for Indian Investors Some structural constraints also exist for Indian investment in Vietnam. Indian private companies have encountered challenges with their investments in Vietnam. Although India ranks as the 25th largest investor out of 146 countries, with 410 valid projects in Vietnam, the journey hasn’t always been smooth. In 2007, Indian companies such as Essar Group and Tata Steel signed MoUs with Vietnamese counterparts but eventually withdrew due to economic and administrative hurdles. For instance, Essar cited the global economic recession and delays in government approvals, while Tata Steel faced challenges in the local business environment. Similarly, Tata Power, another Tata Group subsidiary, was given approval in 2013 to construct a second power station in Long Phú. However, delays due to Vietnam’s revised seventh Power Development Plan (PDP7) led Tata Power to withdraw in 2020, with the company receiving a refund for its investment. The Adani Group officially entered Vietnam in December 2023, opening a representative office in Hanoi. It plans to invest $10 billion in infrastructure and renewable energy over the next decade. Current projects include the Adani Phuoc Minh Wind Power and the Adani Phuoc Minh Solar Power Plant. However, these renewable energy projects have faced challenges due to insufficient power grid infrastructure, leading to reduced operational capacity. For instance, in 2022, its wind farm was required to cut output by 50% each month to prevent grid overload. While the prospects for the Lien Chieu Port in Da Nang remain bright, speculations about whether APSEZ will secure the development contract still remain. The Road Ahead Despite these hurdles, Indian conglomerates remain optimistic about investing in Vietnam. When the Vietnamese government struggled to attract investors for the Lien Chieu port—initially slated for completion in 2025 but delayed due to environmental and volume concerns—the Adani Group emerged as a promising candidate. The conglomerate also plans to develop thermal power plants in Vinh Tan III and Mong Duong II and is exploring coal supply opportunities for Vietnam. Similarly, Tata Power received approval in May 2024 to study the Long Phu 2 Thermal Power Station project, even after Vietnam faced financing challenges due to China, Japan, and South Korea halting investments in new coal-fired power plants. Expanding into foreign markets is critical for economic growth and enhancing a country’s global profile. If APSEZ is chosen to develop the Lien Chieu Port, it would significantly improve ASEAN connectivity, streamlining shipping and logistics to Mekong countries such as Laos, Cambodia, and Thailand. This venture could showcase India’s infrastructure development capabilities on a global scale, unlocking new investment opportunities across Southeast Asia.

Robert Reich: The Big Picture: How We Got Into This Mess, And How...	Donald Trump isn’t the cause of what ails America. He’s the consequence. The real causes go back four decades. Let me start with a bit of family history. During the 1950s and 1960s, my father, Ed Reich, owned a shop on the main street from which he sold women’s clothing to the wives of factory workers. This time of year reminds me of his anxious dependence on holiday sales (and in the days after Christmas, the frantic returns). Between Thanksgiving and Christmas, he needed to earn enough to pay the bills and have a sufficient sum to carry us through the first part of the following year. We weren’t rich but never felt poor, and our standard of living rose steadily through the 1950s and 1960s — as factory workers and their spouses did better and better. This was an era when the income of a single factory worker or schoolteacher or baker or salesman or mechanic was enough to buy a home, have two cars, and raise a family. FOR THREE DECADES after World War II, America created the largest middle class the world had ever seen. During those years, the earnings of the typical American worker doubled, just as the size of the American economy doubled. Over the last 40 years, by contrast, the size of the economy has more than doubled again, but the earnings of the typical American have barely budged (adjusted for inflation). Most of the gains have gone to the top. In the 1950s and 1960s, the CEOs of large corporations earned an average of about 20 times the pay of their typical worker. Now they rake in over 300 times the pay of an average worker. In the 1950s and 1960s, the richest 1 percent of Americans took home about 10 percent of the nation’s total income. Today they take home more than the bottom 90 percent put together. Then, the economy generated hope. Hard work paid off. The living standards of most people improved through their working lives. Their children enjoyed better lives than they had. Most felt that the rules of the economic game were basically fair. Although many women, Black people, and Latinos were still blocked from getting a fair share of the economy’s gains, the nation committed itself to changing this. New laws guaranteed equal opportunity, barred discrimination, promoted affirmative action, and expanded educational opportunity for all. Today, confidence in the economic system has sharply declined. Its apparent arbitrariness and unfairness have undermined the public’s faith in it. Cynicism abounds. Equal opportunity is no longer high on the nation’s agenda. As you’ll see in 'The Big Picture' video on this page, recent American history can be divided into five periods: 1946-1979, we grew together. Almost everyone gained ground. 1980-2008, the great U-turn. Most economic gains began going to the top. 2008-2010, the financial crisis. The banks were bailed out but millions of Americans lost their jobs, homes, and savings. The experience revealed the gross inequalities of wealth and power that underlay the new economy. This caused widespread disillusionment with the system. 2010-2016, anger at the establishment. Both Bernie Sanders and Donald Trump emerged as anti-establishment candidates — although Trump’s anti-establishment persona was fake (and still is). 2016-2050, the choice between oligarchy and democracy. The 2024 election represented a lurch toward oligarchy, but I believe Trump and his oligarchy will overreach, and we’ll choose a more robust democracy. *** WHEN MOST PEOPLE STOP BELIEVING that they and their children have a fair chance to make it, the tacit social contract begins to unravel. And a nation becomes susceptible to demagogues such as Donald Trump peddling the politics of hate. Many of the most vocal proponents of the 'free market' — including Elon Musk, executives of large corporations and their ubiquitous lawyers and lobbyists, denizens of Wall Street and their political lackeys, and numerous multimillionaires and billionaires — have been actively reorganizing the market for their own benefit. The consequence has been a market created by those with great wealth for the purpose of further increasing their wealth. This has resulted in ever-larger upward distributions inside the market, from the middle class, working class, and poor to a wealthy minority at the top. Because these distributions occur inside the market, they have largely escaped notice. We tend to debate only downward 'redistributions' that occur outside the market, through taxing the rich and transferring some benefits to the poor and working class. Musk and Trump want to reduce such redistributions. But the hidden upward redistributions inside the market are arguably larger. This is why it’s so important that those of us who care about social justice speak out and explain what has happened. And why it’s crucial that Democrats focus on reversing the staggering inequalities of this era and getting big money out of politics. Otherwise, the only explanation most Americans receive for what has happened comes from Trump authoritarians who falsely blame immigrants, 'socialists,' the 'deep state,' 'woke'ism, Democrats, Black people, women, and other countries. And the only agenda most Americans receive for remedying what has occurred is by backing Trump and Musk and their lurch toward fascism. My friends, the underlying issue is not the size of government. It’s whom the government is for. The fundamental choice is democracy or oligarchy.

Bangladesh Crisis And India’s Missteps, Misgivings, And Misjudgme...	Among the many lessons the Bangladesh crisis offers India, the role of public sentiment stands out as especially significant. Despite its centrality, this aspect received far less attention than it warranted. Political and foreign policy analyses were dominated by the complexity of the crisis and the institutional and policy failures it exposed. What was missing from these discussions, particularly around India’s sudden confrontation with the crisis and its scramble to recalibrate its geopolitical calculus, was an examination of what the crisis truly revealed about India’s preparedness to engage with the agency and potential of public sentiment. Thus, it is crucial to bring this perspective into focus, shedding light on what India overlooked in the unfolding crisis and the lessons that can be drawn from its missteps, mismatches, and misjudgments. India’s Missed Signals India’s failure to anticipate the growing discontent in Bangladesh under Sheikh Hasina’s rule points to a deeper issue: the assumption that foreign policy is chiefly about government-to-government relations, with public sentiment sidelined. In reality, the crisis has underscored a crucial lesson: No matter how cordial these ties may appear, they are ineffective without the backing of the domestic public. Public sentiment is not simply noise or temporary disruption; it can signal deeper, long-term trends that affect national stability. Far from being inconsequential, domestic opinion plays a vital role in regional stability, security, and diplomatic relations across South Asia. However, whether or not a misguided belief that the public lacked the coherence and understanding to impact statecraft resulted in this oversight, the outcome remains: Sheikh Hasina is now out of power, and Bangladeshis are increasingly blaming India for their suffering over the past decade under the increasingly autocratic rule of the Awami League. It is widely believed that India has supported the Hasina regime, championing it on the international stage, promptly acknowledging contested elections, minimizing concerns about its authoritarianism, and steadfastly defending its policies. India must have been prepared to avoid simplistic explanations for the current crisis, such as claims of the 'Islamization of Bangladesh' or the notion of a 'U.S. or Chinese hand in triggering a coup.' While it is true that India faced a potential redefinition of the security scenario in the region, particularly concerning Islamic radicalism or external influences, these narratives risk overshadowing the genuine public discontent arising from Sheikh Hasina’s domestic policies and the negative perceptions of India that have crystallized over more than a decade of her tenure. Rather than understanding a nuanced perspective of how Islamic fundamentalist forces within Bangladesh might exploit these popular grievances to their advantage and to India’s detriment, understanding the influence of these forces will provide India with a clearer perspective on securing its own security and fostering regional stability. Unfortunately, people-to-people ties have been badly damaged, thanks to the Indian media, which has been at the forefront of a disinformation campaign. Exaggerated assertions of a 'Hindu genocide' are damaging not only people-to-people relations but also negatively impacting India-Bangladesh diplomatic relations. Even worse, the disinformation campaign from the putative independent Indian media has remarkably strengthened the perception of India trying to legitimize the past autocratic ruler Sheikh Hasina and her regime. This perception is easy to concretize, given the preexisting public perception of India’s unwavering support for Hasina’s ruthless and tyrannical regime, despite huge international backlash, particularly from the European Union and the United States. Lessons and Future Pathways For one thing, the crisis has shown that overlooking public diplomacy in international relations comes with a cost. In this case, India’s over-reliance on traditional diplomatic channels left it vulnerable to negative public perceptions abroad. For another, countries in the South Asian region, with unresolved historical grievances and competing social cleavages, are particularly vulnerable as India can benefit from having cordial relations with the foreign public or be harmed by it. This situation thus illustrates that disregarding public opinion can result in costly mistakes and unintended consequences in a region characterized by historical tensions, diverse cultures, and sociopolitical complexities. Bridging this gap is crucial, as it directly impacts India’s national interests, regional stability, and security. Further, the evolving geopolitical landscape of South Asia underscores the importance of understanding domestic public sentiment and specific public discontent. With recent years marked by governmental instability and political crises, notable examples include the return of the Taliban in Afghanistan following the withdrawal of U.S. and NATO forces in 2021, the political crisis in Sri Lanka in 2022 that led to the ousting of President Gotabaya Rajapaksa, and the ongoing public protests against the military junta in Myanmar since 2021. If anything, these events illustrate citizens becoming more emboldened to challenge and even revolt against the government in power. Therefore, understanding the depth of public sentiment in South Asian countries is crucial for India. This awareness will enable India to anticipate potential flashpoints and adopt diplomatic nuances in its foreign policy approach. It also provides an opportunity to build trust, reduce mistrust, and foster cooperation. By paying attention to the perceptions and concerns of its neighbors, India can better navigate the intricate regional politics and adopt policies that advance its interests. In this regard, to achieve any positive outcomes in the long run, New Delhi must strive to understand these complexities without blinkers or ideological bias. Only by taking a clear-eyed and balanced approach can New Delhi hope to navigate these troubled waters effectively. Lastly, it’s high time India recognized the importance of incorporating the critical role of public diplomacy in India’s foreign policy—not as a discrete entity, but as an integral part of it. Diplomacy is no longer a domain reserved for government representatives alone. In a world increasingly shaped by social media and public opinion, overlooking the significance of public diplomacy can result in costly mistakes.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWcJ2GkwDpXjHdNrfgDu0Uzz	2024-12-28T15:56:43-08:00	
Presidential Elections In Croatia 2024: The Favorite Abstains Fro...	Croatia’s presidential election is scheduled for 29 December 2024, with 3.8 million eligible voters. The president is elected through universal and equal suffrage, via direct elections and a secret ballot, for a mandate lasting five years. The entire territory of Croatia, including polling stations abroad, forms a single electoral constituency. Eight candidates, five men and three women are competing for the presidency. The candidates running for president of Croatia are: ● Zoran Milanović (Social Democratic Party of Croatia – SDP and allies), ● Dragan Primorac (Croatian Democratic Union – HDZ and allies), ● Miro Bulj (Most - The Bridge) ● Ivana Kekin (Možemo - We Can!), ● Branka Lozo (Dom i Nacionalno okupljanje – Domino - Home and National Gathering – Domino), ● Tomislav Jonjić (independent), ● Marija Selak Raspudić(independent), and ● Niko Tokić Kartelo (independent). The presidential candidates have primarily focused their election campaigns on healthcare, education, the fight against corruption, and the migrant crisis—issues that essentially do not fall within the president’s remit—rather than addressing foreign policy topics and challenges (relations with neighbours, the EU, NATO) and the Croatian military, which do fall under the president’s competencies. The intriguing legacy of Croatian presidents Franjo Tuđman, the first president of the Republic of Croatia (1991–1999), is widely recognized for his pivotal role in establishing an independent and sovereign Croatian state. However, he is also criticised for numerous shortcomings, particularly his autocratic governance, with repercussions still evident today, especially in terms of organised crime, corruption, and the controversial process of 'tycoonisation' of the Croatian economy. Stjepan Mesić, who succeeded Tuđman as Croatia’s second president (2000–2010), faced the challenging task of addressing the political baggage left by his predecessor. Mesić demonstrated both vision and political courage, making significant strides in affirming Croatia’s position within the region and globally. He also championed the fight against organised crime and corruption, 'declaring war' on the influential intelligence underworld still present in Croatia. He managed to end Croatia’s isolation, steer it back on the path towards EU and NATO integration, and reaffirm antifascism as one of the fundamental values of modern Croatia. However, he was unable to fully eliminate the effects of Tuđman’s legacy, as many of Tuđman’s key figures remained entrenched in Croatian politics, government, economy, and the security and defence sectors, often prioritising personal or party (HDZ) agendas over national interests. Since independence, Croatia has grappled persistently with the issues of the criminalisation of politics and the politicisation of crime. The third president, Ivo Josipović (2010–2015), sought to remain non-partisan during his term in office. He avoided strategic missteps. Like other Croatian officials, Josipović was criticised for insufficiently utilising the potential of Croatia’s NATO and EU membership and for neglecting the country’s economic recovery. Nevertheless, Josipović made significant contributions to regional stability and Croatia’s reputation on the global stage. Kolinda Grabar Kitarović served as Croatia’s fourth president (2015–2020), becoming the first woman to hold the office. She strictly adhered to HDZ policies and sought to reaffirm Tuđman’s concept of Croatia as the 'bulwark of Christianity,' warning—or more accurately, fabricating—the so-called Islamic threat allegedly emanating from neighbouring Bosnia and Herzegovina. Her term can be described as 'frivolous' and brought more harm than benefit to Croatia’s standing in regional and international affairs. The fifth and current president, Zoran Milanović (2020–2025), is widely regarded as the most unconventional president in the history of the young Croatian state. He will be remembered as a 'headstrong' president who challenged dominant Western global trends, particularly the prevailing EU and NATO policies on key international issues. A defining feature of his term is his constant confrontation with Prime Minister and HDZ leader Andrej Plenković. Milanović’s role as the sole counterbalance to the autocratic governance of Plenković and HDZ can be seen as a positive contribution to Croatian statehood and society. The election favourite abstains from the campaign Zoran Milanović is the frontrunner in the presidential election. This time, he has adopted a different strategy compared to the parliamentary elections in April, where he ran as a prime ministerial candidate despite warnings from Croatia’s Constitutional Court, while constantly at odds with Prime Minister Plenković and his cabinet. Throughout the presidential campaign, Milanović has quietly carried out his presidential duties, largely refraining from engaging in day-to-day political events and avoiding confrontations through the media and social networks. In effect, Milanović is abstaining from the campaign. A similar situation occurred in Slovenia in 1997, when Milan Kučan, the favourite in the election, was re-elected as president of Slovenia despite effectively staying out of the campaign. Donald Trump’s victory in the US presidential election stripped Plenković of his sole leverage against Milanović. Trump’s election signalled a period where European policy would need to align with his approach to the war in Ukraine. While the Milanović-Plenković rivalry initially worked in Plenković’s favour, this dynamic shifted with Trump’s election as the new US president. According to analysts, Plenković had no choice but to step back from the election campaign due to the impending changes in US foreign policy, effectively ending any prospects of victory for his candidate, Dragan Primorac. So far, Primorac has struggled to emerge from Plenković’s shadow, with most Croatians viewing him not as a legitimate presidential contender but as a mere stand-in for the true candidate, Andrej Plenković. Furthermore, Plenković knowingly chose a mediocre presidential candidate, believing he could not defeat Milanović. Even in the unlikely event of a Primorac victory, Plenković’s priority was to ensure that his leadership within HDZ would remain unchallenged. This decision has frustrated HDZ members, especially the so-called intellectual wing, who argue that far better and more competent candidates, capable of defeating Milanović, were overlooked because Plenković prioritised his personal ambitions over the party’s interests. Many believe that Plenković’s self-serving and autocratic approach will ultimately secure Milanović’s re-election. Public opinion surveys suggest that Milanović is set to win more than a third of the votes in the first round of the election, with the second round expected to take place on 12 January 2025. Unlike Primorac, the other presidential candidates entered the race fully aware of their slim chances of winning, each motivated by different reasons. Ivana Kekin’s candidacy aims to strengthen support for the Možemo party, while Marija Selak Raspudić is running to regain political visibility after parting ways with Most. Without a party of her own, she seeks broader public recognition and may even consider founding her own political organisation. Conversely, Miro Bulj is running to ensure that Most does not allow Selak Raspudić to dominate their political space following her departure from the party. Public support for Ivana Kekin and Marija Selak Raspudić stands at around ten per cent, while Miro Bulj is backed by less than four per cent of voters, according to polls. Selak Raspudić was the only candidate analysts considered capable of advancing to the second round instead of Primorac, but she failed to build a strong campaign or expand her voter base to significantly boost her support. The European Public Prosecutor's Office (EPPO) reveals Croatia's struggles with corruption In the 2023 Corruption Perceptions Index, Croatia ranks at the bottom of the EU, placing 57th out of 180 countries. The European Public Prosecutor's Office (EPPO), headed by Laura Codruța Kövesi, is currently investigating the misappropriation of over 300 million euros in EU funds in Croatia, placing the country proportionally among Europe’s top offenders. Nataša Novaković[2], former head of the Conflict of Interest Commission, remarked, 'Croatia loses 10 billion dollars annually to corruption. Just imagine how much money that is and the profound impact corruption has on all of us.' During his two terms as prime minister, Andrej Plenković has dismissed more than 30 ministers, predominantly over corruption allegations, yet he has failed to take accountability for the conduct of his closest associates, whom he personally appointed. The latest 'non-paper' concerns Croatia Croatia was the last country to join the EU and is expected to be a genuine partner to all Western Balkan countries, which, in practice, is not the case. Slovenia’s Minister of Foreign and European Affairs, Tanja Fajon, revealed that Slovenia and Germany have drafted a non-paper stipulating the exclusion of vetoes and blockades tied to unresolved bilateral disputes from the pre-accession process. Analysts argue that the new non-paper is a response to Croatia’s detrimental role in the region, especially in its relations with Bosnia and Herzegovina, Montenegro, and Serbia, and that the EU is aware of this. Consequently, the latest non-paper seeks to mitigate the harmful impacts of Croatia’s actions in the Western Balkans, as the country frequently exploits its EU membership to address bilateral disputes. A parallel can be drawn with Bulgaria’s approach to North Macedonia. The proposed non-paper aims to eliminate the use of vetoes and blockades against neighbouring states over unresolved bilateral issues. Qualified majority voting (QMV) will need to be employed in decision-making throughout the EU accession process to avoid obstructions by current EU member states in the integration process of candidate countries. Croatia is haunted by the ghosts of its past Croatia’s political spectrum is defined by two extremes: HDZ and SDP. The Croatian Democratic Union (HDZ) bases its ideology on anti-communism, the independence process, and the so-called Serbian threat in Croatia. However, communism is long gone, Croatia achieved independence in 1991, and Serbs have become a stabilising factor and a litmus test for Croatia’s democracy. The greatest credit for independence belongs to the Croatian people, who overwhelmingly chose to declare an independent and sovereign state. HDZ is clearly attempting to claim sole credit for Croatia’s independence, ignoring that it stemmed from the Croatian people’s aspiration for independence, as well as historical international circumstances and context—most notably the fall of the Berlin Wall. The party must confront internal criminalisation and abandon its idealisation of Franjo Tuđman. Although Croatia is now an independent and sovereign state, HDZ continues to 'search for enemies', be it Serbs, Yugonostalgists, and more recently, the so-called Muslim threat, perceived as a danger not only to Croatia but to Europe. The projection of alleged threats has become a means of political survival. Over the past decade, HDZ has increasingly aligned itself with a Christian identity, despite being conceived as a national movement without a specifically Christian orientation. The most recent example is the warning about the so-called Hungarian (Orbán) threat, issued by Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence Ivan Anušić. Serbian President Aleksandar Vučić and Serbia remain a persistent topic in Croatian politics. Presidential candidate Ivana Kekin has gone as far as to claim that Croatia’s strategic interest is the removal of Vučić from power, with widespread support in Croatia for the protests unfolding in Serbia. The Social Democratic Party of Croatia (SDP), the successor to the former League of Communists of Croatia, has been in a prolonged state of crisis. It failed to transform into a modern left-wing political party during the transition period and remains burdened by remnants of the past. Croatia and the countries of the region need robust social democratic parties, but not in the mould of the current Croatian SDP. Similar challenges are evident in other regional countries with social democratic movements. HDZ and SDP stand as two radical examples on Croatia’s political stage, benefiting most from the ideological divide that continues to fracture the country, hinder societal healing, and prevent the state from functioning at its full capacity. Croatia is a sovereign, independent, and internationally recognised state, a full member of the UN, EU, NATO, the Eurozone, Schengen, and other international organisations. These significant achievements, accomplished in a relatively short timeframe, are deserving of respect. But does this exceptional success translate into the progress of Croatian society? The development of Croatian society has been marred by numerous challenges and does not fully reflect these accomplishments. Additional efforts are needed to foster an open, democratic society rooted in civil liberties and the rights of every Croatian citizen, irrespective of their ethnic, religious, political, or other identity.

Assad’s Fall Opens New Dynamics In Middle East – Analysis	By Dale Gavlak The overthrow of Syria’s Bashar al-Assad regime has opened the door to new dynamics in the Middle East, regional analysts say, with Turkey likely gaining superiority, Iran reeling and, with that, Iraq gaining more freedom from Iranian pressure. The Assad government in Syria spanned 54 years in power — first with the elder Hafez al-Assad and later with son Bashar of the minority Alawite community, a branch of Shiite Islam. Regional analysts say its fall marks a seismic shift in Middle East politics. Sinan Ulgen, a senior fellow with Carnegie Europe speaking during a Carnegie Middle East Center webinar on Dec. 19 in Beirut, called it a 'political earthquake' with far-reaching regional implications. 'Fundamentally, we now see the emergence of a government in Syria that maybe after 50 years really is likely to be more pro-Turkey than pro-Iran,' Ulgen said. 'This is a lasting change in the regional power constellation, which is another reason why the fall of Assad has been welcomed with such zeal in Ankara,' the capital of Turkey. Ellie Geranmayeh, the deputy head of the Middle East program at the European Council on Foreign Relations, said Israel’s attacks on Iran’s assets in Syria and its Hezbollah proxies in neighboring Lebanon, as well as Israeli military strikes in the heart of the Iranian capital, Tehran, 'present a moment of regional reckoning' for Iran. 'It [Iran] is definitely on the backfoot,' she said. 'There is now a strategic rethink ... happening in the establishment about where their policies — both at home and abroad — go from here.' Geranmayeh said prominent figures in Iran’s powerful Revolutionary Guard Corps are likely to be replaced with others, given the nation’s demoted regional status and the near demise of its so-called axis of resistance in Syria, Lebanon, Iraq and Yemen. She said that Iran likely will spin a narrative that the late Revolutionary Guard commander Qassem Soleimani’s regional project to surround Israel with a so-called ring of fire has been 'accomplished,' and that Iran will look to devise other plans to deal with the new reality it faces. Harith Hasan, a nonresident senior fellow at the Carnegie Middle East Center, said, 'Iraq is the last stronghold for Iran’s axis of resistance,' but that, too, could be changing. 'So, Iran might try to strongly defend that influence,' Hasan said. 'But as we see, the balance of power has shifted a lot, and the Iraqi government gained more freedom to be able to resist some of the pressure coming from Tehran.' Hasan said concerns about a possible Islamist-led government in Syria is giving cause for concern to its neighbors, as well as to regional political influencers Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. That, he said, 'could give Iraq new leverage' because of its long border with Syria and strong cross-border ties between the two countries. Hasan said that also may give Iraq a way out from under Iran’s influence, as developments in the region continue to unfold.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWcJ2GkwDpXjHfQnvdSqZX8l	2024-12-28T15:49:48-08:00	
US Sanctions Georgia’s Ivanishvili For ‘Undermining’ Democracy	(RFE/RL) -- The United States said it has slapped fresh sanctions on Russia-friendly billionaire Bidzina Ivanishvili, a former prime minister and the founder of the ruling Georgian Dream party, for undermining Georgia's democracy for the 'benefit of the Russian Federation.' 'Under Ivanishvili's leadership, Georgian Dream has advanced the interests of the Kremlin by derailing Georgia’s Euro-Atlantic trajectory -- in direct contradiction to what was envisioned by the Georgian people and the Georgian Constitution,' U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinkensaid in a statement on December 27. Blinken added that 'Ivanishvili and Georgian Dream's actions have eroded democratic institutions, enabled human rights abuses, and curbed the exercise of fundamental freedoms in Georgia.' 'We strongly condemn Georgian Dream's actions under Ivanishvili's leadership, including its ongoing and violent repression of Georgian citizens, protesters, members of the media, human rights activists, and opposition figures.' The new measures will block transactions involving entities owned by Ivanishvili, the statement said. According to Bloomberg News, Ivanishvili's fortune is estimated at $7.5 billion, much of it coming through metals, banking, and telecom assets in Russia during the 1990s. Prime Minister Irakli Kobakhidze called the U.S. action 'blackmail' and said it was Ivanishvili's 'reward' for protecting Georgia's national interest. However, opposition leader Giorgi Vashadze of the Unity National Movement hailed the U.S. decision, according to Georgia's Interpress news agency. 'I welcome this step from the United States and believe that we are quickly moving toward victory and will celebrate Georgia without Ivanishvili, who is the bringer of chaos and misery to this country,' he was quoted as saying. In a previous action, the United States on December 12 said it would 'prohibit visa issuance to those who are responsible for, or complicit in, undermining democracy in Georgia.' That move affected some 20 people, 'including individuals serving as government ministers and in parliament, law enforcement and security officials, and private citizens,' it said in a statement, without naming the individuals. Georgia, once a closer U.S. ally, has angered Washington and the European Union with its perceived tilt toward Russia and its violent crackdown on dissent in the Caucasus nation. The sanctions come at a crucial time, as Georgia's fate hangs in the balance -- whether it will intensify its tilt toward Moscow, return to the pro-Europe path, or remain in an environment of unrest and uncertainty. Police in Tbilisi have clashed with pro-West protesters over the past several weeks, detaining dozens and injuring scores of people who accuse the government of the Georgian Dream party of moving the country away from the European Union and closer to Moscow. The political crisis erupted after Georgian Dream claimed victory in October parliamentary elections that the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) said was marred by instances of vote-buying, double-voting, physical violence, and intimidation. The rallies intensified after a government decision last month to delay negotiations on Georgia joining the EU. The New York-based Human Rights Watch (HRW) on December 24 called for Georgian security forces to be investigated for the 'brutal police violence' against largely peaceful protesters who have taken to the streets for huge anti-government demonstrations. Georgian President Salome Zurabishvili – who has spilt with the government and backed the protesters -- on December 22 called on Georgian Dream to set a date for new parliamentary elections by December 29. 'Next week at this time I will be president,' Zurabishvili restated on December 27. U.S. Republican House member Joe Wilson wrote on X that he welcomed the new sanctions and added that he had invited Zurabishvili -- 'as the only legitimate leader in Georgia' -- to Donald Trump's presidential inauguration on January 20 'I am in awe of her courage in the face of the assault by Ivanishvili and his friends' in China and Iran, Wilson added, without mentioning Russia. Earlier this month, an electoral college dominated by Georgian Dream chose Mikheil Kavelashvili, a 53-year-old former soccer player and right-wing populist, as Georgia's next president. His inauguration is supposed to take place on December 29, though the 72-year-old Zurabishvili, whose term ends this year, has said she will not step down, setting up a potentially explosive showdown. Georgia received EU candidate status in December 2023, but ties with Brussels have been tense in recent months following the adoption in May of a controversial 'foreign agent' law pushed through parliament by Georgian Dream, which has been in power since 2012.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWcJ2GkwDpXjHUGye4ZrM_du	2024-12-28T15:48:09-08:00	
Former Taiwan Presidential Hopeful Ko Wen-Je Charged With Corrupt...	By Alan Lu Ko Wen-je, a former Taipei mayor and one-time presidential candidate, has been charged with bribery, profiteering, embezzlement and breach of trust and could face more than 28 years months in prison if convicted Ko, who won support among younger voters in a presidential election this year with promises to upend Taiwan’s political establishment, was indicted on Thursday and released on NT$30 million (US$1 million) bail on Friday after spending 113 days in detention. Ko, chairman of the Taiwan People’s Party, or TPP, has denied the charges. 'I still believe in myself. I’m not the type of person who would seek personal gain, engage in corruption, or break the law,' he told reporters outside his home on Friday. 'That said, facing challenges like this makes me realize there are areas in my life I need to reflect on.' His party called the indictment a 'politically motivated crackdown and judicial injustice.' Prosecutors allege Ko orchestrated financial benefits worth billions of New Taiwan dollars for private developers during his mayoral tenure, embezzled political donations, and accepted bribes totaling tens of millions. 'After committing these crimes, investigators found shredded notes in his office containing instructions for accomplices to leave the country and inquiries about internal financial records,' the prosecutor’s office said in a news release. 'This behavior demonstrates his attempts to evade responsibility and his poor attitude following the offenses, leading to the specific charges requested,' it added. Rise and fall Ko, a physician, rose to fame in Taiwanese politics by winning two elections for the mayor of Taipei in 2014 and again in 2022. In 2019, he founded the TPP, positioning it as an alternative to Taiwan’s dominant political parties, the Democratic Progressive Party, or DPP, and the Kuomintang, or KMT. In the 2024 presidential election, Ko and the TPP gained significant support among younger voters, presenting a fresh alternative to the establishment and posing a challenge to the dominance of the major parties. Ko has, however, stirred controversy with what critics see as an ambiguous stance on cross-straight relations. The TPP had maintained a nuanced approach, emphasizing the importance of peace and stability while advocating for Taiwan’s sovereignty. Ko criticized the DPP and KMT over their China-related policies, calling the approach of the former overly confrontational and of the latter too conciliatory. In 2015, Ko promoted a concept he called 'one family on both sides of the Strait', speaking in favour of exchanges between Taiwan and China and fostering goodwill. The ruling DPP, which takes a pro-sovereignty stance, accused Ko of 'echoing' the Chinese Communist Party’s unification rhetoric and 'undermining' Taiwan’s sovereignty. China regards Taiwan as a renegade province that must be reunited with the mainland, by force if necessary. The democratic island has been self-governing since it effectively separated from mainland China in 1949 after the Chinese Civil War.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWcJ2GkwDpXjHdrjSC3Zu_vb	2024-12-28T15:45:42-08:00	
Sinking Mike Pompeo: Tucker Carlson, Assange And Trump – OpEd	Mike Pompeo’s role in the first Trump administration as both director of the Central Intelligence Agency and US Secretary of State will be forever associated with the venom and desperation he had in targeting Julian Assange, a publisher who drove him to distraction and engendered mania. As the chief founder of WikiLeaks, Assange had regularly published troves of classified documents uncovering the messy muddles, messes and more sinister features of the US imperium. When WikiLeaks published the CIA Vault 7 files in March 2017, disclosing a suite of hacking tools used by the organisation, Pompeo became insensible. CIA operatives had thought themselves invulnerable to such publishing revelations, unlike their wobbly counterparts in the State Department and the Pentagon. The report from the CIA’s WikiLeaks Task Force might have encouraged some of the bureaucratic boffins in government to improve: WikiLeaks had, effectively 'brought to light multiple ongoing CIA failures', a fault that enabled a CIA employee to pilfer 180 gigabytes of information, constituting 'the largest data loss in CIA history'. The report goes on spelling out the need for reform. 'We must care as much about securing our systems as we care about running them if we are to make the necessary revolutionary change.' That said, all bureaucracies treat the exposure of failings through an external airing as treasonous, a compromise that rents the thick cloak of secrecy. Most importantly of all, it often shows officials as clumsy, doltish and undeserving of their position. An avenging Pompeo, flushed with spite, went on a crusade against leakers and those aiding them, seeking more serious measures against WikiLeaks. In his April 2017 speech to the Center for Strategic and International Studies, he first designated WikiLeaks a 'hostile non-state intelligence service', a classification that lowered the threshold in terms of what was permissible against a publishing outlet. Implicit was the suggestion that the United States, through its various channels, would actively and aggressively pursue the organisation as an information guerilla misfit prey to foreign powers. Pompeo even emitted a few smoke signals that Assange would not be able to avail himself of those blessed protections available under the First Amendment to the press. 'Julian Assange has no First Amendment freedoms. He’s sitting in an embassy in London. He’s not a US citizen.' In time, a seedy term intended to diminish, if not scuttle the notion of press protections, began circulating in the chatter of Espionage Land: information broker. In that most revealing Yahoo News report, published in September 2021, Pompeo and various other agency chiefs were, in the words of a former Trump national security official, 'completely detached from reality because they were so embarrassed by Vault 7'. Within months, the US intelligence community was monitoring the communications and movements of targeted WikiLeaks personnel. Audio and visual surveillance of Assange was avidly pursued. Some few months after revealing his intentions regarding WikiLeaks, Pompeo decried the emergence of a cult of 'worship' that had grown around 'Edward Snowden, and those who steal American secrets for the purpose of self-aggrandizement or money or for whatever their motivation may be'. Typical of Pompeo: the information disclosed was irrelevant to motivation, the central tenet of the US Espionage Act of 1917. Be it through means conventional or otherwise, the WikiLeaks publisher, then a political asylee in London’s Ecuadorian Embassy, was to be extradited to the United States and tried, or, short of that, abducted or assassinated. (Under a plea deal, Assange was eventually convicted under one count of conspiracy to obtain and disclose national defence information under the Espionage Act.) As the noble scribblers at Yahoo News go on to reveal at some length, using material gathered from interviews with more than 30 former US officials, various scenarios, encouraged by Pompeo, were encouraged. Discussions took place on whether it was possible to extrajudicially remove Assange from the Ecuadorian Embassy under the CIA’s operational doctrine of 'offensive counterintelligence'. Three officials also reveal that killing the publisher was discussed at various meetings as a possibility. At points, the cooling restraints on such heated lunacy were placed by various National Security Council lawyers. With the return of Donald Trump to the White House, whose campaign was aided, in no small part, by various figures sympathetic to Assange’s publishing efforts, the eyes shifted, once again, to Pompeo. Would the now leaner figure (he boasted in 2022 to shedding 90 pounds over six months) make a return, probably as Defense Secretary? Not if Tucker Carlson could help it. The former Fox News host made sure to get to Trump’s ear during the election campaign to remind him about Pompeo’s soiled résumé. In a Wall Street Journal piece this month, Carlson’s efforts at reputational sabotage are mentioned. Certain neoconservative markings of Pompeo were pointed out: a tendency towards warmongering; the obsession with Assange and a contemplated plot to assassinate him. Donald Trump Jr., the eldest son of the president-elect, also threw in his lot, warning that bringing those like Pompeo into the fold again would hamper his father’s free hand. The Make America Great Agenda was not to be cramped. The WSJ piece was hardly sensational. Carlson had publicly aired his dislike for Pompeo in an April interview on The Joe Rogan Experience podcast. As CIA director, 'he plotted the murder of Julian Assange. So he is a criminal as far as I’m concerned.' Carlson also spoke of receiving threatening calls from Pompeo’s lawyers after speaking about the JFK files on his Fox News show. 'His lawyer called me and said, you know, you should know that anyone who tells you the contents of classified documents has committed a crime.' In Carlson’s opinion, Pompeo 'pressed' the president to keep documents relevant to the CIA’s involvement in the assassination of President John F. Kennedy 'secret'. Be that as it may, Carlson’s account from Pompeo’s lawyer on discussing classified documents certainly tallies with the worldview of the secrecy goon himself. At the moment, there is much ado about Trump’s various appointments. They constitute a Flemish painting of characters: the vulgar and the violent; the self-contradictory and the untrained; the stained and the falsely pure. They are threaded by a suspicion that the National Security State has become a canker on the Republic’s foundations. They are also unlikely to dismantle it, whatever the aspirations. Keeping Pompeo out of the stable, however, could be seen as a work in progress.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWcJ2GkwDpXjHbmi2KhiYMmk	2024-12-28T15:42:51-08:00	
Malaysia: Rare Public Caning Angers Human Rights Groups	By Iman Muttaqin Yusof, Helmi Foad, and Syahrin Aziz The rare public caning of a man under Sharia laws in the religiously conservative Malaysian state of Terengganu was criticized by rights advocates as 'inhuman' and a step backward in this multi-ethnic country. Mohd Affendi Awang, a 42-year-old carpenter convicted of repeatedly committing the Islamic crime of khalwat, was punished with six strokes of a rattan cane at a local mosque on Friday. In Sharia law, khalwat refers to an offense when a man and a woman who are not related or married are caught alone together. A local sharia court found Mohd Affendi, a father of five, guilty of spending time with a woman who was not his wife or close relative on June 16, according to local media. He pleaded guilty to the offense. Islam is the dominant religion in multi-ethnic and multi-faith Malaysia. The country has a dual justice system made up of federal courts and Sharia courts that function separately. Friday’s caning was only the second public caning in Malaysia under Sharia law since 2018. Terengganu is where the Malaysian Islamic Party (PAS), a key partner in the nation’s opposition bloc, controls the state legislature. The public caning of Mohd Affendi adhered to guidelines ensuring minimal physical harm, local officials said. 'The caning was carried out by a trained individual using a moderate method that does not injure or bruise the offender’s skin or body,' Muhammad Hariz Md Yusoff, deputy president of the Malaysian Lawyers’ Association, said during a press briefing. But human rights advocates criticized the method of punishment, calling it 'inhuman and degrading.' The public caning is 'an affront to human dignity and violates a basic principle enshrined in both international law and the Federal Constitution of Malaysia,' Malaysia’s Human Rights Commission (Suhakam) said in a statement issued on Dec. 19, ahead of the carpenter’s caning. Public caning undermines the nation’s commitment to human rights, the country’s largest group of lawyers said. 'Such punishments strip individuals of their dignity,' Malaysian Bar president Mohamad Ezri Abdul Wahab said in a statement on Thursday. 'While we acknowledge the significance of upholding laws that preserve public morality, these punishments must align with Malaysia’s commitments to international standards.' Public caning is an act of utmost cruelty designed to humiliate as well as physically injure the individual, said Josef Benedict, Asia-Pacific researcher for Civicus Monitor. 'Flogging sentences is a flagrant violation of international human rights law,' Benedict told BenarNews. 'The authorities must immediately repeal the law which imposes these punishments, which constitute cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment and may amount to torture.' Rare event On Friday, a crowd of around 90 people, including state Islamic authorities, mosque officials, and selected media personnel, were allowed to observe the caning of Mohd Affendi. Dressed in a red prison uniform and a face mask, the carpenter remained composed as Sharia court officials led him into the mosque for the caning. He underwent a 20-minute health check and had the charges read to him before the two-minute caning commenced, witnesses told BenarNews. 'As soon as he arrived, he was taken to a special room,' a local reporter who witnessed the event said. 'According to standard operating procedures, the caning wasn’t carried out with the hand raised fully – only halfway.' 'There was no visible expression or sound from the offender. The cane used had a diameter of 1.2 inches and was softer than those used in civil cases,' he said. Under Terengganu’s Sharia law, repeat offenders of khalwat can face up to six strokes of the cane, fines of up to RM 5,000 ($1,114), or imprisonment of up to three years. Local Sharia courts found Mohd Affendi guilty of violating the same law three times. For his second offense, the court in February sentenced him to four cane strokes behind closed doors apart from paying a fine of RM 3,000 (U.S. $670), local media reported. Outside the mosque on Friday, more than 100 individuals, including curious onlookers and school-aged children, gathered to witness the event. Public reactions to Friday’s public caning were mixed. Some supporters said it was necessary to uphold Islamic morals. 'As a Muslim, I fully support public caning. It serves as a deterrent and a lesson for society,' resident Baharuddin Ambak told BenarNews. 'The case involves a repeat offender convicted of khalwat … [his] third offense,' Wan Mohd Yusof Wan Chik, an Islamic scholar at Universiti Sultan Zainal Abidin, told BenarNews. 'The individual is somewhat defiant, and this punishment was publicly announced due to the repeated nature of the offense.' In 2018, two women were publicly caned in Terengganu after pleading guilty to charges of attempting to have sex in a car. That public punishment at a courthouse angered human rights activists, but it was defended by PAS leaders as a lawful and necessary measure under Islamic principles. Terengganu, the country’s seventh-largest state, is a PAS political stronghold. In the last general elections, PAS secured all eight local parliamentary seats. Perikatan Nasional, a political coalition of which PAS is a member, won all 32 state assembly seats, giving it complete control over decisions related to state matters, including Sharia laws.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWcJ2GkwDpXjHf_rEVaPdTk9	2024-12-28T15:35:21-08:00	
Thailand’s Citizenship Boon – Analysis	By Bridget Welsh Without fanfare but with consequences, Thailand’s cabinet in late October approved granting citizenship to nearly half a million stateless people. It is Southeast Asia’s governance decision of the year – empowering 335,000 long-term immigrants and members of ethnic minorities as well as 142,000 of their children who were born in Thailand. The decision makes sense. It includes the new citizens in Thailand’s revised tax system set to be implemented next year (allowing for more contributions to the social welfare programs), expands the workforce and helps reduce the demographic pressures from an aging population. It also addresses a long-standing security problem. By providing legal documentation for settler communities, the decision reduces illicit activity and corruption concentrated around illegal documentation. Thailand is being forward-looking through grasping that tackling corruption involves reducing opportunities for corruption, especially that which targets vulnerable communities. This decision also allows security personnel to focus their activities on illegal human trafficking and the region’s growing scam problem. Over half a million Thais have been victimized by cybercrime scamssince March 2022, with Thailand bordering scam centers in Myanmar and Cambodia. Most important of all, the decision builds a humanitarian approach towards statelessness. Last January, Thailand expanded universal health insurance for stateless communities, putting in place healthcare for more than 500,000 people and in the process strengthening public health. Before the recent citizenship decision, around half of the stateless children were also able to access education. Southeast Asia has 50% of the world’s stateless population. The largest number of undocumented persons is in Malaysia, estimated to be over one million and concentrated in Sabah. Thailand, with her expansion of rights, has been a role model globally for the treatment of stateless persons. Thailand’s recent citizenship decision may have been unanticipated in its timing and scope, but it has been in the works for more than 20 years. In 2001, King Bhumibol, Thailand’s monarch from 1946 to 2016, gave a speech that called for equality for those who had lived in the country for a long time. His moral authority opened up discussions on reframing citizenship more inclusively, created space for civil society that is active in addressing discrimination against stateless communities, and created momentum in the expansion of rights. Under Thaksin Shinawatra’s government, from 2001 until 2006, there were policy shifts that expanded the rights of stateless people, especially children. Yet, it was the relentless activism of civil society that has been critical in pushing for these rights. Mindsets and practices took time to change. Two earlier cabinet decisions, in 2010 and 2021, set out criteria for inclusion and signaled wider pathways for citizenship. The decision this year is the most progressive. Those who would benefit from the cabinet’s decision include long-term immigrants who settled in Thailand from 1984 to 1999 and from 2005 to 2011, children of ethnic minorities in Thailand and children born in Thailand to persons without registration status. This includes minority settlers from Myanmar and hill tribe communities – among the most vulnerable and discriminated. Labor migrants who have been in Thailand during these time windows can also qualify. The rest of Southeast Asia should learn from Thailand’s forward-looking example. It is possible to resolve a large group of stateless people sustainably. Leadership can make a difference, especially when it listens to civil society. A lens that focuses on children can help change mindsets, as does an appreciation that inclusion can bring broader societal benefits in public health and a stronger economy. The path ahead will still be challenging for Thailand’s stateless people, who have to apply to the Ministry of Interior. It is not clear how long this process will take. Civil society activists worry it still may take years for individual decisions to be finalized. Yet, for the communities who now have a pathway to greater security and inclusion, a reason to celebrate finally came.

EU–Japan Security Partnership Shows Promise But Lacks Action – An...	By Paul O’Shea In early November 2024, Japan and the European Union signed a security and defence partnership. Amid a flurry of other events — North Korean troops in Ukraine, the US election, another looming trade war and Germany’s political and economic crises — this agreement may have gone unnoticed. Even as the world speeds up, EU–Japan relations continue to progress according to their own slow and incremental logic, as if from another era. The November 2024 agreement reflects this dynamic — it is the next step following the 2018 Economic and Strategic Partnership Agreement. Both agreements promise deeper cooperation across a wide range of economic, social and security issues. But for now, they remain too vague and exploratory to keep pace with accelerating geopolitics. The 2018 agreement was concluded in a period of geopolitical uncertainty. The European Union was dealing with the fallout from Brexit while struggling to manage relations with the first Trump administration. Japan, under Abe, was managing Trump in its own way while building partnerships to hedge against US decline and growing isolationism. Six years later, the outlook for both parties is even bleaker. The European Union successfully managed Brexit but right-wing populism continues to rise across the continent. Trump’s return threatens the global economic and security order underpinning European prosperity. In Washington, the so-called ‘prioritisers’ — those that favour focusing on China while reducing involvement in other regions — are coming to power, leaving Europe to consider deterring Russia without US support. Japan’s position, though less dire, remains uncertain. Trump’s pick for Commerce Secretary, Howard Lutnick, has previously targeted Japan for tariffs. Even if Japan avoids the coming Trump tariffs, his re-election sends an ominous signal to US allies. While Japan can take comfort in the fact that the United States needs its support to contain China, four more years of Trump means that nothing can be taken for granted. Looking beyond the next four years, US transactionalism and isolationism can no longer be dismissed as a blip. This is clearly a trend. The 2018 agreement provided a broad framework to formalise cooperation across a range of issue areas, including trade, climate change, energy and human rights. While two structurally similar advanced economies will struggle to achieve massive gains from trade, bilateral trade and investment flows have increased significantly. Non-tariff barriers remain an obstacle but these are expected to fade as the two economies become more deeply interconnected. The 2018 strategic partnership aimed to lay a foundation for future cooperation, focusing on ‘safe’ areas such as climate change. Since then, cooperation has deepened and moved into ‘harder’ sectors. Japanese former prime minister Kishida attended the NATO summits in 2022, 2023 and 2024, while the European Union and Japan implemented a new strategic dialogue at the foreign minister level. In November 2023 and again in 2024, former vice-president of the European Commission Josep Borrell met with Japanese Minister of Foreign Affairs Iwaya Takeshi, and it was at this latter meeting that the Defense Partnership was formalised. This new agreement highlights a wide range of potential fields of cooperation — just as the 2018 agreement did. It includes important new steps, most notably increasing maritime security cooperation, including proposed joint exercises and port calls. While neither China nor Russia are mentioned, the agreement explicitly links the security of Europe with that of the Indo-Pacific’ and vice-versa. The agreement also calls for ‘exploring the opportunity’ to build maritime capacity in third-party Indo-Pacific states among other initiatives. But there lies a key issue — much of the agreement is ‘exploratory’. The text is littered with references to ‘exploring the possibility of cooperation’ in various fields. Given the acute crisis that US alliance partners face today, the language is vague and unhurried. The progress since 2018 is evident but pales in comparison to the dramatic geopolitical shifts in the same period. If there was a time to move from ‘exploration’ to ‘cooperation’, it is now. The shared interests are obvious — both parties have built their prosperity on the rules-based international order. They also share a growing fear of the authoritarian challenge posed by China and Russia, and of the threat to the most basic norms of the post-World War II international order. But despite these shared values and fears, a rapid response seems beyond their reach for several reasons. Kishida’s reaction to Ukraine was lauded, promising major increases in military spending, circumventing restrictions on arms exports and seeking to develop ties with NATO. But even at the time, there were questions about where the money would come from. The October election left the ruling Liberal Democratic Party without a coalition majority, adding political constraints to the existing fiscal and demographic challenges. Meanwhile in Europe, substantial deepening of security ties with Japan would require the unlikely unanimity of member states — a feat that is difficult to achieve given their divergent interests, particularly when it comes to issues that, if only tangentially, involve China. The trajectory and pace of EU–Japan security relations indicate that neither side is currently in a position to be a major geopolitical player outside their immediate neighbourhood. This may change, especially if the China–Russia entente deepens or further significant events occur. But the new agreement, exploratory as it is, marks the limits of possible cooperation.

Afghanistan: Now It Can Be Told, After All The Harm Has Been Done...	This week, the New York Times reported that the U.S. government made war in Afghanistan while helping to 'recruit, train and pay for lawless bands of militias that pillaged homes and laid waste to entire communities.' Those militias 'tortured civilians, kidnapped for ransom, massacred dozens in vendetta killings and razed entire villages, sowing more than a decade of hatred toward the Afghan government and its American allies.' Written by a former Kabul bureau chief for the Times, the article appeared under a headline saying that 'U.S.-backed militias' in Afghanistan were 'worse than the Taliban.' Now they tell us. The new reporting made me think of a chapter in my book War Made Invisible titled 'Now It Can Be Told.' Here’s an excerpt: * * * Timing is crucial in media and politics — and never more so than when war is at stake. It’s completely unsatisfactory for journalists to toe the war line for years and then finally report, in effect: Now it can be told — years too late. Virtually the entire U.S. media establishment gave full-throated support to the U.S. attack on Afghanistan in early October 2001. Twenty years later, many of the same outlets were saying the war was ill-conceived and doomed from the start. Immediately after the invasion of Iraq began in March 2003, with very few exceptions, even the mainstream news organizations that had been expressing trepidation or opposition swung into line to support the war effort. Two decades later, many of the same media outlets were calling the invasion of Iraq the worst U.S. foreign-policy blunder in history. But such framing evades the structural mendacity that remains built into the military-industrial complex, with its corporate media and political wings. War is so normalized that its casualties, as if struck by acts of God, are routinely viewed as victims without victimizers, perhaps no more aggrieved than people suffering the consequences of bad weather. What American policymakers call mistakes and errors are, for others, more aptly described with words like catastrophes and atrocities. Attributing the U.S. wars to faulty judgment — not premeditated and hugely profitable aggression — is expedient, setting the policy table for supposed resolve to use better judgment next time rather than challenging the presumed prerogative to attack another country at will. When the warfare in Afghanistan finally ended, major U.S. media — after avidly supporting the invasion and then the occupation — were awash in accounts of how the war had been badly run with ineptitude or deception from the White House and the Pentagon. Some of the media analysis and commentaries might have seemed a bit sheepish, but news outlets preferred not to recall their prior support for the same war in Afghanistan that they were now calling folly. A pattern of regret (not to say repentance or remorse) emerged from massive U.S. outlays for venture militarism that failed to triumph in Afghanistan and Iraq, but there is little evidence that the underlying repetition compulsion disorder has been exorcized from America’s foreign-policy leadership or major news media, let alone its political economy. On the contrary: the forces that have dragged the United States into an array of wars in numerous countries still retain enormous sway over foreign and military affairs. For those forces, over time, shape-shifting is essential, while the warfare state continues to rule. The fact that strategies and forms of intervention are evolving, most conspicuously in the direction of further reliance on airpower rather than ground troops, makes the victims of the USA’s firepower even less visible to American eyes. This presents a challenge to take a fresh look at ongoing militarism and insist that the actual consequences for people at the other end of U.S. weaponry be exposed to the light of day — and taken seriously in human terms. Despite all that has happened since President George W. Bush vowed in mid-September 2001 to 'rid the world of the evil-doers,' pivotal issues have been largely dodged by dominant U.S. media and political leaders. The toll that red-white-and-blue militarism takes on other countries is not only a matter of moral principles. The United States is also in jeopardy. That we live in one interdependent world is no longer debatable. Illusions about American exceptionalism have been conclusively refuted by the global climate emergency and the Covid-19 pandemic, along with the ever-present and worsening dangers of thermonuclear war. On a planet so circular in so many ways, what goes around comes around.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWeSAohndYMaVAp3P8pU0lWd	2024-12-27T17:12:37-08:00	
US Share Of Electric And Hybrid Vehicle Sales Increased In Second...	The share of electric and hybrid vehicle sales in the United States increased in the second quarter of 2024 (2Q24) after a slight decline in 1Q24. Combined U.S. sales of hybrid vehicles, plug-in hybrid electric vehicles, and battery electric vehicles (BEVs) increased from 17.8% of total new light-duty vehicle (LDV) sales in 1Q24 to 18.7% in 2Q24, according to estimates from Wards Intelligence. This slight increase in the electric and hybrid vehicle market share was driven primarily by hybrid electric vehicle (HEV) sales, which increased by 30.7% year over year. Hybrid sales accounted for 8.6% of the total light-duty market in 1Q24 and increased to 9.6% in 2Q24. Plug-in hybrid electric vehicle sales increased slightly from 1.7% to 2.0% of the total light-duty market year over year. Following slower growth in 1Q24 compared with the previous year, in 2Q24, BEV sales accounted for 7.1% of the U.S. LDV market, a similar share to 2Q23. Luxury electric vehicles continued to sell well, accounting for 32.8% of total luxury sales in 2Q24. U.S. luxury vehicle sales accounted for 16.6% of the total light-duty market in 2Q24, while luxury vehicles made up 73.8% of total battery electric sales, 8.3% of hybrid sales, and 29.2% of plug-in hybrid sales. The average transaction price of BEVs in the United States, not including any government incentives, decreased from $57,405 in January 2024 to $56,371 in June 2024, according to data from Cox Automotive. BEV transaction prices were 21.1% higher than the overall average light-duty vehicle transaction price in January 2024 and 15.9% higher in June 2024. Although Tesla is still the leading manufacturer in the electric vehicle market, it no longer holds the majority share of electric vehicle sales. Tesla’s market share accounted for 48.9% of the total electric vehicle market in 2Q24, decreasing to less than 50% of the light-duty vehicles sold for the first time since 4Q17. The sales have shifted to legacy manufacturers such as Ford, Chevrolet, Hyundai, and Kia. Ford accounted for 8.0% of sales in the electric vehicle market in 2Q24, the second-largest share, driven by the sales of the Mustang Mach-E and F-150 Lightning. Chevrolet’s sales shifted to its newly introduced electric Blazer, Silverado, and Equinox models following the manufacturer’s decision to stop producing the Bolt, a decision that decreased overall sales in 1Q24. BEV manufacturers are producing vehicles both domestically and globally. According to estimates from Wards Intelligence, 74.4% of electric vehicles sold in the United States were manufactured in North America in 2Q24 compared with 78.7% in 2Q23. A year-over-year comparison shows that the total share of electric vehicles sold in the United States and manufactured in South Korea increased from 8.0% in 2Q23 to 12.2% in 2Q24 while the share of electric vehicles manufactured in Japan increased from 2.4% to 7.2%. To qualify for the clean vehicle tax credits in the Inflation Reduction Act, manufacturers must comply with domestic content requirements for final assembly, battery components, and critical mineral inputs that extend beyond simply manufacturing in North America. Therefore, not all vehicles classified as manufactured in North America qualify for this credit.

What Lies Ahead For Switzerland: An Economic Outlook For 2025 – A...	By Samuel Jaberg, Jessica Davis Plüss, Anand Chandrasekhar, Matthew Allen, and Reto Gysi von Wartburg The Swiss economy has proven to be resilient against global economic volatility and inflationary pressures in recent times. In 2025 the economy is expected to grow at a slightly faster pace but remain below its potential. The Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), for example, has raised its growth outlook for Swiss gross domestic product (GDP) from 1.4% to 1.5% for the coming year. Meanwhile, the Swiss National Bank (SNB) faces the ongoing challenge of balancing controlling inflation with supporting economic growth. Interest rates may remain relatively low, though the central bank may adjust its monetary policy stance depending on global trends and domestic inflationary pressures. A strong labour market, particularly in high-skill sectors, such as finance, pharmaceuticals, and technology, will likely support consumption levels. Inflation is expected to be moderate, providing some relief to Swiss households after a period of rising costs. In many industries wage increases decided for 2025 amount to 1.7-2% and lie above inflation, the Swiss union Unia has reported. This should lead to an actual improvement in real wages. Let us have a closer look at six Swiss key industries: 1. Swiss pharma braces for US regulatory uncertainty and global price pressure The two big Swiss pharmaceutical companies, Roche and Novartis, will look to gain momentum in 2025 after corporate restructurings. In November, Novartis lifted its 2023-2028 sales forecast in a sign of confidence after top-selling drugs exceeded quarterly growth targets. Roche is hoping a suite of new weight-loss drug candidates will show positive results in 2025 and help cement its place in what analysts predict could be a $100 billion (CHF88 billion) market in ten years. Although it is a newcomer to obesity, Chief Executive Officer Thomas Schinecker told reporters in July he believed Roche could bring the new drugs to market 'much faster' than investors expect. The companies’ optimism faces headwinds though. Donald Trump’s return to the White House could lead to sweeping changes on drug prices, public health, and biotech funding in the industry’s largest market. Any attempts by Trump to expand drug pricing negotiations agreed under Biden will likely face strong pushback from industry. Pressure on drug prices is mounting beyond the United States. Even at home in Switzerland, companies will be under more scrutiny to justify the price tag for newly launched therapies amid rising healthcare costs. The Swiss pharma and biotech companies are also bracing for disruptions to global trade if the US and China continue to isolate each other. The life sciences industry, which makes up 40% of Swiss exports, relies heavily on global cooperation. Any move to cut off one part of the world from the supply chain could create hurdles for innovation in the sector. 2. Food prices are likely to stabilise in 2025 – except chocolate The continued rise in prices of raw materials like coffee and cocoa have put Swiss food companies in a bind. Six months after former Nestlé CEO Mark Schneider referred to food prices rises as a '50-year event', he was no longer with the company. Nestlé’s sales were down, and the general feeling was that the company had scared away inflation-hit shoppers who had gone on to buy cheaper products. This dent in the customer base will be hard to turn around with new Nestlé CEO Laurent Freixe warning of a 'soft demand environment' during the release of third quarter results this October. The year 2025 will be all about trying to bring cost-conscious consumers back. This task will be a painful one. Food companies will have to absorb the rise in prices of raw materials without passing them on to consumers. This will mean serious cost-cutting. In November, Nestlé announced that it planned to cut CHF2.5 billion in costs by 2027. The food industry is also getting rid of surplus capacity. For example, the Hero Group is closing its jam factory in Lenzburg, Switzerland, and moving production to its existing facility in Murcia, Spain. Despite cost-cutting measures, fans of Swiss chocolate will continue to have to pay more for their treats. Recent record cocoa prices will not be fully absorbed by chocolate manufacturers like Lindt & Sprüngli. Swiss chocolate firms can therefore expect stagnation or even decline in sales volumes in 2025 and loss of market share to cheaper competition who use less cocoa in their products. 3. Financial sector on its way to recovery The Swiss financial sector appears to have rebounded from the shock collapse of Credit Suisse last year. A stock market revival has inflated the assets of the richest people in the world, which is good news for Switzerland’s storied wealth management industry. But uncertainties and storm clouds continue to lurk, never far away. The Credit Suisse saga is far from over, despite the apparent seamless integration into its larger rival UBS. A parliamentary report into the debacle will likely spark a fresh regulatory shake-up next year. The Swiss government has already proposed a raft of measures, including extra capital requirements for banks and increased power for the financial regulator. Banks and asset managers are also campaigning against further regulations surrounding sustainable finance as they face increased pressure from non-governmental organisations. The Swiss stock market, under the new leadership of new CEO Bjørn Sibbern, will be watching how markets react to the new Trump presidency from next year. And the cloud of money laundering refuses to budge over the Swiss banking sector. Just as UBS was cleared of allegations relating to the Bulgarian mafia towards the end of the year, private bank Lombard Odier was hit with money laundering charges by Swiss prosecutors. 4. Swiss watchmakers are no longer celebrating After three years of post-Covid euphoria, the Swiss watchmaking industry returned to a more normal level in 2024. Watch exports fell by nearly 3% in value terms (provisional figures), due to sharp drops in demand in China (-26% at the end of November) and Hong Kong (-20%). No fundamental improvement is expected for 2025, however. 'The lack of appetite among Chinese consumers for luxury products is the main reason for this complicated situation for the industry,' Jean-Philippe Bertschy, a watchmaking expert at Bank Vontobel, told SWI swissinfo.ch. Other markets have also begun to show negative trends in recent months. The downward trend in the number of watches exported and the consolidation of strong brands is likely to continue. 'The top-of-the-range brands that offer high-quality, emotional products with a strong connection to their customers will continue to gain market share. It promises to be a very difficult year for the other brands, and for all the industry’s suppliers,' said Bertschy. 5. A gloomy outlook for the machinery industry For the second year in a row, the Swiss machinery, electrical equipment and metals industry (MEM industries) saw sales fall in 2024 (-4% for the first nine months of the year). The industry’s umbrella association, Swissmem, blames this economic weakness on falling demand from the European Union, and Germany in particular. Germany and its crisis-hit automobile sector is a major source of concern for Swiss subcontractors. Exports to Switzerland’s biggest sales market fell by 8.4% in the first nine months of the year. A recovery is not expected any time soon. 'In the best-case scenario, we can expect a stabilisation next year,' said Stefan Brupbacher, director of Swissmem, in a statement in mid-November. 'On the other hand, if a ‘trade war’ were to break out between the United States, China and the EU, this would drag the Swiss tech industry, which exports 80% of its products, even further down.' 6. Swiss tourism stabilises The Swiss tourism sector had a very good year in 2024, with overnight stays expected to hit a new record of almost 47 million (up 14% on 2023). The coming months also look promising. The KOF Swiss Economic Institute is forecasting External linkgrowth in overnight stays of around 0.8% this winter. Travellers from the United States should continue to benefit from the strong dollar. During summer this year, the number of overnight stays recorded for tourists from North America rose by almost 300,000 (+14%), following an increase of 26% in 2023. Despite the weakening of the euro and the ongoing recession in Germany, the KOF expects overnight stays by European tourists to grow by 2% this winter. Meanwhile, local tourists are likely to 'remain the most important group of visitors,' it says, even if a further decline is expected (-0.5%) in favour of long-distance travel. As far as the 2025 summer season is concerned, the KOF is forecasting an increase of 0.2% in overnight stays. While the European market is expected to remain stable, uncertainty reigns about China. Despite slow growth, total overnight stays by Chinese guests are only expected to reach 60% of the pre-Covid level (2019).	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWeSAohndYMaVMw3SOG_ZyYT	2024-12-27T16:55:43-08:00	
Chinese Soft Power Strategy In Bangladesh – Analysis	Introduction What are the key elements of the Chinese ‘soft power’ strategy in Bangladesh? How has China's soft power strategy influenced Bangladesh's economic, social and cultural landscape? These questions are addressed in this article. On March 2, 2023, Brand Finance – the world's most famous consultancy agency – published a report on Global Soft Power Index (GSPIS) in London which examined the brands of 121 nation-states. The report reveals that among the top 20, Western countries are much ahead in pursuing soft power compared to South Asian or African countries. Soft power is a term used in international relations to describe a country's ability to influence others through cultural appeal, values, and diplomacy rather than coercion or force. Coined by political scientist Joseph Nye in the late 1980s, soft power contrasts with 'hard power', which involves military might and economic sanctions. Soft power involves the power of attraction in international politics. Nye developed the concept of soft power in a Cold War context. The concept of soft power refers to the ability to achieve desired outcomes through attraction rather than coercion or monetary incentives. Since the end of the Cold War, the concept of soft power has evolved over time into a broader concept. Bangladesh-China Trade The magnitude of the Bangladesh–China relationship has assumed a phenomenal shape in the post- Cold War era. Bangladesh–China relations started to grow in the post-1990s on wider issues. Notably, China became a key partner of Bangladesh in every dimension of bilateral ties. Historically, numerous Chinese monks, scholars, and traders traveled to Bengal as early as the Qin dynasty. Bangladesh and China have maintained a longstanding friendly relationship. Trade between the two nations is a significant aspect of their bilateral cooperation, with China being Bangladesh's largest trading partner and Bangladesh ranking as China's second-largest trading partner in South Asia. In 2019, their bilateral trade volume amounted to $18.33 billion. The import from China constitutes 34% of the total imports of Bangladesh. China is a key strategic trading partner for Bangladesh. The Chinese government has announced a zero-tariff policy for 97% of Bangladeshi exports. Chinese Foreign Direct Investment Chinese Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) in Bangladesh has grown significantly over the years, becoming a cornerstone of the bilateral relationship between the two countries. Infrastructure Development: Significant Chinese investments have gone into large-scale projects such as the Padma Bridge, Chattogram and Mongla seaports, and power generation facilities. China has invested in SEZs, notably the Bangabandhu Industrial Park, to promote manufacturing and exports. Investments in coal, solar, and other power projects have been substantial, helping to meet Bangladesh’s growing energy demand. Chinese firms are also exploring opportunities in Bangladesh’s burgeoning tech and fintech sectors. Chinese firms have shown interest in partnering with local industries in Bangladesh's leading export sector. Chinese FDI has been invested in industries such as garments, telecommunications, energy, manufacturing, infrastructure, leather, and chemicals. Between 2016-22, Chinese state-owned and private companies invested nearly US$26 billion in Bangladesh. In 2022, Beijing emerged as the country’s largest FDI provider as its investments topped almost US$1 billion—a 30 percent increase from US$700 million in 2021. Belt and Road Initiative The Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) has become a prominent feature of the current global economic system. The estimated cost of the BRI is approximately $2.1 trillion, impacting on the lives of around 80% of the world’s population. In September 2013, Chinese President Xi Jinping introduced the One Belt and One Road Initiative (OBOR). Initially, BRI garnered limited attention, but a decade later, its English name evolved into the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI). Today, it stands as one of the world’s most ambitious and widely debated development projects. To date, 148 countries and several international organizations have signed memorandums of understanding (MoUs) with China regarding the BRI, which China promotes as an open and inclusive platform for global cooperation. The initiative comprises two main components: the Silk Road Economic Belt and the 21st Century Maritime Silk Road. The Economic Belt focuses on developing and expanding land routes for trade and connectivity across Europe, the Middle East, Central Asia, and Asia. The Maritime Road, on the other hand, aims to enhance sea routes linking East Asia, South Asia, the Middle East, and Africa. The BRI is guided by five core priorities: policy coordination, facilities connectivity, unimpeded trade, financial integration, and people-to-people connections. In 2017, the Communist Party of China formally incorporated the advancement of the BRI into its constitution. The Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) previously estimated that the BRI would generate an additional $1 trillion in global funding between 2017 and 2027, while the World Bank reported that BRI-related investments, including energy projects, totaled approximately $575 billion between 2013 and 2018. While African nations have praised the BRI, countries like India and the United States have criticized it, accusing China of employing ‘debt-trap diplomacy’ to seize control of assets in cases where nations fail to repay loans. Beyond defense and economic cooperation, Bangladesh and China maintain multifaceted bilateral relations encompassing cultural and educational exchanges, sports, exhibitions, scholar and student exchanges, and trade delegations. The BRI is often negatively portrayed in the Bangladeshi press. Public Diplomacy The Pandemic transformed and reshaped the structure of the geo-political landscape of the planet. Vaccine diplomacy is a subset of global health diplomacy and refers to the use and delivery of vaccines to achieve a country’s global health goals and foreign policy objectives. China's vaccine diplomacy started in July 2020 when the first Chinese vaccine trial outside China commenced in Brazil. In December 2020, Egypt became one of the first countries to accept vaccines from Chinese state-owned vaccine producer Sinopharm. Beijing targeted mainly low and medium-income countries for early vaccine deliveries. It has supplied vaccines to EU member Hungary and EU candidate countries Serbia and Turkey. China was the first country to deliver vaccines to COVID-19 hard-hit Southeast Asia, having donated more than 7 million doses across nine ASEAN countries by July 2021. China also supplied the Covid 19 vaccine to the South Asian Countries including Bangladesh. Confucious Institutes & Cultural Engagement The establishment of Confucius Institutes since 2004 to promote the understanding of Chinese language and culture is a striking example of how the Chinese government promotes soft power through cultural means. In Bangladesh, there are several Confucius Institutes dedicated to promoting Chinese language and culture. Established in 2016 as a collaboration between Yunnan University, China, and the University of Dhaka, the Confucius Institute offers Chinese language courses, cultural exchange programs, and research opportunities to strengthen ties between China and Bangladesh. Inaugurated in 2006 in partnership with Yunnan University, the Confucius Institute at North South University provides Chinese language instruction, cultural activities, and resources to foster understanding of Chinese culture in Bangladesh. Officially inaugurated in November 2023, Shanto Mariam-Honghe Confucius Classroom is the first Confucius Classroom in Bangladesh, established to further promote Chinese language education and cultural exchange. These institutions play a significant role in enhancing educational and cultural exchanges between Bangladesh and China. Scholarships and Exchange Programs China has become a popular destination for Bangladeshi students pursuing higher education, particularly in fields like medicine, engineering, business, and technology. This growth is driven by China's globally recognized universities, affordable tuition fees, and government scholarships, including the Chinese Government Scholarship (CGS) and funding under the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI). The presence of Confucius Institutes in Bangladesh also encourages students to study in China by offering language training and cultural orientation. With opportunities to engage in cultural exchange and research collaborations, Bangladeshi students play a key role in strengthening bilateral relations and enhancing people-to-people ties between the two countries. The Skills and Training Enhancement Project (STEP) between Bangladesh and China's Yunnan Province is a leading example of Sino-Bangladesh partnership. Under this initiative, Chinese expert trainers actively assist their Bangladeshi counterparts in strengthening their abilities in a variety of areas, such as student exchange, teacher development, and information sharing. Research Centers & Collaboration The Centre for China Studies (CCS) at the University of Dhaka stands as a collaborative research institution, committed to implementing the spirit of the 2023 Johannesburg Summit between the top leaders of China and Bangladesh. The establishment of the CCS is not only an affirmation of the profound friendship between Bangladesh and China but also an important milestone in the educational and academic exchanges and cooperation between the two sides. The vision of the CCS is to provide a 'valuable platform for Bangladeshi scholars to gain an in-depth understanding of Chinese culture, history and society, which is of great significance for Bangladesh to realize Smart Bangladesh and Vision 2041'. A research center namely, the China-South Asia Center for Socio-cultural Studies (CSCSS) is setup at North South University under the South Asian Institute of Policy and Governance (SIPG). CSCSS aims to emerge as a collaboration hub dedicated to fostering mutual understanding, cultural exchange, and academic collaboration between China and South Asia. The center serves as a bridge between these dynamic regions, aiming to promote socio-cultural harmony and sustainable development through comprehensive research and community engagement Soft Power: A Comparative Analysis An attempt is made here to compare and discuss China’s soft power with that of some regional and global powers. India is a South Asian country and the world's most populous nation, with over 1.4 billion people. India is known for its cultural diversity, rich heritage, and landmarks like the Taj Mahal. The country has a fast-growing economy, driven by sectors like IT, manufacturing, and agriculture. Indian television shows, music, and literature have gained popularity abroad. A comparative analysis of Chinese and Indian Soft Power reveal that China’s soft power strategy is more cohesive than that of India. China excels in cultural initiatives, fostering people-to-people exchanges, attracting international students from various backgrounds, and presenting itself as a progressive and resilient economy. In contrast, India holds an advantage in projecting an image of a nation with a dynamic civil society and a robust democratic framework The U.S. leads in soft power with global cultural dominance through Hollywood, technology, and democratic values. China leverages economic diplomacy, the Belt and Road Initiative, and cultural programs to enhance influence, especially in the Global South. India capitalizes on its rich cultural heritage, spirituality, and growing IT and education sectors. The UK relies on its historical legacy, English language, and prestigious educational institutions, though its influence has slightly diminished post-Brexit. Japan is globally known for its technological advancements and democratic nation. Japan is home to some of the most innovative and renowned technology companies in the world, each contributing uniquely to global industries. Several companies such as Sony, Toyota, Panasonic, Toshiba, Hitachi and Canon symbolize Japan’s commitment to innovation, quality, and technological progress, earning a worldwide prominent with its soft power. Nuclear diplomacy in South Asia is an example of soft power development. Both India and Pakistan are nuclear powers in the South Asian region. Thus, every nation employs distinct soft power strategies, tools and resources that reflect its cultural, social, economic, and political contexts. In 2007, Chinese President Hu Jintao told the 17th Congress of the Chinese Communist Party that they needed to invest more in soft power, and this continued under President Xi Jinping. China’s success story in the economic domain was prominently noticeable when its GDP growth rate averaged 10.5% between 2001 and 2010. Yet, China ‘lags behind the United States in overall attractiveness in most parts of the world, including Asia’ (Nye 2021, p. 205). China is an advocate of multilateralism at the global stage. As a result, the Asian Infrastructure and Investment Bank (AIIB) stands as a significant milestone for Chinese multilateralism, representing China’s successful endeavors to establish a complementary institution to the World Bank. China is a member of The BRICS includes 9 countries - Brazil, China, Egypt, Ethiopia, India, Iran, Russian Federation, South Africa, United Arab Emirates. Another Chinese example of multilateralism is the creation of Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO). The SCO is a permanent intergovernmental international organization established on June 15, 2001, in Shanghai (PRC) by the Republic of Kazakhstan, the People's Republic of China, the Kyrgyz Republic, the Russian Federation, the Republic of Tajikistan and the Republic of Uzbekistan. In Africa, only South Africa and Nigeria consistently display the regional power feature of an Afrocentric foreign policy posture woven around sufficient material preponderance and strong soft power influence. In terms of territory, resource and population, Nigeria is a large country in Africa. China has made huge hard and soft power investments in African states like Nigeria. Conclusion This article argues that China has had mixed success with its soft power strategy in Bangladesh. It explained a few weaknesses or pitfalls of China’s soft power image in Bangladesh: negative portrayal of the Chinese BRI, debt trap discourse and cultural barrier; especially through the Chinese Mandarin language. China's soft power strategy in Bangladesh focuses on fostering goodwill and strengthening bilateral ties through cultural, social and economic initiatives. Key elements include public diplomacy, such as promoting language and cultural exchange through Confucius Institutes, and educational scholarships for Bangladeshi students. Economically, China leverages its BRI to finance major infrastructure projects and deepen trade relations, further enhanced by offering tariff-free access to Bangladeshi products. China emphasizes people-to-people connections through exchange programs and development assistance, portraying itself as a reliable partner in Bangladesh’s growth. This strategy complements China’s hard power investments, aiming to solidify its influence in the South Asian region amid competition from other regional and global powers like India, Japan and the U.S. Chinese soft power in Bangladesh is indeed a shared interest rather than a debt trap.

Is Peace Possible Today? – OpEd	In this Christmas season, with its connotations of peace and goodwill to all people, and the New Year, when one traditionally comes up with ‘resolutions’ for the year ahead, with the intention of compensating for mistakes made during the past year, and of initiating creative projects for the future, one has to ask: is all of this just Heideggerian ‘idle talk,’ or is peace a realistic possibility? This seems to be an easy question to answer. Despite President-elect Donald Trump’s repeated assurance that he would bring about an end to the war in Ukraine, it is by no means certain that he would be able to do that, not only because his enemies, both in the US and abroad, are heavily invested in keeping the war going at all costs, but also in light of the improbability that President Vladimir Putin of Russia would be a pushover when it comes to conditions for a peace agreement. Such an arrangement would suit Ukraine and NATO very well, insofar as it would provide them with the opportunity to rearm and recruit more soldiers for the likely recommencement of hostilities in the future – something that was done before (after the 2014-2015 Minsk agreements), as Angela Merkel and Francois Hollande have admitted. Besides, that this is not a novel tactic, and a disingenuous one to boot, should be evident, as Immanuel Kant knew in the 18th century already, when he wrote his famous essay on the conditions for ‘perpetual peace,’ on which I have elaborated before. I am thinking of a specific condition stated in this essay, in the very first of the ‘preliminary articles,’ which reads: ‘No treaty of peace shall be regarded as valid, if made with the secret reservation of material for a future war.’ Kant’s elaboration on this article shows that he was not sufficiently shortsighted to confuse peace with ‘a mere truce, a mere suspension of hostilities’ – possibly to gain valuable time for strengthening one’s military to recover after relinquishing some of their capabilities in battle. The article is therefore clearly aimed at preventing any ‘mental reservation’ of demands to be used as casus belli to be revitalised on a more auspicious occasion in the future. This is essentially what was done before, as acknowledged by Merkel and Hollande in the RT article linked above, which reported that ‘…former German chancellor Angela Merkel [who] described the Minsk accords in December [2014/2015] as ‘an attempt to give Ukraine time’ to build up its armed forces.’ That Vladimir Putin is not as ingenuous as to fall for such a ruse again – in the guise of the imposition of a temporary ‘freeze’ on military activities in Ukraine – is obvious, however, where RT reports that: Moscow has repeatedly ruled out freezing the conflict, stressing that all the goals of its military operation, including Ukraine’s neutrality, demilitarization and denazification, must be met. Russian President Vladimir Putin said this summer that Moscow would immediately declare a ceasefire and start peace talks once Kiev withdraws troops from all Russian territories, including the Donetsk and Lugansk republics, and Kherson and Zaporozhye regions. Furthermore, the prospects of peace are bedevilled by the non-military actions of NATO against Russia. This is amply demonstrated by the recent murder of Russian General Igor Kirillov and his aide, Major Ilya Polikarpov, by means of a remotely controlled explosive device outside of Kirillov’s Moscow apartment. This is bound to aggravate, rather than ameliorate, the conflict, given that it is not part of conventional military operations. The reasons for NATO resorting to such terrorist actions become clearer where Strategic Culture Foundation reports, in a manner that one would not find in any mainstream news outlets, that: Since 2017, Kirillov served as the Chief of Russia’s Radiological, Chemical and Biological Defense Forces. He was assigned to protect the Russian nation from weapons of mass destruction. Since Russia launched its special military operation in Ukraine to neutralize NATO-backed aggression, Kirillov’s team of investigators uncovered an alleged network of bioweapons laboratories in Ukraine run by the Pentagon. The Russian allegations appeared to be based on intercepted classified U.S. documents that confirmed the operation of bioweapons labs. Kirillov’s presentations and detailed reports caused international alarm about sinister Pentagon involvement in producing biological weapons of mass destruction. According to the Russian investigations, the bioweapons programs were authorized by the Obama and Biden administrations. The programs also involved major U.S. pharmaceutical, engineering and financial companies in a clandestine operation. For the United States, this controversial work by Kirillov and his team was a source of huge embarrassment, although the Western media brusquely dismissed it as ‘Kremlin disinformation.’ It purportedly exposed Washington as being implicated in a systematic bioterrorism project facilitated by a NeoNazi regime that believes in the genocidal destruction of Russia – as its Third Reich forebears did. The discovery of an alleged U.S. bioweapons industry in Ukraine made Lt. Gen. Kirillov a priority target. Former CIA analyst Larry Johnson opines that it was this background that resulted in his murder. Other commentators have claimed that the assassination was aimed at killing the truth about the alleged U.S. bioweapons program. Then, of course, apart from Ukraine there is the situation in and around Syria, which has changed fundamentally (compared to what had existed there before), in a very short time, when Islamist ‘terrorists’ recently carried out a Blitzkrieg, ousting Bashar al-Assad and imposing Islamic rule. With Assad having been given asylum in Russia, the previously secular Islamic Syria – where Jews, Muslims, and Christians co-existed in relative peace – seems to be gone forever, and rather than improving the prospects of peace in the region, it seems to be the other way around, as former weapons inspector Scott Ritter explains in conversation with Clayton Morris. The gist of Ritter’s explanation of the geopolitical implications of the whirlwind regime change in Syria, if I understand him correctly, is that it has been a major blow to the ‘axis of resistance’ (of Iran, Hamas, and Hezbollah) by the Israel-American alliance in the region, insofar as Syria used to provide a lifeline of sorts to Hezbollah, located in Lebanon (and Hamas, in Gaza). That no longer exists, leaving the door wide open for both Israel and Turkey – which have been major backers of the Jihadist takeover of Syria – to pursue expansionist goals, with the probable aim of occupying, and possibly incorporating, parts of the former Syria into their own territory. The upshot of all of this as far as prospects of peace in the region are concerned is anything but reassuring, even if one ignores the ongoing conflict in Gaza – which, according to Ritter, has been largely ignored by the world since the military incursion into and conquest of Syria began. What he has in mind is the position of Iran, which is much better armed than most people seem to think, and which is very close to being able to produce nuclear weapons. This, Ritter believes, is what creates the alarming possibility of a ‘pre-emptive’ strike against Iran by the US, and given the unpredictability of the Biden regime – specifically of Anthony Blinken – in this regard, he is not willing to rule something like this out. However, he does believe that, once President-elect Donald Trump is in the White House, the latter would probably pursue a diplomatic resolution regarding Iran’s capability of becoming a nuclear power (parallel to the hands-on diplomacy that Trump practiced with Kim Jong-Un of North Korea). In light of the information outlined above, together with relevant evidence, one would be forgiven for being pessimistic about Kant’s hope, more than two centuries ago, for an ‘everlasting peace’ among nations (discussed at length in the article linked earlier) sometime in the future. Given the current events of a bellicose nature, discussed above, this is undeniable, and when one scrutinises the three ‘Definitive Articles’ identified by Kant in his peace essay, which would (ideally) provide a foundation on which to build ‘lasting peace,’ and not only a ‘termination of hostilities,’ this is only reinforced. These articles are, first, ‘The civil constitution of all states shall be republican,’ which articulates Kant’s belief, that it is the ‘only constitution which has its origin in the idea of the original contract, upon which the lawful legislation of every nation must be based.’ This constitution is in accordance with the liberty of citizens as human beings; and such freedom depends on shared legislation, and on their equality as citizens. The reason why it is, for Kant, the only constitution that can prepare the way to ‘perpetual peace,’ is that it requires the agreement of citizens before the ‘bad business’ of war can be initiated. Although it is the case, today, that most countries in the world are ‘republican’ in the sense of being representative, instead of ‘direct’ democracies, evidence suggests that, in allowing financial, material, and advisory assistance to Ukraine in the current conflict, the US has circumvented the principle that, as representatives of the American people, Congress has the sole right to declare war against a perceived enemy. This has not been done. Moreover, because American taxpayer funds and military personnel have been utilised in the Ukrainian military conflict, the American public has arguably been implicated in it. The second ‘definitive article,’ namely, ‘The law of nations shall be founded on a federation of free states,’ is essential for enduring peace because such a federation, where states would be subject to federal laws, is comparable to a state with a republican constitution. Nonetheless, when comparing current events in Ukraine and Syria with Kant’s expectations regarding the role of a ‘federation of states’ in the promotion of peace, the UN Preamble rings somewhat hollow. The third of the ‘definitive articles’ named by Kant, to wit, ‘The rights of men, as citizens of the world, shall be limited to conditions of universal hospitality’ is virtually unthinkable today. Needless to spell out, ‘universal hospitality’ does not obtain in the world of the 21st century; on the contrary, virtually everywhere that one travels, you are subjected to stringent requirements before entry into a ‘foreign’ country is granted. Therefore, judging contemporary events related to the ongoing military conflict in Ukraine and Syria against Kant’s requirements for lasting peace, it is obvious that the present seems to be further than ever from the possible actualisation of such ‘perpetual’ peace.

Senator Chris Coons And The Cult Of Patent Monopolies – OpEd	Last week, Delaware Senator Chris Coons, the chair of the Senate Subcommittee on Intellectual Property, made an assertion about the nature of patents that is flat out wrong. Senator Coons said: 'OUR FOUNDING FATHERS MADE IT CLEAR THAT INVENTORS SHOULD HAVE EXCLUSIVE RIGHTS TO THEIR INVENTIONS. IN OTHER WORDS, THE CONSTITUTION IN ITS SCRIPT GUARANTEES TO INVENTORS THE ABILITY TO PREVENT OTHERS FROM USING OR SELLING THEIR INVENTIONS WITHOUT THEIR PERMISSION.' This assertion is directly at odds with what the constitution explicitly says. The constitution absolutely does not provide any guarantees to inventors about exclusive use of their inventions. The wording that provides the basis for government-granted patent and copyright monopolies can be found in Article 1, Section 8, where the Constitution lays out the powers of Congress. 'The Congress shall have Power To lay and collect Taxes, Duties, Imposts and Excises, to pay the Debts and provide for the common Defence and general Welfare of the United States; but all Duties, Imposts and Excises shall be uniform throughout the United States; …. 'To promote the Progress of Science and useful Arts, by securing for limited Times to Authors and Inventors the exclusive Right to their respective Writings and Discoveries;' The granting of patent and copyright monopolies is a power of Congress, like the power to tax and the power to declare war. Patent and copyright monopolies are not a right granted to individuals, like the right to free speech or the right to practice the religion of one’s choosing. Rights Versus Policy This is not just a gotcha where Senator Coon has inaccurately described the wording in the constitution, the mistake matters hugely for how we think about patents and copyrights. As Senator Coon has described the constitutional wording, Congress is obligated to provide patent and/or copyright monopoles to allow people the opportunity to profit from their inventions. The actual wording in the Constitution says that Congress has the power to grant these monopolies as a way to promote innovation and creative work. It no more has obligation to grant patent and copyright monopolies than it has an obligation to impose taxes and declare wars. Furthermore, the Constitutional language says nothing about the length or strength of these monopolies. Presumably, Congress would look to structure them in a way that it deems most efficient for the purpose of promoting innovation and creative work. If we recognize that patents and copyrights are simply one set of policies for promoting innovation and creative work, and not an individual right, then we can ask questions like whether they are the best policy. As I and others have argued, there is good reason to believe they are often not the best policy. This especially the case with prescription drugs and medical devices. We will spend over$650 billion this year for pharmaceutical products that would likely cost us around $100 billion in a free market without patent monopolies. This difference between the patent protected price and the free market prices comes to more than $4,000 a year for an average family. It also creates the absurd situation where people with serious health conditions may be looking at paying tens or even hundreds of thousands of dollars for drugs that would sell for a few hundred dollars in a free market. And the enormous profits created by patent monopolies gives drug companies a huge incentive to mislead doctors and the public about the safety and effectiveness of their products. We very much need to have a serious discussion about the relative merits of patent and copyright monopolies as mechanisms for supporting innovation and creative work. (I discuss alternatives in chapter 5 of Rigged. [It’s free.]) But that discussion cannot take place as long as we have prominent senators like Chris Coon blatantly misrepresenting the Constitution’s wording on intellectual property. Unfortunately, our public debate is so skewed by the people who benefit from these government policies, that Senator Coon’s misrepresentation will likely go unnoted by almost everyone. Needless to say, the Senator is not likely to feel any obligation to correct his mistake.

Queenstown As Low-Carbon City Of Conservation And Efficiency – An...	By Liu Lidan ANBOUND's founder Mr. Kung Chan has recently pointed out that the global issue of climate change is gradually evolving from a scientific matter into a political movement. China's response to global climate change should start from a 'Chinese green perspective' and actively build a Chinese green cultural movement. Moreover, China should help the world understand its perspective on climate change better. The core strategies for China's climate change response are 'conservation' and 'efficiency,' which are quite helpful in mitigating the large-scale cost increases associated with addressing climate change. These cost increases, which have led to inflation, have already become very evident in the United States and Europe. In terms of implementation, China's green perspective should focus on 'energy-saving and emission reduction' reinvestment and reconstruction as the main feature, contributing to global climate change efforts. This should especially become a key focus of the 14th Five-Year Plan. Regarding urban development, centered around China's green perspective and the Pedestrian-Oriented Development (POD) principle, urban renewal should be based on 'conservation and efficiency'. Large-scale renovations aimed at energy saving and emission reduction can create substantial investments and GDP, promoting urban economic growth and making cities more livable. In this regard, some cities like Shanghai have already been promoting planning transformation, although comprehensive and effective strategic policy support has not yet been fully established. By contrast, some cities in other countries, through recent explorations, have developed strategic concepts and progress in low-carbon urban construction. They are achieving more sustainable local development methods with 'conservation and efficiency' at their core. For example, Queenstown, New Zealand, has applied ANBOUND's POD principle along with the 'conservation and efficiency' perspective to develop and practice its 'carbon-zero visitor economy', helping the city's development and tourism industry undergo a low-carbon transformation. Located in the Otago region of New Zealand's South Island, Queenstown has been developing its adventure sports tourism economy around its stunning lake and mountain landscapes since the 1960s. The region is one of the most popular destinations in New Zealand, and tourism has become a driving force behind its economic development. In 2020, tourism accounted for 39% of the town's GDP and 52% of total employment. In 2023, nearly 400,000 international visitors came to Queenstown, nearly 20% more than in 2019 before the outbreak of the pandemic, while the town's permanent population is only around 50,000. As climate change and environmental issues have become increasingly severe, coupled with the continuous rise in the number of visitors, Queenstown has realized that the old model of expansion has led to massive energy consumption and is unsustainable. In order to protect the local natural environment and improve the quality of life for its community, Queenstown decided to develop its tourism industry in a more sustainable way and set an ambitious goal: to become the world's first destination to fully achieve a 'carbon-zero visitor economy' by 2030. In 2021, the Destination Queenstown, Queenstown Lakes District Council, and Lake Wānaka Tourism proposed this plan, which has garnered support from tourism operators and local residents. The plan, from concept to implementation, fully embodies the POD principle and the 'conservation and efficiency' green perspective proposed by ANBOUND. First, Queenstown is gradually introducing low-carbon and renewable energy tourism projects, innovatively organizing investments and consumption within the tourism industry. A key strategy is the promotion of electric public transportation, along with the development of a comprehensive network of walking paths and bike lanes, creating a 'slow-moving' transportation system. This design not only reduces carbon emissions but also promotes economic activities and social interactions within the community, reflecting the POD principle that advocates for the creation of vibrant, pedestrian-centered urban hubs. Specifically, by 2030, it is expected that visitors arriving in Queenstown, possibly on an electric aircraft operated by Air New Zealand, will then take an electric gondola or a hydro-powered ferry to cross the town's famous glacial lake, Lake Wakatipu, to reach the town center. With the increasing influx of visitors during the winter season, skiers will be able to take an electric gondola to the mountaintops of nearby ski resorts. Additionally, the world's first fully electric jet boat will begin operating on Lake Manapouri from early 2025, powered entirely by batteries. This Swedish-designed electric jet boat is expected to reduce carbon emissions by over 240 tons annually, equivalent to removing 52 gasoline cars from the road. The local dock has recently been upgraded to provide electric jet boat charging services for all watercraft users. Moreover, the region has developed 130 kilometers of bike trails, stretching along the edge of Lake Wakatipu and extending into remote areas outside the town. Some of these trails cross swaying suspension bridges over the emerald-green Kawarau River, making Queenstown a globally recognized cycling destination. By 2026, it is expected that cycling tourism will account for 50% of the region's tourism economy, surpassing the carbon-intensive ski tourism that currently dominates the area. At the same time, Queenstown is undertaking green and low-carbon urban renewal initiatives aimed at energy conservation and emission reduction. This allows tourists to enjoy eco-friendly travel while experiencing the region's rich history and culture. This aligns with ANBOUND's 'conservation and efficiency' green perspective and the POD principle, which advocates for 'preserving historical context and passing down the city's cultural memory in urban renewal'. In Queenstown, the Sherwood Queenstown, a hotel with a 40-year history, was renovated and ranked by Expedia as one of the top 10 eco-friendly hotels in 2019. The motel is almost entirely powered by 248 solar panels, and a full-time gardener grows nearly half of the hotel's restaurant produce on a hillside overlooking Lake Wakatipu. All food waste at Sherwood is turned into compost, which is then used to grow more food, creating a cycle of waste management and resource utilization. Additionally, RealNZ, a tourism experience company, is working to decarbonize one of Queenstown's most popular adventure activities, the 112-year-old coal-fired ship TSS Earnslaw. This ensures that the TSS Earnslaw, which has been carrying day-trippers since the 1970s, retains its historical features during the refurbishment while adopting environmentally friendly fuels, such as hydrogen. This integration of new and old elements with a focus on energy conservation and emission reduction not only makes Queenstown a contributor to environmental protection but also helps maintain the city's unique cultural charm. In addition, as Queenstown promotes its zero-carbon tourism economy, it focuses on resource conservation and efficient utilization to achieve energy saving and emission reduction. Local tourism operators are actively promoting the implementation of green building standards, particularly in key tourism facilities such as hotels and resorts, where energy-efficient designs and equipment are extensively used to reduce the energy consumption of buildings and facilities. This aligns with ANBOUND's core principles of 'conservation and efficiency'. For example, the Headwaters Eco Lodge in Queenstown is the world's first accommodation facility to receive the Living Building Challenge certification. Located in the picturesque village of Glenorchy, a 45-minute drive west of Queenstown, the lodge is surrounded by the Southern Alps and winding river valleys. It is built entirely using regenerative building materials. The lodge uses the world's most advanced composting toilets, and every liter of wastewater irrigates the vast wetland in the center of the property. All of the lodge's electricity comes from one of the largest solar gardens on the South Island, which includes nearly 600 solar panels. The energy generated is so substantial that excess power is used to supply another business on the nearby road. This architectural design not only meets functional requirements but is also environmentally friendly, perfectly integrating with the natural surroundings. It fully embodies the POD principle, which emphasizes prioritizing environmental space and ensuring that buildings harmoniously coexist with the urban environment. Finally, the transformation of Queenstown's tourism industry is dedicated to promoting low-carbon and high-efficiency tourism models, avoiding excessive development and consumption of land and infrastructure. This also reflects the POD principle, which emphasizes selecting industries based on the carrying capacity of social resources and developing the economy while preventing environmental degradation. In Queenstown, innovations like the fully electric jet boat provide opportunities for economic diversification. Many New Zealand manufacturers have participated in this project, and the jet boat industry is rapidly emerging globally. Queenstown's zero-carbon tourism economy plan aims to upgrade industries and renew the city with energy-saving and emission-reduction goals, with its economic benefits far outweighing those derived from traditional tourist spending. Final analysis conclusion: Queenstown demonstrates its commitment to achieving a zero-carbon tourism economy by promoting electric and hydrogen-powered public transportation, supporting eco-friendly accommodation facilities, green renovating existing infrastructure, implementing waste management, and utilizing renewable energy. With comprehensive strategic policy support, widespread community participation, and technological innovation, the town is on track to meet its zero-carbon tourism goal. The development approach focuses on driving industrial upgrades and urban renewal with energy-saving and emission-reduction objectives, ensuring that economic development and environmental protection progress sustainably in balance. Ultimately, this will help Queenstown realize its goal of becoming the world capital of ecotourism.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWeSAohndYMaVNhVaL_UTFh6	2024-12-27T16:27:15-08:00	
Tariffs Won’t Save The US Dollar – OpEd	By Vincent Cook In a November 30 Truth Social post, President-elect Trump threatened BRICS states—Brazil, Russia, India, China, South Africa, Iran, Ethiopia, Egypt, and the United Arab Emirates, plus more states in the process of joining—with 100 percent tariffs on their exports to America if they dared to attempt replacing the US dollar as an international trade currency: 'The idea that the BRICS Countries are trying to move away from the Dollar while we stand by and watch is OVER. We require a commitment from these Countries that they will neither create a new BRICS Currency, nor back any other Currency to replace the mighty U.S. Dollar or, they will face 100 percent Tariffs, and should expect to say goodbye to selling into the wonderful U.S. Economy. They can go find another 'sucker!' There is no chance that the BRICS will replace the U.S. Dollar in International Trade, and any Country that tries should wave goodbye to America.' When one examines international trade data in detail, however, some curious anomalies in Trump’s statements become evident. For one thing, the world needs the BRICS economies for both merchandise exports and imports far more than the world needs America. China (including Hong Kong) all by itself is a bigger importer and far bigger exporter of goods than America. America only accounts for 13 percent of the world’s merchandise imports and less than 9 percent of its merchandise exports. If the world’s economy were to fragment into rival currency/trade blocs, most countries outside of North America would regard access to BRICS markets, not to America’s markets, as being a higher priority. A NAFTA bloc and its US dollar would be competing on unfavorable terms with a BRICS bloc, a Euro bloc, and maybe a Japanese-led bloc for access to the natural resources and other factors of the less-industrialized countries. Fears of being cut off from natural resources, in turn, incentivizes hostile blocs to turn into hostile military alliances, and for their trade and currency wars to turn into world wars. For another thing, Trump’s threats mean nothing to states that are already under severe sanctions like Russia and Iran. They export practically nothing to America. It is Chinese manufacturers who have the most to lose by the BRICS bloc antagonizing Trump, with their annual export revenues on the order of $450 billion at stake (about 3/4ths of all BRICS exports to America). However, Chinese dictator Xi has undoubtedly calculated that China’s economy is likely going to be targeted by American statists anyway, so he has every incentive to preemptively create a sanctions-proof international medium of exchange in spite of risks to export markets, just as BRICS has already created an independent wire payments system and an independent multinational credit institution to bypass American-aligned institutions. Trump’s brazen threat only provides more evidence that the American government is not a trustworthy steward of an international monetary system, and thus makes migration away from a dollar-dominated system towards some sort of alternative money even more urgent and compelling for every state that fears arousing Washington’s ire. Yet another odd thing about Trump’s threat is that trade barriers hurt Americans as well as foreigners. It is not simply that case that big box retailers are filled from floor to ceiling with inexpensive Chinese-made consumer goods that Americans can’t seem to get enough of. The data show that China is a critical supplier of electronics and machinery too, something which American businesses depend heavily on for their own productivity. Tariffs do nothing to address the root causes of America’s deindustrialization, but suddenly cutting off access to Chinese-made capital goods and forcing diversions of scarce inputs to sectors where America lacks comparative advantages to make up for lost imports means tremendous losses of productivity and real incomes for American workers. Tariffs can certainly accelerate the deindustrialization process and the decline of the middle class and make dollar-denominated accounts and assets even more unattractive to foreigners. Carrying out Trump’s threat would be spectacularly counterproductive for the Americans who voted for Trump. To be sure, a fragmentation of the world’s economy into rival blocs hurts everyone, not just Americans, so Trump’s threat might just be a bluff to gain an advantage in trade negotiations, and won’t do any real damage unless his bluff gets called. Even as a mere negotiating ploy, Trump’s demands don’t make sense. What Trump doesn’t seem to understand is that the continual creation of fiat dollars and dollar substitutes out of thin air hurts everyone too. Continued dependency of the world on fiat dollars is not an acceptable outcome, not even for Americans. Using threats of economic chaos to try to keep the current failing system in place is madness. Not only are America’s predatory elites (who happen to be fiercely anti-Trump) ruthlessly exploiting the entire world with what former French President Valéry Giscard d’Estaing famously called the American government’s 'exorbitant privilege' of fiat dollar creation to commandeer the productivity of others, the use of dollar-denominated US Treasury securities as the principal reserve asset for the world’s banking system means that this system is at risk of a catastrophic collapse in the event of a dollar hyperinflation. The dollar’s role as the leading trade currency is a mere byproduct of the foreign demand for dollar-denominated US Treasury securities. It is this dubious choice of reserve asset as a substitute for gold that poses an existential hyperinflationary threat to the entire global monetary system. With the fiat US dollar having lost well over 98 percent of its purchasing power in terms of gold since President Nixon cut the last links to gold in 1971, calling it 'mighty' as Trump did, is a gross exaggeration. The US dollar in its current form is not mighty, it is an absolute disgrace. It is doomed to failure even without an overt challenge from the BRICS states. Some heavy fiscal distress followed by a sudden loss of confidence in our ever-inflating dollar would be quite sufficient to bring it down and all dollar-dependent currencies along with it. A dollar hyperinflation under the present system is the single greatest man-made risk threatening the continuity of civilization apart from a nuclear war. Imagine a world where all the world’s supply chains are broken and even the 'essential businesses' are all shut down everywhere due to all money becoming worthless. Instead of vainly defending the fragile monetary status quo with threats of economic destructionism, Trump should be leading America—and as much of the rest of the world as he can—away from the fiat dollar and back towards a decentralized gold standard, or better yet, towards an improved, decentralized gold standard that is coupled to a 100 percent reserve rule for all risk-free money substitutes. Americans too need a better form of money than the fiat dollar. To the extent that America’s enemies can find a way to escape a failing fiat dollar by turning towards some sort of basket of gold and fiat currencies, is it wise for America not to implement an even better gold-based monetary reform of its own, and encourage its allies to do the same? Instead of fearing international monetary competition and attempting to hide from it, why not try to win the competition by coming up with an even better form of money? While many economists outside the Austrian school may scoff at calls for sound money and concerns about hyperinflation risks, it is curious that their misguided allegiance to 'empirical' and econometric methods has not led them ponder the dreadful history of the hundreds of fiat money experiments that have been tried and have invariably failed over the past millennium, beginning with the very first example of a fiat currency dating from exactly 1,000 years ago in China. Surely even those who are immune to the indisputable logic of purposeful action must concede that, in all the historical records available to us, tariffs and other more severe interventions have never been successful in saving fiat monies from the scourge of continual depreciations (usually over a span of decades) followed by utter oblivion and economy-wide chaos. Only a transition back to precious metals has ever averted a hyperinflationary disaster. There isn’t the slightest indication that the dollar differs from these historical precedents in any important respect, aside from the fact that the threat of monetary destruction is now universal. A restoration of gold backing for the dollar, not tariffs, is the only viable plan for making the US dollar great again.

With Trump Again Talking About Greenland, Moscow Focusing On Faer...	Two Danish possessions in the north Atlantic, Greenland and the Faroe Islands, are attracting increasing attention in Washington, where President-elect Donald Trump has again suggested that he would like the US to acquire the former, and in Moscow, where a well-connected commentator suggests the Kremlin is now focusing on the Faeroes. During his earlier term in office, Trump said he would like to acquire Greenland from Denmark. Although Copenhagen rejected the idea, Moscow focused on it as a potential threat to Russian interests (windowoneurasia2.blogspot.com/2020/05/us-wants-greenland-as-second-alaska.html, windowoneurasia2.blogspot.com/2023/05/moscow-sees-greenlands-moves-toward.html, jamestown.org/program/greenland-set-to-become-cockpit-of-controversy-between-east-and-west/ and jamestown.org/program/russia-expects-growing-conflict-with-us-over-greenland/). Until Trump was again elected and again spoke about acquiring Greenland, Moscow focused more on other islands in the North Atlantic and the Baltic Sea as places of Russian interest (jamestown.org/program/moscow-focusing-on-gotland-and-other-baltic-sea-islands-as-potential-targets/, jamestown.org/program/spitzbergen-a-new-hotspot-in-the-cold-north-between-russia-and-the-west/ and jamestown.org/program/moscows-first-move-against-nato-could-take-place-in-norways-svalbard-archipelago/). While Spitzbergen, Gotland, and the Aaland Islams received more Russian attention, Moscow occasionally focused on the Faroes, an autonomous Danish possession between Scandinavia and Iceland that has been more willing to continue to cooperate with (windowoneurasia2.blogspot.com/2023/05/the-faroe-islands-autonomous-part-of.html). In a new article, Moscow security commentator Aleksey Chichkin says that Russia is interested in continuing its close cooperation with the autonomous Faroes because the autonomous region of 1400 square kilometers and 53,000 people wants to do so as well (stoletie.ru/rossiya_i_mir/farery_poshhochina_jes_702.htm). Because it is autonomous, the Faroe Islands are not part of the EU and have not gone along with the EU and Denmark in imposing sanctions on Russia after the Anschluss of Crimea and Putin’s launch of the expanded invasion of Ukraine in 2022. Instead, they have worked to expand trade and fishing rights with Russia. Some in Denmark, the Faroes and Russia see this as presaging an eventual move toward independence by the Faroe Islands and suggest that events during World War II set the stage for that. Not only did the two Danish territories refuse to surrender to Germany after the latter’s occupation of Denmark, but Iceland moved to acquire independence from Copenhagen. Chichkin suggests that the Faroes could follow the same course now, a possibility that would likely increase if Russian assistance to the Faroes fishing industry expands and American interest in Greenland does as well. Were that to happen, it would likely give Russia expanded leverage over the North Atlantic as well as the entrance to the Northern Sea Route. Consequently, a place few in most of the countries of the West have ever heard of except for its salmon may now be on its way to becoming a cockpit of conflict between Russia, on the one hand, and the West, on the other, especially given the Kremlin’s current interest in expanding its position in these and other islands in the region.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWeSAohndYMaVJA77tKuim5g	2024-12-27T16:19:08-08:00	
The Evolution Of Baltic Military Divisions – Analysis	By Lukas Milevski (FPRI) -- Ten years ago in 2014, Baltic defense was paltry. The defense budgets of the three Baltic states, but especially Latvia and Lithuania, were suffering from the financial crisis of 2008, and their armies were all negligible. Baltic defense was measured in battalions of about 400-1,000 men, while trying to form brigade-sized forces of 3,000-5,000. Alliance contributions were minimal. In the aftermath of the Russian invasion of Crimea, the US deployed mere companies to the Baltic states; after the 2014 Wales and 2016 Warsaw Summits, NATO finally deployed battalion-sized battlegroups. Compared to the Russian hordes across the border, force sizes were limited. Yet now, with Russian forces in the Baltic region largely drawn away to fight and die in Ukraine, defense forces in the Baltic states have become ever larger and can be measured not in battalions, nor even brigades, but in divisions: Each Baltic state is defended by at least one division. It is worth exploring what this looks like and what it means. One must first understand what a division as a military formation actually is. Critically, there is no single divisional template; divisions are structured differently among countries and even within the same country. Moreover, because countries can vary even in the structure of their basic infantry squads, it is important not to overanalyze when discussing divisions. Rather than trying to account for any division, down to the numbers of individual soldiers and the quality and quantity of their equipment, the vehicles a division operates, and so on, the focus should be mostly on the subunits which report directly to divisional headquarters and the kinds of military assets they essentially represent. For example, the US 1st Infantry Division fields two armored brigade combat teams, each with a cavalry regiment, an infantry regiment, two armored regiments, as well as engineer and support battalions; two regiments of artillery; a combat aviation brigade; and a logistics brigade. The US 1st Cavalry Division similarly fields three armored brigade combat teams; divisional artillery, including a battalion of air defense; a combat aviation brigade; and a logistics brigade. The German 1st Panzer Division fields two armored brigades, two mechanized infantry brigades (one of which is Dutch), as well as artillery, signals, engineer, and support battalions. The key points ultimately are: 1) these are large formations, often much closer to 20,000 than 10,000 soldiers, if not over 20,000; 2) divisional headquarters do not just command frontline brigades but also organically oversee and coordinate artillery, air defense, engineers, signals, and logistics assets as well. The real tests of a division’s capabilities lie in both its size and its breadth of organic assets. Estonia, the smallest of the Baltic states, has been in the process of establishing its own — purely Estonian — division since December 2022. Its order of battle comprises two relatively light infantry brigades, a headquarters and signal battalion, and artillery, logistics, and ISTAR (Intelligence, Surveillance, Target Acquisition, and Reconnaissance) battalions. The second infantry brigade is as yet incomplete and would have to be filled with reservists in case of war, while the first brigade is rather more substantial and organically includes even air defense and engineer battalions, as well as an anti-tank company. It is anticipated that in the event of war in the Baltic, one British armored brigade combat team (either 12th or 20th) from the British 3rd Division would also be deployed to Estonia under the operational command of the 1st Estonian Division, besides other NATO enhanced forward presence units in the country. Unlike its northern and southern neighbors, Latvia does not aim to field a national division but already since 2019 has instead contributed to a multinational division, MND North, with Denmark and Estonia, and has remained committed to it. It is therefore the oldest division set up for Baltic defense and as such its headquarters were certified by NATO as operationally ready in July 2023. However, its force structure does not appear to be publicly available. It should include two brigades, the Latvian mechanized infantry brigade and the Canadian-led enhanced forward presence brigade, the latter of which should achieve full brigade-level operationally-ready status by 2026. Yet MND North has additionally become the formal affiliation of the 1st Danish Brigade, which is gearing up to be operationally ready, but it is still unclear how this brigade may eventually fit into divisional operations in Baltic defense, if at all. The Latvian army has artillery, combat support, and combat service support units at battalion level, which presumably would also fall under divisional command, while heavy armor is provided by two squadrons of Leopard 2s, one Polish and one Canadian. A Lithuanian national division has been an ambition of the Lithuanian Ministry of Defense since the 1990s. Serious realization of this vision has received impetus only from Russia’s full scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, with the intention being to bring it to operationally ready status by 2030, which will require substantial investment to achieve. The division will be created around the three existing Lithuanian infantry brigades, of which the first is a complete mechanized infantry brigade, the second is incomplete and light, and the third, as described in early 2023, is 'just a name and a flag.' The Lithuanian division also needs substantial investment into the various other assets that divisional command entails and requires, including air defense, more artillery, and tanks, among other critical capabilities. The intended size of the division is about 17,500 soldiers. A heavy German armored brigade is expected to be permanently deployed and operational in Lithuania by 2027 and will incorporate the existing enhanced forward presence forces, but as part of Germany’s 10th Armored Division, rather than slotting into the host’s national division like the British armored brigade combat team in Estonia or the Canadian-led brigade group into MND North in Latvia. Given strenuous national efforts and NATO allies expanding their enhanced forward presence, Baltic defense is on a better footing than it ever has been since the three countries regained independence in 1990-91. Yet the divisions they are deploying or planning to deploy remain substantially works in progress, substantially light infantry, and with comparatively few combat support enablers compared to what observation of the on-going warfare in Ukraine suggests they may need to fight the Russians. The heavier elements mostly derive from allied forces, and here Latvia will be somewhat disadvantaged compared to its two neighbors, each of which would have — at the very least, eventually — an entire allied armored brigade in-country while Latvia will not. Moreover, each Baltic state has further light infantry forces in its national guard or defense league units, which apparently are not intended to be folded under divisional command. Ultimately, much work remains to be done, as reflected by all three Baltic states currently expanding their respective defense budgets significantly to well over 3% of GDP.

China Approves Construction Of Mega-Dam In Tibet	China is moving ahead with plans to build the world’s largest hydropower dam on Tibet’s longest river despite environmental, water security and displacement concerns raised by India, Bangladesh and Tibetan rights groups. The Chinese government granted approval to build the Medog Hydropower Station on the lower reaches of the Yarlung Tsangpo river, where it is expected to generate 300 billion kilowatt-hours of power annually, three times the power of China’s massive Three Gorges Dam, according to the state-run Xinhua news agency. The river originates in the glaciers of western Tibet and flows into India and Bangladesh, where it is known as the Brahmaputra and the Jamuna rivers, respectively. China did not disclose details about when construction was likely to start and end, or the likely impact of the new dam project, including the number of people displaced or the ecological, environmental and cultural consequences of what Tibetans consider as one of their most sacred and biodiverse regions. But experts and activists say the impact will be significant Yarlung Zangbo Grand Canyon in Nyingchi city and that China could use the dam to promote its interests. It will almost certainly affect water flow patterns and native flora and fauna, and it also raises concerns about water security as China may use the dam to control the flow of water downstream. 'Any dam on a river has huge ecological consequences downstream,' India-based water conservation expert Vishwanath Srikantaiah told Radio Free Asia. 'China may use it as a tool by withholding and not being transparent with data on dam operations.' 'Lessons that India can take are from the dams on the Mekong River that China has built [in Laos] and which have impacted downstream nations particularly in years of drought, and how China has operated them broadly on principles of self-interest,' Srikantaiah said. Research has shown that China’s 11 mega-dams on the upper reaches of the Mekong River have resulted in an increase in the frequency and severity of downstream drought over the past two decades. The dams have restricted or blocked water from reaching downstream countries like Thailand, Vietnam, and Cambodia, as well as disrupted biodiversity and eroded river banks. Tibetan protests China’s dam projects have generated protests in the past. Earlier this year, more than 1,000 Tibetans were arrested for protesting against China’s planned construction of the Kamtok, or Gangtuo, Dam project on the upper reaches of the Drichu River, known as Jinsha in Chinese, expected to impact at least two villages and six monasteries in Dege county. Beijing’s investment to build the dam is expected to exceed 1 trillion yuan (US$137 billion) Yarlung Zangbo Grand Canyon in Nyingchi city more than four times the total investment of 250 billion yuan (US$34.5 billion) for the Three Gorges Dam project. The hydropower station will be built in Medog county (Motuo in Chinese) in Nyingtri (Nyingchi) prefecture in the Tibet Autonomous Region, bordering the Indian state of Arunachal Pradesh. 'As far as hydropower projects in the Himalaya are concerned, there is already substantial evidence of their negative impacts,' Manshi Asher, a climate activist and researcher based in North India, told Radio Free Asia. 'This project will undoubtedly alter the environmental flows of the river,' Asher said. 'The larger the dam, the greater the impact on the river flows.' It isn’t clear how many people will have to move to make way for the dam and reservoir it will create. The Three Gorges dam resulted in the displacement of around 1.4 million people, but the area around the Yarlung Tsangpo River where the Medog Hydropower Station is expected to be built is less populated than the area around the Yangtze River, where the Three Gorges dam was built. Earthquake concerns Another major concern is the Medog hydropower dam’s location in a geologically unstable area prone to earthquakes and landslides, that could be exacerbated by the huge volume of water it would hold, said Srikantaiah. According to a study by the advocacy group International Campaign for Tibet, China has built or plans to build at least 193 hydropower dams in Tibet since 2000, of which, almost 80% are large or mega-sized. Of the 193 dams, over 60% are reportedly still in the proposal or preparation stages. But if completed, they could displace over 1.2 million people and destroy religious sites, the rights group said. Dechen Palmo, climate researcher at the Dharamsala, India-based Tibet Policy Institute, noted that while the specific details of the dam on the Yarlung Tsangpo river have not been disclosed, the project would likely result in the displacement of Tibetans and the destruction of ancient monasteries. The new mega-dam also would pose environmental risks with significant impact on neighboring countries, including India, as has been the case with multiple dams that China has built on Tibet’s rivers, he said.

Taliban Hint At Shielding Anti-Pakistan Militants In Afghanistan ...	By Ayaz Gul A senior Taliban leader in Afghanistan has indicated that they will continue to provide refuge to anti-Pakistan militants, describing them as 'guests' under the country's traditions. Taliban Information Minister Khairullah Khairkhwa made the rare remarks just days after the Pakistani military reportedly conducted airstrikes against suspected terrorist locations in an eastern Afghan border province. The Taliban claimed that Tuesday's attack in Paktika resulted in the deaths of nearly 50 civilians, predominantly refugees from Pakistan. While the claims could not be verified from independent sources, the United Nations said that it had 'received credible reports' from the remote Afghan province that dozens of civilians, including women and children, were killed in the Pakistani airstrikes. Islamabad has refrained from publicly acknowledging the cross-border strikes, but Pakistani security officials anonymously confirmed and told reporters that the military action had targeted and destroyed several 'terrorist hideouts' of the Tehrik-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), an outlawed group engaged in lethal attacks against Pakistan. Several key TTP commanders were also said to be among more than a dozen militants killed. 'We must honor the Afghan nation's commitment to safeguarding these guests, friends,' an angry Khairkhwa said while denouncing the Pakistani attack. He was apparently referring to the TTP in his speech aired by Taliban-controlled state television and shared via X social media platform Friday. The Taliban minister emphasized the need for Pakistan 'to draw lessons from the consequences of military interventions' in Afghanistan by Britain, the former Soviet Union and the United States, respectively, since the 19th century. 'Anyone who attacks Afghanistan or harbors such intentions must learn from the defeat of three superpowers,' Khairkhwa asserted. This is the first public admission by a senior Taliban leader regarding the presence of TTP operatives in the country. Previously, Taliban officials have vehemently denied their existence, claiming that no foreign militants are permitted to operate and pose a threat to other nations from Afghan soil. TTP, designated as a global terrorist organization by the United Nations, has escalated attacks in Pakistan since the Taliban's August 2021 resurgence to power in Kabul, killing hundreds of Pakistani civilians and security personnel. On Friday, Pakistani Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif expressed his government's intention to enhance economic and trade relations with Afghanistan. However, he stated that the threat of TTP-led cross-border terrorism impedes that progress. 'Unfortunately, the TTP continues to operate from there and killing innocent people inside Pakistan. This cannot go on,' Sharif said in his televised remarks to a Cabinet meeting in Islamabad. 'They must rein in TTP. … This constitutes a red line for us. The TTP operating from Afghan soil is unacceptable under any circumstances,' he stressed. Sharif said his country was ready to talk with the Afghan government to address the issue. 'But there can be no progress if, on the one hand, they seek to foster relations with Pakistan while simultaneously permitting TTP to operate with impunity,' he emphasized. Separately, the Pakistani military reported Friday that its counterterrorism operations and clashes with TTP militants resulted in the killings of over 900 'terrorists' this year, including 27 Afghan suicide bombers and fighters. The violence also left nearly 400 Pakistani security forces and officers dead, said Lieutenant General Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry, the military spokesperson. Who is Khairkhwa? Khairkhwa, a U.N.-sanctioned Taliban leader, was captured by U.S. forces in collaboration with Pakistani counterparts in early 2002 and subsequently transferred to the U.S. Guantanamo Bay prison center. He was freed along with four other senior Taliban leaders in 2014 as part of a Qatar-mediated exchange for the release of U.S. soldier Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl. Following the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks on the United States, American and Western-allied forces invaded Afghanistan, overthrowing the then-Taliban government due to its refusal to surrender Osama bin Laden, the leader of al-Qaida, who was accused of orchestrating the deadly attacks from his Afghan bases. The Taliban leadership at the time justified its refusal to surrender bin Laden, asserting that he was a 'guest' in the country and that surrendering him would violate local traditions. Subsequently, the Taliban regrouped and launched an insurgency against U.S.-led foreign forces, using sanctuaries on Pakistani soil. Bin Laden evaded capture and fled to Pakistan, where he was eventually tracked down and killed by American troops in 2011. Taliban leaders pledged to combat transnational militant networks to prevent them from using Afghanistan as a haven for global attacks after they seized power three years ago. However, an annual U.S. terrorism report released earlier this month cast doubts on Taliban counterterrorism commitments, citing TTP's growing attacks against Pakistan from Afghan sanctuaries and the threat transnational groups pose to regional stability from Afghanistan.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWeSAohndYMaVMBbxmj5gdmq	2024-12-27T15:51:34-08:00	
Tough Energy Poker In Eastern Mediterranean After Assad’s Fall In...	By Sarantis Michalopoulos (EurActiv) -- Turkey’s growing influence in Syria’s situation since the fall of Bashar al-Assad has raised eyebrows in Greece and Cyprus, as Ankara reportedly wants to demarcate maritime zones with the new rulers in Damascus. Europe is directly impacted as it searches for Russian gas alternatives, and the demarcation of maritime zones will unlock crucial energy projects. This occurs in the context of fierce competition among regional players, while Europe's position remains fragile. Since the early hours of 8 December, when Assad left Damascus, a geopolitical game has been taking place. The former ruler's forces were defeated by the Islamist militant group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), which was supported by Turkish forces.A few days later, Turkey sent an envoy and other high-level officials to start discussions on various matters, making them the first on the scene along with Qatar. Among Ankara's group were Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan and the intelligence agency chief Ibrahim Kalin. By 24 December, media reported that Ankara was in advanced talks with Syria to sign a deal demarcating maritime zones in the Mediterranean Sea. 'We will conclude a maritime jurisdiction agreement with the Syrian administration […] we are working on a contingency plan that includes air, rail, road and communication services in Syria', Transport Minister Abdulkadir Uraloğlu said. The news triggered reactions in Athens after a similar deal between Turkey and Libya in December 2019 ignored the existence of the island of Crete. The EU then described the deal 'illegal' because it 'infringed upon the sovereign rights of third States.' For its part, Greece said Turkey wants to set a legal precedent with an 'illegal' Memorandum of Understanding under international law. The Cyprus issue While in the case of Syria, Athens and Nicosia fear that Cyprus’ sovereignty rights will be affected. Turkish forces have occupied the north of Cyprus following an Athens-backed failed coup d'etat in the 1970s. Ankara refuses to relinquish control, making it the only divided country in the EU. Cypriot government spokesperson Konstantinos Letymbiotis said in a statement that any intention to conclude an agreement between Turkey and Syria, as countries with adjacent coasts, should be 'based on international law, specifically the customary international law of the sea as reflected in UNCLOS, and should take into account the rights of the Republic of Cyprus in the area'. Meanwhile, Turkey has not ratified the UNCLOS, and insists that it is not bound by its provisions that award islands maritime zones. The future of both Turkey-Syria and Turkey-Libya maritime deals are crucial for the region, as Greece and Turkey have not signed a similar deal amid strong disagreements between the two neighbours. EU made aware Greek diplomatic sources explained this week that the borders in the region are European and stressed that the issue has already been raised with the EU in a joint statement with Austria and Cyprus. They also noted that Syria is facing a 'transitional situation' that does not 'legitimise anyone to make such an agreement'. The government in Athens also faces pressure from opposition parties, who call on the ruling centre-right New Democracy party (EPP) to set EU sanctions against Ankara. The hard-right 'Hellenic Solution' party (ECR) – which is on the rise in polls fishing votes from New Democracy – said it had warned about 'the Islamic terrorists who occupied Syria are fully controlled by Turkey and that Greece should fight for their non-recognition in any way'. The developments in Syria and Turkey’s ambitions in the region came as a surprise in Athens as Greece-Turkey relations have been calm for quite some time. When it comes to Syria, the EU has adopted a wait-and-see approach while it has not taken a position on Turkey’s growing influence in the country. However, Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen visited Ankara on 17 December, considering migration is high on the EU agenda. After she acknowledged Turkey’s help in hosting Syrian refugees, she promised to provide Ankara with an additional €1 billion. In Washington, incoming US President Donald Trump has not revealed his cards but publicly acknowledged Turkey’s role in overthrowing Assad. Pipeline games The demarcation of maritime zones is tightly connected with the energy agenda in the region. For its part, Europe is directly affected as the bloc has been in search for alternatives to Russian gas and the Eastern Mediterranean has a role to play. However, the complex interests among the players in the region (Greece, Cyprus, Turkey, Israel, Egypt) make the equation tough to solve. Earlier this week, Reuters reported that a delegation from Turkey's energy ministry will visit Syria 'soon' to discuss possible energy cooperation. Turkey is already providing electricity to some parts of northern Syria where the Turkish army has invaded four times since 2016. On 23 December, Greece and Israel signed an energy deal aiming to create a 'green' electricity corridor from Israel to the EU, via Greece and speed up the Greece-Cyprus-Israel electrical interconnection project. The latter has been delayed as the Greece-Cyprus section is facing a stalemate. It’s considered the 'world’s longest' subsea high-voltage cable. It will link European transmission networks to Cyprus and later extend to Israel. Turkey, which has rising tensions with Israel over Gaza, has opposed this project. Instead, analysts in Athens suggest that Turkey aims to increase its geopolitical leverage and become Europe’s energy hub. An old, ambitious plan to build a pipeline to transport Qatar's natural gas to Europe through Saudi Arabia, Jordan, Syria, and Turkey has resurfaced. Greek media report that another project in the spotlight is connecting western Syria with the existing Arab Gas Pipeline, which connects Syria with Jordan and Egypt and could provide Europe with Egyptian and Israeli natural gas. However, analysts in Athens estimate that Tel Aviv will not let Turkey handle its main geopolitical weapon. Lastly, all energy projects under discussion will be affected by Turkey’s future handling of Syria’s Kurds, as Turkish President has threatened with full-scale invasion, a scenario opposed by Israel.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWeSAohndYMaVExxD8v6_czl	2024-12-27T15:49:46-08:00	
Russia Says Ready To Help Armenia In Rapprochement With BRICS	Russia has completed its chairmanship of BRICS, Russian Ambassador to Armenia Sergey Kopyrkin said Friday, December 27, Sputnik Armenia reports. The ambassador noted that if Armenia shows interest in rapprochement with BRICS, Russia is ready to provide assistance 'in the spirit of allied relations'. Thus, according to him, Russia, as the BRICS chair in 2024, vigorously promoted cooperation in three key areas: 'politics and security', 'economics and finance', and 'cultural and humanitarian contacts'. The culmination of Russia's BRICS presidency was the October summit in Kazan, which was attended by some twenty thousand guests, delegations from thirty-five countries and six international organizations. 'The official delegation of the Republic of Armenia, headed by Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan, took part in the Kazan summit,' the Ambassador said. 'A significant event were the productive Armenian-Azerbaijani high-level talks on the normalization of relations on the sidelines of the Kazan forum. This proved in practice that BRICS can act as a convenient and neutral platform for interstate dialogue on the settlement of contentious issues. If Armenia shows interest in rapprochement with BRICS, Russia is ready to provide all possible assistance in the spirit of alliance and strategic partnership.'	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWeSAohndYMaVL2kt_BOm3bj	2024-12-27T15:48:31-08:00	
Justice As Infection: A Wild Reading Of Jaun Elia – OpEd	In today’s age of neo-fascism and neoliberal capitalism, there is a rising pressure to conform to social norms. The decimation of state welfare, the rise of precarious employment, violent xenophobia, right-wing hysteria against sexual self-determination etc. have created a society in which the individual is left powerless to decide their own fate. Instead of figuring out how we can collectively annihilate an unjust order, contemporary psychology has sought to justify individual quiescence. Mark Manson, for instance, says that it is impractical to hate society and completely disengage from it. That only leads to 'indifference' – people hide in an 'emotionless pit of their own making, self-absorbed and self-pitied, perpetually distracting themselves from this unfortunate thing demanding their time and energy called life.' Since there will always exist a society that sets up norms for us to follow, Manson asks us to accept that'everything sucks, some of the time.' There will always be people who will 'laugh you off the stage over and over again'. We will never 'feel comfortable and happy at all times'. That’s why Manson says that we have to be concerned only with 'the big things, the important things'. Human beings are mortal creatures who have to think carefully about how they want to use their limited time. They can’t be everywhere at all times, resolving every single problem. They are characterized by the 'unfortunate tendency…to inhabit only one place in space and time'. From the individual’s perspective, the inability to change the entirety of society means that we have to 'recognize our life’s inevitable limitations and then prioritize what we care about based on those limitations'. So, it is the fact of mortality that allows us to focus on what really matters to us. Thinking about death foregrounds questions that possess urgency: 'What is your legacy going to be? What are the stories people are going to tell when you’re gone? What is your obituary going to say? Is there anything to say at all? If not, what would you like it to say? How can you start working towards that today?' In the end, the mental health discourse of the present conjuncture boils down to an ideology of death: the fact that individuals cease to exist becomes an excuse for accepting hardships. Manson thinks that becoming a 'hotshot court lawyer' means tolerating '80-hour workweeks'. He obviously doesn’t stop to reflect if this personal 'sacrifice' doesn’t reflect historical norms of capitalist productivity. For him, it is just a trans-historical necessity: 'Everything involves sacrifice. Everything includes some sort of cost. Nothing is pleasurable or uplifting all of the time.' Manson’s ideology leads to the assertion of a strong self that can weather the inevitable imperfections of life and thus doggedly pursue its goals. But from where does Manson derive this strong self? Are we always capable of confronting difficulties and creating a new future for ourselves? Manson thinks so. For him, 'uncomfortable emotions' can’t be considered as an independent entity. They exist only as a 'source of motivation' for us, spurring 'positive change in our lives'. Thus, mainstream psychology converts negative affects into mere inputs for the machine of optimism. An alternative to the machine of optimism can be found in the poetry of Jaun Elia, where pessimism silently and aggressively voices the necessity for a radical change. Consider these lines: 'dād-o-tahsīn kā ye shor hai kyuuñ/ham to ḳhud se kalām kar rahe haiñ' (Why is there such a commotion of praise and applause? / We are merely conversing with ourselves.) One can find here an attitude of indifference to society. While Manson wants us to carefully focus on things that we are capable of pursuing and exclude those that are out of our control, Elia is absolutely ignorant of such distinctions. He converses with himself without assessing how it would be received by others. He doesn’t care if his inner conversation has succeeded in overcoming difficulties and earning applause from society. Rather, he is confused as to why does a society even exist, why are there people who are applauding him. So, does Elia basically deny the existence of society? If so, how do we even make sense of his monologue? Even a monologue relies upon the social infrastructure of language. One is never alone while thinking, as thoughts arise from a history of interaction. How, then, do we understand Elia’s incredulity towards applause? The word dād has a variety of meanings: praise, justice, help and the fungal skin infection called 'ringworm'. Here, a curious equivalence occurs between the domain of social conventions and the domain of morbidity. Is social recognition and mutuality like a skin infection that itches, inflames, and swells? In this graphic imagery, the act of applause becomes an irritant to the human body. Appreciation from others no longer validates the goals that we pursue or the values that we hold. It becomes an infection that demands treatment. In this morbid sociality, there exists no secure selfhood that can convert negative affects into a determined struggle for personal goals. On the contrary, Elia presents us with brute negativity, an affect of inflammation that doesn’t provide any comfort. For Manson, difficulties have to be faced if people wish to fulfill their goals. The fact of mortality continually reminds us that humans can’t have it all, that they have limited time to execute their plans in a harmonious manner. Thus, the negativity of difficulties becomes a principle that has to remembered, constantly reminding us to invest our energies in a judicious manner. Elia, on the other hand, presents us with a negativity that is enacted in a fit of confident forgetfulness, instead of being remembered as a principle that can help us in navigating society. Nothing, not even death, can guide us in the creation and maintenance of social relations. Sociality is always a form of morbid astonishment: people start applauding and assisting when one least expects it. Words spoken to oneself somehow invite the irritant gaze of the other. Society can’t be neatly categorized into a set of necessary imperfections that the individual has to rationally manage to fulfill their own goals. Our goals are overridden by an intense monologue wherein praise and appreciation lose their normative force, just as infection disturbs the integrity of the body that till now had seemed as if it completely belonged to me. Insofar as there is no stable selfhood that can rationally pursue its goals, who is the subject that confusedly looks at the applause that it is receiving from others? Here, one can replace the smooth language of social recognition with the rasping abrasion of resistant materials. In the former, there is a psychologically motivated individual who is discriminating between what they should care about and what they should accept as an inevitable imperfection. In this totalized individuality, the other doesn’t need to disseminate itself. It is always concentrated in the mind of the rational individual, who knows how to deal with society. Even difficulties are accepted by the individual as an inevitable aspect of life, motivating them to try harder. But in the ontology of infection, no difficulty can be legitimized as a trans-historic principle of life. Difficulties are not inevitabilities that are smoothly integrated into the worldview of the individual. Rather, there has to be a dissemination, a passage of social signs: the infection of sociality has to spread from the portal of entry to the wider body. Infection doesn’t involve the entirety of the body. It initially operates upon specific structures or molecules that the pathogen can exploit, such as receptors on cell membranes, open wounds or mucosal surfaces that allow entry etc. It is only later that pathogens may spread beyond the initial entry site through the bloodstream, lymphatic system, or nerves. The dissemination of the infection of sociality may or may not take place. Life’s difficulties may or may not be accepted as inevitabilities. In other words, the necessity of dissemination attests to the possibility of changing the world. There is no reason why the world should be fatalistically legitimized as an inherent aspect of life. Just like an infection, the world, too, can be diagnosed and treated. Thus, there is a space where the reasonableness of things is not yet guaranteed. Whereas Manson begins with the rigid individual whose selfhood has already internalized the trans-historic inevitability of suffering, Elia asserts the presence of a singularity that is not convinced of the reasonableness of anything. A singularity keeps conversing with itself, without attempting to participate in the social verification of beliefs. Instead of possessing social coordinates that would allow it to face outwards and map the exterior, the singularity mutters its way through society. It is as if the ears of the singularity are blocked by the loudness of its own internal conservation. And from where does it get so much sonic power? The explanation is to be sought in its positioning at the infectious niche, the point at which the body of the singularity possesses the capacity to function as a microhabitat for pathogens. Located at this meeting-point, the singularity keeps receiving social signals from the machine of history. This endows it with a vastness of material. But at the same time, the material is subject to the pressures of dissemination: the pathogenic substance has to cover a distance in order to spread itself. The indetermination of the passage means that the material of history can be recklessly deformed into a rambling monologue that pays no heed to the normal rules of functioning. Dād, we saw, also means justice. Elia can be said to inaugurate a new notion of notion: justice as infection, an order in which everything becomes dry, flaky and crusty, as it is detached from the nurturing atmosphere of the status quo. Before anything can be changed, it needs to be subjected to the withering gaze of ruthless critique. According to Manson, 'Meaning is like the water of our psychological health. Without it, our hearts and minds will shrivel and die. And like water, meaning flows through us'. For Elia, on the other hand, meaning is like ringworm: it is the infectious dryness that subsists beneath the surface of water. This dryness keeps irritating us, foregrounding the flakiness of all that exists. From this cauldron of inflammation, there arises the monstrosity of the singularity, annihilating injustice in the flames of monologue, absolutely indifferent to social norms.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWeSAohndYMaVGtTB3uCJS-k	2024-12-27T15:43:18-08:00	
NATO Vows To Bolster Baltic Presence Amid Suspected Undersea Sabo...	(RFE/RL) -- NATO has said it would bolster its presence in the Baltic Sea after undersea power lines and Internet cables were damaged by suspected sabotage believed to be carried out by vessels belonging to Russia’s so-called 'shadow fleet.' Estonia also announced on December 27 that it had begun a naval operation to guard a crucial electricity line in the Baltic Sea in coordination with allies as tensions mounted in the region. NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte said in a social media post following discussions with Finnish President Alexander Stubb that 'NATO will enhance its military presence in the Baltic Sea.' Both Finland and Estonia have coastlines on the Baltic Sea. When asked for details about planned actions, NATO officials told AP that the alliance 'remains vigilant and is working to provide further support, including by enhancing our military presence' in the region. 'We have agreed with Estonia, and we have also communicated to NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte, that our wish is to have a stronger NATO presence,' Stubb told a news conference. Stubb added that investigators did not want to jump to conclusions, but a day earlier he had said that 'it is necessary to be able to prevent the risks posed by ships belonging to the Russian 'shadow fleet.'' The 'shadow fleet' is a reference to old, uninsured oil vessels typically used to bypass Western sanctions on Russia and maintain a source of revenue. European government and the United States have accused Russia of intensifying 'hybrid attacks' following reports of damage to Baltic Sea communications cables, although they have not yet directly tied Moscow to the damage. NATO stepped up monitoring critical infrastructure in the Baltic following Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022 and the destruction of the Nord Stream natural gas pipeline seven months later. Chinese-linked ships have also been suspected of sabotaging undersea infrastructure over recent years. Sweden -- NATO's newest member, which also has a coastline on the Baltic Sea -- said its coast guard had stepped up surveillance of sea traffic and had deployed aircraft and vessels in concert with regional allies. The European Commission on December 26 said a cargo ship suspected of having deliberately damaged power and Internet cables in the Baltic Sea was part of Russia's 'shadow fleet.' The poor condition of these ships has also raised concerns about environmental disasters. Finnish authorities on December 26 boarded and took command of the Cook Islands-registered Eagle S oil tanker in the Baltic Sea as part of its investigation into the damages, saying it likely belong to the 'shadow fleet.' Investigators have said the damage could have been caused by the ship intentionally dragging its anchor. The Kremlin said it had no connection to the ship seized by Finland. It has regularly denied that it is involved in any of the many incidents involving Baltic Sea region infrastructure assets.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWeSAohndYMaVGsrqf-fXwMp	2024-12-27T15:36:32-08:00	
A Tribute To Former PM Manmohan Singh: Remembered For Empowering ...	Manmohan Singh (September 26, 1932 - December 26, 2024) was an Indian statesman, economist, scholar, and bureaucrat. From 2004 to 2014, he served as the 13th Prime Minister of India. He was born in Gah (Pakistan); however, his family relocated to India during the partition of India in 1947. Dr. Singh possessed unparalleled academic intellect. He pursued his studies in Punjab prior to graduating with First Class Honours in Economics from the University of Cambridge in 1957 and subsequently obtained a D. Phil in Economics from Nuffield College, Oxford in 1962. Singh occupied several significant roles in the Indian government during the 1970s and 1980s, such as Chief Economic Advisor (1972–1976), Governor of the Reserve Bank (1982–1985), and Chairman of the Planning Commission (1985–1987), as well as serving in the United Nations from 1966 to 1969.The apolitical in 1991, during a significant economic crisis in India, P. V. Narasimha Rao, the newly elected prime minister, appointed Singh as finance minister. Notwithstanding substantial resistance, he executed several structural reforms that liberalized India's economy in the subsequent years. Although these measures effectively averted the economic crisis and enhanced Singh's reputation as a notable reform-oriented economist globally. Notwithstanding, the incumbent Congress Party lost the 1996 general election. Singh subsequently headed the opposition in the Rajya Sabha, India's upper parliamentary chamber, during the Atal Bihari Vajpayee administration from 1998 to 2004. The United Progressive Alliance (UPA), an alliance led by the Congress, assumed power in 2004. Singh was elected Prime Minister and led the United Progressive Alliance I and II. Under the astute leadership of PM Singh, several significant laws and initiatives were formulated, including the Rural Employment Guarantee program, the National Rural Health Mission, the Unique Identification Authority, and the Right to Information Act. The persistent issues of rural poverty and unemployment in India prompted the initiation of these welfare programs, led by Prime Minister Manmohan Singh. The inception of a national employment guarantee scheme occurred when multiple Indian states-initiated pilot programs to provide work opportunities for rural households in the 1970s and 1980s. Although limited in scope, these initial programs established the foundation for a nationwide initiative. The notion of a national employment guarantee program gained prominence in the 1990s, accompanied by various central government proposals and deliberations. Despite India's progress in various socioeconomic domains, the conditions of rural populations, particularly marginalized communities have been moderately improved. These individuals have long suffered been from rural unemployment and poverty. A significant portion of India's rural population remained in poverty and unemployment despite economic expansion. Their heightened vulnerability to drought and natural disasters exacerbated poverty and food insecurity, thereby further exacerbating the conditions and status of rural households. The predominant number of rural households engage in seasonal employment within the agricultural sector. Consequently, there are often inadequate employment opportunities, leading to underemployment and migration. To rectify these disparities, demands for social justice and inclusion have emerged from various marginalized groups, including women, scheduled castes, and scheduled tribes. In response to this scenario, the UPA government implemented significant measures such as MGNREGA, Food Security, and Rural Development to enhance the status of marginalized individuals. Right to Work (2005) The introduction of National Rural Employment Guarantee Act-2005 (rename as MGNREGA in 2009), has been a significant Indian social welfare initiative designed to ensure the 'right to work', particularly for the rural marginalized people. The act was passed on 23 August 2005 and was implemented in February 2006 under the UPA government led by Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and the Minister for Rural Development, Raghuvansh Prasad Singh. It is a bold step towards ensuring an inclusive India by social safety net for rural households, providing a lifeline for millions of marginalized people struggling with poverty and unemployment. The program's focus on job creation, rural advancement, and social inclusion has established it as a fundamental component of India's development strategy. The initiative aims to enhance livelihood security in rural areas by guaranteeing a minimum of 100 days of assured wage employment annually for at least one member of every Indian rural household, contingent upon the adult members' willingness to undertake unskilled manual labor. Women are guaranteed one-third of the employment opportunities generated under the MGNREGA, with efforts aimed at achieving a minimum of 50% participation. A primary objective of MGNREGA is to create enduring assets, such as roads, canals, ponds, and wells. Employment will be offered within a 5 km radius of the applicant's residence, and the minimum legal wage as mandated by law will be compensated. Applicants are eligible for an unemployment benefit if employment is not offered within 15 days of their application. If the government fails to provide employment opportunities, it is required to furnish designated unemployment benefits to those impacted. Consequently, employment under MGNREGA represents a legal entitlement. Proponents of NREGA claim that, in addition to providing economic security and creating rural assets, it also aids in environmental protection, empowers rural women, reduces rural-urban migration, and fosters social equity, among other advantages. In its World Development Report 2014, the World Bank described this program as a 'stellar example of rural development' (The Economic Times, 10 October 2013). National Rural Health Mission (NRHM) 2005 On April 12, 2005, the Prime Minister launched the National Rural Health Mission (NRHM) to provide the rural population, especially the most vulnerable, with access to quality, affordable healthcare. The primary goals of NRHM are to establish a decentralized, community-driven, autonomous health delivery system and to address the social determinants of health. The NHRM sought to reduce maternal and infant mortality rates, as well as to prevent and manage both infectious and non-communicable diseases and to promote a healthy lifestyle. To attain these objectives, various measures regarding staff and infrastructure were implemented. The initial step in this direction was the establishment of the Accredited Social Health Activists (ASHA). The same was comprised of volunteers who work to create a connection between the targeted community and the health system. This mission has benefited from the contributions of over 8.84 lakh community health volunteers. For marginalized populations, especially women and children, facing difficulties in accessing healthcare in rural regions, ASHA serves as the primary resource for any health-related requirements. This initiative, proliferating across the states, has proven particularly effective in reintegrating individuals into the public health system. Moreover, it has resulted in an increase in the utilization of inpatient care, diagnostic facilities, outpatient services, and institutional deliveries. The subsequent step in the same mission was the formation of the Patient Welfare Committee. It is a legally sanctioned entity that governs the operations of hospitals as a board of trustees. Financial assistance and support for these communities involved in patient welfare initiatives are managed by a consolidated fund. Auxiliary Nurse Midwives (ANMs) in the field now exhibit increased confidence due to enhanced tools, including weighing scales, stethoscopes, and blood pressure monitors, provided by Sub-Centre Grants. The Village Health Sanitation and Nutrition Committee (VHSNC), functioning at the grassroots level, is an essential tool for community empowerment. NRHM has endeavored to address human resource deficiencies by contractually providing approximately 170,000 personnel for health services to States, including 8,871 doctors, 2,025 specialists, 76,643 ANMs, and 41,609 staff nurses, among others. Mobile Medical Units (MMU) have delivered services in various underserved regions. The government initiated the Janani Shishu Suraksha Karyakram (JSSK) program to promote universal healthcare, providing complimentary transportation, medications, diagnostics, blood, and food for pregnant women delivering in public health facilities and for ill newborns. In 2014-15, 1,04,38,905 beneficiaries were documented under the NHRM, with 87% of beneficiaries originating from rural areas. Food Security Act of 2013 The National Food Security Act (NFSA) 2013 is a legislative initiative implemented by the Government of India under Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, aimed at guaranteeing subsidized food grains to approximately two-thirds of the nation's population. The NFSA includes the Midday Meal Scheme, Integrated Child Development Services scheme, and the Public Distribution System. The NFSA 2013 also recognizes maternity entitlements. The Midday Meal Scheme and the Integrated Child Development Services Scheme are intended to be universal, whereas the Public Distribution System aims to serve roughly two-thirds of the population, with coverage of 75% in rural regions and 50% in urban areas. The Targeted Public Distribution System (TPDS) sought to cover 75% of the rural population and 50% of the urban population by guaranteeing a monthly allocation of 5 kg subsidised grain per person. The national coverage rates for rural areas are 75%, while for urban regions, they are 50% within each state. According to the TPDS regulations, foodgrains will be available at subsidized prices of Rs. 3, 2, and 1 per kg for rice, wheat, and coarse grains, respectively, for a period of three years following the enactment of the Act. The identification of households is the responsibility of the States and Union Territories, as specified by the coverage defined for the Targeted Public Distribution System in each State. Pregnant women, nursing mothers, and children aged 6 months to 14 years will be provided meals that adhere to the nutritional standards set forth by the Integrated Child Development Services (ICDS) and Mid-Day Meal (MDM) programs. Improved nutritional standards have been implemented for children under six years old suffering from malnutrition. The maternity benefit provision mandates that pregnant women and nursing mothers shall receive a minimum sum of Rs. 6,000. The oldest female member of the household, aged 18 or older, shall assume the position of head of the household for the purpose of issuing ration cards. The Central Government will provide assistance to States in managing the expenses related to intra-State transportation and handling of foodgrains, along with the margin for Fair Price Shop dealers, in accordance with the standards to be set for this initiative. Conclusion The Government of India, led by Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, implemented various substantial initiatives to promote socio-economic inclusivity in the country. The right to employment under MGNREGA, the guarantee of food security through NFSA, and the provision of affordable and accessible universal healthcare under NHRM for disadvantaged and marginalized groups have been notable social welfare initiatives for which the Prime Minister will be historically acknowledged. His legacy would act as a beacon for both marginalized communities and future governments in their efforts to develop effective policies. India has lost an exceptional statesman whose legacy will be commemorated for its inclusivity and progressive vision.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWeSAohndYMaVPOoqveAkDLE	2024-12-27T15:30:51-08:00	
Will Pope Francis Visit Ukraine In 2025?	By AC Wimmer Media reports about Pope Francis potentially visiting Ukraine have raised hopes the Holy Father could accept an invitation to visit the war-torn country in 2025. According to a report by Ukrainska Pravda, Major Archbishop Sviatoslav Shevchuk, the head of the Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church, said in a recent interview that while no visit was confirmed, 'Pope Francis sometimes likes to make surprises.' The prospect of a papal visit to Ukraine has been discussed multiple times since Russia’s full-scale invasion began. In June 2022, speaking to children during the 'Children’s Train' initiative in Rome, Pope Francis explained his approach to such a visit: 'I would like to go to Ukraine. But, I have to wait for the right time to do it, because it is not easy to make a decision that could do more harm to the whole world than good.' The new speculation about a potential visit follows the pope’s Christmas message on Dec. 25 in which he specifically mentioned the ongoing conflict in Ukraine, calling for its end and for negotiations toward a just peace. 'May the sound of weapons be silenced in Ukraine,' the pope urged on Christmas Day. 'May there be the boldness needed to open the door to negotiation and to gestures of dialogue and encounter.' Shevchuk has long advocated for a papal visit to Ukraine. In April 2022, following Pope Francis’ comments during an in-flight press conference returning from Malta, the Ukrainian Catholic leader said he hoped the pope would visit Kyiv 'as soon as possible.' At that time, Shevchuk noted that the local Catholic Church and government officials were 'working to ensure that the Holy Father’s visit to Ukraine takes place.' In his latest interview, the Ukrainian Church leader reportedly expressed hope for peace in the coming year. 'We enter this new year with hope, with the hope that a just peace will eventually prevail in Ukraine,' he said.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWeSAohndYMaVNfEERM4J_G7	2024-12-27T15:29:04-08:00	
The Merz Doctrine: What A CDU-Led Government Would Mean For Germa...	By Jeremy Cliffe and Jana Puglierin Friedrich Merz’s long and winding journey towards the German chancellery is a tale of the federal republic’s past and present. Marinated in the determinedly pro-European, pro-Western politics of Helmut Kohl’s Christian Democratic Union (CDU) in the 1990s, he became co-leader of its Bundestag group in 2000, before Angela Merkel elbowed him aside. But Merz’s outspoken conservatism also clearly chimes with the harsher, more doubtful and sometimes more inward-looking mood of mid-2020s Germany. This is one reason why the CDU is polling around 30% to 34% ahead of the federal election on 23 February. The election result is far from certain—these are volatile political times, and Merz is relatively untested—but his victory would align with the broader German zeitgeist. Understand that, and one starts to understand the nuances of Merz’s foreign-policy philosophy, as well as what a CDU win would mean for Germany’s international role. It also sheds some light on the most important issue: whether the election result will see Europe’s keystone country provide more leadership in the coming years than it has in recent ones. Germany’s now-collapsed 'traffic light' coalition—Olaf Scholz’s Social Democrats (SPD), the centre-left Greens, and the right-liberal Free Democrats (FDP)—framed European and German interests as tightly interlocking, but often acted otherwise. An unpredictable actor in Brussels, it would often abstain or change its mind at the last minute. It delayed the European Union’s adoption of sanctions against Russia, reflexively rejected Mario Draghi’s report on the single market’s competitiveness, and opposed tariffs on Chinese electric vehicles. Berlin’s relations with Paris and Warsaw have deteriorated. In other European capitals, policymakers often remark that Germany appears to have gone missing[1]. The country that—under Kohl and, in her better moments, Merkel—rowed Europe through its storms now seems to be swept along by the current of events. Whether Merz can change this depends on the interaction between the three main pillars of his foreign policy—and the complementarities and tensions between them. *** The first is a profound commitment to a more integrated Europe. Merz came up in the Kohl era; the age of German reunification and the Maastricht Treaty. A member of the European Parliament from 1989 to 1994, he sat on the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, which helped mould the single market. Merz has called Wolfgang Schäuble 'the closest friend and adviser I ever had in politics', and seems especially influenced by his mentor’s belief in a Europe of concentric circles centered on France and Germany. In 2018, Merz echoed this sentiment in a call jointly authored with the philosopher Jürgen Habermas for a European army, 'European rather than national terms when setting wages and prices', and even a European unemployment insurance scheme. Today Merz calls for a grand reset in Germany’s relations with France and Poland, chides Europeans for being too reliant on American support for Ukraine, and blasts Scholz for refusing to provide Kyiv with Taurus cruise missiles. In what will likely be a major dividing line in the upcoming campaign, Merz has upbraided the would-be Friedenskanzler, or 'peace chancellor', with the words: 'Peace you can find in any cemetery. It is our freedom that we must defend.' This European Merz was most visible at an event in Berlin with Enrico Letta, the Italian former prime minister and author of a bold blueprint for a deeper single market, on the day after the US presidential election. As the reality of a new Donald Trump term settled over the German capital, the German conservative and the Italian social democrat found far-reaching common ground on the need to integrate European energy, telecommunications, defence and capital markets. *** The second pillar of the Merz doctrine is a market-liberal Atlanticism that goes beyond the 'Westbindung', the federal republic’s almost existentially Western geopolitical identity. Merz has a deeper personal connection with the US and the Anglosphere than Konrad Adenauer, Helmut Kohl, or either Merkel or Schäuble. After he was sidelined by Merkel in the early 2000s, he pursued a transatlantic business career; heading the German board of the asset manager Blackrock and serving as chairman of Atlantik-Brücke, a campaign for closer US-German relations. Merz also has an affinity with the United Kingdom, chiding Merkel for not doing enough to stop Brexit. He speaks almost accentless English. But realism tempers his emotional connection with the English-speaking world. Merz is rare in Germany for presenting Trump’s re-election as a justification for transatlantic engagement: at the Letta event he argued that the failed EU-US free trade deal (TTIP) would have helped insulate Europe’s economy from looming American tariffs, and that EU should not necessarily respond to those tit-for-tat. But he also acknowledges that Joe Biden was America’s last traditionally Atlanticist president. He has publicly asserted that the 'Europe of yesterday', with its 'confidence associated with the solitary leadership of the US', is a thing of the past. And he recognises that the transatlantic relationship must change radically to survive, with a more balanced burden of responsibility. *** Such Europeanism (albeit conservative) and Atlanticism (albeit realistic) might make Merz seem a throwback to Kohl-era Germany. But the third pillar of ‘Merzianism’ complicates that picture: as well as being a product of the idealistic 1990s, he is also a creature of the more introspective and less exceptionalist Germany of the 2020s. In his own distinct way, the CDU chancellor candidate is prone to just as defensive and narrow a conception of the German national interest as that which has marked Scholz’s Europe policies at their most parochial. Merz has described Ukrainian refugees in Germany as 'social tourists' (though subsequently apologised). On Berlin’s temporary imposition of border controls, a main cause of its current poor relations with Warsaw, he only wishes Scholz’s government had acted sooner. He has a cool relationship with his CDU party comrade Ursula von der Leyen, having disagreed with the European Commission president on the EU’s migration and asylum pact; on EU tariffs on Chinese electric vehicles; and its 2035 target to end the sale of new polluting cars. Most of all, this 'Germany first' approach comes across in Merz’s steely refusal to countenance the measures required for Europe to fund a more sovereign future. When Draghi published his competitiveness report, the CDU chancellor candidate dismissed common borrowing as 'a debt spiral' that he would 'do everything to prevent'. He has made it clear that the Next Generation EU pandemic recovery fund was an exception, rather than a basis for future common borrowing for shared priorities like defence. These positions are striking not in their divergence from Scholz’s traffic-light coalition, but in their continuity with it. *** Combine those three pillars—Europeanism, Atlanticism, and 'Germany first'—and the broad contours of a Merz chancellorship become clear. It would be most active where the three overlap; for example, European initiatives to placate Trump in the interests of German business (especially to curb American tariffs). A Merz government would shy away from proclamations of European 'autonomy' and seek to shore up NATO, while urging greater European leadership within the alliance. It would be more robust than its predecessor on Ukraine and Russia; with Merz confident in personally associating himself with the Bundeswehr and German defence. It would seek to relaunch Germany’s place in Europe, focusing especially on France and Poland but also the Nordics and Baltics. Yet it would also bridle at putting serious German money behind this European reset. On China, it would be torn between an instinctive geopolitical hawkishness and a business-friendly inclination to hedge German bets. Viewing the Merz doctrine as the fusion of those three pillars also highlights some inherent tensions. Where, during the Kohl years, Europeanism and Atlanticism mostly fitted neatly together, under a second Trump term Merz’s stated desire to do German 'deals' with the incoming president may well clash with any Schäublerian quest for a more robust and united European core. Meanwhile the conflict between the narrowly German sense of Merz’s mission and his European calling is expressed in his reluctance to countenance deeper European fiscal integration or a genuinely shared migration regime. And in the age of Trump 2.0, there are also tensions between the Atlanticist pillar and 'Germany first'. The more nationalist branches of the CDU in eastern states like Saxony are significant parts of Merz’s base and tend to be relatively more sceptical about NATO and Germany’s alignment with America. *** Quite how these tensions play out depends a lot on the details of Germany’s federal election. One important factor is whether the overall campaign, which will reach its crescendo in first weeks of the new Trump administration, favours a united European stance or bilateral German attempts to seek special deals with the incoming president. Another concerns the result. The better the Eurosceptic, anti-NATO fringe parties—the far-right Alternative for Germany and the left-conservative Sahra Wagenknecht Alliance—do at the polls, the more Merz’s commitments to Europe and the US will come under pressure, including from within his own party. Another significant variable is the influence of Merz’s inner circle of advisers. Key names if he becomes chancellor could include Thorsten Frei (a tough-on-migration CDU MP poised to run the chancellery), Jacob Schrot (Merz’s chief of staff and a keen Atlanticist), and Daniel Andrä (a foreign policy adviser with close links to the Bundeswehr). Merz’s team reflects his own instincts. But especially when those instincts are in tension, such voices could shape which of them prevail. The biggest variable, however, is what sort of coalition emerges from the election. It is likely (at the time of writing) that the CDU/CSU will have to rely on a coalition with the SPD and/or the Greens. The latter are somewhat closer to Merz on Ukraine but farther from him on the climate and migration. More important than the exact makeup of the coalition, however, is whether it has the vision and cohesion to rise to Germany’s manifold challenges. The country’s old model of 'cheap energy from Russia, trade orders from China, security from the US' no longer works. Scholz’s government has slowly, fitfully edged Germany on from it, while too-often neglecting necessary European solutions. But the new Trump presidency greatly increases the urgency. Whether any Merz-led coalition has the internal and external political room to act accordingly will be decisive. So, too, will be whether it sees Europe more as an obstacle to that action, or a vessel for it.

Spain’s Stressful Water Problem – Analysis	By William Chislett The flash flooding that hit the region of Valencia last month, killing 239 people, would seem to suggest Spain does not have a problem of lack of water. In some places, more rain fell in a day than in a whole year. That natural disaster, one of the worst in the country’s modern history, however, was one of extreme weather, known as a ‘DANA’ (depresión aislada en niveles altos), and not representative of Spain as a whole. DANA weather systems are formed when an area of low pressure gets ‘cut off’ from the main flow of the jet stream. As a result, instead of moving through a region relatively quickly, they get blocked over the same area producing persistent rainfall for days. In stark contrast, other parts of Spain have recently suffered prolonged bouts of drought (in November 2023 nine million people, one fifth of the population, faced water restrictions). Both the tragedy in Valencia and persistent droughts have brought home the rising threat of climate change for which Spain, like so many other countries, is unprepared. Last month was the hottest November in Spain since records began more than 60 years ago, according to the State Meteorological Agency (Aemet). The average temperature was three degrees higher at 12.4ºC, and, despite the torrential rain from the DANA, Spain’s total rainfall was 40% lower than normal for November. As climate change intensifies, Spain’s water management faces significant challenges, and this in a country which has a wealth of tradition and culture in relation to the careful use and exploitation of water; Romans, Arabs and other civilisations that settled in the Iberian Peninsula were more mindful than we tend to be today of the need not to waste water. The Alhambra and Generalife in Granada, the Aqueduct in Segovia and the Water Court in Valencia, the oldest existing institution of justice in Europe, bear testimony to this. Water management suffers, as do so many other issues, from political polarisation and the lack of cooperation and coordination between Spain’s four levels of government (central, regional, provincial and municipal). The authorities’ initial response to Valencia’s deadly floods was woefully inadequate. The civil protection agency (Agencia Valenciana de Seguridad y Respuesta a las Emergencias or AVSRE), which is overseen by the Popular Party-led regional government of Valencia, only sent out a text message warning residents hours after the first floods were reported. Help from the Socialist-led central government, which said it was up to the regional government to ask for what it needed, was slow to come in the first days. While an army of volunteers stepped into the gap, political opponents wasted no time in starting a blame game. The water problem is well known and has been endlessly diagnosed, particularly in a 600-page long White Paper published in 2004, but little has been done, particularly executing planned hydraulic works, many of which have either not been started or are going way behind schedule. A project to channel Valencia’s Poyo ravine, which caused some of the worst flooding, was designed in 2006 and given priority in 2009 by the Hydrographic Confederation (Confederación Hidrográfica del Júcar) but was shelved by successive governments. A report, published last month by the environmental consultant OIKOS, sounds alarm bells on Spain’s ‘increasing water stress’, which at 43% is well above Germany’s 34% and Italy’s 30%, but far lower than Israel’s dramatic 110% (see Figure 1). Figure 1. Level of water stress: freshwater withdrawal as a proportion of available freshwater resources, taking into account water’s environmental needs (Indicator 6.4.2.) (1) Country%Israel110India66Mexico45Spain43China42Germany34Italy30United States28France23(1) Source: The Food and Agriculture Organisation of the United Nations (FAO). Agriculture is a huge and inefficient user of water, consuming 65%, while only generating 14% of the value of EU agriculture. Drip irrigation, which is more economical and efficient, as it falls drop by drop on the roots of plants, thereby reducing consumption and loss of water, is underutilised (see Figure 2). Figure 2.

Climate change has produced a sharp fall in Spain’s average annual rainfall and consequently more prolonged periods of drought, particularly in Andalusia and Catalonia, the two regions that attract the most international tourists. Tourism is a vital part of the Spanish economy (12.8% of GDP); last year’s record number of 85.3 million tourists was the main driver of economic growth. Water reserves in Catalonia fell below 16% in February, triggering a state of emergency that extended water restrictions in other parts of the region to Barcelona and the surrounding area. The drilling of illegal wells –some estimates put the number at more than 500,000– and the excessive use of water in vulnerable areas, such as the Doñana Natural Space, one of Europe’s most important wetlands, which includes a Unesco-listed national park, and Las Tablas de Daimel, requires much stricter control. At Doñana, strawberry farms have depleted the aquifers holding groundwater. The first report denouncing the increasingly critical situation was made in 1988 and nothing began to be done until 2019, most importantly last December when the central government, which had been at loggerheads with the Popular Party regional government in Andalusia for two years, agreed a landmark €1.4 billion deal to help protect Doñana and diversify the local economy away from reliance on soft fruit. More than 1,000 illegal wells have been shut down. Another problem is the defective infrastructure. Up to 25% of drinking water supplied in distribution networks is lost, well above the ‘best practice’ target of less than 10%. This is not just a waste but reduces the availability of water for other uses. The average price of water in urban areas of €2/m3 is lower than the €3 EU average and well below the €5 charged in some countries, encouraging wasteful and inefficient use. Spain is a laggard in using non-conventional sources for water, which have been developed over the years, such as desalination plants and reclaiming water from a variety of sources, treating it and re-using it for beneficial purposes such as agriculture. OIKOS says only between 30% and 33% of total residual water treated undergoes tertiary treatment, which is the final phase of the wastewater cleaning process making it totally safe for re-use. Valencia’s flooding left residents in the affected areas without basic needs including drinking water. When the supply was restored, people were advised to boil the water or use bottled water, a profitable business for water-bottling plants, some run by multinationals, particularly those in the immediate area of the disaster. This prompted questions in some quarters on whether restrictions should be placed on these companies in times like that of Valencia’s tragedy or more broadly during periods of drought. Water governance clearly needs to be improved. OIKOS calls for the creation of a national water authority in order to better coordinate national, regional and municipal policies. It is to be hoped that the idea will not fall on deaf ears. About the author: William Chislett (Oxford, 1951) is Emeritus Senior Research Fellow at the Elcano Royal Institute.

Myanmar’s Poverty Trap: Inflation And Unemployment Collide – Anal...	By Windia Soe Myanmar’s efforts to reduce poverty (Sustainable Development Goal 1) face significant setbacks due to escalating inflation and unemployment driven by political instability, economic crises, and conflict-induced disruptions. Key Takeaways: Inflation surged from 3.64% in 2021 to 30.2% by late 2023, fueled by currency depreciation, foreign currency shortages, and rising oil prices, pushing nearly half the population below the poverty line. The military coup and COVID-19 caused mass job losses, with unemployment peaking at 4.34% in 2021, forcing millions into informal, unstable jobs and prompting a mass emigration of skilled laborers. Political instability, military conscription, and declining investment have weakened Myanmar’s labor market, reducing job quality, wage levels, and overall productivity, compounding poverty. Progress and Setbacks in Poverty Reduction Myanmar, one of the least developed countries, has significantly reduced poverty over the last decade. Myanmar began a political and economic transition in 2011 under a controversial elected government led by a retired military leader, which led to its first semi-democratic transition in 2015. The 2017 Myanmar Living Conditions Survey (MLCS) reports that the percentage of the population living below the national poverty line decreased significantly, dropping from 48.2% in 2005 to 24.8% in 2017. Between 2011 and 2019, the country achieved significant economic growth, averaging 6 percent annually, and notable reductions in poverty. This progress was driven by economic reforms, increased foreign direct investment, the lifting of sanctions, and growing optimism for stability. However, Myanmar’s development journey is complex, with the positive trends observed in 2017 were soon disrupted by the COVID-19 pandemic and subsequent political instability in 2021. By the end of 2020, the poverty rate was projected to rise from 6 to 11 percent, driven by declining incomes and limited coping mechanisms among vulnerable households. The 2020 Household Vulnerability Survey revealed that 83.3% of households reported income losses, particularly those reliant on small-scale family businesses. In 2021, the economy contracted to 10%, with widespread job and income losses, inadequate government relief, and halted public investments. This contraction from the dual crisis shows no sign of recovery, pushing millions into poverty. Poverty has more than doubled, rising from 24.8% in 2017 to 49.7% in 2023; nearly half of the population was living below the poverty line, struggling to meet even their basic daily needs on just 1,590 Kyats a day (around $0.75). In 2023, the estimated average income per person in Myanmar was just 75,000 Kyats per month (about $35). In rural areas, incomes were even lower, 24% less than the national average, averaging around 75,000 Kyats. Inflation: A Major Driver of Poverty Amid ongoing crises, inflation has emerged as a pivotal factor driving the surge in poverty levels across Myanmar. After reaching a five-year low of 3.64% in 2021, inflation escalated dramatically, with consumer price inflation rising to 30.2% by the September quarter of 2023, according to Statista. This stark increase reflects deepening economic vulnerabilities exacerbated by external shocks and internal instability. The Asian Development Bank forecasted an average inflation rate of 8.5% in 2023, building on a 16% rate in 2022, underscoring the persistent inflationary pressure within the economy. Food price fluctuation, a critical component of household expenditures, has further strained vulnerable populations. The World Food Program reported a 27% increase in food prices between October 2023 and April 2024, with conflict-affected regions such as Kayah and Rakhine experiencing even sharper spikes of 40–50% and up to 200%, respectively. These disproportionate increases highlight the compounded effects of regional instability and supply chain disruptions. The rapid erosion of purchasing power has pushed an alarming number of families below the poverty line, emphasizing the urgency for targeted interventions to stabilize prices and protect the most affected communities. Several key factors contribute to this alarming rise in inflation, including; Local currency (Kyat) depreciation: As of August 2024, the kyat has fallen to an all-time low of about 7,500 kyats per US dollar in the black market, a sharp drop from approximately 5,000 kyats earlier in the same month. Increase in oil prices: Oil prices rose by 13% from December 2023 to April 2024, increasing 31% compared to last year. In response to escalating prices, the Central Bank of Myanmar implemented measures in early 2024 to provide fuel importers with access to subsidized exchange rates. However, persistent foreign currency shortages have hindered importers' ability to fully utilize these preferential rates fully, increasing local fuel prices. Foreign currency shortage: The country has experienced significant foreign currency shortages due to a sharp decline in trade activity, which fell sharply by 55–64% within two months of the military takeover, as port operations were hampered by clearance delays, logistical challenges due to political unrest, and the temporary suspension of shipping services. This decline limits the availability of foreign currency as exports decrease. Increase in the money supply by printing: Following the coup, Myanmar faced widespread civil disobedience movements that severely disrupted economic activities and caused cash shortages. In response to the cash shortage, the CBM increased the money supply by printing to address the cash shortages. As of March 2024, Myanmar's Money Supply M1 was reported at 23.245 billion USD, marking an increase from 21.523 billion USD in December 2023. Although these are significant factors contributing to inflation in Myanmar, they are not exhaustive. Other elements, such as supply chain disruptions, rising production costs, and broader economic instability, play critical roles in shaping inflationary trends. Unemployment’s Contribution to Poverty The labor market in Myanmar has been severely affected by the military coup in February 2021. These disruptions have led to significant unemployment and underemployment, which in turn contribute to rising poverty levels across the country. In 2021, an estimated 18.9 million people were employed, reflecting a loss of 1.6 million jobs (8%) compared to 2020 due to the military takeover and COVID-19. Industries such as construction, garments, and tourism were hit hardest, with employment dropping by 31%, 27%, and 30%, respectively, compared to the previous year. Since 2019, the combined impacts of the pandemic and political crisis have resulted in 3.2 million people (14% of the workforce) losing employment. Despite a reported decline in official unemployment rates—from 3% in 2022 to 2.8% in 2023—these figures fail to reflect the true challenges in the labor market. Many workers have been pushed into informal, low-paying, and unstable jobs, while reports of labor rights violations further underscore the precarious conditions faced by workers across the country. Current Labor Market Situation As of December 2024, Myanmar's population is approximately 54.6 million, with a working-age population between 15 and 64 years at 68.4%. Of 22 million employed in the country, approximately 48.8 percent work in agriculture, 16.9 percent in industry, and 34.2 percent in service industry. The working-age population is projected to rise, reaching 39.2 million by 2030. However, employment gains have not kept pace with population growth, leading to a decline in the employment-to-population ratio, which dropped to 54.5% in 2022- a decline of 8.2 % from 2017. The decline is particularly severe in conflict-prone regions, where instability eroded economic activity and labor opportunities. A significant recent development affecting the labor market is the enforcement of a military conscription law in February 2024, which mandates military service for men aged 18 to 35 and women aged 18 to 27, with evasion punishable by up to five years’ imprisonment. This has triggered widespread fear and migration, especially from urban areas to rural regions and neighboring countries such as Thailand. Labor shortages have become critical, as many employees have resigned to evade conscription. The mass exodus of young people has intensified the labor crisis, further straining an already fragile economy and contributing to the rise of child labor. In response, the garment and construction industries have been forced to increase wages to retain employees, but these efforts have not been enough to attract skilled laborers. Trends in Unemployment From 2004 to 2020, unemployment in Myanmar remained low, typically below 1.5%. However, unemployment spiked sharply to 4.34% in 2021, the highest in nearly two decades. This jump is attributable to mass layoffs in the public and formal private sectors after the coup. Additionally, international sanctions—including targeted measures by the EU and other countries—and Myanmar’s FATF blacklisting in 2022 deterred foreign investment, prompting the withdrawal of numerous Western companies and exacerbating the economic downturn. The garment sector shed an estimated 300,000 jobs after the closure of over 200 factories. Unemployment rates slightly decreased to 2.83–2.84% in 2022 and 2023, but the recovery remains fragile due to ongoing political instability and sanctions. The trends suggest that Myanmar may face challenges in stabilizing its labor market without substantial governance and economic policy changes. Economic Consequences of Unemployment The sharp rise in unemployment since the 2021 coup has worsened poverty and weakened the labor market. Key consequences include: Declining Job Quality: The share of wage employment decreased from 36.8% in 2017 to just 28.9% in 2022, indicating that many workers have shifted toward self-employment or informal jobs with lower returns. Impact on Women: Women have been disproportionately affected; their unemployment rate increased fivefold from just 2% in 2017 to approximately 10.2% in 2022, reflecting severe job losses across both public and private sectors. Real Wage Decline: Real wages have declined by approximately 15% between 2017 and 2022, forcing over 70% of households into asset liquidation or borrowing as coping mechanisms due to wage losses. Reduced Labor Productivity: Labor productivity has also suffered significantly; estimates show an 8% drop in productivity during 2021, followed by a further 2% loss early in 2022. This indicates that skilled workers are increasingly channeled into low-value sectors like agriculture. Brain Drain: Since the coup, 1.6 million people have lost their jobs, including many from high-skill sectors. The emigration of skilled workers—especially those aged 18–25 years—has further weakened Myanmar's labor market. These trends underline Myanmar’s economy’s deep structural challenges, with long-term implications for growth, poverty alleviation, and social stability. The interconnectedness of unemployment and poverty creates a vicious cycle, further undermining the well-being of vulnerable populations in Myanmar. Conclusion The relationship between inflation and unemployment is complex. High unemployment keeps wages low, while low unemployment can drive wages up, leading to inflation. In Myanmar, inflation and unemployment are rising, creating unique challenges that deepen poverty. Studies by the University of Ibadan show that rising inflation, unemployment shocks, and population growth strongly affect poverty in the short term. But, long-term strategies focusing on sustainable economic growth, stable governance, and investment in human capital are essential to breaking the cycle of poverty and achieving the SDG of eradicating poverty by 2030. However, the success of long-term strategies is deeply tied to political stability, which unfortunately appears increasingly uncertain and fragile in Myanmar.

Thailand’s Defective Democracy Under Elite Control – Analysis	By Paul Chambers Thailand’s political landscape in 2024 continued to reflect a deeply compromised democratic system — characterised by human rights violations and persistent authoritarian tendencies. While the country maintained a superficial pluralism through elected institutions, real power remained concentrated between the royal palace and the Shinawatra political dynasty. The Pheu Thai–led coalition government demonstrated some progressive impulses. It improved social equality by introducing legislation to legalise same-sex marriage and granting citizenship for 483,000 long-term migrants and children born in Thailand. It also attempted to increase government control over the military, though this initiative ultimately failed due to opposition from coalition partners. But human rights violations have remained appalling in Thailand. According to Thai Lawyers for Human Rights, from 18 July 2020 to 31 August 2024 at least 1956 individuals were charged for participating in public assemblies or expressing political opinions across 1302 cases. Of these, 273 individuals in 306 cases have been charged with lese-majeste — insults to the monarchy punishable by up to 15 years in prison. Several high-profile cases highlighted the severity of lese-majeste. Activist Netiporn Saneesankhom died in detention after a prolonged hunger strike. Lawyer Anon Nampa was sentenced to 16 years in prison, with additional charges pending. Move Forward Party MP Chonticha Jaengraew was sentenced to two years, though she remains on bail and is appealing. In a politically motivated move, ex-prime minister Thaksin Shinawatra was indicted on lese-majeste charges, with his trial set to begin in July 2025 — relating to comments made in 2015. Thai security officials were reportedly responsible for the arbitrary arrest, detention, extortion and forced return of Myanmar refugees — including 650 individuals deported in a single day on 24 April 2024. Reports also emerged of three Thai soldiers allegedly torturing and killing a Burmese national along the border. Another Burmese was quickly arrested and imprisoned for the crime though evidence clearly pointed to Thai security forces, a troubling example of institutional impunity. The continuing counterinsurgency in Thailand’s Deep South has involved multiple human rights violations by the Thai security forces. In October 2024, Thailand’s judiciary dismissed charges against security officials implicated in the deaths of 78 Muslim protestors during the notorious 25 October 2004 Tak Bai incident, citing the expiration of the 20-year statute of limitations and failure to arrest suspects. Democratic institutions also faced significant erosion. A quasi-election for Senators — where only candidates could vote — resulted in a chamber dominated by a Pheu Thai rival, the Bhumjai Thai party. Bhumjai Thai’s victory derived from a masterful use of clientelism and election irregularities. This process effectively guaranteed that the Senate would vote against any progressive legislation from the Lower House. On 7 August 2024, the arch-royalist Constitutional Court disbanded the progressive Move Forward party (MFP), which had won the 2023 election, finding it guilty of treason for advocating reform of lese-majeste. The ruling banned the party’s leadership from politics for ten years. The National Anti-Corruption Commission also ordered an investigation into 44 ex-MFP MPs who had signed an agreement to amend the lese majeste law, potentially leading to a lifelong ban from politics. Political volatility peaked in mid-August 2024. On 9 August, ex-Move Forward MPs regrouped under the new People’s Party. But this party was smaller and its leadership was not as charismatic. The People’s Party began losing by-elections in two-party MP contests and provincial-level elections against Pheu Thai. Suddenly, on 14 August, the Constitutional Court dismissed prime minister Srettha Thavisin for malfeasance. He was replaced two days later by Paetongtarn Shinawatra — Thaksin’s daughter and the fourth member of the Shinawatra family to serve as prime minister. This move possibly signalled the palace and wider elites’ dissatisfaction regarding Thaksin’s political ambitions. Royals may later force Paetongtarn to step down if they think Thaksin is overreaching into politics through his daughter. The annual 1 October military reshuffle produced a new line-up favoured by the palace. Incoming army commander Pana Klaewblaudtuk secured his role until 2027 — positioning him to potentially lead a future putsch, though this is unlikely in early 2025. Attempts to amend the constitution failed in November. The People’s Party and Pheu Thai party could not replace the 2017 junta-created constitution with a more progressive charter that would, among other things, allow an elected Senate,with Senate opposition blocking efforts to simplify the amendment process. Diplomatic tensions emerged in December when the Royal Thai Navy broke with the government over a maritime border dispute with Cambodia, declaring that it would adhere to royal commands rather than prime ministerial orders. Throughout 2024, Thailand remained a defective democracy dominated by two levels of elites — the palace-controlled security apparatus and the Shinawatra political dynasty. This asymmetrical relationship between the palace and Thaksin seems based upon mutual interests — but also Thaksin not overstepping what royals perceive should be his limits. The Shinawatras may face political trouble in 2025. Any Thai–Cambodian resolution to the boundary dispute might set off nationalist opposition to Paetongtarn’s government. Thaksin could also easily be forced from Thailand if he angers the palace and is found guilty of lese-majeste. Similarly, the arch-royalist Constitutional Court could rapidly find Paetongtarn guilty of malfeasance. If so, Bhumjai Thai party leader Anutin Charnvirakul could easily become the next prime minister. Though less likely, a military coup against Paetongtarn is also always possible. Thailand in 2024 was first under the control of the palace, and under lesser domination by Thaksin. This political status looks set to persevere for the immediate future.

Japan And India: 20 Years Of Strategic Partnership – Analysis	By Pratnashree Basu and Tripti Neb Over the past two decades, Japan-India ties have evolved into one of the most prominent and pivotal partnerships in the Indo-Pacific region. While Shinzo Abe is often regarded as the one who succeeded in cementing mutual trust between the countries, the foundations for this relationship were established much before, during the administrations of Yukio Hatoyama, Naoto Kan, and Yoshihiko Noda, all of whom served before Abe's return to office in 2012. Despite their relatively short tenures, these leaders played an essential role in advancing political, economic and strategic cooperation with India, recognising its significance in promoting regional stability and balancing China’s growing influence. This trend of deepening bilateral ties has been sustained under subsequent leaders, such as Fumio Kishida, and is expected to continue evolving under the current Ishiba administration. The era of strategic reset Starting with Yukio Hatoyama’s tenure as Prime Minister in 2009, Japan began the process of recalibrating its foreign policy in the wake of a global economic slowdown and shifting regional dynamics. Hatoyama’s administration centred its foreign policy around the idea of an 'East Asian Community', a vision that sought closer regional integration while also creating stronger economic multilateral relations. According to experts in Tokyo, India, as a rising power and the world’s largest democracy, proved a natural fit for this framework. The Hatoyama government placed significant emphasis on strengthening economic ties with India, choosing to begin projects such as the Delhi-Mumbai Industrial Corridor to boost India’s manufacturing industries collaboratively. Japan’s role in the corridor, which symbolised the intersection of economic collaboration and strategic connectivity, emphasised its acknowledgement of India’s potential as a vital partner in the Indo-Pacific. Japanese investments through the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) began flowing in to aid Indian infrastructure and industrial development. However, Hatoyama’s cautious approach to defence cooperation reflected a greater hesitation to counteract China, even as the economic partnership with India deepened. The era of strategic consolidation Naoto Kan’s administration, succeeding Hatoyama in 2010, faced significant challenges due to the Great East Japan Earthquake and the Fukushima nuclear disaster of 2011. Despite these calamities, Kan worked towards solidifying Japan’s relationship with India in the footsteps of his predecessor. His administration oversaw the commencement of the Japan-India Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement, a landmark deal that aimed to reduce trade barriers and boost bilateral commerce to reach bilateral trade worth US$25 billion by 2014. Kan’s administration recognised the strategic importance of diversifying Japan’s energy partnerships in the wake of its nuclear energy scepticism, leading to continued discussions on a civil nuclear cooperation agreement with India. Although a formal civil nuclear deal would not be signed until 2017, these negotiations reflected Japan’s growing trust in India’s role as a prominent nuclear state. On the maritime front, Kan’s administration took part in several series of the Malabar joint naval exercises with India, indicating increased interest in maintaining the freedom of navigation and stability in the Indian Ocean. While Kan’s domestic circumstances limited the scope of his foreign policy to an extent, his tenure contributed to the steady institutionalisation of Japan-India ties. Succeeding Kan, Yoshihiko Noda took charge of the administration in 2011, bringing a more focused approach to defence cooperation with India and recognising the need for strategic convergence between the two nations in the Indo-Pacific. During Noda’s tenure, Japan refreshed its engagement with India through the Japan-India Strategic and Global Partnership, highlighting not just economic partnership but also security and defence cooperation. His administration oversaw the initiation of technology transfer talks with India, marking a significant shift in Japan’s traditionally pacifist post-war stance. Noda also encouraged closer collaboration on maritime security, including intelligence sharing and joint exercises in 2012, aimed at ensuring the safety of the Indo-Pacific, given China’s rise to power in the region. These efforts aligned with India’s interest in strengthening its defence relationships and reducing its dependence on traditional partners such as Russia. Economically, Noda’s government accelerated investments in India’s manufacturing and urban infrastructure, particularly through the promotion of Japanese participation in India’s smart city initiatives. The era of strategic elevation By the time Shinzo Abe returned to power in 2012, Japan-India relations were primed for a significant leap forward, leading up to one of the strongest periods in Japan-India bilateral relations. Abe, known for his strategic vision and commitment to counterbalancing China’s growing regional influence, placed India at the cornerstone of his Free and Open Indo-Pacific (FOIP) strategy. Undoubtedly, Abe’s key contribution was this FOIP vision, which continues to play a pivotal role in consolidating Tokyo’s strategic ties with key regional and global partners. FOIP has become the backbone of Japan-India relations, emphasising shared values and interests in the Indo-Pacific. The Abe administration also cemented the annual '2+2' dialogues involving foreign affairs and defence ministers, indicating the strength of strategic alignment ties between the two nations. Defence cooperation reached unprecedented heights, with Japan becoming a permanent participant in the Malabar naval exercises and signing agreements for the transfer of defence equipment and technology to India. Additionally, Abe deepened economic ties with India, pouring heavy investments into India’s infrastructure projects, including US$15 billion in the Mumbai-Ahmedabad High-Speed Rail project. These initiatives, funded in part by JICA, symbolised mutual trust and a long-term vision for collaboration. India and Japan, under Abe’s administration, focused not only on economic and defence fronts but also sufficiently on cultural and soft power diplomacy. This was famously institutionalised with the declaration of 2017 as the 'Year of India-Japan Friendly Exchanges'. The Abe administration expanded the number of scholarships for Indian students to study in Japan, promoted people-to-people ties, and welcomed India’s support regarding the forthcoming Tokyo Olympics in 2020. These efforts successfully enhanced mutual understanding and goodwill, complementing growing strategic alignment. Abe’s tenure marked the flourishing of the Japan-India relationship into a comprehensive partnership, setting a high benchmark for future leaders to follow. The era of pragmatic continuity and enhanced engagement Yoshihide Suga's tenure focused on maintaining Shinzo Abe’s legacy, particularly in advancing the Free and Open Indo-Pacific (FOIP) vision and strengthening collaboration in the Quadrilateral security dialogue—a grouping of Australia, India, Japan, and the United States. He emphasised economic resilience through supply chain partnerships and supported India during the COVID-19 pandemic, consolidating the strategic partnership’s momentum. Fumio Kishida, who assumed the role of Prime Minister in 2021, has heavily built upon this legacy, focusing on emerging areas such as cybersecurity, supply chain resilience, and green energy. Recognising India’s critical role in diversifying global supply chains, Kishida’s administration focused on developing alternatives to China’s dominance in industries such as semiconductors and rare earth elements, pledging US$42 billion worth of investments in India. Additionally, the Japan-India Digital Partnership, launched under Kishida, has fostered collaboration in areas such as artificial intelligence and supply chain technology since 2023. Kishida’s pragmatic approach to bilateral relations has ensured steady growth in both nations’ relationships, with a much-needed emphasis on innovation and sustainability. Looking at the road ahead, the administration of Shigeru Ishiba is likely to bring new dimensions to the Japan-India partnership. Ishiba, a strong advocate of proactive security posture, is likely to prioritise defence cooperation and multilateral engagement with India and the Indo-Pacific. His administration could accelerate joint technology development, expand military exercises, and strengthen intelligence-sharing mechanisms among both nations, owing to the growing need to counteract China. Moreover, Ishiba’s interest in space exploration and advanced technology could open new avenues for bilateral collaboration in cutting-edge fields such as satellite technology. Nonetheless, even as the geopolitical landscape continues to evolve, Japan and India’s partnership will remain a critical pillar of regional stability, underscoring shared democratic values and a commitment to a stable international order.

45 Days In Ukraine, 1,000 Days In War – Essay	By Kaspars Ģērmanis (FPRI) -- The title of this essay would have been a little bit different if I had spent five more days in Odesa as planned. '50 days in Ukraine, 1,005 days in war.' That would be a neat summary of my time in the country, where I visited several cities and experienced everyday life. That’s what this essay is about: personal feelings in a country engulfed in war. However, because of the Russian air attack on Odesa on November 18, I changed my plans. I left Ukraine on November 19 — the 1,000th day since the full-scale war began on February 24, 2022. I left not so much out of fear — I was already used to the sirens warning of air alerts, and I had experienced the attacks of the Iranian Shahed drones. Odesans themselves told me not to stay, and I guess I understand why. They have seen and experienced too much to watch others take unnecessary risks. It’s not about courage anymore; it is about living in permanent stress, where one grows tired of heroism, courage, and killing. Nobody talks about these qualities. There is just a wish to have a normal life. A Brief Introduction About Myself and Ukraine This was my sixth and longest visit to Ukraine, and my second during the full-scale war. My story with Ukraine started when I was around 13 years old. I played ice hockey, and my team participated in the Eastern European Hockey League competitions. Latvian, Belarusian, and Ukrainian teams took part in this tournament once a year, and we went to Kyiv. Back in Latvia, people asked me how it was: 'Did you like Ukraine?' I answered, 'Yes,' and it was an honest answer. Later, as a volunteer in Switzerland, I met other Ukrainians with whom I still have very friendly relationships. When Russia annexed Crimea in 2014 and started a war in Donbas — eastern Ukraine — it seemed unbelievable. A war in Europe? In the same Europe that, after WWII, despite the war in the Balkans in the 1990s, continued to insist on the principle of 'never again'? Sure, it was 'other Europe,' not pacifistic Western Europe, but still. February 24, 2022, was unbelievable for Ukrainians. Some remember thinking that Russia would only attack the eastern part of Ukraine to enlarge territories already ruled by the Kremlin. Despite the Russian army being concentrated on three sides of Ukraine — from Belarus, Crimea, and the border with Russia — most people I spoke to did not believe a full-scale war would occur. First, Ukraine and Russia share close ties. On a personal level, many have relatives in Russia, and vice versa. Now Ukrainians hate this phrase, but for a long time, both nations were referred to as 'brother nations.' As one of my acquaintances in Kyiv said, ironically, 'Our brother — or as they called themselves, ‘the big brother’ — attacked us.' Second, it seemed unbelievable that war had begun. In Russia, Ukraine, the Baltic countries, and Belarus, the generation that experienced WWII used to say that the worst that could ever happen is war — it is a saying well-known to succeeding generations. Thus, the idea of war had become something unthinkable. In 2022, I wanted to help Ukraine but did not know how. Just going to Ukraine without a clear plan and doing something for the sake of doing it would be silly. I had not visited my friends in Ukraine because I did not want to appear as a 'catastrophe tourist.' I didn’t want to be one of those people who observes others’ tragedies and then returns to his safe country, home, job, and comfortable everyday life. If I can do nothing, I have no reason to be in Ukraine. However, in November and December 2023, I visited Lviv for two weeks. This is the largest western Ukrainian city and one of the largest cities in Ukraine, located near the border with Poland. Ukrainians encouraged me to come again because it is nice to see foreigners in Ukraine. Besides, the situation in Lviv is relatively calm. The experience stayed with me, so in the summer I decided again to leave for Ukraine. The Think Tank Approach and Trump Perspective My colleagues at the Center for Geopolitical Studies in Riga supported my most recent trip to the country. They suggested creating a network of Latvian-Ukrainian think tanks — 'LatUkrNet' ('Latvian–Ukrainian Network') — intended to bring Ukraine closer to the West, the European Union, and NATO. My visit began in Kyiv, where I met representatives from eight organizations, most of which are Ukrainian think tanks in various fields: international politics, economics, legal affairs, law, the fight against fake news and disinformation, forensics, social psychology, and political psychology. All of them are eager to bring Ukraine closer to the Western world. The Center for Geopolitical Studies in Riga is happy to implement various research projects, invite Ukrainian experts to Latvia for conferences and to work with Latvian students, and help establish cooperation with other Latvian institutions or NGOs. This is how we at the Center for Geopolitical Studies can support Ukraine during these times. We hope for the best results. Who else can help Ukraine? Europe, the United States, or more specifically, Donald Trump, who recently reclaimed his position as US president-elect? It seems that Ukrainians do not know what to expect from Trump. One woman just shakes her head when she hears his name. 'What’s the difference? This war will never end,' she says, finding solace in religion. 'If there is someone who prays for you, everything will be good, even if you have to stay in Odesa,' she indicates to me. Another perspective heard in Ukraine is that Trump is better than the Democrats. True, he is unpredictable, but both attacks in 2014 and 2022 on Ukraine occurred under Democratic presidents: Barack Obama and Joe Biden, respectively. Opinions that the Democrats are too soft and unable to respond with a 'fist against fist' approach in international politics can sometimes be heard. There is hope that Trump can confront Russian dictator Vladimir Putin in a way that he understands better. In Eastern Europe, discussions and compromises can be viewed as signs of weakness and cowardice. In Lviv, I did not hear a single air raid for about a week before the US presidential election. On November 6, there were three of them. However, this was the exception. I stayed in Lviv until November 16, and the situation was quite calm. The Different Faces of War In regions where war is distant, life seems similar to peacetime, but this is just a mirage. In many cities and towns, there are memorial alleys with photos of fallen soldiers and fields of graves decorated with Ukrainian blue-yellow, Ukrainian Insurgent Army (Ukrainska Povstanska Armiya) red-black, and battalion flags. Pubs, at least officially, are open until 11 pm, and the number of soccer fans attending games is very limited, to avoid giving Russia a reason to launch rockets and kill a large crowd. In Kyiv and Lviv, people go to pubs, performers of popular songs entertain in the squares, and young people enjoy life by drinking beer in parks. Occasionally, stark contrasts in experiences appear: One side is at war, and due to a shortage of soldiers, has few opportunities to return home for a respite or troop rotation, while the other side 'lives as before.' This question particularly concerns men. There are checkpoints on the streets and highways that stop men and check documents to determine why they are not in the military. I was also stopped several times, but when they saw my Latvian passport, their interest disappeared. However, those away from the battlefields also do what they can to support Ukraine. They search for vehicles in Europe for the army, donate money or goods, or build drones. In Uzhhorod, a city on the border with Slovakia, the pastor prays for local men who have gone to war, as well as for cities that have endured further rocket fire: Sumy, Kharkiv, Dnipro, and other locations. However, the chance to go to the pub and watch a soccer match while sitting in a tree or standing behind the stadium fence, due to the attendance limit, is a source of power and strength to keep resisting and fighting. There is also humor — though often it’s dark humor. 'Don’t forget to take a flashlight,' writes one of the leaders of a Kyiv think tank that joined 'LatUkrNet.' When Russians destroy the city’s energy system, the public lighting stops working. In Odesa, after attacks, electricity can go out for hours; however, the internet works autonomously for five hours, explains a resident. Everything Ends Quickly in Odesa In Uzhhorod, where air raids are rare, I visited the shelter for the first time. I witnessed an argument between the train station administrator and a woman from Odesa who did not want to go to the shelter. She says she is used to the anxiety of the air raid siren because it is common in Odesa. The administrator stands firm, and both the Odesa woman and I end up in the shelter. Noticing that I speak very little Ukrainian, she asks if I speak Russian. Yes, I do, but I avoid doing so in Ukraine. The Odesa woman replies in a friendly yet proud manner, saying, 'All Ukrainians know Russian.' Another observation: In Kyiv, especially in Lviv and Uzhhorod, people refuse to speak Russian. Locals tend to be very definite — this is the language of the enemy. Even those who did not know English responded kindly and with a smile … in Ukrainian. I understood this attitude; it was not personal. A few hours before traveling by train to Odesa from Uzhhorod, I found out that there had been a rocket attack on Odesa. Like other Eastern and Southern Ukrainian cities, Odesa is more often targeted by missiles than Western regions. Later, it became known that 10 people were killed and even more were injured. While everything was calm in Lviv and Uzhhorod, and also in Kyiv, except for a couple of distant shootings near my guesthouse with Iranian Shaheds, the attack in Odesa reminded me of a harsher everyday life. The proud but kind woman from Odesa, along with other locals, advised me to leave Odesa immediately. The owner of the Airbnb apartment, with whom I had already made arrangements, also recommended that I go and return when the situation is better. I understood that I had no reason to stay in Odesa. I was in Kyiv for work and to see some friends, and in Lviv to meet friends and attend to some duties. Uzhhorod? My curiosity. But Odesa? I had heard a lot about this great city. In other words, curiosity also played a part. 'You are welcome, but next time,' I heard from the locals. As I already wrote, if I cannot be useful, then there is no point in staying and watching other people’s tragedies. Odesans would like to be in my place because I had a chance to leave. And I left. But I hope to return — both to Odesa and to Ukraine. I truly hope so. About the author: Kaspars Ģērmanis is a researcher at the Center for Geopolitical Studies in Riga.

Inheritance Tax Hikes Threaten Farmers’ Property Rights In The UK...	By Owen Ashworth London was flooded recently with hundreds of farmers, protesting the recent changes made by the Labour government to inheritance tax. Thousands of farmers feel that their generational culture is truly at stake with the changes to inheritance tax. The Labour government claims that the changes to inheritance tax will affect very few farmers. The modus operandi of left-leaning statists is to claim that increases to any form of taxation only harms the most well off within the group it affects because they know the public need to be persuaded that it won’t affect them, only those with the broadest shoulders. These changes in inheritance tax make very little sense for many reasons so it is not difficult to understand why it caused such an uproar. The Changes and Claims Made The government has scoured the country for areas to gather more funds for the National Health Service and in the budget—without mentioning it in the budget statement—set their sights on farmers to provide what they can for our health service. The changes include discarding the full exemption that comes with Agricultural Property Relief (APR), combining it with Business Property Relief (BPR), but capping the relief at £1 million meaning farmers will now pay inheritance tax on all their land and all their business assets over the first £1 million. The government is claiming that only around 500 farms would be affected—the implication reinforcing their narrative that only the wealthiest farmers are paying. However, the figure comes from the total sum of claims for APR currently without considering BPR suggesting the government concluded, wrongly or perhaps purposefully, that an APR claim was the total sum of a farm but it is hard to plead ignorance when APR is known for only applying to land and not machinery. The government has caught itself in a thoroughly questionable position. On the one hand, they are claiming that this will affect very few people—the wealthiest farmers—claiming it will raise around £500 million, yet they are providing all the ways that the people affected can avoid most of the tax. Throughout this strange discourse, the government has not admitted whether they have taken these exemptions into account. Common sense tells us that the government will not raise anywhere near that figure so the question beckons: why are they making these changes? The Origins of the Policy The government has admitted that the theoretical foundation for the changes to inheritance tax come from the Centre for the Analysis of Taxation. The Centre is run by Arun Advani and Andy Summers who happen to be Wealth Tax Commissioners that push for huge increases in taxation. Recently, the think tank published a report on inheritance tax where they suggested that the cap should be set at £500,000 which, even they admit, could cause excessive fragmentation of farm land. To counteract excessive fragmentation, Advani advocates for 'the state taking part-ownership of land and becoming the landlord to tenant farmers.' When it comes to the risks associated with food security, Advani states that state subsidies should be given for 'specific activities desired e.g. farming particular produce' whilst other proposals include removing inheritance tax relief for bequests to charities because it 'redirects tax revenues towards the charitable preferences of a very small number of people.' The government has not announced they will be carrying out any of these proposals but they have admitted this is where they got inspiration for the changes in inheritance tax. Why This Is Important Defenders of the Labour Party claim that the government has not announced anything that mirrors these proposals so critics should not worry, they claim, as good statists often do, that they have merely taken the good ideas from the report instead of the insane ones. The issue arises insofar as that it’s not beyond the realm of possibility that the government is way off the mark in regards to the amount of farms that will be affected by these changes, it could end up affecting thousands of medium-sized farmers who are asset rich but cash poor. Farmer’s wages are notoriously small compared to their assets. So, how do the farmers who get caught up paying inheritance tax come up with the money to pay the tax? They sell off bits of their land to pay for it. If the number is indeed substantially higher, does this not constitute, if not come very close to, 'excessive fragmentation'? Austrians know that government intervention begets government intervention so it is not conspiratorial that the government could take on the more radical proposals in the report if they are, supposedly, shocked by huge sell offs of farmland causing fragmentation. Worldviews Clash The Labour Government worldview is experiencing a mental civil war. They believe that huge corporations are morally repugnant, avaricious, and out of control. It is why they spent much of the election campaign promising that any tax increases would fall solely on big business because they have been allowed to roam free by the previous Conservative Government. However, their inheritance tax changes will cause an outcome that contradicts this worldview. Those who own truly gargantuan farms who do generate a high income will not be forced to sell any of their land since they have the money to pay the tax. The farmers caught in the middle—who make a relatively low income but have land assets in their farms—will be forced to sell part of their land and the participants in the market who will come buying will be those wealthy farmers. This is just a further centralization of the market into the hands of the truly wealthy which Labour purport to wish to prevent. To Austrians, this is an obvious outcome of this policy, yet there should be no underestimating the Labour Government’s ability to be perplexed by this outcome and desire more state intervention to correct this. In this way, it is evident that their worldview cannot, in any sense, claim to act as a restraint on the state. If only the Labour Party could connect the dots, realize that their perplexity at the spawning of incessant issues arises—not out of the ether—but from their own actions, the cycle of self-destruction could be broken. Some Other Arguments for the Change of Policy A quick address to some of the justifications for this policy is warranted. Multiple professors from high-status universities have claimed that the inheritance tax exemption for farmland introduced in the 1980s caused wealthy people to purchase farmland to avoid inheritance tax, thus, farmland values skyrocketed. The land value being higher also causes higher costs for the farmers, the implication being that scrapping the exemption will help the farmers by reducing their costs. If the exemption caused land values to skyrocket by 'a fourfold increase,' then why didn’t it happen until the early 2000s? Farmland values shot up in 2003, coincidentally, when the European Union started handing out subsidies based on land area. It is no wonder that farmland values spiked when this happened. There has been a more blatantly nefarious justification for this policy from a former advisor to Tony Blair. John McTernan suggested doing to the farmers 'what Margaret Thatcher did to the miners' meaning destroying the industry. McTernan added, 'If people are so upset that they want to go on the streets and spread slurry then we don’t need small farmers,' and that, 'It’s an industry we can do without.' This isn’t a fringe member of the party. McTernan is still very influential within the Labour Party and used to be Tony Blair’s political secretary. It is very unlikely that it is only McTernan that holds this view, thus, we can reasonably suppose that there is a group that genuinely hate the farming industry and desire the destruction of British farming. Perhaps they only hate the smaller farms, but this just poses more questions about their motives. There is nothing more spiteful, immoral, or destructive for society than political actors who believe that because they harbor hatred for an industry, that they can destroy it using the levers of the state. These actors feel they are superior, completely unjustifiably, and can simply extinguish livelihoods because they disapprove of it. Where will the Government go from here? The Labour government has a humongous majority in the British parliament so they will most likely hold their ground on this policy. Unless changes are made, it should be suspected that the farming industry will continue its centralization into the hands of the truly wealthy. There will be a huge change in the composition of production with the remaining farms as the government encourages certain activities like 'rewilding.' British farming will change as we know it and we will hear utter confusion from the political elites when reality bites.

Witches, Covid, And Our Dictatorial Democracy – OpEd	On December 1, President Joe Biden announced that he was pardoning his son Hunter for all the crimes he committed from January 1, 2014 through December 1, 2024. Biden’s sweeping pardon of all of his son’s abuses epitomizes how presidents and their families are now above the law. It also illustrates how the 'King James Test for American Democracy' could become the death of the Constitution. The American Revolution was heavily influenced by a political backlash that began across the ocean in the early 1600s. King James I claimed a 'divine right' to unlimited power in England, sparking fierce clashes with Parliament. Since the 9/11 attacks, some of the same moral and legal principles have been advanced in this nation, but few people recognize the historical roots. Before he became king of England in 1604, James was king of Scotland. He cemented his claims to absolute power thereby launching witch panics and burning hundreds of Scottish women alive to sanctify his power. Harsh methods were not a problem because James insisted that God would never allow an innocent person to be accused of witchcraft. 'While James’s assertion of his [Scottish] royal authority is evident in his highly unorthodox act of taking control of the pre-trial examinations, it is his absolutism which is most apparent in his advocating the use of torture to force confessions during the investigations,' according to the University of Texas’s Allegra Geller, author of Daemonologie and Divine Right: The Politics of Witchcraft in Late Sixteenth-Century Scotland. Torture produced 'confessions' that spurred further panic and the destruction of far more victims. England did not have similar witch panics because officials were almost entirely prevented from using torture to generate false confessions. James justified the illicit torture, 'asserting his belief that as an anointed king, he was above the law.' After Queen Elizabeth died and James became king, he vowed that he had no obligation to respect the rights of the English people: 'A good king will frame his actions according to the law, yet he is not bound thereto but of his own goodwill.' And 'law' was whatever James decreed. Nor did he flatter the men elected to the House of Commons: 'In the Parliament (which is nothing else but the head court of the king and his vassals) the laws are but craved by his subjects and only made by him at their rogation.' James proclaimed that God intended for the English to live at his mercy: 'It is certain that patience, earnest prayers to God, and amendment of their lives are the only lawful means to move God to relieve them of their heavy curse' of oppression. And there was no way for Parliament to subpoena God to confirm his blanket endorsement of King James. James reminded his subjects that 'even by God himself [kings] are called Gods.' Seventeenth-century Englishmen recognized the grave peril in the king’s words. A 1621 Parliament report eloquently warned: 'If [the king] founds his authority on arbitrary and dangerous principles, it is requisite to watch him with the same care, and to oppose him with the same vigor, as if he indulged himself in all the excesses of cruelty and tyranny.' Historian Thomas Macaulay observed in 1831, 'The policy of wise tyrants has always been to cover their violent acts with popular forms. James was always obtruding his despotic theories on his subjects without the slightest necessity. His foolish talk exasperated them infinitely more than forced loans would have done.' Macaulay scoffed that James was 'in his own opinion, the greatest master of kingcraft that ever lived, but who was, in truth, one of those kings whom God seems to send for the express purpose of hastening revolutions.' After James’s son, Charles I, relied on the same dogmas and ravaged much of the nation, he was beheaded. Charles I’s son ascended to the English throne in 1660, but his abuses spurred the Glorious Revolution of 1688 and sweeping reforms that sought to forever curb the power of monarchs. A century and a half after King James denigrated Parliament, a similar declaration of absolute power spurred the American Revolution. The Stamp Act of 1765 compelled Americans to purchase British stamps for all legal papers, newspapers, cards, advertisements, and even dice. After violent protests erupted, Parliament rescinded the Stamp Act but passed the Declaratory Act, which decreed that Parliament 'had, hath, and of right ought to have, full power and authority to make laws and statutes of sufficient force and validity to bind the colonies and people of America, subjects of the crown of Great Britain, in all cases whatsoever.' The Declaratory Act canonized Parliament’s right to use and abuse Americans as it pleased. The Declaratory Act ignited an intellectual powder keg among colonists determined not to live under the heel of either monarchs or parliaments. Thomas Paine wrote in 1776 that 'in America, the law is king. For as in absolute governments the King is law, so in free countries the law ought to be King; and there ought to be no other.' The Founding Fathers, having endured oppression, sought to build a 'government of laws, not of men.' That meant that 'government in all its actions is bound by rules fixed and announced beforehand — rules which make it possible to foresee with fair certainty how the authority will use its coercive powers,' as Nobel Laureate Friedrich Hayek noted in 1944. For generations, American politicians spoke reverently of the Constitution as America’s highest law. But in recent years, the Constitution has fallen into disrepute. The rule of law now means little more than the enforcement of the secret memos of the commander-in-chief. We now have the 'King James Test for American Democracy.' As long as the president does not formally proclaim himself a tyrant, we are obliged to pretend he is obeying the Constitution. Government is not lawless regardless of how many laws it violates — unless and until the president formally announces he is above the law. While King James bluntly declared his right to absolute power 400 years ago, recent presidents only make such claims via their lawyers, often in secret documents that citizens are supposed to never see. The most important recent change in American political thinking is nonchalance regarding government criminality. The notion that 'it is not a crime if government does it' is the new conventional wisdom in Washington. It doesn’t matter which agency or official broke the law. Instead, the only prudent response is to pretend nothing is amiss. Nowadays, every act of government is judged in a vacuum, as if every constitutional violation is a fluke. This is the mirror image of how the Founding Fathers viewed government power. In 1768, John Dickinson wrote that colonists fixated on 'not what evil has actually attended particular measures but, what evil, in the nature of things, is likely to attend them.' Dickinson pointed out that because 'nations in general, are not apt to think until they feel…nations have lost their liberty.' The Founding Fathers looked at the liberties they were losing, while modern Americans focus myopically on the rights they supposedly still retain. Law professor John Phillip Reid, in his seminal work The Concept of Liberty in the Age of the American Revolution, observed that liberty in the 18th century was 'largely thought of as freedom from arbitrary government….The less a law restrained the citizen, and the more it restrained government, the better the law.' But government officials now claim unlimited discretion to define the law and their own prerogatives. Jack Goldsmith, who headed the Justice Department’s Office of Legal Counsel in 2003–04, later explained how top Bush officials dealt with 'laws they didn’t like: they blew through them in secret based on flimsy legal opinions that they guarded closely so no one could question the legal basis for the operations.' It is no longer a question of having good laws, including laws that permit officials limited flexibility for contingencies. The rule of law has come to mean nothing more than finding a single lawyer who will say 'Yes, Master!' to his political overlords. But it is folly to make the survival of liberty hinge on some lawyer’s sense of shame. If the Iraq war had not turned into a debacle, most of the media and the political ruling class would have continued deferring to President George W. Bush almost across the board. As long as his popularity ratings were high, he could do little or no wrong. America’s 'best and brightest' were as naive or craven as the courtiers who defended the mass burning of Scottish women 400+ years earlier. The Constitution’s checks and balances failed to deter recent administrations from erecting the legal scaffolding of dictatorship. Instead, implausible denials of seizing excessive power have been followed by 'dictatorial apathy.' Lawless power grabs have become another background noise in Washington. Presidents and their legal teams can claim absolute power — and almost no one inside the government or the Justice Department blows the whistle. President Bush could boast that he was obeying the law because his appointees assured him that he was the law. Legions of government employees safeguarded their careers by going along and enforcing Bush-era absolutist legal doctrines. That settled any doubts about whether Justice Department officials would be willing tools for future presidents who trample the Constitution. Inside the Beltway, a mystical adoration of power is taken as proof of wisdom. In 2007, Bush nominated former federal judge Michael Mukasey as attorney general. Three years earlier, Mukasey had proclaimed that 'the hidden message in the structure of the Constitution' is that the government is entitled to 'the benefit of the doubt.' Mukasey did not reveal where the message was hidden. Mukasey’s 'benefit of the doubt' assertion may have helped him snare the top law-enforcement job in the nation, where he provided all the benefits Bush needed. The more power politicians capture, the more flattery they hear, and the more deluded they usually become. A phalanx of academics is always ready to cheer power-hungry presidents. In 2007, Harvard University government professor Harvey Mansfield exalted 'one-man rule' in a Wall Street Journal op-ed, scoffed at the rule of law, and declared that 'free government should show its respect for freedom even when it has to take it away.' And since the president is entitled to vast power, how would we know it is still a 'free government?' Presumably because it would be a crime to assert otherwise. Mansfield scorned contemporaries who 'forget to consider emergencies when liberties are dangerous and law does not apply.' The previous year, Mansfield wrote in a Weekly Standard article that the 'Office of President' is 'larger than the law' and that 'ordinary power needs to be supplemented or corrected by the extraordinary power of a prince, using wise discretion.' Mansfield also asserted that in emergencies, 'liberties are dangerous and law does not apply.' Such assertions may have swayed the National Endowment for the Humanities to select Mansfield in 2007 to deliver its Jefferson Lecture — 'the highest honor the federal government bestows for distinguished intellectual and public achievement in the humanities.' Mansfield’s cheerleading fits a pattern that goes back millennia. Throughout history, intellectuals downplayed the perils of political power. As long as court intellectuals were treated royally, rulers were indemnified for any and all abuses of the peasantry. As French philosopher Bertrand Jouvenal noted in 1945, 'Authority can never be too despotic for the speculative man, so long as he deludes himself that its arbitrary force will further his plans.' John Maynard Keynes, the most influential economist of the 20th century, exemplified this attitude. Keynes declared in 1944 that 'dangerous acts can be done safely in a community which thinks and feels rightly, which would be the way to hell if they were executed by those who think and feel wrongly.' And who is to judge whether the community 'thinks and feels rightly?' The same politicians seizing boundless power. The same passion for absolving high-level wrongdoers is often expressed in muffled terms by the editorial pages of the Washington Post and other leading papers. From 2008 onwards, the Post inveighed against permitting lawsuits that sought to hold former Attorney General John Ashcroft, former Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld, and other top officials liable for the torture and other abuses that occurred on their watch. One Post editorial fretted: 'Officials should not have to fear personal lawsuits for performing their duties in good faith and in violation of no established legal precedent.' This practically assumed the existence of 'good faith torture' — as if maiming and beating people to death was the moral equivalent of a clerical error. Unfortunately, the same 'absolve everything' mindset often prevails in the federal judiciary. Government officials have become practically untouchable at the same time that they have become far more dangerous. The Supreme Court has expanded sovereign immunity like a toxic legal cloud. As Senator John Taylor warned in 1821, 'There are no rights where there are no remedies, or where the remedies depend upon the will of the aggressor.' Nowadays, lawless government is simply benevolence on amphetamines. Rather than the rule of law, we now have the 'friend of humanity rhetorical test.' As long as politicians profess to be doing good, it is bad taste to quibble about legal technicalities or archaic constitutional clauses. The question is not what the president actually did but whether he 'meant well.' The word 'dictator' applies only to government officials who publicly announce plans to do bad things to good people. The Covid pandemic vivified how easily individual liberty can be obliterated in our time. A virus with a 99+% survival rate spawned a 100% presumption in favor of despotism. Citizens were assured that the biggest danger was that their rulers would have insufficient clout to force everyone else to stop working, stop worshipping, stay inside, and get injected. Zero freedom was the price for zero Covid, except that hundreds of millions of Americans still had Covid infections. Not a single government official has spent one day in jail for all the lies and crimes of the Covid mandates, lockdowns, censorship, and other abuses. There has even been no penalty for the federal officials who used American tax dollars to bankroll gain-of-function research at the Wuhan Institute of Virology, leading to a lab leak and millions of deaths around the world. Sen. Daniel Webster warned in 1837 that 'the Constitution was made to guard the people against the dangers of good intentions. There are men in all ages who mean to govern well, but they mean to govern. They promise to be good masters, but they mean to be masters.' Americans must decide whether they want good leashes or a good master. We can either stop politicians from continuing to abuse their power, or we can spend our time looking for a wise and merciful despot. Either way, democracy cannot survive power worship.

The Beginning Of The End For Iran’s Regime – OpEd	The overthrow of Syria’s dictator signifies not only a profound shift in regional politics but also reveals the structural weaknesses of the religious fascism governing Iran. The regime’s Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei, who considered Syria his strategic depth, now faces the collapse of one of his regime’s most critical barriers to internal disintegration. The structural corruption and military incapacity of the Syrian army had already become evident during the country’s civil war. However, the new development is the psychological collapse and demoralization of the Iranian regime’s proxies, underscoring their strategic defeat, organizational disintegration, and lack of motivation among their forces. Key Implications of Assad’s Overthrow The fall of Assad has consequences that extend beyond Syria’s borders. This event has vividly exposed the true weakness of the Iranian regime and the inability of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) to maintain its regional influence. The IRGC, long serving as Khamenei’s military and security apparatus, can no longer sustain the strategy of supporting proxy groups in the Middle East. The failure of this strategy signals the end of the regime’s expansionist policies and the beginning of its downfall. With the collapse of one of the regime’s primary regional pillars, conditions have been set for the expansion of popular uprisings within Iran and the acceleration of further political changes. Deception by Lobbies and False Narratives One of the Iranian regime’s tools in foreign policy has been extensive lobbying efforts in Western countries. These lobbies were tasked with presenting a false image of the regime’s power and stability while denying the democratic alternative, namely the Iranian Resistance. These efforts sought to obscure the Iranian Resistance’s ability to overthrow the regime and dismiss the widespread activities of Resistance Units in Iranian cities. However, recent developments have thwarted this strategy. The global community can no longer remain indifferent to the will of the Iranian people to achieve freedom and democracy. The bipartisan Resolution 1148 of the U.S. Congress, which recognizes the Iranian people’s right to resist oppression and seek change, reflects the revolutionary diplomacy of the Iranian Resistance. Necessity of Triggering Snapback Sanctions Following its regional defeats, the Iranian regime has rapidly accelerated its nuclear weapons program. The goal of this program is not to provide national security but to create a tool for preserving the regime’s survival. Under these circumstances, triggering the snapback mechanism in United Nations Security Council Resolution 2231 is essential. This move would enable the global community to increase international pressure to curb the Iranian regime’s nuclear threats. The truth is that the only sustainable solution to prevent nuclear threats is the overthrow of the Iranian regime by its people and the Resistance. They are the primary force for change, backed by an organized network of Resistance Units and a Resistance movement that spans across the globe. A Democratic Alternative The National Council of Resistance of Iran (NCRI), recognized as the democratic alternative to the regime, emphasizes that its goal is the transfer of power to the Iranian people. Mrs. Maryam Rajavi, the NCRI’s President-elect for the transitional period, reiterated this in her online message to a U.S. Congress gathering: 'The NCRI seeks not to seize power but to transfer it to its rightful owners, the Iranian people. According to the NCRI’s platform, a provisional government will be established for a maximum of six months after the regime’s overthrow.Its primary task is organizing elections for a Constituent Assembly and transferring sovereignty to the people’s representatives. The Iranian Resistance underscores values such as political freedoms, gender equality, autonomy for ethnicities, separation of religion and state, abolition of the death penalty, and the establishment of a nuclear-free Iran. These principles lay the foundation for building tomorrow’s Iran, transforming it into a peace-loving nation and a defender of regional stability. The Resistance expects Western countries to impose comprehensive sanctions, blocking the Iranian regime’s financial channels. Furthermore, activities of regime operative under cover organizations abroad must be entirely halted. Domino Effect of Defeats Reaching Tehran The fall of Syria’s dictator, one of Iran’s largest allies, signifies not only a defeat for Khamenei’s regional policies but also a warning bell for the survival of the ruling regime in its entirety. This development underscores the reality that the Iranian regime can no longer sustain its regional structures and is rapidly heading towards decline. More important than this regional defeat is the determination of the Iranian people and Resistance to bring about change. Recent developments highlight a historic stage in the Iranian people’s struggle—a stage where freedom and democracy will replace tyranny and oppression. In this journey, the global community must stand with the Iranian people and support their rights, playing a significant role in accelerating these changes.

Lessons From Japan For China: Healthcare Deterioration In An Agin...	By Zhou Chao In 2022, China's National Health Commission released a report indicating that during the '14th Five-Year Plan' period, the aging of the country's population will deepen, with the proportion of people aged 60 and above exceeding 20% of the total population, marking the transition to a moderately aged society. The health of the elderly is concerning, with the aging process leading to declines in cognitive, physical, and sensory functions, as well as increasing health issues related to nutrition and psychology. Over 78% of the elderly suffer from at least one chronic disease, and the number of disabled elderly people will continue to rise. In comparison to the health needs of the elderly, there is insufficient institutional, workforce, service, and policy support related to healthy aging. There is also a lack of specialized institutions for promoting elderly health, as well as efforts in preventing and controlling key diseases in the elderly. Existing studies point out that the aging of the population in China has these characteristics: larger scale, rapid growth, regional imbalances, urban-rural reversal, a higher number of elderly women than men, and a trend of aging before accumulating sufficient wealth. Rapid aging has led to an increase in chronic disease patients, rising social healthcare costs, declining quality of life for patients, and posing severe challenges to China's healthcare system. At the same time, high-quality medical resources in China are heavily concentrated in large and medium-sized cities and large hospitals, with a significant imbalance in resource distribution and insufficient financial security. In recent years, the government has repeatedly pushed for the decentralization of medical resources to adapt to China's '9073' elderly care pattern (90% of elderly care is family-based, 7% community-based, and 3% institutional), investing significant efforts in building community medical resources, which has achieved some progress. However, researchers at ANBOUND believe that aging is a highly complex phenomenon with highly diverse social impacts, and effectively addressing this issue requires consideration of multiple dimensions. The successful resolution of this issue is crucial for maintaining social stability and consolidating social trust, while ineffective responses to it could lead to severe social consequences. In this regard, Japan can serve as a valuable lesson for China. From 1992 to 2002, Japan's healthcare system faced a contraction in medical insurance due to the economic recession, compounded by a surge in patients following the acceleration of aging. This ultimately led to a rise in medical accidents and incidents of doctor-patient conflicts across the country, resulting in a large-scale resignation of the doctors. Between 1992 and 1997, the number of patients aged 65 and above in Japan surged from less than 2 million to 3.6 million. Major hospitals quickly faced a severe shortage of doctors, and even with full workloads, doctors were unable to meet the rapidly increasing demand. The 1994 Public Health White Paper revealed that the gap in the number of doctors reached 94,000 that year, while there were only 230,000 doctors nationwide at the time, causing work pressures to rise rapidly. According to statistics from the Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare, in 1995, 40% of doctors worked more than 80 hours per week, reaching the danger zone for overwork-related deaths, while Japan was only in the early stages of accelerated aging. Existing studies point out that the Japanese government's miscalculations are to blame. It is undeniable that the Japanese government was aware of the aging issue well in advance, as this phenomenon itself was not new. However, the preventive measures taken by the government were far from sufficient. First, when Japan's aging population reached 7% in 1970, the government introduced the strategy aimed at doubling the number of doctors. Over the next 15 years, the total number of doctors gradually increased from 100,000 to 200,000. Thanks to this expansion, Japan's medical resources were quite abundant in the 1980s. However, the government optimistically assumed that the medical reserves were sufficient and even proposed the so-called theory of an oversupply of doctors, calling for a 10% reduction in doctors in the 1990s. In 1995, the Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare reported that elderly patients aged 65 and above consumed four times the medical resources of adults, far exceeding the forecasted numbers of the 1970s. Second, there was insufficient preparation for the disease characteristics of the aging population. In the 1970s, medical care for the elderly was primarily focused on conventional infectious diseases, which only required short-term treatment before patients could be discharged. Chronic diseases, which require long-term care, were still considered rare 'diseases of the rich' and were not fully considered by the government. However, by the 1990s, elderly people in Japan, who had become wealthier, began facing the long-term challenges of chronic diseases. Due to the prolonged hospitalization required for chronic illnesses, 14% of the elderly population occupied 60% of hospital beds, with 20% of elderly patients being hospitalized for more than a year. This severely occupied medical resources and made it difficult for the younger population's medical needs to be effectively met, leading to the rise of 'anti-elderly' sentiments. Faced with this dilemma, the Japanese government had only two available options: strengthen doctor training and increase medical investment. However, training a high-quality doctor takes up to 10 years, making it a 'distant solution to an immediate problem'. After the collapse of the bubble economy, the Japanese government's financial resources were severely limited, making it difficult to effectively meet funding needs. The government estimated that to solve the shortage of medical resources, annual medical investment would need to increase by more than 100%, with healthcare spending accounting for 12% of GDP. In comparison, the economic stimulus plan, which supported millions of jobs, accounted for only 3% of GDP. In 1995, Japan's healthcare fiscal expenditure surpassed JPY 27 trillion, up from JPY 22 trillion in 1992, an increase of nearly JPY 5 trillion over three years. This primarily came from the costs of hospitalization and medications for elderly patients. Under immense expenditure and fiscal pressure, the Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare introduced a medical cost-cutting bill, and Japan's healthcare system shifted to a development model focused on cost control. Starting in 1995, the Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare proposed a new doctor evaluation system centered around controlling costs, with a particular focus on reducing hospitalization and medication expenses. The government hoped to treat more patients without increasing the medical budget by lowering costs. They then linked patient expenses with doctor incomes, forcing doctors to actively reduce patient costs. The government also implemented cost-control reforms in the pharmaceutical industry, initiating large-scale collective procurement and price reductions for over 10,000 drugs, forcing pharmaceutical companies to significantly reduce production costs. This series of measures successfully controlled healthcare fiscal spending and prevented the collapse of the medical fiscal system, but its negative effects were also significant. First, the quality of healthcare rapidly declined. After the reform, doctors were evaluated based on their ability to cure patients at a lower cost. At that time, even the frequent use of expensive drugs for treatment was considered a mistake. Patient treatment was no longer based on the severity of the illness, the patient's health condition, or actual medical needs. Instead, it was strictly based on the principle of minimizing expenses, which led to a rapid decline in the quality of care in public hospitals. Second, pharmaceutical research and development companies faced immense pressure, and medical accidents became more frequent. Faced with the pressure of collective procurement, pharmaceutical companies had to drastically reduce production and research and development spending. Under the new system, cheap drugs were overused, but many of these low-cost drugs did not have effective therapeutic outcomes. In 1997, Japan saw a famous pharmaceutical fraud incident, where the giant pharmaceutical company Tsumura Juntendo, with revenues in the billions, was found guilty of causing aa number of deaths and ultimately declaring bankruptcy. However, even when doctors were aware of the quality issues with certain drugs, they had no choice but to continue using them. Patients became the victims of cost-cutting healthcare, and in 2000, more than 60% of the 620 medical accidents nationwide were related to excessive cost control. Third, doctor-patient relationships became increasingly tense. Under the logic of low-cost healthcare, patients experienced a direct decline in the quality of medical care. However, they often found it difficult to understand the complex policy logic behind these changes, and as a result, patients often directed their frustration at the doctors who implemented the policies. The media failed to play its expected guiding role and instead portrayed doctors as those who 'feed off patients', fueling social animosity. In 1997, medical disputes in Japan began to surge, and by 2000, the number of doctor-patient disputes nationwide had exceeded 3,000, compared to fewer than 300 in 1995, marking a tenfold increase in just five years. Faced with social sentiment and public pressure, the responsible authorities and police did not conduct a thorough review or response. Instead, they continued to put pressure on doctors, and the standards for medical malpractice were repeatedly relaxed. According to statistics, between 1998 and 2003, 120 doctors were sentenced, which was nearly equal to the total number of doctors sentenced over the previous 40 years, highlighting the widespread impact of these criminal penalties. As a result, trust between doctors and patients nearly collapsed. For doctors, those who chose to stay in the system often had to opt for treatment plans with the least legal risk, rather than those with the best medical outcomes, leaving patient health inadequately protected. For doctors who adhered to the principles of patient-centered care, discouragement and resignation became inevitable. Statistics show that in the first five years of the cost-control reform, 11,000 doctors resigned from public healthcare systems, with dissatisfaction with the medical system being the main reason for their departure. In 2003, nearly 3,000 doctors left public hospitals, with the highest proportion being clinical surgeons. The mass resignation of doctors further exacerbated the shortage of medical personnel, and the group most affected by this was still the patients. Final analysis conclusion: Japan's experience with the deterioration of its healthcare system during the later stages of aging is marked by unique characteristics and underlying causes, which should not be generalized. Since 2020, as China's population born in the 1960s and 1970s has begun retiring, the country's healthcare and fiscal challenges have thus become increasingly pronounced, sharing many parallels with Japan's situation in the 1990s. Therefore, it is crucial to carefully examine Japan's experiences and lessons to guide China in addressing similar issues effectively.

A Cleric’s Heroism – OpEd	By Lawrence W. Reed In many homes worldwide, the day after Christmas is nearly as festive as the day before. December 26 is a holiday in the UK and many Commonwealth nations. People everywhere look forward with hope to the New Year just days away. That may not have been true on December 26, 1948, for a Catholic prelate in Hungary named Cardinal József Mindszenty (1892–1975). Arrested that day by communist authorities, he was sentenced to life in prison on concocted charges of 'treason and conspiracy.' Beatings and torture followed. This was not Mindszenty’s first arrest. He was just 27 when, in 1919, he spoke out against the 'socialist policies' of the Hungarian government and found himself behind bars as a result. A few months later, for expressing similar sentiments, he was re-arrested by the next government, a short-lived communist one. Then in 1944, Mindszenty was arrested by the Nazi puppet regime when he opposed the government’s plan to quarter its troops on Church property. When he was grabbed and jailed in the waning days of 1948, 'here we go again' might have sprung to his mind. When the bad guys hate you, you’re probably doing something right. Every time the authorities busted Mindszenty, it was for the same 'crime,' namely, speaking truth to power. His story recalls an inspiring statement, in a slightly different context, from Winston Churchill. During a visit to Harrow School near London in 1941, the Prime Minister declared: Never give in, never give in, never, never, never, never—in nothing, great or small, large or petty—never give in except to convictions of honor and good sense. Never yield to force. Never yield to the apparently overwhelming might of the enemy. Cardinal Mindszenty personified the courage and defiance to which Churchill alluded. As head of the Roman Catholic Church in Hungary, he despised tyranny and believed it his Christian duty to oppose it. He should be remembered, in the words of Claremont Institute scholar Daniel Mahoney in his Introduction to the Cardinal’s Memoirs, 'as one of the antitotalitarian titans of the twentieth century.' In 1947, as the post-war Soviet occupation tightened communism’s grip on Hungary, the Cardinal repeatedly and publicly condemned the oppressors. He issued statements that angered the authorities, such as one in April that warned: The government has assumed complete control of the publication of textbooks to be used in our schools. Thus the ruling political party in this land will now have the power to indoctrinate our youth. Ahead of sham elections that same year, Mindszenty chastised his fellow Hungarians who naively believed that the communists had mellowed and embraced democracy: We trusted those who had taken over the reins of government. We overlooked their abuses of authority, believing such abuses were the inevitable accompaniment of change and hoping they would cease with the passage of time. Now the time has come for elections, we can no longer keep silent. We must publicly declare that no Christian voter can support a party that rules by violence and oppression and tramples underfoot all natural laws and human rights. By December of the following year, the regime viewed the Cardinal as an implacable foe who had to be silenced and discredited. I, for one, am thankful that humanity often produces such remarkable people. Mindszenty’s resolve helped stiffen the spines of others when circumstances called for courage and defiance. That spirit ultimately prevailed and brought down one European communist despotism after another in 1989–91. Two months after his fourth arrest—on the day after Christmas in 1948—Mindszenty was put on trial by Hungary’s Stalinist dictatorship. His conviction and life sentence in early 1949 produced an international uproar. Even the United Nations issued a resolution condemning it. The regime claimed he confessed to his 'crimes,' but the Hungarian people knew better. The Cardinal had warned before his incarceration that any confession should be regarded as fabricated or induced under duress and, therefore, meaningless. When Hungarian patriots briefly liberated Budapest in a 1956 uprising, Mindszenty was set free. He immediately endorsed the movement and spoke to the nation by radio as armed forces from Moscow invaded Hungary to put the communists back in power. 'Let everyone in the country know,' he said, 'that this fight was not a revolution but a fight for freedom.' The Soviet invasion sadly succeeded, prompting Mindszenty to seek asylum in the US embassy in the Hungarian capital. He remained inside for the next 15 years until a diplomatic arrangement allowed him to leave the country safely. He lived in exile in Austria until he died in 1975. For two reasons, we must not forget brave men and women like Cardinal Mindszenty. One is that we must know history as it was lived, not as someone might choose to rewrite it or erase its lessons. Another is that the wisdom and warnings of people like Mindszenty may apply to circumstances yet to be lived. About the author: Lawrence W.

Ukrainian NATO Membership Impasse Resolved – OpEd	In a December 23 segment on Andrew Napolitano's Judging Freedom show, former CIA analyst Ray McGovern envisages a hypothetical US-Russia compromise on the issue of Ukrainian membership for NATO. McGovern sees a discussion possibly leading to a thirty-five year wait before Ukraine could join the Euro Atlantic military alliance. I respectfully differ with him. For openers, there's no need for Russia to compromise on the subject of NATO membership for Ukraine. In an unintended roundabout way, the Jake Sullivans of the world acknowledge a Russian compromise on NATO expansion. After the start of Russia's Special Military Operation, Finland and Sweden joined NATO. These countries had already been working towards closer military contacts with that alliance. Sullivan & Company express glee over these additions. Let them gloat. Having Sweden and Finland in NATO will be an added burden for Brussels and its two newest members. If the choice is Sweden and Finland versus Ukraine in NATO - Russia is more comfortable with the former. When compared to the two Scandinavian countries, Russia and Ukraine have a longer border, in addition to these two former Soviet republics having close historical and cultural ties going back to the pre-Mongol subjugated Rus period. McGovern says a Russian agreed thirty-five-year wait for Ukrainian NATO membership could see the eventual demise of that organization, thereby making the issue irrelevant. He doesn't deny this might not happen. The Russians are perfectly aware of that as well. It's therefore imprudent for Moscow to play Russian roulette with its future, when Russia has the upper hand in the NATO proxy war against it. History isn't clearcut when it comes to old divisions disappearing and periodic conflicts reigniting. This very point brings to mind the comments of Andrey Martyanov on Garland Nixon's December 19 show. Martyanov notes the Napoleonic and Nazi invasions of Russia involved numerous other Europeans besides French (regarding 1812) and Germans (in 1941). He depicts a wide scale anti-Russian sentiment throughout Europe. There's nonetheless reason to believe that better times can ultimately prevail. There're intelligent folks in the West who don't buy into the anti-Russian BS. The past wasn't always so uniformly confrontational. In the Napoleonic instance, Russia was allied with Prussia, Austria and Britain. During WW II, numerous Europeans and the US sided with the USSR. In the EU, the Slovak and Hungarian governments correctly see post-Soviet Russia for what it actually is. The overall public opinion in Bulgaria is favorable to Russia. There're potentially positive signs elsewhere in the EU and the rest of the world. When the USSR broke up, I welcomed the possibility of Russia being positively engaged with NATO and the EU. This view was shared by many, if not most Russians including Vladimir Putin. This didn't happen on account of Western based anti-Russian prejudices getting the upper hand. It has been noted on Napolitano's and Nixon's shows that the incoming Trump administration has expressed some faulty views on Russia's situation, relative to the NATO proxy war against it. (This has also been noted by others, among some of them: The Duran, Deep Dive, and my prior commentary.) The truth can be hidden for only so long. A return of top-level US-Russian interaction will give President elect Donald Trump and hopefully the rest of his cabinet a better idea of Russia's situation and ability to carry on with its objectives. Moscow is understandably unsupportive of any frozen conflict which down the road could very well thaw into a future armed conflict. Within reason, Russia wants a settlement. As I informally proposed to a select group, a way out of the NATO issue would be to formally declare that Ukraine can only join NATO if Russia does so as well. In this hypothetical scenario, should Russia reject a NATO offer to join, Ukraine wouldn't be able to enter as well. This idea jives well with the OSCE Astana and Istanbul declarations (signed respectively in 1999 and 2010), noted in my February 1, 2022 article. These declarations stipulate that an expanded military bloc shouldn't threaten another country. At present, Russia is understandably reluctant and likely uninterested to join an organization dominated by anti-Russian elements. There's also the matter of Russia not wanting to upset its relationship with China. The two countries share a large border and see the wisdom of having a peaceful economic relationship. In recent years, NATO has been negatively posturing towards China. The Russo-Sino relationship kind of reminds me of the Franco-German experience. Unlike the farcical neocon/neolib views of Russia within the German and French political establishments, Berlin and Paris appear to have prudently overcome their violent past. The current Russo-Sino situation has been belittled by some in the West, who recall the post-Stalin differences between the USSR and China. In the 1970s, these likeminded Western prognosticators weren't so pessimistic on the noticeably improved Sino-West relations of that period. During the Korean War, large detachments of Americans and Chinese fought each other. For good reasons, the British imperialist history in China isn't fondly regarded by many Chinese. The Chinese compete via commerce as opposed to stationing military bases all over the world and getting militarily engaged in armed conflicts. I recall incoming US Vice President JD Vance noting China's success in Africa due to Beijing building civilian infrastructure (hospitals, schools and roads). Vance added the US falls short in that regard by comparatively linking such aid with trying to influence how these societies should be governed. US supported governments can expect to have any human rights abuses downplayed by Washington, in exchange for geopolitical subservience. Outside the Collective West, the world at large sees thru the inconsistency of applied standards. Concerning Romania, there was little if any Western mainstream outrage when the NATO/EU friendly Romanian political establishment annulled a recent election because the result wasn't to their liking. On the other hand, there has been considerable Western meddling in Georgia because the elected Georgian government doesn't agree with some core EU/NATO preferences. As suggested in my October 17 article, the Western zero-sum game stance taken against Georgia serves to better position Russian influence in that former Soviet republic. Relative to a Russian-Ukrainian reconciliation at some future point, I haven't received pushback to my stated observation of December 12, 2023, on how well Americans were accepted in Germany and Japan not too long after US forces killed many German and Japanese civilians. Time can heal especially when it becomes clearer that events weren't as good versus evil as depicted.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWcuP41_xGFrMgnOdx4v8B2V	2024-12-26T15:52:49-08:00	
The Syrian Refugees In A Post-Assad Era – OpEd	The Syrian refugee crisis is one of the most harrowing humanitarian catastrophes of the 21st century. Triggered by a civil war that erupted in 2011, the conflict displaced more than 13 million Syrians, half of the country’s pre-war population. Among these, approximately 6.8 million sought refuge abroad, primarily in neighboring countries such as Turkey, Lebanon, and Jordan, as well as in Europe and beyond. Their plight became a symbol of human suffering, resilience, and the challenges of global solidarity. Now, with the fall of Bashar Assad, some Western countries have initiated efforts to repatriate Syrian refugees, citing changing conditions on the ground. However, the complexities of Syria’s devastated economy, crumbled infrastructure, and societal scars warrant a more cautious approach to repatriation. During the civil war, many Syrians risked perilous journeys across the Mediterranean to seek safety in Europe. Images of overcrowded boats and tragic drownings stirred global attention, yet responses varied widely. Some countries opened their doors, while others closed borders or erected barriers to limit the influx. The refugee crisis underscored profound challenges: the strain on host countries’ resources; the difficulty of integrating large refugee populations; and the enduring trauma faced by those who fled. Syrians struggled to find stable employment, access to healthcare, and secure education for their children. Despite these hardships, many often clung to the hope of returning home. While the fall of Assad marks a significant turning point, Syria appears to be far from ready to accommodate the return of millions of its displaced citizens. The war’s toll on the country’s economy and infrastructure is staggering. Entire cities lie in ruins, with essential services like water, electricity, and healthcare severely compromised. According to estimates, rebuilding Syria could take hundreds of billions of dollars and decades of effort. Roads, schools, hospitals and homes must be reconstructed before large-scale returns can be viable. The economic landscape is equally dire. Syria’s GDP has contracted sharply since the war began, and industries that once provided livelihoods for millions have collapsed. Agriculture, a cornerstone of the pre-war economy, has been devastated by conflict and climate change. Many factories and businesses have been destroyed or abandoned, leaving a vacuum of employment opportunities. Inflation and currency devaluation have rendered basic goods unaffordable for much of the population. For those who do return, the challenges are formidable. Housing is one of the most immediate and pressing issues. Many refugees’ homes have been destroyed, seized, or occupied by others. Legal disputes over property rights are likely to be widespread, particularly in a country where documentation was lost or destroyed during the war. Economic reintegration poses another major hurdle. With high unemployment and limited job opportunities, returnees may struggle to support themselves and their families. Skilled workers may find that their professions are no longer viable due to the destruction of infrastructure or shifts in the economy. Farmers returning to rural areas may face land that has been rendered infertile by neglect or conflict. In urban areas, small businesses that once thrived may no longer have a customer base or the resources to restart operations. Access to basic services is another significant concern. Healthcare facilities are scarce and overwhelmed, with shortages of staff, equipment, and medicine. Schools have been destroyed or repurposed. Refugees returning to such conditions may find that their quality of life is no better — and perhaps worse — than in the countries where they sought asylum. In addition, the psychological toll of return cannot be overlooked. Many refugees have endured profound trauma, from witnessing violence to losing loved ones. Returning to a country that still bears the scars of war may exacerbate these mental health challenges. Support systems, such as counseling and community networks, are limited or non-existent in many parts of Syria. Despite these challenges, many Syrians hope that Syria can one day reclaim stability, security, and prosperity. After 13 years of relentless conflict, the prospect of peace may offer a glimmer of possibility for millions of Syrians longing for normalcy. With time, the reconstruction of infrastructure, the revival of the economy, and the healing of societal divisions can hopefully pave the way for a brighter future. The rebuilding of Syria’s infrastructure will be a monumental task, but it is essential for enabling refugees to return and rebuild their lives. Roads, bridges, and public services must be restored to connect communities and facilitate economic activity. Schools and hospitals must be reconstructed to provide education and healthcare, laying the foundation for a healthier and more prosperous society. Investments in renewable energy and modern technology could help Syria leapfrog some development challenges, creating opportunities for innovation and growth. As stability takes hold, the Syrian economy has the potential to recover and even thrive. Agriculture can be revitalized through investment in irrigation and sustainable practices. Industries such as manufacturing and construction can provide jobs and drive economic growth. Tourism, once a major contributor to Syria’s economy, could gradually rebound as historical sites are restored and security improves. The entrepreneurial spirit of the Syrian people, evident in the diaspora, can play a crucial role in rebuilding the nation. Social healing will be equally important. Programs aimed at reconciliation and community building can help bridge divides and foster a sense of unity. Education will be key to equipping the next generation with the skills and knowledge needed to rebuild their country. Cultural and artistic initiatives can celebrate Syria’s rich heritage and inspire a sense of shared identity. While the road ahead is long and fraught with challenges, the resilience of the Syrian people offers hope. For those who have endured unimaginable hardship, the dream of returning to a safe and thriving homeland is a powerful motivator. With patience and perseverance, many Syrians hope that their country can rise from the ashes of war, offering its citizens the security, stability, and opportunities they deserve. The international community will undoubtedly watch as the Syrian people work toward their hope of a brighter future, determined to rebuild their lives and their nation.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWcuP41_xGFrMpE1jK9dNXbn	2024-12-26T15:47:00-08:00	
Ghana’s New President Faces Looming Terrorism Threat – Analysis	Among the most pressing issues that must be addressed by Ghana’s new president, John Dramani Mahama, is devising and deploying a coherent, multifaceted approach to the growing threat of terrorist groups spilling south from the Sahel. Mahama, who held the same position from 2012 to 2017, made the country’s economic crisis his dominant platform, and experts have long called for much more investment in the north to complement Ghana’s military approach to preventing militants from gaining ground. He is originally from Damongo in northern Ghana, which raises hopes that he will restore peace to the region. 'Expectations of Ghanaians are very high, and we cannot afford to disappoint them,' Mahama said in his victory speech. 'Our best days are not behind us. Our best days are ahead of us. Forward ever, backwards never.' Extremist militants from the Sahel already have established themselves inside of Ghana’s porous 600-kilometer border with Burkina Faso and are likely recruiting from marginalized communities in the north. 'The spillover risk is high,' Adam Bonaa, a security analyst with the Accra-based Institute of Security, Safety, Policy and Research, told The Africa Report magazine. Journalist Nosmot Gbadamosi has reported from northern Ghana for the past few years and said she has observed 'an alarming spike in criminality and violence' in remote border communities. 'Yet the young men whom I talked to said they engaged in criminal networks to smuggle gold, wood, weapons and machinery via Burkina Faso and Togo because they were jobless and poor,' she wrote for Foreign Policy magazine on November 20. 'Their motives were financial, not ideological. Indeed, hunger was the overriding factor.' Security experts have warned that the government must increase its presence in the north with services to address widespread poverty and unemployment, which has ballooned to nearly 15% nationwide. According to the World Data Lab, around 3.5 million men and 3.3 million women in Ghana are in extreme poverty, defined at a threshold of living on or below $2.15 a day. While Ghana’s military is well-regarded, it cannot prevent the spread of violent extremist groups on its own. Analyst R. Maxwell Bone has sounded alarms that rural communities are particularly exposed to the expansion of extremist groups. 'In Ghana, groups affiliated with JNIM and the Islamic State have established themselves as key nodes within the illicit gold trade, a major economic activity in the country’s north,' R. Maxwell Bone wrote in a September 2024 analysis for Foreign Policy magazine. 'Unless the militarized approach is replaced with one with an emphasis on mitigating the social exclusion that has rendered communities vulnerable to violent extremist recruitment, the security situation will continue to deteriorate.' The United States in March 2024 announced $100 million in aid to support conflict prevention and stabilization efforts in Ghana, Benin, Côte d’Ivoire, Guinea and Togo — all of which border Sahel terrorism hot spots in Burkina Faso, Mali and Niger. The European Union also provided military assistance in 2024 to bolster Ghana’s defense against radicalization. About 4 kilometers from Ghana’s northern border with Burkina Faso, the town of Bawku starkly embodies the country’s internal challenges. Hospitals, banks and schools have shut down, as deadly attacks between the Kusasi and Mamprusi ethnic groups have intensified. 'Bawku’s lawlessness offers fertile ground for their expansion,' Bonaa said. 'The Sahel’s terrorist networks see any vacuum as an opportunity.' Mahama Ayariga, a local member of parliament, is gravely concerned that Bawku, like so many border communities, urgently needs government and military intervention. 'The violence here is heartbreaking,' he told The Africa Report. 'If this isn’t addressed soon, Bawku will become Ghana’s weak link in the fight against terror.'	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWcuP41_xGFrMqGEg7ObxiL7	2024-12-26T15:44:22-08:00	
Ukraine Recovers After ‘Inhumane’ Christmas Day Attacks; Biden Vo...	(RFE/RL) -- 'Massive' Russian attacks on Ukrainian infrastructure showed no letup as night fell on Christmas Day following what President Volodymyr Zelenskiy called an 'inhumane' assault by the Kremlin’s forces – leaving hundreds of thousands in the bitter cold without heating and causing blackouts in the capital, Kyiv. 'Today, [Russian President Vladimir] Putin deliberately chose Christmas to attack,' Zelenskiy said on December 25, adding that Moscow continues to 'fight for a blackout' throughout the country. 'What could be more inhumane? More than 70 missiles, including ballistic missiles, and more than a hundred attack drones.' The Russian Defense Ministry, meanwhile, claimed its forces had conducted a 'massive strike' on critical energy sites that were supporting Ukraine’s 'military-industrial complex.' 'The aim of the strike was achieved. All facilities have been hit,' the ministry said in a statement. In Washington, U.S. President Joe Biden, who will leave office on January 20, offered new support and further aid for Ukraine in the face of the Christmas Day attacks. 'In the early hours of Christmas, Russia launched waves of missiles and drones against Ukrainian cities and critical energy infrastructure,' Biden said in a statement. 'The purpose of this outrageous attack was to cut off the Ukrainian people’s access to heat and electricity during winter and to jeopardize the safety of its grid.' He added that 'the United States and the international community must continue to stand with Ukraine until it triumphs over Russia’s aggression.' 'I have directed the Department of Defense to continue its surge of weapons deliveries to Ukraine, and the United States will continue to work tirelessly to strengthen Ukraine’s position in its defense against Russian forces,' he said. Regional governors reported that six people were injured in the northeastern city of Kharkiv and one person was killed in the Dnipropetrovsk area, as residents struggled to recover amid the freezing cold. Governor Oleh Syniehubov also reported 'damages to civilian nonresidential infrastructure' in the regional capital of Kharkiv . Kharkiv came 'under a massive missile attack,' Mayor Ihor Terekhov said on the Telegram social media platform. 'A series of explosions was heard in the city and there are still ballistic missiles heading toward the city,' Terekhov wrote early on December 25. Ukrainian authorities reported that there was no letup in drone attacks into the evening of December 25, with areas around Kharkiv, Dnipropetrovsk, and Chernihiv being targeted. In Ukraine, where a majority of Christians identify as Orthodox Christians, this was the second Christmas that was officially designated by the government to be observed not on January 7, but on December 25, in line with Roman Catholic and many Western Christian traditions. In Russia, home to the largest number of Orthodox Christians, believers still celebrate Christmas on January 7. From outside the country, British Prime Minister Keir Starmer also condemned what he called an 'ongoing assault on Ukraine's energy infrastructure.' 'I pay tribute to the resilience of the Ukrainian people, and the leadership of President Zelenskiy, in the face of further drone and missile attacks from Putin's bloody and brutal war machine with no respite even at Christmas,' Starmer said in a statement. Pope Francis, in his Christmas address, made an urgent plea for 'all people, all peoples, and nations [to] silence the weapons and overcome divisions.' 'Let there be silence of the weapons in martyred Ukraine,' Francis said while calling for negotiations to 'achieve a just and lasting peace' in the war-torn country. Ukrainian Energy Minister Herman Halushchenko said that Russia was 'again massively attacking the energy sector' on December 25. 'The transmission system operator is taking the necessary measures to limit consumption to minimize the negative consequences for the energy system,' Halushchenko wrote on Telegram. Dnipropetrovsk Governor Serhiy Lysak reported that the province had been under a 'major attack since the morning,' with Russian forces 'trying to destroy the region's power system.' Air raid sirens rang out across Ukraine in the early morning, while the country’s air force reported that Russian Kalibr cruise missiles had been launched from the Black Sea. Since the start of the war in February 2022, Russia has repeatedly attacked Ukraine’s energy sector, severely damaging the country’s power grid and causing frequent outages. In a similar attack on December 13, more than 90 missiles and more than 200 drones were used -- but 81 of the missiles were shot down, according to Zelenskiy. Inside Russia, authorities said the Ukrainian military attacked the city of Lgov in the Kursk region, hitting a residential building and killing four people. It wasn't immediately clear if the damage was caused by drones or shelling. Russian officials also reported Ukrainian drone attacks in the Belgorod region and Voronezh regions. The reports could not immediately be verified.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWcuP41_xGFrMnQLtH_1CJh_	2024-12-26T15:42:30-08:00	
Russian Air-Defense System Downed Azerbaijan Plane, Sources Say	(EurActiv) -- Russian air defences downed an Azerbaijan Airlines plane that crashed in Kazakhstan, killing 38 people, four sources with knowledge of the preliminary findings of Azerbaijan's investigation into the disaster told Reuters on Thursday (26 December). Flight J2-8243 crashed down on Wednesday in a ball of fire near the city of Aktau in Kazakhstan after diverting from an area of southern Russia where Moscow has repeatedly used air defence systems against Ukrainian drone strikes. The Embraer passenger jet had flown from Azerbaijan's capital Baku to Grozny, in Russia's southern Chechnya region, before veering off hundreds of miles across the Caspian Sea. It crashed on the opposite shore of the Caspian after what Russia's aviation watchdog earlier said was an emergency that may have been caused by a bird strike. Officials did not explain why it had crossed the sea. The nearest Russian airport on the plane's flight path, Makhachkala, was closed on Wednesday morning. One of the Azerbaijani sources familiar with Azerbaijan's investigation into the crash told Reuters that preliminary results showed the plane was struck by a Russian Pantsir-S air defence system. Its communications were paralysed by electronic warfare systems on the approach into Grozny, the source said. 'No one claims that it was done on purpose. However, taking into account the established facts, Baku expects the Russian side to confess to the shooting down of the Azerbaijani aircraft,' the source said. Three other sources confirmed that the Azeri investigation had come to the same preliminary conclusion. Russia's Defence Ministry did not respond to a request for comment. Kazakh Deputy Prime Minister Qanat Bozymbaev said he could neither confirm nor deny the thesis that Russian air defences downed the plane. Asked about the possibility that Russian air defences shot at the plane, the Kazakh transport prosecutor for the region where the plan came down said the investigation had not come to a firm conclusion yet. The Kremlin, asked before the Reuters report about the idea that the aircraft had been shot at by Russian air defences, said that an investigation was ongoing and that it would be improper to comment until the inquiry came to its own conclusions. 'It is wrong to build hypotheses before the conclusions of the investigation,' Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said. Wreckage Footage shot by passengers on the plane before it crashed down showed oxygen masks down and people wearing life vests. Later footage, showed bloodied and bruised passengers climbing out of the plane. There were 29 survivors. Pictures of the plane wreckage showed what appeared to be some sort of shrapnel damage to the tail section of the plane. Aviation security firm Osprey Flight Solutions said in an alert to airlines on Wednesday that footage of the wreckage and the circumstances around the air space in southwest Russia indicated the possibility that the airliner was hit by some form of anti-aircraft fire. Ukrainian military drones have repeatedly targeted Russia's southern regions in recent months, triggering Russian air defences. Russia and Ukraine have been at war since Moscow's invasion of its neighbour in February 2022. Earlier on Wednesday, the Russian Defence Ministry had reported the downing of 59 Ukrainian drones over several regions. Some were reportedly shot down in closed air space over regions bordering Ukraine, including the Sea of Azov. Flight operations were reportedly temporarily suspended at Russia’s Kazan Airport due to the activity. In addition, publicly available ADS-B flight tracking data shows that the Azerbaijani aircraft experienced GPS jamming throughout its flight over southwest Russia, the alert said. Russia uses advanced electronic jamming equipment to confuse Ukrainian drone location and communication systems and a large number of air defence systems have been deployed to shoot down the drones. The US National Security Council referred queries to Azerbaijani and Kazakhstani officials as the investigation continues.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWcuP41_xGFrMjQiPXg-0Q6P	2024-12-26T15:40:41-08:00	
Taiwan Seeks Clarity On Trump Team Policy Amid Chinese Pressure –...	By William Yang As the world prepares for U.S. President-elect Donald Trump’s return to the White House, Taiwan finds itself sandwiched between Washington and Beijing as it grapples with uncertainties about the outlook of U.S.-Taiwan relations and growing military pressure from China. Trump has already picked several politicians known for their hawkish stances on China as potential nominees for his Cabinet, including Marco Rubio and Mike Waltz, but analysts say the president-elect's comments about Taiwan on the campaign trail and in recent interviews have not offered much clarity about how he might handle one of Washington’s most delicate relationships. 'We don't know if [Trump] means it when he wants to return the United States to a more isolationist position,' said J. Michael Cole, a Taipei-based senior fellow with the Global Taiwan Institute. During an interview with Bloomberg Businessweek in July, Trump said Taiwan should pay the United States for defense and compared U.S. military spending on Taiwan to an insurance policy. 'I know the people very well. Respect them greatly. They did take 100% of our chip business. I think Taiwan should pay us for defense,' he said. In October, Trump pledged to impose additional tariffs on China if Beijing were to 'go into Taiwan.' 'I would say: If you go into Taiwan, I'm sorry to do this, I'm going to tax you, at 150% to 200%,' the President-elect said during an interview with The Wall Street Journal. In his first post-election interview with NBC News on Dec. 8, Trump didn’t publicly say whether the U.S. would militarily defend Taiwan in the event of a Chinese invasion. 'I’d prefer that they don’t do it,' Trump said, adding that he has a 'very good relationship' with Chinese President Xi Jinping and that the two have been communicating since last month’s election. During his time in office, U.S. President Joe Biden has on multiple occasions said his administration would defend Taiwan if it was attacked. Not panicking, but concerned Some Taiwanese residents worry about what they describe as a lack of clarity from the Trump administration. 'I’m slightly concerned about how Trump’s return to the White House might affect relations between the U.S. and Taiwan because he always prioritizes U.S. interests, which makes it hard to predict how his administration might form their Taiwan policies,' Angel Chi, a 28-year-old medical worker, told VOA in a recent interview on the streets of Taipei. Others say while Trump’s position on Taiwan seems uncertain, they do not think his administration will reduce support for Taipei. 'I still have faith in the U.S. democratic system because he can’t decide everything by himself,' Christine Chiu, a 42-year-old accountant, told VOA. The strong bipartisan support for Taiwan in Congress and some potential Trump Cabinet members’ track records on foreign policy could prevent U.S.-Taiwan relations from undergoing major changes during Trump’s second term, experts said. 'I don’t think there is panic in Taipei because we dealt with this situation before and we have confidence in our congressional support in the U.S.,' said Lai I-Chung, president of The Prospect Foundation, a Taiwan-based think tank made up of academics and government officials. 'The mood [in Taiwan] is we will be careful and watchful about the development, but we are not panicking,' he told VOA in an interview in Taipei. Taiwan-US relations In recent weeks, Taiwan’s government has been reaching out to Republican congressional leaders and Trump’s transition team. Taiwanese President Lai Ching-te spoke with U.S. House of Representatives Speaker Mike Johnson on the phone during his first overseas trip to the Pacific region in early December. On that trip, Lai had stopovers in Hawaii and the U.S. territory of Guam. Additionally, two senior national security officials from Taiwan traveled to the U.S. last week to meet members of Trump’s transition team, hoping to establish ties before next month’s inauguration, Reuters news agency reported last on Dec. 19. Cole said there should be enough 'institutional resistance' in the U.S. government to prevent longstanding policies toward Taiwan from being abruptly altered. During a regular press conference on Dec. 6, China’s Foreign Ministry responded to a question on Lai’s stopover in Guam and Hawaii and said, 'No one should underestimate the firm resolve, will and ability of the Chinese government and people to safeguard sovereignty and territorial integrity.' China’s military pressure campaign As Taiwan tries to deepen its engagement with U.S. officials and the incoming Trump administration, China has been increasing military pressure on the island throughout 2024. Beijing has conducted two blockade-style military exercises around Taiwan since Lai took office in May. Last week, Taiwan’s Defense Ministry said Beijing deployed the largest number of naval and coast guard vessels to regional waters in almost three decades. Apart from military exercises, China has increased pressure on Taiwan through a range of what are called gray zone operations, measures that involve irregular tactics but stop short of combat. China’s use of its coast guard to intimidate and test Taiwan is one example of those gray zone tactics. Beijing has repeatedly sent coast guard vessels to patrol waters near Taiwan’s outlying Kinmen and Matsu islands since February. Kinmen and Matsu are closer to China than they are to the main island of Taiwan. The Prospect Foundation’s Lai said China has some coast guard vessels that are similar in size to naval destroyers, making it harder for Taiwan’s coast guard to respond proportionately. 'It would be difficult for Taiwan to [deploy] naval vessels against the Chinese coast guard, and when Taiwan responds by deploying its coast guard forces, the vessels are smaller ships [while] the Chinese coast guard vessels are as big as navy ships,' he told VOA. Countering China To counter the growing military pressure and gray zone operations from Beijing, Taiwan has incorporated more unscripted, real-combat drills into its annual military exercises. The island has also increased its defense budget in recent years, which is set to reach a new high of $19.74 billion dollars in 2025. This year, Taiwan’s government also established a committee to help strengthen the island’s civil defense capabilities. Cole said Taiwan still faces challenges in that regard. 'There is still quite a bit of resistance not only within the security apparatus and armed forces, which don’t like the idea of involving citizens in defense, the opposition parties have also sought to derail [relevant] plans and fundings,' he told VOA. What may come next depends on Taiwan’s actions and Beijing’s assessment of Trump’s policies toward the island after he takes office in January.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWcuP41_xGFrMtybhY9v9IG4	2024-12-26T15:38:01-08:00	
Notebook Found On North Korean Soldier Outlines Tactics For Count...	By Sangmin Lee and Jaewoo Park A North Korean soldier’s notebook described tactics for shooting down Ukrainian drones, including diagrams and details on how a three-person team should be used to lure and destroy the unmanned devices, the Ukrainian Special Forces said on Thursday on Telegram. The notebook was found on a dead soldier named Jong Kyong Hong in Russia’s Kursk region, according to the Telegram post. Radio Free Asia was unable to independently verify the information. About 50 North Korean soldiers were killed in Ukrainian drone attacks in Kursk last week, according to South Korea’s spy agency. 'North Korean troops are being ‘consumed’ for front-line assaults in an unfamiliar battlefield environment of open fields, and they lack the ability to respond to drone attacks,' said South Korea’s National Intelligence Service, as cited by lawmaker Lee Seong-kweun, who was briefed by the agency on Dec. 19. The Ukrainian Special Forces posted a photograph of the notebook in its Telegram post. A diagram shows one person standing in front of the drone as the other two team members are positioned behind it, preparing to shoot. 'When a drone is spotted, form a team of three,' writing in the notebook said. One person’s role is to lure in the drone from a forward position while maintaining a distance of about 7 meters (23 feet), the notes said. The other two should be ready to shoot the drone from a distance of 10 to 12 meters (32 to 40 feet), it said. 'When the person luring the drone stands still, the drone will also stop, making it possible for the two to aim and shoot it down,' the writing said. ‘Human bait’ The Ukrainian Special Forces deemed the method as 'living human bait.' The special forces said that it was unclear whether the tactic was unique to the North Korean military or if it was something that the Russian military had taught to them. Russian forces have complained that North Korean soldiers were a 'burden' because of their 'ignorance' of drone warfare, the South Korean spy agency said in its briefing last week. Initial evidence from Ukraine has shown that North Korean soldiers are ill-prepared and lack the skills for modern warfare, said Federico Borsari, a resident fellow at the Washington-based Center for European Policy Analysis. 'They lacked counter-drone equipment, and with little cover they were easy targets for Ukrainian FPV operators,' he said, using the initials for 'first-person view' –- a kind of drone that wirelessly transmits video feed. 'Many were killed while trying to hide among tall, dry grass crops and leafless tree lines,' he said. 'Snow –- and Ukraine’s thermal sensors -– made them easily identifiable as most of those soldiers didn’t wear white camouflage.' American, South Korean and Ukrainian authorities have said there are up to 12,000 North Korean soldiers in Russia, deployed there primarily to help Russia push Ukrainian forces out of positions they captured in Kursk in August. Earlier this week, Ukraine reported that more than 3,000 North Korean soldiers had been killed or wounded in Kursk. South Korea has estimated that the number of casualties among North Korean troops is at least 1,100. The Defence Intelligence of Ukraine, or DIU, noted on Dec. 17 that North Korean forces appeared to have taken additional measures to mitigate the threat of drone strikes. 'After serious losses, North Korean units began setting up additional observation posts to detect drones,' the DIU wrote in a post to its official Telegram channel. On Thursday, DIU said on its website that North Korea has added at least five more observation posts to improve its drone reconnaissance. It also said that Russian drone units have started providing tank and artillery support for North Korean troops during assaults. Recent footage had suggested that the North Koreans were sometimes receiving no assistance from Russian forces during combat.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWcuP41_xGFrMsQprKvkyXGe	2024-12-26T15:35:21-08:00	
WHO Chief Unharmed Following Israeli Airstrike At Yemen Airport	By Conor Lennon Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the head of the World Health Organization, has described the scene in Sana’a, Yemen, on Thursday, after Israeli aircraft bombed the airport, reportedly killing two people. Tedros was in Yemen to negotiation the release of UN staffers who have been held hostage by the Houthi movement for several months, and assess the health and humanitarian situation in the country. With the mission concluded, explained the WHO chief, he and his team were about to board their flight out of the country, when the airport came under attack. As well as two reported deaths, a member of his plane’s crew was injured. The air traffic control tower and the departure lounge were both damaged. Tedros and his team were just metres away but are unharmed. The strike is reportedly one of two that took place in Houthi-led Sana’a on Thursday, with the second hitting the Ras Issa port, killing one person. On behalf of WHO, Tedros sent his condolences to the families whose loved ones lost their lives in the attack.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWcuP41_xGFrMvZ4JDQt8owx	2024-12-26T15:32:01-08:00	
China Should Rethink It’s Myanmar Strategy – OpEd	China's continued support for Myanmar's military junta is not only morally questionable but also strategically short-sighted. By backing an unpopular regime whose grip on power is tenuous at best, against the clear wishes of the Myanmar people, Beijing risks severe long-term consequences for its regional influence and economic interests. Recent developments highlighting the resilience of resistance forces have exposed the flaws in Beijing's approach. Despite superior armaments, a comprehensive investigation by BBC World Service indicates that the military now maintains control over less than a quarter of Myanmar's territory, a clear indication of their waning authority. Meanwhile, the National Unity Government (NUG) enjoys overwhelming popular support, 92% according to a United States Institute of Peace (USIP) survey, with the majority of Myanmar's diverse population viewing it favorably. This groundswell of opposition to military rule is not a fleeting phenomenon but the culmination of 70 years of failed governance and oppression. China's backing of the junta exacerbates an already dire humanitarian crisis. As of early December 2024, approximately 3.4 million people were displaced within Myanmar. Myanmar's stability hangs by a thread. The junta's mismanagement has doubled poverty rates to 40% in 2022, creating an economic quagmire that threatens to engulf the region. The junta's grip on power is rapidly eroding, with resistance forces delivering historic defeats to the military in northern Myanmar. In a stunning turn of events, resistance forces in northern Myanmar delivered a historic defeat to the military in early August, toppling the northeastern command and bringing expansive territories across northern Shan State under their control. Recently the Kachin Independence Army (KIA) gained control of areas rich in rare earth elements (REEs) and the Arakanese Army (AA) has nearly gained control of the entire Rakhine state. On December 20, 2024, the AA claimed to have 'completely captured' the Western Regional Command headquarters in Ann, Rakhine state China's response has been both aggressive and counterproductive: Unleashing punitive measures targeting key resistance groups Cutting off resources to resistance forces Pressuring Ethnic Resistance Organizations (ERO) for ceasefires Tacitly approving military airstrikes with China-provided hardware Showering junta leader Min Aung Hlaing with unprecedented legitimacy Financing and technically assisting sham elections in 2025. The international community views China's support for the junta's proposed elections as endorsing a process designed to exclude genuine opposition. These actions not only exacerbate the humanitarian crisis but also alienate the Myanmar people, who overwhelmingly support the resistance movement. China’s actions have triggered worldwide protest rallies by the Myanmar diaspora which had been joined by Chinese dissidents and covered by their media in Los Angeles and San Francisco. The economic implications of China's misguided policy are becoming increasingly apparent to the Myanmar public. The China-Myanmar Economic Corridor (CMEC), with its oil and gas pipelines estimated at $2.5 billion and the $7.3 billion Kyaukphyu deep-sea port project, promises economic growth but at a severe cost. These projects have led to widespread land confiscation, displacing thousands without adequate compensation and sparking protests. Environmental degradation threatens local ecosystems and the livelihoods of communities dependent on agriculture and fishing. Myanmar's increasing dependence on Chinese investments raises concerns about national sovereignty and potential debt traps, which might limit its ability to negotiate favorable terms for future projects. Myanmar owes $4 billion of its $10 billion national debt to China, with Chinese loans carrying higher interest rates (up to 4.5%) compared to international lenders like the World Bank or the International Monetary Fund (IMF). These loans have been described as burdensome, particularly since they often finance projects of strategic value to China rather than benefiting local communities. The lack of transparency and high costs associated with these projects exacerbate concerns about falling into a debt trap. Resistance forces have shown remarkable resilience to Chinese pressure to stop fighting the junta, defying Beijing by continuing revolutionary activities. In a significant development, the Kachin Independence Army (KIA) on October 18, 2024, took control of Pang War township, bringing billions of dollars’ worth of rare earth mines under its control. This movement challenges China's dominance in the rare earth market and provides significant economic leverage to resistance groups. China announced on December 3, 2024, that it would ban the export of several rare minerals to the United States. Myanmar exported approximately 50,000 metric tons of rare earth oxides to China in 2023, surpassing China's own mining quota. The local Kachin population wants to suspend the production from these rare earth mines due to significant environmental damage which has severely affected the health and livelihoods of the local people. China imposed a trade embargo on the Kachin cutting off electricity and imports of essential goods, including fuel, chemicals, and food. The Kachins have not resumed the production of REEs to date. The embargo of essential goods imports was also imposed on the two members of the Three Brotherhood Alliance, T’ang National Liberation Army (TNLA) and Myanmar National Democratic Alliance Army (MNDAA), an armed resistance group operating in the Kokang region of Myanmar, to stop fighting the junta. While the EROs have not fully complied with China's demands, there are signs of impact: The TNLA and MNDAA have expressed willingness to participate in Chinese-brokered peace talks with the Myanmar junta. The trade restrictions have weakened the resistance groups both militarily and politically, making them more likely to comply with Beijing's demands. The pressure from China on these groups has been described as 'the most formidable in recent times. China's demand for a joint venture security company to protect its investments in Myanmar is particularly alarming. It is perceived by the Myanmar people as a thinly veiled attempt at direct territorial control, echoing neo-colonial practices that have no place in the 21st century. This move, along with China's shielding of the junta at the UN, is rapidly eroding any goodwill among Myanmar's populace. China's international standing, already under scrutiny, will suffer further if it continues to be seen as aligning itself with a regime facing potential war crimes charges. On November 27, 2024, the International Criminal Court (ICC) Prosecutor Karim Khan filed a request for an arrest warrant for Myanmar Junta's Senior General Min Aung Hlaing. The warrant was requested for crimes against humanity. The people of Myanmar are not seeking to become pawns in a geopolitical chess game. They desire a balanced foreign policy, neither pro-West nor pro-China, focused on mutual benefit and respect for sovereignty. By ignoring these aspirations, China risks pushing Myanmar closer to other regional powers, potentially losing influence in this strategically crucial nation. China has already lost the goodwill of the people of Myanmar. China has an opportunity to recalibrate its approach. Engaging with the NUG and ethnic armed organizations to support a peaceful transition to democratic rule would demonstrate true leadership. Prioritizing transparency, environmental protection, and local economic development in future projects would go a long way in rebuilding trust. Leverage China’s influence to encourage genuine political dialogue and reconciliation, rather than supporting the junta's flawed election plans would be very beneficial. Failure to do so not only betray the principles of non-interference that China claims to uphold but also jeopardizes its long-term strategic interests in Southeast Asia. If the people of Myanmar are left with nowhere to turn except to their own determination and hope, they will persevere to the last person. Unlike North Korea, Myanmar can't be easily isolated, thanks to Myanmar’s strategic location which resulted in China's intended use of Myanmar as a BRI hub. China faces a hard choice and needs to rethink.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWcuP41_xGFrMo-1QJZwmBIV	2024-12-26T15:30:19-08:00	
Navigating Power Poles: Kazakhstan’s Multi-Vector Diplomacy And R...	In 1991, the dissolution of the Soviet Union marked a seismic shift in the geopolitical landscape of Central Asia. This transformation, described by President Putin in 2005 as the 'greatest geopolitical catastrophe of the century,' presented Kazakhstan with unprecedented challenges, including economic instability and dependence on Russia. To navigate this turbulent period, Kazakhstan’s first president, Nursultan Nazarbayev, implemented a multi-vector diplomatic approach. This policy aimed to establish balanced and pragmatic relationships with multiple global powers while safeguarding Kazakhstan’s sovereignty and national interests. The essence of the multi-vector policy lies in fostering mutually beneficial cooperation with global powers such as Russia, China, the United States, the European Union, and others without becoming overly dependent on any single actor. By actively engaging with diverse partners, Kazakhstan has sought to assert its regional leadership and economic stability. Historical Context of Kazakhstan’s Multi-Vector Policy Before gaining independence, Kazakhstan and the broader Central Asian region were primarily resource extraction zones for the Soviet Union. Kazakhstan, rich in oil, gas, and minerals, also served as a nuclear testing site. The Soviet strategy of dividing ethnic groups and creating administrative boundaries ensured the region remained dependent and fragmented, preventing unified resistance. The disintegration of the Soviet Union in 1991 thrust Central Asian republics, including Kazakhstan, into uncharted waters. These nations, designed for governance under a centralized Soviet framework, found themselves ill-prepared for independence. In Kazakhstan, the transition to an independent government brought challenges such as hyperinflation following the collapse of the ruble zone, instability linked to neighboring Afghanistan, and issues like drug smuggling and human trafficking. Recognizing the need for a strategic response, President Nazarbayev adopted the multi-vector policy to reduce dependency on Russia and build diversified relationships with other global powers. The Inner Works of Multi-Vector Diplomacy Kazakhstan’s strategic positioning and richness in natural resources such as large reserves of oil and gas have made it more relevant in regional geopolitics. Kazakhstan has upheld delicate balance between the major powers through its multi-vector policy. Russia has also remained a player and influencer of key importance in the whole Central Asia region. Kazakhstan is a member of the Collective Security Treaty Organization (CSTO), meaning its military cooperation is joined with Russia and other former Soviet states. It also collaborates with Russia on regional security matters, especially concerning Afghanistan and Islamic extremism. Kazakhstan which is within the scope of Eurasian Economic Union (EEU), a Russia-led regional bloc that promotes free trade and closer economic relationships. Kazakhstan has treaded carefully in its dealings with Russia, asserting its independence when it matters. For instance, during Russia’s annexation of Crimea in 2014, Kazakhstan did not take sides and has even advocated for regional security that includes cooperation with the West, not just Russia. Kazakhstan's neutral attitude can also be observed through its position on the ongoing Russia-Ukraine war, which is a clear manifestation of its multi-vector policy. Kazakhstan has welcomed projects such as the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) with open arms, using Chinese investments to expand infrastructure and branch out partners. Kazakhstan’s relationship with the EU and the US also reflects its desire to expand partnerships outside of its immediate region, especially in sectors like energy exports and technology. This pragmatic stance has proved critical to maintaining Kazakhstan’s independence and strengthening its role domestically and abroad. Impact of Russia on the other Central Asian states Kazakhstan’s successful maintenance of this policy has established a growing divergence with the other Central Asian states, including Tajikistan, Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan, and Kyrgyzstan, which remain deeply embedded in diverse degrees of dependency on Russia. Tajikistan, for one, depends greatly on remissions from migrant workers in Russia that account for more than 30 percent of its G.D.P. and receives plenty of military assistance by way of a large Russian contingent at its 201st Military. Challenges such as drug smuggling and extremism along the Afghan border further deepen Tajikistan’s reliance on Moscow. However, the Russia-Ukraine conflict has disrupted remittance flows, exposing the vulnerabilities of this dependence. Similarly, Uzbekistan, under President Shavkat Mirziyoyev, has attempted to adopt a balanced foreign policy but remains economically tethered to Russia due to its reliance on Russian energy infrastructure. Despite withdrawing from the Collective Security Treaty Organization (CSTO), Uzbekistan’s limited diversification options and ongoing cooperation with Russia on regional security issues hinder its multi-vector aspirations. Turkmenistan’s dependence on Russia is particularly evident in its natural gas exports, heavily tied to the Gazprom-Turkmenistan partnership, which grants Moscow significant influence over the Turkmen economy. The country’s avoidance of engaging with Western or regional multilateral organizations further restricts its capacity for multi-vector diplomacy. Meanwhile, Kyrgyzstan’s economic and security reliance on Russia is underscored by remittances from workers in Russia and its alignment with Moscow’s defense policies as a CSTO member. Collaborative military initiatives highlight Russia’s sway, preventing Kyrgyzstan from achieving strategic independence. Kazakhstan’s multi-vector diplomacy has established it as a regional leader, enabling it to maintain balanced relations with major powers while safeguarding its sovereignty. This approach leverages Kazakhstan’s geographic and resource advantages effectively. In contrast, the economic and security dependencies of other Central Asian nations on Russia underscore the difficulties of implementing a truly balanced foreign policy. As Kazakhstan continues to navigate the complexities of regional and global geopolitics, its multi-vector strategy serves as a model for other nations aspiring to assert their independence in a multipolar world. By fostering diverse partnerships and maintaining strategic autonomy, Kazakhstan exemplifies the potential of pragmatic diplomacy in securing national interests and achieving regional leadership. Kazakhstan’s Independent Stance in International Relations Kazakhstan’s approach during the Russia-Ukraine war serves as a compelling demonstration of its independent foreign policy, shaped by its multi-vector strategy. This strategy emphasizes maintaining balanced relationships with multiple global powers while safeguarding national sovereignty and adhering to international law. Kazakhstan’s responses to the conflict highlight its nuanced diplomacy and commitment to neutrality, even when dealing with its most influential neighbor, Russia. 1. Refusal to Recognize Russia’s Annexation of Ukrainian Territories Kazakhstan has consistently upheld Ukraine’s territorial integrity. It refused to recognize Russia’s annexation of Crimea in 2014 and reiterated this stance during the 2022 annexation of the Donetsk, Luhansk, Zaporizhzhia, and Kherson regions. President Kassym-Jomart Tokayev publicly declared at the St. Petersburg International Economic Forum in June 2022 that Kazakhstan does not acknowledge 'quasi-state territories.' This explicit statement underscores Kazakhstan’s firm position against violations of international borders. 2. Neutrality in UN Resolutions Kazakhstan’s stance at the United Nations further reflects its independent policy. The country abstained from key votes condemning Russia’s actions in Ukraine, opting instead to call for peaceful negotiations and adherence to international law. In March 2022, Kazakhstan abstained from voting on a resolution to suspend Russia from the UN Human Rights Council. These actions signal its reluctance to align fully with Moscow while maintaining a balanced position internationally. 3. Denial of Support for Russian Military Efforts Despite being a member of the Collective Security Treaty Organization (CSTO), Kazakhstan refused Russia’s request for military support in the Ukraine conflict. Kazakhstan emphasized that its CSTO commitments are strictly defensive, and it did not deploy troops to assist Russia. Additionally, the country declined to help Moscow evade Western sanctions, further highlighting its independent stance. 4. Hosting Russian Draft Dodgers Kazakhstan’s humanitarian response to Russia’s partial mobilization in September 2022 reinforced its neutral position. Thousands of Russian citizens fled to Kazakhstan to escape conscription, and the Kazakh government allowed them entry and residency. President Tokayev affirmed Kazakhstan’s commitment to humanitarian principles, stating that the country would not deport individuals fleeing conscription. 5. Providing Humanitarian Aid to Ukraine In a clear signal of neutrality and support for humanitarian principles, Kazakhstan sent multiple shipments of aid to Ukraine. These shipments included medical supplies, food, and other essential goods, demonstrating Kazakhstan’s concern for the Ukrainian population’s suffering despite its economic ties with Russia. 6. Economic Diversification Amid Sanctions The sanctions imposed on Russia following the invasion of Ukraine pushed Kazakhstan to diversify its trade routes. The country actively pursued alternatives to Russian transit infrastructure by developing the Trans-Caspian International Transport Route (Middle Corridor), connecting Kazakhstan to Europe via the Caspian Sea, Azerbaijan, and Turkey. This move reflects Kazakhstan’s proactive efforts to mitigate risks associated with overreliance on Russian infrastructure. 7. Advocacy for Peace and Dialogue Throughout the conflict, Kazakhstan has consistently called for a peaceful resolution and dialogue between Russia and Ukraine. President Tokayev offered Kazakhstan as a neutral venue for potential peace talks, reinforcing the country’s image as a mediator committed to stability and international law. 8. Reaffirming Domestic Policy Independence Kazakhstan’s independence extends beyond its foreign policy. It resisted Russian pressure to align its domestic policies more closely with Moscow, refusing to implement counter-sanctions against Western countries. President Tokayev emphasized the importance of adhering to international law and safeguarding Kazakhstan’s sovereignty, further distancing the country from Russia’s geopolitical agenda. Kazakhstan’s actions during the Russia-Ukraine war illustrate its ability to maintain an independent and balanced foreign policy under its multi-vector strategy. By refusing to recognize Russia’s territorial claims, abstaining from aligning with Russia at international forums, hosting Russian draft dodgers, and providing humanitarian aid to Ukraine, Kazakhstan reaffirmed its sovereignty and adherence to international norms. These steps showcase the country’s commitment to neutrality, sovereignty, and regional leadership, setting a notable example for other nations navigating complex geopolitical landscapes. Challenges of Kazak’s Policy Kazakhstan’s multi-vector policy has been pivotal in maintaining balanced relations with global powers, but it is not without significant challenges. These challenges stem from geopolitical, economic, and regional factors, as well as internal vulnerabilities. Below is an analysis of the major obstacles Kazakhstan faces in implementing its multi-vector strategy effectively: 1. Geopolitical Pressures from Major Powers Russia's Influence: Kazakhstan shares a long border with Russia and has historical, cultural, and economic ties with Moscow. Russia's assertive foreign policy and dominance in the region, particularly through organizations like the Eurasian Economic Union (EAEU) and the Collective Security Treaty Organization (CSTO), exert considerable pressure on Kazakhstan to align with its interests. China’s Growing Dominance: China's Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) has deepened its economic influence in Kazakhstan, particularly through infrastructure projects and energy investments. This growing dependence risks Kazakhstan being overly influenced by Beijing, limiting its ability to maintain an independent stance. Balancing the West: While Kazakhstan seeks closer ties with the European Union and the United States, these relationships can provoke suspicion and countermeasures from Russia and China. Western emphasis on human rights and governance reforms also poses challenges to Kazakhstan’s domestic policies. 2. Economic Dependencies Reliance on Energy Exports: Kazakhstan's economy heavily depends on oil, gas, and mineral exports, which makes it vulnerable to fluctuations in global commodity prices. Russia and China are significant markets for these exports, creating dependency risks. Sanctions and Regional Isolation: Western sanctions on Russia due to the Ukraine conflict have disrupted regional trade and affected Kazakhstan’s ability to balance its economic partnerships. Limited Economic Diversification: Despite efforts to develop non-resource sectors, Kazakhstan remains heavily reliant on its extractive industries, making it challenging to pivot towards new markets. 3. Regional Stability and Security Proximity to Afghanistan: The instability in Afghanistan, particularly after the U.S. withdrawal and the Taliban's return to power, poses security risks, including drug trafficking, extremism, and cross-border instability. Ethnic Tensions and Border Disputes: Kazakhstan's diverse ethnic composition and long borders with neighboring states can lead to internal and external tensions, complicating its regional relationships. Water and Resource Conflicts: Central Asian nations, including Kazakhstan, face disputes over water resources and energy-sharing agreements, adding stress to regional diplomacy. 4. Domestic Challenges Political Reforms and Stability: Kazakhstan has faced criticism over its slow pace of political reforms and allegations of authoritarian governance. These issues strain its relations with Western nations and hinder the development of a robust multi-vector strategy. Economic Inequality: Despite economic growth, wealth distribution remains uneven, creating social discontent that could undermine national stability. Ethnic and Linguistic Issues: Balancing the interests of the Kazakh majority and Russian-speaking minorities is an ongoing challenge, especially given Russia's interest in protecting Russian-speaking populations abroad. 5. Global Geopolitical Dynamics Russia-Ukraine War: Kazakhstan’s neutral stance during the Russia-Ukraine conflict has strained its relations with Moscow. Refusing to support Russia’s annexation of Ukrainian territories and hosting Russian draft dodgers has created diplomatic friction. U.S.-China Rivalry: The growing strategic competition between the U.S. and China forces Kazakhstan to navigate a highly polarized international environment, complicating its efforts to maintain balanced relations. 6. Institutional and Logistical Constraints Infrastructure Development: Kazakhstan's vast territory and landlocked position require significant investments in infrastructure to access global markets. Dependence on Russian transit routes and Chinese logistics limits its autonomy. Institutional Capacity: Implementing a multi-vector foreign policy requires a well-functioning diplomatic corps and robust institutions, which Kazakhstan is still developing. Kazakhstan’s multi-vector policy has positioned it as a key player in Central Asia, but its success depends on navigating these complex challenges. Addressing economic vulnerabilities, enhancing regional cooperation, and managing external pressures from global powers will be essential for Kazakhstan to maintain its strategic autonomy and continue leveraging its geographic and resource advantages. Benefits of Kazakhstan's Multi-Vector Foreign Policy Kazakhstan’s multi-vector foreign policy has been a cornerstone of its international strategy since gaining independence in 1991. This approach, rooted in pragmatism and neutrality, has enabled the country to balance relations with global powers, leverage its geographical and economic advantages, and maintain stability in a volatile region. Below is a detailed analysis of the key benefits of this policy: · Enhanced Sovereignty and Strategic Autonomy: Kazakhstan has maintained balanced relations with major powers like Russia, China, the United States, and the European Union, safeguarding its sovereignty and avoiding over-dependence on any single partner. Despite historical and economic ties with Russia, it has pursued an independent path, resisting undue influence, as demonstrated by its stance on the Russia-Ukraine war. Similarly, while China’s economic presence is significant, Kazakhstan has actively engaged with other partners to maintain a balanced relationship with Beijing. · Economic Diversification and Connectivity: The multi-vector approach has opened diverse avenues for economic growth and trade, reducing reliance on any single market or partner. The development of the Middle Corridor, connecting Kazakhstan to Europe via the Caspian Sea, Azerbaijan, and Turkey, diversifies export options and reduces dependence on Russian transit routes. By cultivating relations with Western countries, Kazakhstan has attracted investments in energy, infrastructure, and technology, complementing Chinese investments under the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI). These balanced relations allow Kazakhstan to secure competitive deals for its vast reserves of oil, gas, and minerals while ensuring the inflow of advanced technologies for resource extraction. · Regional Leadership and Stability: Kazakhstan’s multi-vector diplomacy positions it as a stabilizing force and leader in Central Asia. Its neutral stance in global conflicts, including offering to mediate the Russia-Ukraine war, enhances its image as a peacebuilder. Active participation in platforms like the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO), Eurasian Economic Union (EAEU), and Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) strengthens Kazakhstan’s influence in shaping regional and global agendas. · Strengthened International Partnerships: Kazakhstan’s foreign policy has enabled it to establish robust ties with diverse partners, ensuring flexibility to pivot to alternative allies if needed. Relations with the EU and the U.S. provide access to markets, technology, and development assistance, while ties with China, Turkey, and South Korea enhance its integration into the Asian economic and political landscape. Kazakhstan exemplifies balanced alliances by collaborating with Russia on security while engaging with the West on economic diversification. · Security and Defense Optimization: Kazakhstan’s multi-vector policy has reinforced its security framework without becoming entangled in conflicts. By abstaining from military alignments that could provoke major powers, it maintains strategic neutrality and minimizes external threats. Membership in the CSTO provides security guarantees from Russia while allowing Kazakhstan to assert its independent defense policies. · Diplomatic Prestige and Global Recognition: Pragmatic and balanced diplomacy has elevated Kazakhstan’s international profile. Hosting significant summits, such as the Astana Peace Talks on Syria and the Congress of Leaders of World and Traditional Religions, underscores its role as a trusted mediator. Chairmanship roles in organizations like the OSCE highlight its commitment to global stability and cooperation. · Promotion of National Development: The economic benefits and global partnerships arising from the multi-vector policy directly contribute to Kazakhstan’s domestic development. Collaborations with China and the EU have modernized infrastructure, enhancing connectivity and trade potential. Partnerships with Western nations have brought investments in education and technology, fostering innovation and creating a knowledge-based economy. · Mitigation of External Risks: Kazakhstan’s balanced foreign relations mitigate risks arising from regional conflicts or global power rivalries. Its neutral stance on the Russia-Ukraine conflict enables peaceful relations with Russia without alienating Western allies. Careful navigation of Western sanctions on Russia ensures Kazakhstan’s economy and trade remain unaffected. · Leverage of Geopolitical Position: Kazakhstan’s strategic location as a bridge between Europe and Asia makes it vital for transcontinental trade and energy transit. Its oil and gas exports to Europe, China, and other regions enhance its strategic importance, while participation in initiatives like the BRI boosts its role in global supply chains. · Cultural and Soft Power Diplomacy: The multi-vector policy enables Kazakhstan to showcase its cultural and historical significance, strengthening its soft power. Cultural exchange programs foster dialogue and mutual understanding with multiple regions. By promoting its Eurasian identity, Kazakhstan highlights its model of coexistence between diverse ethnic, religious, and cultural groups, reinforcing its role as a bridge between East and West. Conclusion Kazakhstan’s multi-vector foreign policy is a pragmatic and forward-thinking strategy that has enabled the country to navigate the complexities of global geopolitics effectively. By balancing relations with major powers, fostering economic growth, and maintaining regional stability, Kazakhstan has not only safeguarded its sovereignty but also emerged as a respected and influential player on the global stage. While challenges persist, the benefits of this approach significantly outweigh the risks, providing a robust framework for sustainable development and strategic autonomy.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWewwuioyKD5HGaXoVfxaADz	2024-12-26T10:07:51-08:00
