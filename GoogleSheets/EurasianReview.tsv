Argentine President Javier Milei’s 2025 Address To World Economic...	This is an AI-generated transcript of President Milei's full address at Davos 2025 as released by the World Economic Forum Good morning everyone. And how much has changed in such a short time. A year ago, I stood here before you, alone, and spoke some truths about the state of the Western world that were met with some surprise and astonishment by much of the political, economic and media establishment of the West. And I must admit that, in a way, I understand it. A president from a country that, as a result of systematic economic failure for more than 100 years, as a result of having the country taken weak stances in major global conflicts, and as a result of us having closed ourselves off to trade, we had lost practically all international significance over the years. A president of such a country stood on this stage and told the entire world that they were wrong, that they were headed for failure, that the West had gone astray, and that it needed to be redirected. The president of that country, Argentina, who was not a politician, who had no legislative support, no backing from governors, business leaders or media groups. In that speech, here standing before you, I told you it was the beginning of a new Argentina, that Argentina had been infected with socialism for far too long, and that with us it would once again embrace the ideas of freedom – a model that we summarize as the defence of life, liberty and private property. And I also told you that in a way, Argentina was the 'ghost of Western Christmases yet to come', because we had already experienced everything you were going through, and we already knew how it would end. A year later, I must say that I no longer feel so alone. I don't feel alone, because the world has embraced Argentina. Argentina has become a global example of fiscal responsibility, of commitment to honouring our obligations and, obviously, a commitment to solve the inflation problem. Also, we are an example of a new way of doing politics, which is about telling people the truth to their faces and trusting that they will understand. Nor do I feel alone because over the course of this year, I have found allies in this fight for the ideas of freedom in every corner of the world – from the amazing Elon Musk to that fierce Italian lady, my dear Giorgia Meloni; from Bukele in El Salvador to Viktor Orbán in Hungary; from Benjamin Netanyahu in Israel to Donald Trump in the United States – slowly an international alliance has been forming among all those nations which, like ours, want to be free and believe in the ideas of liberty. And slowly, what once seemed like the absolute global hegemony of the woke left in politics and educational institutions, in the media, in supranational organizations, or even in forums like Davos, has begun to crumble. And I hope for the ideas of freedom is starting to emerge. Today I've come here to tell you that our battle is not yet won. And although hope has been rekindled, it is our moral duty and our historical responsibility to dismantle the ideological edifice of sickly wokeism, until we have succeeded in rebuilding our historical cathedral, until we have ensured that the majority of Western countries once again embrace the ideas of liberty. Until our ideas become the common currency in the halls of events such as this one, we can't let our guard down. Because I must say that forums like this one have been protagonists and promoters of the sinister agenda of wokeism that is doing so much damage to the Western world. If we want to change, if we truly want to defend the rights of citizens, we must first begin by telling them the truth. And the truth is that there is something badly mistaken about the ideas that have been promoted through forums such as this one. And I would like to take a few minutes today to discuss some of them. Today, few will deny that winds of change are blowing in the West. There are those who resist change, those who grudgingly accept it, but accept it nonetheless. There are the new converts who appear when they see it as inevitable. And finally, there's those of us who have fought all of our entire lives for change to arrive. Each one of you will know which group you belong to. Surely there may be a bit of each within this auditorium, but you will all surely recognize that the times of change are knocking on our doors. Historic moments of change have a unique characteristic. The times when formulas that have been in place for decades become exhausted. The methods once considered the only way of doing things cease to make sense and what, to many, seemed unquestionable truths is finally called into question. These are times when the rules get rewritten, and therefore these are times that reward those who have the courage to take risks. But much of the free world still prefers the comfort of what is familiar, even though it may be the wrong path. And they will insist on applying the recipes of failure and the great burden that is the common denominator among the countries and institutions that are failing is the mental virus of woke ideology. This is the great epidemic of our time that must be cured. This is the cancer we need to get rid of. This ideology has colonized the world's most important institutions – from the political parties and governments of leading Western nations to global governance organizations, even NGOs, universities and media outlets. It has also set the tone of the global conversation over the past decades. Until we remove this abhorrent ideology from our culture, our institutions and our laws, Western civilization – and even the human species – will not be able to return to the path of progress demanded by our pioneering spirit. It is essential to break these ideological chains if we want to usher in a new golden age. That is why today I would like to take a few minutes to breaking those chains. But first, let's talk about what we are fighting for. The West represents the pinnacle of human achievement on the fertile ground of its Greco-Roman heritage and Judeo-Christian values. The seeds of something unprecedented in history were sown after definitively overcoming absolutism. Liberalism inaugurated a new era in human existence, and within the new moral and philosophical framework, which placed individual liberty above the whims of tyrants, the West was able to unleash man's creative capacity, initiating an unprecedented process of wealth generation. The data speaks for itself. Until the year 1800, the world's per capita GDP remained virtually constant. However, from the 19th century onwards, and thanks to the Industrial Revolution, per capita GDP multiplied by 20, lifting 90% of the global population out of poverty, even though the population itself increased eightfold. And this was only possible thanks to a convergence of fundamental values, respect for life, liberty and property, which enabled free trade, freedom of speech, freedom of religion and the other pillars of Western civilization. In addition, our inventive Faustian exploratory, pioneering spirit, which is constantly testing the limits of what is possible, and that's a pioneering spirit that today is represented, among others, by my dear friend Elon Musk, who has been unjustly vilified by the wokism ideology in recent days for an innocent gesture that simply reflects his enthusiasm and gratitude towards people. In summary, we invented capitalism on the basis of saving, investment, labour and reinvestment, and hard work. We got every worker to multiply tenfold or 100-fold, or why not even a 1,000-fold? Their productivity thus overcoming the Malthusian trap. Yet at some point in the 20th century, we lost our way and the liberal principles that had made us free and prosperous were betrayed. A new political class, driven by collectivist ideologies and taking advantage of times of crisis, saw the perfect opportunity to accumulate power. All the wealth created by capitalism until then and into the future would be redistributed through some scheme of centralized planning, setting in motion a process whose disastrous consequences we are suffering today. By promoting a socialist agenda while insidiously operating within the liberal paradigm, this new political class distorted the values of liberalism, and so they replaced freedom with liberation, using the coercive power of the state to redistribute the wealth created by capitalism. Their justification was the sinister, unjust and abhorrent idea of social justice, complemented by theoretical Marxist frameworks aimed at liberating individuals from their needs. And at the core of this new value system lies the fundamental premise that equality before the law is not enough, as hidden systemic injustices exist which must be rectified, an idea that serves as a gold mine for bureaucrats who aspire to omnipotence. And this is fundamentally, fundamentally what wokeism is about, the result of the reversal of Western values. Each of our civilization's pillars has been replaced by a distorted version of itself through various mechanisms of cultural subversion. Negative rights to life, liberty and property were transformed into an artificially and artificial and endless list of positive rights. First it was education, then housing, and from then on, absurdities like access to the internet, televised football, theatre, cosmetic treatments and an endless number of other desires that were turned into fundamental human rights. Rights that, of course, someone has to pay for, and which can only be guaranteed through the infinite expansion of the abhorrent state. In other words, we moved from the concept of freedom as the fundamental protection of the individual against the intervention of the tyrant to the concept of liberation through state intervention. On this foundation, wokeism was built – an ideology of monolithic thinking upheld by various institutions whose purpose is to penalize dissent, feminism, diversity, inclusion, equity, immigration, abortion, environmentalism, gender ideology, among others. These are all various heads of the same beast aimed at justifying the state's expansion through the appropriation and distortion of noble causes. Let us look at some of these. Radical feminism is a distortion of the concept of equality, even in its most benevolent form, it is redundant – as equality before the law already exists in the West. Everything else is a quest for privileges, which is what radical feminism truly seeks, pitting half of the population against the other half, when they should both be on the same side. We have even got to the point of normalizing the fact that in many supposedly civilized countries, if you kill a woman, it is called femicide. And this carries more serious punishment than if you kill a man simply based on the sex of the victim – legally making a woman's life be worth more than that of a man. And that they carry the banner of the gender-based wage gap. But when you look at the data, it is clear that there is no inequality for the same work, but rather that most men tend to choose better paying professions than most women. However, they don't complain about the fact that most prison inmates are men, or that most plumbers are men, or that most victims of robbery or murder are men – let alone the majority of people who have died in wars. But if you raise these points in the media or even at this forum, you are considered a misogynist simply for defending an elementary principle of modern democracy and the rule of law, which is equality before the law. And of course, defending the data as well. Wokism also manifests in sinister radical environmentalism and the climate change agenda, preserving our planet for future generations is a matter of common sense. No-one wants to live in a landfill. But once again, wokeism has managed to pervert this fundamental idea. From preserving the environment for human enjoyment, we have shifted to a fanatical environmentalism, where we humans are seen as a cancer that must be eradicated and economic development is considered little more than a crime against nature. And yet, when we argue that the Earth has already gone through five abrupt temperature change cycles, and that during four of those men was not even around, we are called ‘Flat Earthers’ in order to discredit our ideas, even though science and the data are on our side. It is no coincidence that these same groups are the main promoters of the bloody, murderous abortion agenda, an agenda designed on the basis of the Malthusian premise that overpopulation will destroy the Earth, and that we must therefore implement some form of population control. In fact, this has been carried to such an extreme that today on Earth we start to see a population growth rate starting to look like a problem and talk about a job they've done by promoting abortion. And these forums promote the LGBT agenda, attempting to impose the idea that women are men and men are women simply based on self-perception. And they say nothing about when a man dresses as a woman and kills his opponent in a boxing ring, or when a male prison inmate claims to be a woman and ends up sexually assaulting women in prison. In fact, just a few weeks ago, there were headlines around the world regarding the case of two gay Americans who championed the banners of sexual diversity and were sentenced to 100 years in prison for abusing and filming their adopted children for more than two years. I want to be clear when I say abuse, this is no euphemism because in its most extreme forms, gender ideology is outright child abuse. They are paedophiles. So, I want to know who would support that kind of behaviour. Healthy children are being irreversibly harmed through hormone treatments and mutilation, as if a five-year-old child could possibly consent to such things, and should their family not agree to this, there will always be state agents ready to step in in favour of what they call the best interests of the child. And believe me, the scandalous experiments in the name of this criminal ideology will be condemned and likened to those committed in the darkest periods in our history. And covering this multitude of abhorrent practices is the eternal victimhood narrative, always ready to hurl accusations of homophobia, transphobia and other fabricated terms, whose sole purpose is to silence those of us who dare to expose the scandal – one of which both national and international authorities are complicit. Meanwhile, in our businesses, public institutions and educational establishments, merit has been cast aside in favour of the doctrine of diversity, which represents a regression to the aristocratic systems of the past. Quotas are invented for every minority politicians can come up with, which ends up undermining the excellence of institutions. Wokeism has also distorted the issue of immigration, the free movement of goods and people is a fundamental pillar of liberalism. We know this well. Argentina, the United States and many other countries became great thanks to immigrants who left their homelands in search of new opportunities. However, we have shifted from attracting foreign talent to foster development to now embracing mass immigration, driven not by national interests but by guilt. Since the West is supposedly the root cause of all of the world's evils in history, it must redeem itself by opening its borders to everyone, which leads to a form of reverse colonization that resembles collective suicide. So, this is how we now see images of hordes of immigrants who abuse, assault, or even kill European citizens, whose only sin was not adhering to a particular religion. But when someone questions these situations, they are immediately labelled racists, xenophobic or even Nazis. Wokeism has penetrated our societies so deeply, promoted by institutions like this one, that it has even led to questioning the very concept of biological sex through the disastrous influence of gender ideology, which has resulted in even greater state intervention through absurd legislation – such as the state having to fund expensive hormone treatments and surgeries to fulfil the self-perception of certain individuals. Only now are we beginning to see the effects of an entire generation that has mutilated their bodies, encouraged by a culture of sexual relativism, and these people will have to spend their entire lives in psychiatric treatment to cope with what they have done to themselves. Yet no one dares to speak about these issues. Not only that, but the vast majority have also been subjected to the misguided self-perceptions of a tiny minority. And wokeism also seeks to hijack our future because by dominating the faculties of the world's most prestigious universities, it is shaping the elites of our countries to reject and deny the culture, ideas and values that made us great, further damaging our social fabric. What future do we have if we are teaching our young people to feel ashamed of our past? All of this was incubated and increasingly developed over the past decades, after the fall of the Berlin Wall. Curious enough, free nations began to self-destruct when they no longer had adversaries to defeat. Peace made us weak. We were defeated by our own complacency. All these and other aberrations which we can't enumerate due to time constraints, are the threats that today endanger the West. And unfortunately, these are the beliefs that institutions like this one have been promoting for 40 years, and no one here can feign innocence. For decades, there has been a worship of a sinister and murderous ideology, as if it were a golden calf, moving heaven and Earth to impose it on humanity. And this organization, along with the most influential supranational bodies, have been the ideologues of this barbarity. Multilateral lending organizations have been instruments of extortion, while many national governments, and especially the European Union, have acted as their armed wing. Is it not true that right now, as we speak, in the UK citizens are being imprisoned for exposing horrifying crimes committed by Muslim migrants, crimes that the government seeks to conceal? Or didn't the bureaucrats in Brussels suspend Romania's elections simply because they didn't like the party that had won? Faced with each of these discussions, wokeism’s first strategy is to discredit those of us who challenge these things first by labelling us and then by silencing us. If you're white, you must be racist. If you're a man, you must be a misogynist or part of the patriarchy. If you're rich, you must be a cruel capitalist. If you're heterosexual, you must be heteronormative, homophobic or transphobic. For every challenge, they have a label, and then they try to suppress you by force, or through legal means. Because beneath the rhetoric of diversity, democracy and tolerance that they so often preach, what truly lies is their blatant desire to eliminate dissent, criticism and ultimately freedom, so they can continue to uphold a model in which they are the main beneficiaries. Haven't we heard only recently how certain European leading authorities and quite reddish, I should say, actually have made open appeals to censorship. Actually, there is no censorship, but rather this idea that you need to silence those who don't partake in the woke ideology. And what kind of society can wokeism create? A society that replaced the free exchange of goods and services with the arbitrary distribution of wealth at gunpoint. One that replaced free communities with forced collectivization. One that replaced the creative chaos of the market with the sterile and sclerotic order of socialism. A society filled with resentment where there are only two types of people – those who are net taxpayers, on the one hand, and those who are beneficiaries of the state on the other. And by this, I don't refer to those who receive social assistance because they don't have enough to eat. I'm talking about the privileged corporations, the bankers who were bailed out during the sub-prime crisis, the majority of media outlets, the indoctrination centres disguised as universities, the state bureaucracy, the unions, social organizations and the crony businesses that thrive off the taxes paid by hard-working individuals and taxpayers. I'm talking about the world described by Ayn Rand in Atlas Shrugged, which unfortunately has become a reality. It is a system where the big winner is the political class, which becomes both a referee and stakeholder in this redistribution game. I say it again, the political class is a referee and stakeholder, an interested party in this redistribution. Of course, the one who redistributes is the one who keeps the lion's share. And despite the cosmetic differences between various political parties, they share interests, partners, deals and an unshakable commitment to maintaining the status quo. That is why I call them all the party of the state, a system that hides behind well-meaning rhetoric claiming that the market fails and that they are the ones responsible for correcting the failures through regulations, force and bureaucracy. But there is no such thing as market failures. Market failures, I say this again, do not exist. Since the market is a mechanism of social cooperation where property rights are voluntarily exchanged, the very concept of market failures is a contradiction in terms. The only thing such intervention achieves is the creation of new distortions within the price system, which in turn hinders economic calculation, savings and investment – ultimately leading to even more poverty in its wake or a mesh of abhorrent regulations, such as is the case in Europe, which kills economic growth. As I often say in my speeches, if you believe there is a market failure, go and check to see if the state is not involved. And if you find that it isn't, check again because you got it wrong. For this same reason, since wokism is nothing more than a systematic plan by the party of the state to justify state intervention and increase public spending, this means that our first and foremost mission – if we truly want to reclaim the West's progress and build a new golden era – has to be the drastic reduction in the size of the state. Not only in each of our countries, but also the drastic reduction of all supranational organizations, as this is the only way to root out this perverse system, draining its resources in order to give back to taxpayers what belongs to them, and to put an end to the sale of favours. There is no better method to end state bureaucracy than to have no opportunity for such favours to be sold in the first place. The functions of the state must once again be limited to defending the right to life, liberty and property. Any other function the state assumes will come at the expense of its fundamental role and will inevitably lead to the ‘omnipresent Leviathan’ that we all suffer under today. Today we are witnessing the global exhaustion of this system that has dominated us for the past few decades. Just as has happened in Argentina, the rest of the world is seeing the deepening of the only truly relevant conflict of this century, and of all previous ones – the conflict between free citizens and the political caste that clings to the established order, doubling down on its efforts aimed at censorship, persecution and destruction. Fortunately, throughout the free world, a silent majority is organizing. And in every corner of our hemisphere, the echo of this freedom cry resonates. We are facing a change of era, a Copernican shift, the destruction of a paradigm and the construction of another. And if globally influential institutions like this one wish to turn over a new leaf and participate in good faith in this new paradigm, it will have to take responsibility for the role played over the past decades, acknowledging to society the Mia culpa that is being demanded of them. To conclude, I wish to speak directly to the world's leaders, to all those who lead both national states, and also to major economic groups and influential international organizations, whether present here today or listening from their homes. The political formulas of the past decades, which I have referred to in this speech, have failed and are now collapsing under their own weight. This means that thinking like everyone else does, reading what everyone else reads, and saying what everyone else says, can only lead to error. Even though many still insist on marching towards the precipice. The script of the last 40 years has run out, and when a system runs out, history opens up. That is why, to all global leaders, I say it is time to break free from that script. It is time to be bold. It is time to dare to think and to dare to write our own verses. Because when the ideas and narratives of the present all say the same thing – and they say the wrong things – being brave means standing outside of time. It means looking backwards, not being dazzled by the transient, losing sight of the universal. It means reclaiming truths that were obvious to our ancestors and that are at the core of Western civilization success, but which the regime of monolithic thinking of recent decades has persecuted as if they were heresies. As Churchill once said, the farther back you can look, the farther forward you are likely to see. In other words, we must reconnect with the forgotten truths of our past, to untangle the knots of the present and take the next step forward as a civilization towards the future. And what do I see when I look back? That we must once again embrace the last proven thesis of economic and social success. This is the model of freedom, once again embracing the ideas of freedom. Going back to libertarianism. That's what we're doing in Argentina. That is what I trust President Trump will do in the new America. And this is what we invite all the great nations of the free world to do if they wish to halt in time what is clearly a path leading to catastrophe. So ultimately, what I'm proposing is that we make the West great again today. Today, just as 215 years ago, Argentina has broken its chains and invites us – as our national anthem declares – invites us, all mortals of the world to hear the sacred cry: ‘Freedom, freedom, freedom! May the forces of heaven be with us.’ Thank you all very much and long live freedom, damn it.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWeE8linnmC12ycTq3AwOrFJ	2025-01-24T17:49:43-08:00	
Arakan Army’s Growing Influence In Myanmar: Implications For The ...	By Sreeparna Banerjee In a significant turn of events, after days of relentless battles, the Arakan Army (AA) seized control of the Maungdaw and Taungup townships, securing a 270-kilometre (km) stretch along Myanmar's border with Bangladesh last month. This victory cements the dominance of the AA and its political wing, the United League of Arakan (ULA), in Rakhine State, and shifts the region’s dynamics, putting the junta on the back foot. The capture of hundreds of soldiers, weapons, and the infamous Brigadier General Thurein Tun marks a significant blow to the junta. The subsequent fall of Ann, the Western Military Command headquarters, was yet again a historic setback. It marks the second military command being taken over by resistance forces, after the capture of the Northeastern Command in August last year. With AA gaining control of 14 of Rakhine’s 17 townships, and the junta scrambling to retain its grip, the resistance forces now control a total of over 93 towns and cities, six critical border trading posts, two key airports, Thandwe in Rakhine and Lashio, and several key connectivity projects with neighbouring nations. The fighting to capture the remaining territories is still ongoing. As the AA solidifies its hold over Rakhine, its relationship with the Rohingya community remains fraught. The junta's practice of forcibly conscripting Rohingyas into its fight against the AA has worsened tensions. Many Rohingya conscripts have been captured or killed, further entangling the displaced people in a conflict that they did not initiate. For the stateless and marginalised Rohingya, the AA's rise presents new uncertainties—whether it will lead to coexistence or deepen divisions is an open question in Rakhine’s turbulent future. Rise of the AA Rakhine State, a region marked by economic underdevelopment and ethnic diversity, has long been a focal point of Myanmar's complex political and social landscape. Among the various forces shaping its future, the AA has emerged as a key player, commanding significant territorial control and public confidence. Formed in 2009, the AA has grown into one of Myanmar’s most powerful ethnic armed groups, with an estimated 30,000 soldiers. There are three reasons for this growth. First is the group’s dynamic leadership, with figures like Major General Twan, Mrat Naing, and Brigadier General Nyo Twan Awng, who have built a cohesive team, incorporating leaders from earlier revolutionary movements, thus making the AA more unified than its predecessors. Secondly, its 'Arakan Dream 2020' and the 'Way of Rakhita' vision for self-governance have rallied public support, positioning the AA as a symbol of hope for Rakhine nationalism. Frustration with political suppression, such as the marginalisation of Rakhine aspirations by the National League for Democracy Party (NLD), and incidents like the 2018 Mrauk U protests have further fuelled AA’s rise as an alternative to traditional political avenues. Thirdly, the AA has also gained strength through alliances. Early Kachin Independence Army (KIA) support provided training and combat experience to the paramilitary group. At the same time, ties with the Northern Alliance and backing from the United Wa State Army (UWSA) have bolstered its resources and operations. Stance towards Rohingyas The AA has a complicated stance towards the Rohingya. While it doesn’t openly target or blame the Rohingya in most of its statements, it has historically expressed strong resentment towards them, reflecting broader tensions in Rakhine State. Initially, the AA referred to Rohingya militants as 'terrorists' and criticised them after attacks in 2016, vowing to protect Rakhine State. However, over time, the AA shifted its tone to avoid being seen as anti-Rohingya or promoting religious or ethnic hatred. For example, in 2020, the AA stated that it represents all people in Rakhine, regardless of religion or ethnicity, and emphasised its respect for human rights and religious freedom. At the same time, the AA denies accusations from the Myanmar military that it collaborates with the Rohingya armed group, the Arakan Rohingya Salvation Army (ARSA). The AA instead focuses on its fight against the military forces and has always blamed the central government for creating divisions between Rakhine communities and the Rohingya. Overall, the AA has avoided overt hostility toward the Rohingya and it maintains a cautious attitude. Its actions and rhetoric are shaped by both local tensions and the need to maintain an international reputation, as any violence against the Rohingya could harm its standing globally. Following the coup and Operation 1027, the ULA has demonstrated goodwill, and its decision to lift travel restrictions for the Rohingya in central Rakhine State and Paletwa has earned support from some quarters. Concerns, however, about the well-being of the Muslim community have intensified, particularly amidst ongoing violence in Rakhine. Reports indicate counter-attacks on Rohingya households by the AA, allegedly instigated by the military junta, which has reportedly used the Rohingyas to target the AA. The heightened hostility of the ethnic armed organisation (EAO) toward the Rohingya can be partly attributed to a shifting military dynamic. Specifically, three prominent Rohingya armed groups—ARSA, the Rohingya Solidarity Organisation (RSO) and the Arakan Rohingya Army (ARA)—are reportedly aiding the junta in its conflict with the AA, and are accused of forcibly recruiting youth from Myanmar and even Bangladesh refugee camps, worsening the already fragile situation and amplifying humanitarian concerns in the region. Adding to the complexity, the AA’s recent use of the derogatory term 'Bengali Muslim' to describe the Rohingya in its August 2024 statement denying allegations of harming the Rohingya with arson attacks echoes rhetoric historically used to delegitimise the Rohingya, by framing them as foreign immigrants. This narrative has been instrumental in denying them citizenship and perpetuating their marginalisation, deepening mistrust and complicating efforts for peace in Rakhine. Situation in Bangladesh Bangladesh has been hosting the Rohingya population since 1978. It has always maintained a strict policy of repatriation to Myanmar through negotiation with the Myanmar regime in power, despite its shortsightedness in looking into the welfare of the displaced people. However, the current political changes within Bangladesh and the civil war situation at Rakhine, with no progress on fundamental issues of citizenship, safety, and the repatriation of a million displaced people sheltered in Bangladesh (who the Bangladesh government refers to as Forcibly Displaced Myanmar Nationals), there seems no viable resolution in sight. Amid declining donor funding, conditions in Rohingya camps have worsened, with only 53 percent of the US$852.4 million required for 2024 raised by September. Reduced food rations, deplorable living conditions with landslides, fires, and limited opportunities have pushed many into illegal activities, whether knowingly or unknowingly, raising security concerns. Bangladesh’s interim government, led by Muhammad Yunus, is reevaluating its Rohingya policy after seven years of failed repatriation attempts. Faced with the arrival of 60,000 additional displaced people and shifting dynamics in Myanmar and Rakhine, the interim government has indicated an interest in semi-formal engagements with non-state actors like the AA while maintaining diplomatic ties with Myanmar’s regime and seeking regional cooperation from India, China, Malaysia, Thailand, and Indonesia. Khalilur Rahman, the High Representative for the Rohingya crisis and Priority Issues, plans a UN-backed conference later this year to mobilise funds, refocus global attention, and explore a UN-guaranteed safe zone in Rakhine for repatriation. This dual approach reflects the complexity of balancing humanitarian needs with geopolitical realities. Road ahead For the Rohingya, caught between a repressive military regime and an ascendant AA, the future remains uncertain. The AA's rise may offer a glimmer of hope for better governance in Rakhine, but the group’s relationship with the Rohingya has been marked by mistrust and sporadic violence. Whether this new power dynamic will lead to coexistence or further conflict depends on whether the AA can embrace inclusivity and recognise the rights and aspirations of the Rohingya community in a post-junta Rakhine. For now, the region’s destiny hangs in a delicate balance, with the Rohingya still searching for a place to call their own in a land long shadowed by strife.

Jammu And Kashmir Elections Reveal Enduring Political Fault Lines...	By Arun Swamy Both regional and national elections were held in India’s troubled Jammu and Kashmir (J&K) region in 2024 for the first time since its autonomy was drastically downgraded in 2019. But despite successful elections in the region plagued by complex territorial disputes and enduring insurgencies, early signs suggest that decades-old patterns of political allegiance remain largely unchanged. J&K, formerly a princely state with a Hindu ruler with a majority-Muslim population and three distinct cultural regions — Jammu, the Kashmir Valley and Ladakh — has been claimed by both India and Pakistan since 1947 when a brief war left each controlling a portion of it. It has been the focus of both China–India and Pakistan–India wars, as well as the subject of UN resolutions calling for a territorial plebiscite. An insurgency began in Kashmir in 1989 with covert support from Pakistan and has continued with varying degrees of intensity to the present day. In 2019, the newly re-elected government of Prime Minister Narendra Modi repealed Article 370 of the Indian constitution which had given J&K special status and allowed the state its own constitution. This had long been promised by Modi’s Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), but the government went further by dividing the state into two regions and downgrading both to union territories. An appeal to the Supreme Court failed in December 2023. For the next five years, both union territories — J&K and Ladakh — were administered by the central government as it sought to stamp out the insurgency and improve its own standing in the region. Incidents of stone-throwing in 2019 declined steadily to zero by 2023 and other types of protests and violence declined sharply. This paved the way for the first national and regional elections in 2024. Elections to the Lok Sabha, the lower house of the national parliament, were held in April and May 2024. The newly truncated J&K has five seats in the Lok Sabha — two in Jammu and three in Kashmir. The BJP, contesting only in Jammu, won both seats there and beat the Indian National Congress (INC) by wide margins. But despite the BJP’s efforts to rally support for third parties in Kashmir, the INC-aligned Jammu and Kashmir National Conference (JKNC) won two of three seats. The Lok Sabha results influenced the INC to ally only with the JKNC for elections to the J&K Legislative Assembly in September 2024. The alliance won despite some controversial measures that had improved the BJP’s chances, including redrawn constituency boundaries, which the JKNC criticised as equalising Jammu and Kashmir’s representation despite Kashmir’s larger population. The central government’s representative, the lieutenant governor, was also allowed to appoint five members to represent various marginalised constituencies, which was viewed by many as a ploy to give the BJP a majority if the election was close. The marginalised communities in this case were migrants or refugees from Pakistani-occupied sections of Kashmir and Kashmiri Pandits — ethnic Kashmiri high-caste Hindus. Since the onset of the current insurgency in 1989, over 100,000 Kashmiri Pandits — the overwhelming majority — left the Kashmir Valley in the 1990s. For the BJP, returning the Hindu Pandits to the Valley has become a rallying cry. In the 2024 election, the government announced efforts to expand the ability of Kashmiri Panditsresiding outside the Valley and Hindu refugees from Pakistani-held portions of Kashmir to vote in Kashmir. These efforts, along with legal changes following the abrogation of Article 370 that allowed outsiders to buy land in J&K, have led some to believe that the BJP was attempting to change the composition of the electorate population. Despite the controversies, the assembly elections were a relative success. Turnout was quite high at 64 per cent overall and over 56 per cent in Kashmir. The JKNC–INC alliance won a clear majorityof seats, rendering concerns about appointed legislators holding the balance moot. But the BJP won a large majority of seats in Jammu. Exit polls indicated that voters’ principal concerns were the economy and restoration of statehood, with a sizable portion of the electorate favouring a restoration of Article 370. While restoring statehood is supported in principle by all parties, the JKNC-led government’s call to also restore Article 370 has caused the BJP to walk out over the issue. It is unclear if the events of the last five years have significantly changed the political situation in J&K. The Modi government can take credit for increased electoral participation and declining violence. Yet traditional Kashmiri parties, especially the JKNC, remain the principal political forces in the region. The majority do not seem reconciled to the loss of Article 370 so much as united in their desire to see it restored. The real test will come when New Delhi decides to restore J&K statehood without the special provisions of Article 370. If the demand for restoration fades, the policy can be deemed a success. If not, it will be back to square one. About the author: Arun Swamy is Professor of Political Science at the University of Guam.

Amnesty International Warns About Imminent Execution Of Six Polit...	Six Iranian men are at imminent risk of execution after being sentenced to death in October 2024 by Branch 26 of the Revolutionary Court in Tehran after a grossly unfair trial, Amnesty International has warned. Amnesty International has called on authorities to immediately halt these executions, citing the arbitrary nature of the detentions and serious due process violations. The men — Abolhassan Montazer (65), Akbar Daneshvarkar (58), Babak Alipour (33), Mohammad Taghavi Sangdehi (58), Pouya Ghobadi (31), and Vahid Bani Amerian (32) — were convicted of 'armed rebellion against the state' (baghi) amid allegations of torture and forced confessions. The convictions stem from accusations of affiliation with the People’s Mojahedin Organization of Iran (PMOI/MEK), the main opposition group to the Iranian regime. Amnesty International reports that their trial, which lasted just two hours, was marred by serious violations of fair trial standards, including limited access to legal counsel and reliance on confessions extracted under duress. The six men were arrested between December 2023 and February 2024 and detained in Tehran’s Evin Prison under the control of the Ministry of Intelligence. Amnesty International cites numerous accounts of torture and ill-treatment, including beatings, floggings, prolonged solitary confinement, and death threats at gunpoint, to coerce confessions. Specific instances of abuse include eye injuries and severe physical pain suffered by Vahid Bani Amerian during his arrest, as well as restricted access to medical care for several detainees, including Mohammad Taghavi Sangdehi, who was denied necessary medication for gout. Despite these allegations, the Revolutionary Court failed to investigate claims of torture or the credibility of the so-called confessions. The six men’s case is part of a larger wave of repression in Iran following the nationwide uprising in 2022. Amnesty International reports a sharp rise in executions, with at least 853 carried out in 2023 alone, a 48% increase from the previous year. In 2024, the regime topped it with more than 1,000 executions. Activists and dissidents, particularly those affiliated with ethnic minorities or opposition groups like the PMOI, have faced harsh penalties, including death sentences issued after secretive, summary trials. Among those at imminent risk of execution are Behrouz Ehsani and Mehdi Hassani, who were sentenced to death in early January 2025 after the Supreme Court upheld their convictions related to alleged support for the PMOI. Their cases, like many others, have been criticized for reliance on coerced confessions and grossly unfair trials. Revolutionary Courts, criticized for their lack of independence and susceptibility to their ties to intelligence institutions, have played a key role in the crackdown. Amnesty International notes that such courts routinely flout international standards of justice, making fair trial violations a systemic issue in Iran’s judiciary.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWeE8linnmC127x2UGGU3cuU	2025-01-24T16:58:53-08:00	
The Warped Ethics And Tainted Politics Of Presidential Pardons – ...	By Graham J Noble There have been times when certain presidential pardons have raised an eyebrow or two, but few considered them a big deal – save the pardon of Richard Nixon by President Gerald Ford. But then, Joe Biden, on his way out the door of 1600 Pennsylvania Ave., started handing them out like Reese’s Pieces on Halloween. Pre-emptively pardoning several members of his own family was bad enough – many would argue this amounted to an unintentional admission that some of the Bidens had indeed been engaged in corruption, influence-peddling, and money laundering, which some people had suspected. Extending this executive absolution to Democrats (and two Republicans) who investigated the events of Jan. 6, 2021, was beyond the pale. Of course, those are not the pardons that upset Democrats and their stenographers in the media. When President Donald Trump followed through on his promise to pardon the Jan. 6 protesters, one would have thought from the uproar that he had just announced he was replacing JD Vance with Vladimir Putin as his vice president. When the president held his first press conference on Jan. 21, announcing the roll-out of a massive AI infrastructure project, the only thing reporters seemed interested in asking him about was the pardons he issued to those imprisoned for taking part in the Jan. 6 demonstration. Police as Political Pawns The most extreme of those on the left would probably have preferred to see every single one of those demonstrators, around 1,500, rotting in prison for another 15 or 20 years at least. But they can’t admit that, so they pretend to be troubled that among the recipients of pardons were people who had attacked police officers. The lack of self-awareness is certainly jaw-dropping. It’s as if the Black Lives Matter (BLM) riots of 2020 never happened. After BLM and various other extreme left-wing groups decided to use George Floyd’s death as an excuse to go on a rampage, violent mobs blazed – quite literally – a trail of destruction and chaos across several American cities. Businesses were looted and burned, cars were destroyed, at least one police precinct was set on fire, and a number of police officers suffered serious injuries. An officer in Ferguson, MO, suffered brain damage after being attacked by BLM rioters. These same activists marched in the streets, openly calling for the murder of law enforcement. Of those arrested during the 2020 riots, many had their charges dropped, and the same people who now claim to be outraged by President Trump’s Jan. 6 pardons were practically cheering the rioters on. Funds were set up to bail them out – promoted by elected Democrats, including Kamala Harris. The sympathizers even objected to the use of the words 'looters' and 'rioters' to describe these criminals. Certainly, not a single prominent voice on the left was raised in anguish over police officers being attacked. And none of them have expressed more than a token word or two of sympathy over the injuring or killing of any police officer in the United States either before or since the 2021 Jan. 6 protest. Jan. 6 Pardons Right a Terrible Wrong On that day in the nation’s capital, no police officers were killed – despite false media reports. None sustained life-threatening or life-changing injuries (because the establishment media would have paraded like circus elephants any who did). No businesses were destroyed, no cars were set on fire, and no stores were looted. The Jan. 6 protesters, if one wishes to call them rioters, might’ve been the most well-behaved and disciplined rioters in history – except for perhaps 20 or 30 individuals, who may or may not have even been Trump supporters. The extent of the damage? A few windows in the Capitol building were broken, and a few items were pilfered – items paid for with American tax dollars. The worst thing that happened that day was the fatal shooting of an unarmed woman by a Capitol Police officer – whom the Capitol Police and congressional Democrats then went to extraordinary lengths to protect. Yet those 1,500 or so people who turned out because they genuinely believed Trump was robbed of victory in the 2020 election and have since been charged seem to have been railroaded out of sheer malice, spite, and hatred of Trump. President Trump – and many of his supporters, if not most – see this wave of pardons as righting a wrong that was both a symptom and a cause of the political divisiveness that has scarred the nation for too long. By contrast, Joe Biden handed his son an 11-year blanket of immunity. He spared brutal killers the death penalty, protected several other family members – even though they have supposedly done nothing wrong – and immunized congressional investigators who, if Trump is to be believed, destroyed evidence in order to present a one-sided show at trial. The ethical contrast between the current president and his predecessor could not be more obvious. And if the pardoning power of the president has been tainted at all, there can surely be little debate about which of them is responsible.

Ralph Nader: To Thwart Trump’s Tyranny, The Media Must Cover Resi...	A lawless madman, with cunning political skills, is at large in our White House. After less than five days in office, he has set a record for flamboyantly issued executive orders, many violative of federal statutes and the Constitution. A partial list: he has withdrawn the U.S. from the World Health Organization (e.g., damaging international coordination regarding pandemics), quit the Paris Climate Accords (e.g., nations working together against climate violence), selected corporate ideologues to run regulatory agencies (the purpose of which is to save lives, prevent injuries and stop consumer rip-offs), unleashed ICE to crash schools looking for undocumented kids to take away, threatened the media, readied more tax cuts for the super-rich and big companies, and halted the hiring of I.R.S. staff needed to stop massive tax evasions by the plutocracy. He has moved to make massive cuts in spending for programs protecting children and the sick (e.g., slashing Medicaid), lifting controls over oil & gas drilling, reducing support for solar and wind energy, and gutting the civil service. Meanwhile he, a convicted felon, is pardoning hundreds of convicted jailed felons who assaulted Capitol Hill police on Jan. 6, 2021, who will now be vengefully on the streets. The terrifying list goes on. (See the Brookings Institution tracking of regulatory changes in the second Trump administration: These actions harm all Americans – that is, they produce indiscriminate injustice against both liberal and conservative low-wage workers, consumers, parents, and children. This strengthens the resistance from the people with a more unified opportunity to stop Trump. Already the first torrent of federal and state lawsuits are being filed to block Trump’s power grab. Certainly, many state attorneys general are readying lawsuits. However, comfortable with his dominance over Congress and the Supreme Court, Trump’s response is one he has previously used – figuratively mocking so sue me, ha, ha, ha. In anticipation of the Trump rampage, the New York Timespublished a lead editorial on January 18, 2025, titled: 'Are We Sleepwalking Into Autocracy?' The newspaper’s answer is 'Yes,' unless: 'Defenders of democracy have to stay united, focusing on ensuring that checks and balances remain intact and that crucial democratic watchdog institutions (my emphasis) elude capture.' Nice words. But the Times and other large newspapers and magazines have largely avoided a critical responsibility since the 60s and 70s. That is, without their covering the actions, litigation, initiatives, and reports of civic institutions and labor unions, little or nothing will flow from their efforts. The Times editors know full well that without reaching millions of people, influential groups and lawmakers, the power of civic/labor community is very significantly reduced. This lack of media coverage has been happening for the past forty years. Mass media coverage based on newsworthiness and editorializing empower these groups, gets the attention of more supporters and makes it more difficult for the forces of often secret autocratic government to roll over the citizenry. The regular reporting about what activists were doing in the 1960s and 1970s made possible the consumer, environmental, labor, and freedom of information laws. Similar efforts now cannot gather momentum with media visibility. Legislative hearings, prosecutions, and regulatory actions cannot get jumpstarted just by the people insistent on a just and democratic society. Over the years I’ve highlighted this exclusion coupled with suggesting newsworthy stories to hundreds of reporters, editors, and a few publishers. To little avail. Look at the scene at the Times and the Washington Post. How often do you see op-eds from civic/labor advocates? How often do you read reviews of their books? How often have the groundbreaking studies by Public Citizen, Common Cause, Center for Science in the Public Interest, Veterans for Peace, Union of Concerned Scientists Et. al received coverage? Look at the profitable Washington Post Live podcasts and see how civic and union leaders have been back-handed. How often do the celebrated Times and Post podcasts interview them? The exclusions are overwhelming, even when compared with the access extreme right-wingers receive, such as Marjorie Taylor Greene and Grover Norquist. Some may say, well, they can always use social media. It is too cluttered, too fractured, and too impulsive. Whether we like it or not, the major newspapers’ original content feeds the radio and television stations and still has an unchallenged impact on getting attention for agendas underway that may have been floating around on the Internet for years and going nowhere. The same situation exists for local journalism which could feed local TV and radio were it to stop ignoring incipient efforts from community activism, whistleblowers, or simply good stories called into them by alert citizens. Official source journalism presently reigns. Our democracy can’t afford redundant and tepid reporting in the coming days. For example, there are about 500 full-time reporters covering Congress. The mostly ditto-head reporting misses all kinds of stories. We started the quarterly forty-page newspaper, Capitol Hill Citizen (capitolhillcitizen.com) to expose some of the goings on in Congress that fall under the rubric of ignored unofficial journalismto illustrate this point. In an era of closing weekly and daily newspapers, one might expect some coverage of this unique effort reporting on Congress, the most important and potentially most powerful institution that can turn around our deteriorating democracy. For nearly three years, none of the major newspapers and news magazines have told their readers about this rising journalistic beacon. To sum up: the reporters and editors at the Times, Post and the rest of the national, local newspaper, radio, and TV media must rise to higher levels of their own significance and give voice to the aroused resistance against the onrushing Trumpian dictatorial regime imposing fascistic government and more concentrated corporate power. If they cave, if they cower, as Thomas Jefferson warned, the main bulwark for our Republic crumbles. More citizens then withdraw and give up. That calamity would freeze Congress and the people who are the last ultimate rescuers of our besieged constitutional Republic.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWeE8linnmC12wxo4PYwiEd6	2025-01-24T16:50:13-08:00	
As One Cycle Ends, Another Begins Amid Growing Divergence – Analy...	We project global growth will remain steady at 3.3 percent this year and next, broadly aligned with potential growth that has substantially weakened since before the pandemic. Inflation is declining, to 4.2 percent this year and 3.5 percent next year, in a return to central bank targets that will allow further normalization of monetary policy. This will help draw to a close the global disruptions of recent years, including the pandemic and Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, which precipitated the largest inflation surge in four decades. Though the global growth outlook is broadly unchanged from October, divergences across countries are widening. Among advanced economies, the United States is stronger than previously projected on continued strength in domestic demand. We have raised our growth projection for the US this year by 0.5 percentage point, to 2.7 percent. Growth in the euro area, by contrast, is likely to increase only modestly, to 1 percent from 0.8 percent in 2024. Headwinds include weak momentum, especially in manufacturing, low consumer confidence, and the persistence of a negative energy price shock. European gas prices remain about five times as high as in the United States, versus twice as high before the pandemic. In emerging market economies, growth projections are broadly unchanged, at 4.2 percent and 4.3 percent this year and next. Elevated trade and policy uncertainty is contributing to anemic demand in many countries, but economic activity is likely to pick up as this uncertainty recedes. This includes China, where we now project 4.5 percent growth next year, up 0.4 percentage point from our prior forecast. Some divergence between large economies has been cyclical, with the US economy operating above its potential while Europe and China are below. Under current policies, this cyclical divergence will dissipate. But the divergence between the US and Europe is more due to structural factors, and the disconnect will linger if these are left unaddressed. It reflects persistently stronger US productivity growth, particularly but not exclusively in the technology sector, linked to a more favorable business environment and deeper capital markets. Over time, this translates into higher returns on US investment, increased inbound capital flows, a stronger dollar and US living standards pulling away from those of other advanced economies. For China, it is notable that potential growth is now more like that of other emerging market economies. Economic policy uncertainty is elevated, with many governments newly elected in 2024. Our projections incorporate recent market developments and the impact of heightened trade policy uncertainty, assumed to be temporary, but refrain from making assumptions about potential policy changes that are currently under public debate. In the near term, a constellation of risks could further exacerbate these divergences. European economies could slow more than anticipated, especially if investors grow more concerned about public debt sustainability in more vulnerable countries. The main risk is that euro area monetary and fiscal policy could simultaneously run out of room if weaker economic activity pushes interest rates back toward the effective lower bound just as insufficient fiscal consolidation raises risk premia, in turn further constraining fiscal policy. In China, should fiscal and monetary measures prove insufficient to address domestic weakness, the economy is at risk of a debt-deflation stagnation trap, where falling prices raise the real value of debt, undermining activity further. The sharp decline in Chinese government bond yields, seen as haven for local investors, shows rising investor concern. Both in China and Europe, these factors could lower inflation and economic growth. By contrast, while many of the policy shifts under the incoming US administration are hard to quantify precisely, they are likely to push inflation higher in the near term relative to our baseline. Some indicated policies, such as looser fiscal policy or deregulation efforts, would stimulate aggregate demand and increase inflation in the near term, as spending and investment increase immediately. Other policies, such as higher tariffs or immigration curbs, will play out like negative supply shocks, reducing output and adding to price pressures. A combination of surging demand and shrinking supply would likely reignite US price pressures, though the effect on economic output in the near term would be ambiguous. Higher inflation would prevent the Federal Reserve from cutting interest rates and could even require rate hikes that would in turn strengthen the dollar and widen US external deficits. The combination of tighter US monetary policy and a stronger dollar would tighten financial conditions, especially for emerging markets and developing economies. Investors already anticipate such an outcome, with the US dollar gaining around 4 percent since the November election. Overall, these near-term risks could lead to further divergence across economies. In the medium term, about five years, the positive effects of the US fiscal shock may dissipate and could even reverse if fiscal vulnerabilities increase. Deregulation efforts can boost potential growth in the medium term if they remove red tape and stimulate innovation. However, there is a risk that excessive deregulation could also weaken financial safeguards and increase financial vulnerabilities, putting the US economy on a dangerous boom-bust path. Medium-term risks to economic output would be heightened by restrictive trade policies and stricter migration limits. Renewed inflation pressures, should they arise so soon after the recent surge, could well de-anchor inflation expectations this time around, as people and businesses are now much more vigilant about protecting their real income and profitability. Inflation expectations are further away from central bank targets than in 2017–21, which suggests increased risks of higher inflation. In this environment, monetary policy may need to be more agile and proactive to prevent expectations from de-anchoring, while macro-financial policies will need to remain vigilant to avoid a buildup of financial risks. The issue is likely to be exacerbated for emerging market economies, given the passthrough of dollar exchange rates to domestic prices and the effects of weaker domestic growth in China. In most cases, the appropriate policy response in emerging market economies will be to let currencies depreciate as needed while adjusting monetary policy to achieve price stability. However, in cases where inflation dynamics have become clearly unanchored or where there are financial stability risks, capital flow management and foreign exchange interventions could help, as long as these are not a substitute for necessary macroeconomic adjustments, in line with the IMF’s Integrated Policy Framework. For several countries, fiscal policy efforts have been delayed or insufficient to stabilize debt dynamics. It is now urgent to restore fiscal sustainability before it is too late and to build sufficient buffers to address future shocks that could be sizable and recurrent. Additional delays could trigger a worrying spiral where borrowing costs keep rising as markets lose confidence, further increasing adjustment needs. Recent strains in Brazil’s financial markets, like the reaction to the UK’s September 2022 mini-budget, underscore how funding conditions can deteriorate suddenly. While any sizable fiscal consolidation is bound to weigh on economic activity, countries should take special care to preserve growth as much as possible along the consolidation path, for instance by focusing the adjustment on reducing untargeted transfers or subsidies rather than government investment spending. To achieve this—and help overcome persistent structural differences driving growth divergences—there should be renewed focus on ambitious structural reforms to directly boost growth. These include targeted reforms to better allocate resources, increase government revenues, attract more capital, and foster innovation and competition. Finally, additional efforts should be made to strengthen and improve our multilateral institutions to help unlock a richer, more resilient, and sustainable global economy. Unilateral policies that distort competition—such as tariffs, nontariff barriers, or subsidies—rarely improve domestic prospects durably. They are unlikely to ameliorate external imbalances and may instead hurt trading partners, spur retaliation, and leave every country worse off.

Global Energy Will Face Severe Overcapacity In 2025 – Analysis	By He Yan Given the increasing volatility in the global economy and the growing uncertainty in geopolitical dynamics, along with fluctuations in oil and gas supply and the continued growth of renewable energy generation, the current global energy system is significantly impacted. Looking back at 2024, China’s oil companies took over large oil fields in the Middle East from ExxonMobil. Meanwhile, oil giants Shell and Norway’s Equinor paved new paths by merging their oil and gas assets in the North Sea, creating the largest oil company in the region. These major events have greatly influenced the oil and gas industry. As the industry continues to adapt to the changing environment, a series of trends are emerging, including shifts in geopolitical balance, breakthroughs in low-carbon technologies, the growing influence of artificial intelligence (AI), and the ups and downs of hydrogen energy development. First, geopolitical tensions remain a major risk factor for energy security and emissions reduction efforts. The new U.S. administration and its evolving approach to U.S.-China relations will be a focal point of global attention. At the same time, the ongoing conflicts in the Middle East and the situation in Ukraine will continue to draw widespread international concern. Furthermore, the increasingly unstable state of the Global South, the continued fragmentation of international alliances, and the revolutionary impact of AI will collectively shape a new global order. In the economic realm, the imminent threat of a global trade war triggered by U.S. tariffs could hinder economic growth and fuel protectionist policies. In this process, American liquefied natural gas (LNG) exports may become an important bargaining chip in global trade negotiations. After the Trump administration took office, its push for energy dominance policies could accelerate LNG exports through regulatory relaxation, faster approval processes, and infrastructure development, thus boosting the growth of American oil and gas production and LNG exports. According to reports, during the Trump 1.0 period in 2019, the U.S. became a net energy exporter. By 2023, it became the world's largest LNG exporter. According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, by 2028, North America's LNG export capacity is expected to more than double, where one-third of this growth will come from LNG projects in Canada and Mexico. This indicates that during Trump's second term, the U.S. will fully leverage LNG exports as a powerful tool in energy diplomacy. However, the acceleration of these projects could lead to a growing oversupply of LNG on the global market. This increased supply may undermine price stability, especially if trade tensions between the U.S. and China escalate once again. Such tensions would negatively impact U.S. producers and LNG developers, as American LNG projects rely heavily on steady demand from China. Additionally, Trump is attempting to strike a delicate balance between fostering the growth of American LNG exports to Europe and managing his stance on Russia. As Europe’s demand for LNG continues to rise, Trump views this as an opportunity to reduce Russia’s influence. However, as he has repeatedly pointed out, in order to bring an end to the war in Ukraine swiftly, it may be necessary to consider easing sanctions on Russia. Therefore, Trump’s role in shaping the U.S. and global energy markets through his 2025 energy agenda is especially significant. Secondly, supply chain challenges will continue to impact the global energy market. Over the past year, as global demand for energy has surged, not only in traditional oil and gas sectors but also in the low-carbon energy industry, energy supply chains have faced significant challenges. In the oil and gas industry, both buyers and suppliers have been struggling with high input costs. Although these costs have come down from historical highs, they are still expected to remain at elevated levels. Rystad Energy predicts that by 2025, high investment levels in both oil and gas and new energy sectors will exacerbate the already strained supply chains. In the offshore oil and gas industry, bottlenecks in floating production storage and offloading units (FPSOs), subsea equipment, drilling rigs, and other related vessels are expected to persist, continuing to delay the progress of capital projects. In North America, capital optimization and increased efficiency have further intensified overcapacity, putting pressure on the earnings of oilfield services companies. In the new energy sector, overcapacity in battery and solar photovoltaic manufacturing will continue to grow, fundamentally lowering prices. However, protectionism and tariffs will drive up costs for importers and force manufacturers to shift more of their operations to domestic outsourcing and overseas markets. Overall, as suppliers prepare for the new world order, divestments and mergers and acquisitions will become a key feature of the entire energy supply chain. Furthermore, driven by efforts to decarbonize industries, the rise of electric vehicles, and the rapid expansion of data centers, global electricity demand is entering a new phase of accelerated growth, which will continue to fuel the expansion of the low-carbon energy market. Goldman Sachs predicts that, globally, data centers currently consume an average of 1% to 2% of total global electricity, but driven by AI technologies, their energy consumption is steadily increasing. It is expected that by 2030, this share will rise to 3% to 4%. As a result, tech companies have become one of the key buyers in the power purchase agreement (PPA) market. Oil giants have already taken note of this market opportunity and begun entering the electricity market. In order to meet the 24-hour electricity demand, some tech companies are also turning to other base-load power sources, including signing power purchase agreements with traditional nuclear power plants. At the same time, these companies are showing strong interest in new small modular reactor (SMR) technologies. However, due to the still-high development costs of nuclear power and the need for further verification of technical feasibility, the primary focus remains on purchasing low-carbon energy for now. Therefore, in the short term, renewable energy will continue to be the priority for electricity investment. The International Energy Agency (IEA) has stated that by 2025, solar power is expected to meet more than half of the world's new electricity demand. In addition, the hydrogen energy sector may receive more policy support but will also face an increasing number of stalled projects. For instance, in the hydrogen subsidy final plan released by the Biden administration in January this year, the electricity consumption time standard for electrolyzers in hydrogen production was relaxed from 'hourly' to 'annual', and subsidies for hydrogen production from sources like nuclear power and biomass power generation were also introduced. This field has bipartisan consensus, hence one can expect to see strong continuity after the Trump administration takes office. Meanwhile, Germany, as one of the major markets for clean hydrogen, will make its political support and commitment to hydrogen energy even clearer after its elections. Both China and India will also continue to push forward agendas related to clean hydrogen and its derivatives. However, in mid-2024, many hydrogen projects faced suspension or cancellation. This includes Kansai Electric Power’s pull out from the Australian green hydrogen project, Shell’s suspension of the Norwegian blue hydrogen project, Repsol’s suspension of its Spanish green hydrogen development, and multiple large-scale hydrogen projects in Inner Mongolia, among others. On the whole, these projects face numerous challenges, including R&D costs, hydrogen source supply, technical standards, hydrogen storage and transportation, and talent shortages. By 2025, many large-scale hydrogen projects that were launched earlier will likely face similar difficulties and may start to fall by the wayside. Final analysis conclusion: As the energy industry continues to adapt to a changing environment, a series of trends are emerging. First, American LNG exports may become an important bargaining chip in global trade negotiations. At the same time, the risk of oversupply in the global market, influenced by this trend, could undermine price stability. Second, the global energy market will continue to face supply chain challenges. Furthermore, the accelerated growth of global electricity demand will continue to drive the development of the low-carbon energy market. Lastly, while the hydrogen energy sector will receive more policy support, it will also face an increasing number of stalled projects.

Will Trump Spark A Mineral ‘Gold Rush’ In Greenland? – Analysis	By Henry Ridgwell The mineral wealth on the Arctic island of Greenland is in the global spotlight after U.S. President Donald Trump said he wants to take control of the territory from Denmark, prompting alarm from European allies. Trump's words were echoed in a January 12 interview on 'Fox News Sunday' by Vice President JD Vance, who said, 'There is a deal to be made in Greenland,' and that the island has 'a lot of great natural resources.' Until now, Greenland's mining industry has struggled to turn a profit, but could that be about to change? 'Full of minerals' Greenland currently has only one active commercial mine — White Mountain —located north of the capital, Nuuk, and gets its stark, monochrome color from anorthosite rock, which is rich in calcium deposits and other minerals. The mine's operator, Lumina Sustainable Materials, ships the rock from Greenland's western coastline to Asia, Europe and North America, where it is used to make a variety of products such as fiberglass, paint, fillers, cement and polymers. Efforts are under way to exploit aluminum deposits within the anorthosite. 'Greenland is a country full of minerals. We have, literally, minerals available all over the place,' Bent Olsvig Jensen, Lumina's managing director in Greenland, told VOA in an interview. Dozens of other mining companies from around the world are conducting exploration and feasibility studies across Greenland, although White Mountain remains the only commercial operation currently trading. China competition The minerals include plentiful rare earth elements such as lithium and scandium, which are critical for devices such as batteries. Global supply chains for those elements are currently dominated by China. Trump has repeatedly said that U.S. control of Greenland is necessary for 'international security.' His comments caused a political storm in Greenland and Denmark, but mining companies see an opportunity. 'His interest in Greenland can actually help the industry get access to further investment, which is needed for the industry to develop in Greenland,' Jensen said. 'So, yes, I definitely welcome it. And I think it's important that both from the industry side but also from the political side in Greenland that we position ourselves towards Trump and the U.S.' 'Not for sale' Greenland's government is largely autonomous, although Denmark is responsible for the island's security. Naaja Nathanielsen, Greenland's minister for resources, emphasized the government's long-held response to Trump's interest: Open for business, but not for sale. 'We do want American investments. We do want collaboration with the U.S. State Department, and we've been trying to advocate for that for some time,' she told VOA. Greenland signed a deal with Trump during his first administration in 2019 to boost the mining industry. 'The U.S. funded our direct marketing towards investors all over the world, and this agreement has just come to its end. So we've been trying to … get engagement from the U.S. for some time now in order to renew this deal,' Nathanielsen said. Challenges Despite widespread recognition of Greenland's mineral wealth, attracting investment in mining has been a long-term problem. 'For many years now, we have seen that there has been some hesitance in the investor environment to engage in high-risk, long-term projects. We only have one American-owned license at the moment. In comparison, we have 23 from Canada, 23 from the U.K. and about 10 from Denmark. So, it's not an area where you see a lot of U.S. engagement as of now. Of course we welcome it, and there's plenty of opportunity,' Nathanielsen said. Greenland's government is pushing for full independence from Denmark. Supporters hope the island's mineral wealth could one day provide the economic foundation for full statehood. But there's a long way to go, said Ulrik Pram Gad, an analyst at the Danish Institute for International Studies in Copenhagen. 'If you want minerals out of the ground and financing Greenlandic self-sufficiency economically, then you will need to have the uptake in the international processing going,' Gad told VOA. 'And then, probably you'll have to think very closely about how to make sure that these mining projects benefit people who live close to them, rather than being a new version of imperialist extraction. Because then, the Greenlanders might not want it in the end,' he explained. The risk doesn't always end in reward. Rubies and pink sapphires were extracted at the Aappaluttoq mine until 2023, when its operator, Greenland Ruby, went bankrupt, $71 million in debt. The company is restructuring and seeking new investors, with a goal of restarting operations. Greenland's 2.1 million square kilometers of land is icebound for much of the year. 'Obviously, we are in the middle of the Arctic, so there are some logistical challenges,' Jensen of Lumina said. 'Not all of Greenland is open all year round. However, that is something that we can plan our way out of.' Jensen added that investors must have patience to make a profit. 'It takes time to develop a project from the early-stage exploration until you actually have a mine where you can extract and start selling. And as we all say in mining, 'Time is money.''	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWeE8linnmC12xf8vwH-iTCL	2025-01-24T16:34:09-08:00	
US-Saudi Ties Set For New Chapter In Trump’s Second Term – Analys...	By Hassan Al-Mustafa Following Donald Trump’s victory in the 2024 US presidential election, Saudi Arabia moved swiftly to reinforce its diplomatic ties through multiple channels. King Salman’s congratulatory message highlighted 'the excellence of the historic close relations between the two friendly countries and peoples.' The Saudi monarch emphasized the shared commitment to 'strengthen and develop them in all fields.' The diplomatic outreach continued as Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman personally called Trump to convey his congratulations. During the call, the crown prince emphasized 'Saudi Arabia’s aspiration to strengthen the historical and strategic relations between the two countries.' Responding to these warm sentiments, Trump expressed gratitude to the crown prince for his congratulations and acknowledged his goodwill toward the American people. Beyond traditional diplomatic exchanges, Saudi Arabia demonstrated its pragmatic approach through informal channels. On Nov. 17, social media buzzed with images and footage of Yasir Al-Rumayyan, the governor of Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund, at UFC 309 in New York in the company of President-elect Trump and his newly appointed government efficiency czar Elon Musk. This high-profile gathering, which also included several other key figures, signaled Riyadh’s sophisticated approach to relationship building. By engaging with Trump’s inner circle in casual settings, Saudi Arabia demonstrated its commitment to establishing personal connections with influential members of the incoming administration. Saudi Arabia’s current proactive diplomatic approach builds upon decades of US-Saudi relations. The Kingdom pursues a strategy aimed at creating resilient ties that can withstand shifts between Democratic and Republican administrations. This approach operates on two tracks: first, by deepening institutional cooperation between the two governments and, second, by cultivating broad networks among American political, economic and intellectual leaders. Through transparent engagement and emphasis on shared interests, Saudi Arabia works to steadily strengthen these relationships, while developing mechanisms to address any points of disagreement between the nations. During Monday’s inauguration of President Trump, Princess Reema bint Bandar, Saudi Arabia’s ambassador to the US, highlighted the enduring bond between the two nations. She emphasized the deep historical ties spanning eight decades, noting how their strategic partnership has enhanced regional stability and security, while successfully navigating various political and economic challenges. The ambassador reaffirmed Saudi Arabia’s commitment to continued collaboration with the US, stressing their shared goal of advancing the well-being of both peoples, the region and the global community. In an interview with Al-Arabiya last October, then-presidential candidate Trump expressed his intention to collaborate with the crown prince on regional peace initiatives. Trump dubbed the Saudi leader a 'visionary.' He commended the crown prince’s achievements, saying that 'he has done things that nobody else would have even thought about.' He said he is a 'great guy' and lauded his approach to leadership. Trump’s laudatory remarks signal a clear diplomatic overture to Riyadh, indicating his readiness to cultivate stronger bilateral ties during his administration. By offering such explicit praise, he seeks to differentiate his approach from the more contentious stance adopted by Democrats, particularly contrasting with President Joe Biden’s initial critical rhetoric toward the Kingdom during his campaign and early tenure. Saudi Economy Minister Faisal Al-Ibrahim has emphasized the Kingdom’s willingness to maintain continuity in Saudi-US cooperation, while expressing readiness to address global economic challenges alongside Trump’s administration, especially the economic growth slowdown affecting the international community. This economic focus reflects Riyadh’s strategic assessment of Trump’s business-oriented approach and his priorities: tackling US inflation, boosting employment, enhancing income levels, managing Chinese trade competition and navigating EU economic relations. The Kingdom aims to leverage economic cooperation as a primary channel for engaging with the incoming administration, viewing it as a pathway to secure advanced technology transfers and attract the foreign investment crucial for achieving the objectives of Vision 2030. While economic engagement offers significant opportunities, it also presents potential areas of tension due to divergent priorities between Saudi Arabia and the US. Trump’s proposed policies — including new tariffs on Chinese exports, potential trade restrictions on EU and Canadian goods, expanded domestic oil exploration and economic pressure on China and Russia — may conflict with Saudi Arabia’s existing international partnerships. The Kingdom maintains substantial trade and energy relationships with China, India, Russia and the EU, with China serving as its primary oil customer. Additionally, Trump’s support for increased US oil production, aimed at lowering energy prices, could undermine Saudi Arabia’s fiscal objectives by pushing oil prices below the Kingdom’s budgetary targets. These details are extremely important and influential, not just in Saudi-US relations but also in the latter’s relations with the entire world. The Middle East peace process represents another domain where Saudi-US engagement may simultaneously foster collaboration and reveal policy differences. The Kingdom advocates for a comprehensive peace framework grounded in ending Israeli actions against Palestinians, upholding international legal standards and establishing Palestinian sovereignty. The crown prince has articulated this position unequivocally, declaring the Palestinian issue as Saudi Arabia’s primary regional concern. He has firmly stated that the Kingdom’s diplomatic recognition of Israel remains contingent upon the establishment of an independent Palestinian state with East Jerusalem as its capital. Meanwhile, President Trump has his own vision, this week saying that 'I think Saudi Arabia will end up being in the Abraham accords.' Riyadh has established clear conditions for joining the Abraham Accords, centered on securing a verifiable pathway to peace that explicitly guarantees Palestinian statehood. This stance is interlinked with other Saudi priorities, including a US defense pact, civilian nuclear program development and additional bilateral agreements under discussion. The trajectory of Trump’s approach to the two-state solution remains uncertain, with his administration’s position on these fundamental issues likely to emerge in the early stages of his presidency. The scope of Middle East peace extends beyond the Palestinian issue, encompassing the complex Saudi-Iranian relationship, which saw notable improvement following the March 2023 Beijing Agreement. Through this diplomatic breakthrough, Riyadh aimed to establish a framework for managing bilateral tensions with Tehran, while seeking to curtail Iranian support for militant groups operating within Saudi territory and potential threats to the Kingdom’s critical infrastructure. The Saudi-Iranian diplomatic thaw, despite proceeding with measured caution, represents a strategic pillar of Saudi foreign policy aimed at preventing military escalation in the Gulf region. This position was articulated by Foreign Minister Prince Faisal bin Farhan during the World Economic Forum annual summit in Davos, Switzerland, this week. He underscored Saudi Arabia’s commitment to regional conflict prevention, while calling for constructive Iranian engagement in the Gaza ceasefire process. He also expressed confidence that the incoming US administration would not heighten regional military tensions. Prince Faisal’s remarks reflect Saudi Arabia’s nuanced understanding of the complex dynamics between Washington and Tehran. His address acknowledged that progress in US-Iranian relations requires a pragmatic approach rooted in meaningful dialogue to address multiple interconnected challenges: Iran’s nuclear program, its ballistic missile development and broader regional security concerns affecting both the Arab Gulf states and the wider Middle East. The foreign minister’s message emphasizes Saudi Arabia’s conviction that diplomatic engagement, rather than military confrontation, remains the most viable path forward in resolving these critical issues. Despite Trump’s rhetoric about potential military action against Iran — a stance aligned with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s preferences — his administration is likely to prioritize economic leverage over military confrontation. This approach would revive the 'maximum pressure' strategy, using economic tools to extract concessions from Tehran. Such compromises, while politically costly for Iran, could prove essential in mitigating the regional instability stemming from the aftermath of the conflicts in Gaza and Lebanon. Saudi Arabia aims to cultivate constructive engagement with the Trump administration while maintaining its strategic autonomy. The Kingdom will pursue this collaboration without compromising its core economic and political interests, its relationships with major powers like China and Russia or its fundamental prerequisites for normalizing relations with Israel. Drawing on its diplomatic experience, Riyadh possesses the capability to navigate these complexities through pragmatic solutions, trust-building initiatives and win-win proposals that advance mutual interests without generating friction with the incoming White House administration. • Hassan Al-Mustafa is a Saudi writer and researcher interested in Islamic movements, the development of religious discourse and the relationship between the Gulf Cooperation Council states and Iran.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWeE8linnmC12714x1bwtfM-	2025-01-24T16:32:33-08:00	
The Venetian Republic Offers Powerful Lessons To An American One ...	The Venetian Republic's political system, emerging alongside those of other Italian city-states, was founded on collaboration and power distribution. Its rise and decline highlight the importance of adaptability in the face of shifting global political dynamics. Over more than a thousand years, Venice transformed from a modest refuge into a dominant Mediterranean power. Despite various crises and encircling empires, the Venetian Republic avoided foreign rule, revolution, and collapse. It developed an adaptable and efficient political system, building on its semi-independence from the 5th century until Napoleon's conquest in 1797. In an international system dominated by self-proclaimed democratic republics, the longevity and eventual downfall of Venice's oligarchic republican model provides insights for tailoring governance to contemporary challenges. Its unique political structure inspired founding fathers of the United States, like Alexander Hamilton and John Adams, who looked to Venice's early system when shaping the republic. By blending Roman legal principles, Byzantine refinements like the Justinian Code (a compilation of Roman laws shaped by Greek traditions that codified and systematized legal practices), and its original innovations, Venice became a symbol of stability, endurance, and independence. The Origins of Venice and Its Push for Independence Venetian society was deeply paternalistic, governed by a hereditary elite with limited public participation, and yet it contained many elements of distribution of powers and checks on authority that are ubiquitous today. Geopolitically savvy and culturally diverse, Venice was open to new and foreign influence while preserving its traditions. Venetian diplomat Gasparo Contarini's 16th-century account, shaped by his family's central role in Venetian politics, alongside other sources, highlights Venice's self-proclamation as the Serenissima Repubblica di Venezia—the Most Serene Republic of Venice. Venice's origins, according to tradition, trace back to 421 AD, when Roman refugees fleeing invasions in northern Italy established self-governed settlements in the Venetian Lagoon. The Rialto, which became synonymous with Venice, only emerged as the city's center 400 years later. The collapse of the Western Roman Empire in 476 left northern Italy contested, with instability driving more settlers to the lagoon. During the 5th and 6th centuries, trade networks and influential families began to shape the region. They reflected a mix of loyalties: pro-Byzantine landowners tied to the mainland coexisted with a rising merchant class seeking autonomy, along with the Frankish factions loyal to Rome. These groups dominated the informal councils, assemblies, and tribune leadership roles that governed early Venetian society. By the 7th century, Venetian settlers recognized Byzantine authority in exchange for protection and securing vital trade access. Historian John Julius Norwich emphasized the Byzantine's role in shaping Venice's identity, alongside its Roman heritage. In 697 AD, the lagoon's settlers elected their first doge (duke), marking the beginning of Venice's independence. Initially, the doge's authority required approval from Constantinople, but Byzantine authority in the region was never strong and gradually faded. Seeking stronger local governance to navigate the delicate political landscape, Venetians resisted certain Byzantine decrees and a revolt in 726 saw them elect their own doge without outside interference. In the early 9th century, Venice successfully secured greater autonomy from the Byzantine Empire while keeping the Frankish Empire at bay by playing a crucial role in mediating peace between them, a settlement later known as Pax Nicephori. Over the following centuries, Venetian autonomy increased as it forged ties with Rome to enhance its influence in Europe. Venice's role in the 1204 sack of Constantinople, led by Latin forces, solidified its independence as a sovereign republic, coinciding with the rise of powerful republican city-states across Italy. Its push for independence was vital in shaping a political system aligned with Venice's unique needs, values, and aspirations as a sovereign state. Constraining Doge Power and Creating a Republic Like the Roman Republic, Venice lacked a formal written constitution or judicially enforced laws. Instead, its political system relied on unwritten customs, allowing flexibility in responding to new challenges, and also demonstrating that the republican culture depends on habits of the heart and mind more than documents that record statements of principle. Though dominated by a hereditary elite, Venice's republican system prioritized power decentralization, an unusual approach at the time that encouraged a balance of authority and political stability. Early doges ruled autocratically for life, often attempting to establish dynasties, leading to rivalries, assassinations, and exiles. By 1032, Venetian patricians chose to abolish de facto hereditary dogeship, and though the doge retained a lifetime title, they could be deposed or pressured to resign. Secrecy was essential to shielding political affairs from outside influence. With few grand political rallies or public speeches, rivalries were mostly confined to private councils. This restraint also helped prevent stirring up public sentiment, avoiding sensationalism, and maintaining a sense of calm and order in the city. Venetians were willing to adapt when necessary, but once a solution proved effective, they stuck with it. The threat of factionalism over the doge's position, led by the Tiepolo and Dandolo families in the 1200s, prompted patricians to introduce a unique voting process for the doge in 1268. Combining lotteries and voting, this system would remain largely unchanged for the next 500 years. Council members gathered and drew from an urn containing hundreds of balls (ballotta)—30 gold and the rest silver; those drawing gold advanced, while those who picked silver exited. The ballottino, a young attendant, managed the urns. The 30 who picked gold then repeated the lottery, reducing their number to nine. These nine members then deliberated and agreed on 40 candidates, each requiring a minimum of seven votes from the group of nine to be considered. The process continued: the 40 were reduced to 12, who nominated 25; the 25 to nine, who nominated 45, and finally, the 45 to 11, who selected 41 electors. The final electors deliberated and voted on the doge, who required a minimum of 25 votes to win. The process combined the impartiality of lotteries with the selectivity of voting, minimizing the chance for corruption while ensuring the legitimacy of decisions through broad consensus. The often weeks-long change broke the families' duopoly, and ensuing elections often took weeks. Contarini observed that doges were neither glorified nor vilified. Their terms were subject to posthumous review, with poor leadership censured or erased from public memory, while the contributions of effective rulers were recognized. This helped to ensure that leadership was viewed as a collective effort rather than the achievement of any single individual. Fear of the doge's authority also led patricians to steadily decentralize power into hereditary committees, integrating government expertise within the oligarchy. This ensured balanced decision-making and reduced the risk of autocratic rule. In 1142, the Minor Council was established as a small executive body to assist and monitor the doge. This was followed by the Great Council in 1172, which became the foundation of Venetian governance and the principal legislative body, severely limiting the doge's power. Membership in the Great Council was a lifetime privilege for patrician males. From 1179, judicial authority was invested in the Quarantia Criminale(criminal law), followed later by two other Councils of Forty (highest appeal court). By the early 13th century, the Senate emerged from the Great Council, focusing on trade and foreign policy, and was composed of serving and former officials. Meanwhile, in response to the failed 1310 revolt by Bajamonte Tiepolo, the Council of Ten was created to track down conspirators, later evolving to handle crises, conduct investigations, and oversee internal security. Despite rising governmental complexity, Venice's bureaucracy remained efficient and avoided runaway growth. Political offices outside the dogeship also faced constraints. Terms were typically limited to one year to prevent consolidation of power and reelections often required formal approval. Close relatives were prohibited from holding the same office, running in the same election, or voting in elections involving each other to prevent familial monopolies. Contarini noted that accountability was shared among the elite. Nobles who supported candidates were held financially liable if those candidates were later convicted of embezzlement and unable to repay the amount. Corruption resulted in punishments such as property confiscation and exile, with the competitive noble families keeping each other in check. As the doge's role became largely symbolic, real power shifted to the Council of Ten, the Great Council, and the Senate. These bodies dominated Venetian politics during its Golden Age, Renaissance, and eventual collapse, adapting to changing needs while maintaining cohesion and expertise through overlapping membership. The Arengo or Concio, a general assembly of Venetian general citizens, initially played a strong political role alongside the doge. However, Venice's noble families were similarly distrustful of commoner influence through democracy. Public participation in governance declined sharply after the Serrata of 1297 or the closing of the Great Council, which solidified hereditary governance and saw the Arengo lose its political authority before it was formally abolished in 1423. These decisions effectively ended democracy in Venice and ensured political power remained concentrated among the nobles. Given the rarity of democracy at the time, this approach nonetheless permitted greater political stability by minimizing potential disruptions from populist movements. Social Hierarchy and Economic Opportunities in Venice The late 13th and early 14th centuries 'marked the formal separation of the nobles from the rest of the population,' entrenching Venice's oligarchy and placing the non-patrician majority—approximately 95 percent of the city's population—under elite control. The disconnect between the elites and commoners could be stark—Contarini praised Venice's commitment to protecting commoners during crises like the plague, but later accounts paint a less charitable picture. Despite limited political representation and rigid social classes, Venice's nobles managed to maintain enough support for the political system to survive. A tiered hierarchy emerged under them, with the cittadini—a privileged class of merchants, skilled artisans, notaries, and administrators—forming approximately eight percent of the population, while the majority were commoners (popolani). Social hierarchy in Venice was strictly enforced, with laws dictating what each class could wear. Intermarriage between patricians and cittadini was rare, though the latter class experienced regular turnover. Richer cittadini often surpassed certain aristocratic families in wealth, while patricians invested in merchant enterprises, creating economic interdependence. The cittadini also controlled the civil service, led by the Grand Chancellor of Venice—the highest-ranking non-noble official. Through the Order of Secretaries, the cittadini served as notaries, clerks, tax collectors, and judicial officers. The wealthiest of their families with long-standing Venetian roots (cittadini originari) were included in the Book of Silver and granted additional opportunities in committees. Granting the cittadini some political influence prevented the patricians from completely dominating government affairs and ensured efficiency through their administrative expertise. Despite the large and relatively powerless commoner class, Venice avoided the social upheavals common in other Italian city-states. According to Dennis Romano, professor emeritus of history at Syracuse University, 14th-century Venice remained stable because patricians and commoners were less rigidly separated, and tradition coexisted with flexibility. Social networks could overlap and legal and moral boundaries occasionally blurred during this period. Social rules were relaxed during holidays and festivals, elevating a sense of civic community, while commoners could participate in religious roles, including as members of the clergy. Symbols of unity, such as the Venetian mask, the lion of Saint Mark, and the figure of the doge, reinforced civic identity. Legal protections through the Avogaria de Comun (public prosecutors), established in the late 12th century, ensured justice for commoners and legal representation for the poor. The state also supported infrastructure projects, welfare institutions, and charities, and wealthy nobles were expected to engage in philanthropy without fanfare and provide financial aid to the state during crises. Venice's economic allure and social mobility opportunities were, however, arguably the most crucial factors in maintaining stability. Venetian contract law ensured trust and stability in trade. The republic's vast commerce and trade networks and position as a vital connector between the East and the West offered opportunities to commoners rarely found elsewhere. While they suffered more during conflicts, famines, and plagues, the diverse composition of the popolani made it difficult for them to unite around common grievances. Additionally, Venice's stable governance and potential for social mobility left them better off than those in neighboring city-states and empires. As a result, though commoners were excluded from major political decisions, they accepted their limited role, trusting in the fairness and accountability of Venice's governing class, institutions, and rule of law. Within the city, a thriving retail sector and diverse economic opportunities complemented a strong manufacturing base. Venice became a leader in shipbuilding, wool and silk cloth production, and glassmaking, attracting talent and investment. Commoners could also join merchant guilds and trade associations along with cittadini, gaining modest political representation and participation in collective decision-making. In later centuries, Venice evolved into a hub of printing and intellectual life, eventually becoming a center for culture and leisure, renowned for its prestige as a museum city. Venice's economic adaptability, driven by both patricians and the merchant class, was key to Venice's sustained prosperity, driving innovation and supporting the city's ability to respond to shifting trade and political dynamics. Military Strength, Foreign Holdings, and Diplomacy But Venice's survival and success also came from its military strength. Surrounded by larger states, its central hub in the Venetian Lagoon provided a defensible core for its navy. The state-owned Arsenal, a pioneering shipyard, and private enterprises enabled the mass production of ships, blending commerce and defense. Merchant ships were often fitted for combat, doubling as warships to protect trade routes, while military expeditions were self-sustaining through trade conducted en route. Boasting the strongest navy in Europe, Venice compensated for its limited land power by employing professional mercenaries and condottieri (or military commanders). The republic avoided overextension, focusing on maintaining positive relations with its limited territories. Mainland cities enjoyed considerable autonomy, with several independent city-states voluntarily joining the republic. During the War of Cambrai (1508 to 1516), Venice contemplated ceding mainland territories, but revolts in occupied cities in support of Venice helped drive out invaders. At its height in the 16th century, Venice's dogado around the lagoon housed approximately 150,000 inhabitants, with its wider territories encompassing 2.3 million people. The Domini da Tera administered mainland Italy, while the Domini da Mar governed overseas colonies. Venetian military officials, like their political counterparts, were rotated regularly to avoid power accumulation and provide numerous nobles with administrative and military experience. Revolts in Crete against Venetian rule exposed governance flaws in its territories, but efforts to promote greater equality between Venetian settlers and local populations eventually brought peace and showcased Venice's adaptability in managing overseas territories. Venice also maintained its independence through skilled diplomacy and a calculated focus on the balance of power. Supported by an expansive network of spies, diplomats, and agents, the small republic successfully navigated challenges from larger, powerful rivals, including Byzantium, the Carolingians, the Holy Roman Empire, the Ottomans, France, and Spain. An early strategic alliance with Byzantium secured access to key ports, while ties with Rome and trade posts as far as China reinforced its position as a reliable trading partner and intermediary. Ties with entities like the Hanseatic League (a trading network) further expanded Venice's global reach. Even during its economic decline, Venice played a powerful diplomatic role. Several Venetian popes were elected from the 1400s to 1700s, and Venetian diplomat Alvise Contarini played a crucial role in mediating the Peace of Westphalia in 1648, ending the Thirty Years' War. Steady Decline The seeds of Venice's decline were nonetheless sown early into its foreign expansion. The Fourth Crusade in 1204 enriched Venice and expanded its territories but strained its relations with Eastern Orthodoxy. The smaller, weakened Byzantine Empire, restored after the crusade, could not withstand the rising Ottoman Empire, whose conquest of Constantinople in 1453 disrupted Venice's critical eastern trading routes. Venice maintained a strong presence in the Mediterranean, but logistical challenges, heavier taxation, and growing Ottoman competition gradually pushed it into a defensive retreat. In 1492, Spain's accidental arrival in the Americas marked a shift in global trade and the need for larger, ocean-bound ships. Venice's lack of access to the Atlantic, which would fuel later European empires, was soon compounded by the Portuguese voyage to India via Africa in 1498, further undercutting its trade with the East. Venetians later established footholds in cities like Paris, London, and the Low Countries to collaborate with the rapidly growing Atlantic powers, but they struggled to keep pace. The city's preference for autonomy left it isolated in a rapidly changing European geopolitical landscape. While Venice's early history of isolationism gave way to expansion, the city reverted to a more defensive and conservative isolationism in a world dominated by global powers. Repeated outbreaks of plague, particularly in 1575 to 1577 and 1630 to 1631, devastated Venice's population and weakened its economic and military foundation. By the 17th century, Venice's once-adaptative nobles and political system had come to resist reform. Venice's oligarchic social and political structure, as noted by historian John Norwich, had become rigid and highly corrupt. The nobility, formerly active merchants, had become passive investors, landowners, or city administrators. Destitute aristocrats could no longer sustain their privileges, weakening both their status and the socio-political hierarchy. Political activists, inspired by French Jacobin ideals and Italian nationalism, became increasingly vocal. Venice's system had also arguably become too outdated by the 18th century. Nation-states and the modern concept of nationalism simply overwhelmed merchant republics in demographics, territory, and wealth. Napoleon's revolutionary changes in both warfare and social systems allowed the French military to take Venice without a fight. The Great Council then voted itself out of existence, and France transferred the region to Austria, which shifted the center of the regional government to Milan and prioritized nearby Triest as a port instead. Venice was later incorporated into Italy in 1866, which it has remained part of ever since. Venice's Strengths and Other Former Republics Other Italian city-state republics also achieved prominence. Florenceflourished with its banking sector, textile industry, and legal protections afforded to its citizens. Lucca maintained independence longer than Venice, while Pisa and Siena enjoyed periods of prominence. Genoa emerged as a significant maritime power, rivaling Venice for centuries. However, Florence shifted to hereditary and dynastic rule under the Medici family in the 16th century and conquered Pisa and Siena. Lucca lacked Venice's scale and influence, while Genoa, despite its strengths, struggled with internal tensions. Merchants and aristocrats were often at odds, as were rival noble clans who reverted to warring among themselves during peacetime. This instability often required foreign mediation, gradually eroding Genoa's autonomy, while its later alliance with Spain further subordinated Genoa's independence. In contrast, Venice managed to avoid conquest, retaining its republican system, political autonomy, and global significance long after many of its counterparts had faded or been absorbed. Even centuries after its fall, no other Italian republic holds the same mystique of Venice. The city's cultural impact alone was immense, producing creative figures like Tintoretto, Antonio Vivaldi, and Giovanni Bellini, and attracting Andrea Palladio and Titian. Its architectural beauty, set against the lagoon and emulating Roman styles, remains an international draw. Venice's maintenance and adaptation of Greek and Roman political influences created a system that lasted centuries, which though weakened by the time of French conquest, may have had the potential to rebound. Venice's independence movement, which has accelerated since 2014, is unlikely to achieve secession due to significant barriers, including the constraints of Italy's constitution, lack of international recognition, and disputes over the territorial feasibility of such a split. The city's modern economy is driven by tourism, with more than 5.7 million visitors in 2023. Other Italian city-states survive in their own ways: Genoa revived as a key port city in the 1800s and remains so today. The Grimaldi family, originally from Genoa, meanwhile, seized control of Monaco in 1297 and has ruled the country ever since. San Marino, a city-state republic with a claim to a 1700-year-old history, successfully diplomatically negotiated its independence in 301 AD. Other republics outside Italy emerged during Venice's time but struggled to endure. The Novgorod Republic established in 1136 in modern Russia, thrived on trade and featured a large assembly, term limits, and checks on elite power. However, its lack of a strong military left it vulnerable, and Moscow captured it in 1478. The Dutch Republic, established in 1588, decentralized government between provinces and the States General for shared decision-making. It prioritized legal protections, religious tolerance, trade, literacy, and social mobility, though the Dutch East and West India companies undermined republican ideals through colonization and slavery. In 1795, the Dutch Republic fell to France and was replaced by the centralized Batavian Republic, which struggled with regionalism and reliance and dominance by France. By 1810, it became a French-controlled monarchy, until Dutch independence in 1813 reintroduced a monarchy that persists today. Modern Republican Rule Modern republics remain young and show a range of adaptations. Parliamentary republics rely on coalition-building, but this risks marginalizing even the most popular parties. Votes of confidence can swiftly remove leaders, but shorter political terms can lead to prioritizing short-term visions. Presidential systems can, meanwhile, run the risk of autocracy, particularly with longer-term limits and incumbency advantage. Other challenges include promoting democratic participation without runaway populism, balancing decentralization and centralization, creating effective political bodies without needless bureaucracy, and striving for peace while remaining prepared for conflict. Switzerland stands out for its sustained stability, avoiding revolution, occupation, or imperialism since its unification in 1848. It combines regional and international autonomy, open trade, and its role as a global financial and diplomatic hub. Seasonal canton voting embodies direct democracy and encourages citizen participation. However, universal suffrage faces resistance tied to immigration, with referendums on non-citizen voting rights from 1992 to 2016 struggling in areas with higher foreign populations, reflecting concerns over integration and 'over-foreignization' in the country. Singapore, an independent city-state republic since 1965, has thrived and maintained its autonomy by emerging as a trade hub, balancing Cold War powers and rising U.S.-China tensions over the last 20 years. Despite its nominally democratic and republican system, governance has remained centralized under the People's Action Party, dominated by Lee Kuan Yew's family and close allies. The Need for Greater Corporate Accountability The discussion of decentralized leadership should extend beyond nations to the private sector. Early corporations like the British East India Company, as well as modern constitutional republics, were modeled on medieval chartered towns that were given powers to legislate, imprison, and wage conflicts. Modern multinational corporations operate globally, influencing markets, negotiating with governments, and increasingly having access to armed forces. Their growing autonomy has led to efforts to link corporate governance with civic responsibility, including proposals to replace the hijacked democratic 'one share, one vote' system that has allowed major shareholders to consolidate power and exploit corporate governance in recent decades. The likelihood of self-imposed corporate accountability is low. However, introducing more layered governance with checks and balances could improve oversight, as private governing entities continue to evolve. Increasing experimentation with private cities globally signals a resurgence of corporate governance, seen more than a century ago in the U.S. with company towns. Similarly, Próspera, a private charter city on Roatán Island in Honduras, is run by a U.S. corporation with a proclaimed commitment to libertarian ideals. It's important to view the workers and communities these corporations interact with as similar to state subjects. The growth of corporate power challenges the classical liberal idea that contracts between companies and workers should be free of authority. Republican-style corporate leadership in such projects could address concerns about civic participation, autocracy, and the rule of law. Venice's Lessons for Modern Democracies Many factors contributed to Venice's success: expansive trade networks, social mobility, technological innovation, geographic advantages, military power, and diplomatic prowess. These elements were mutually reinforcing, underpinned by political stability achieved through distributing authority across collaborative bodies. While Venice's oligarchy compromised the non-hereditary ideal of republicanism, it effectively prevented dynasties and upheld the principle of power distribution. The public largely trusted the nobles, though the exclusive nature of the noble class contributed to their decline in later centuries. Venice's political evolution and trajectory are a priceless repository of history for modern democracies to study. The presence of a non-hereditary figure like the doge provided a unifying focal point for governance, helping to anchor symbolic authority and reduce factionalism. A commitment to checks and balances allowed for a balanced distribution of power. Economic opportunities were cultivated by elites and merchant classes and embraced by the commoners, driving Venice's prosperity and social mobility. Its ability to continuously adapt its political and economic systems was similarly a major reason for its long-term survival. Today, frequent power and public opinion shifts, coupled with the influence of wealth and corporations, are fueling instability and gridlock, undermining the long-term effectiveness of democratic institutions. History shows that democratic societies have voted to unintentionally dismantle their own democratic and republican systems, and contemporary voters have often turned to populism and autocracy in the 21st century out of frustration. But how much power should rest with individuals? Governance could be strengthened by withholding our tendency to center authority in people and instead placing it into political bodies. Venice's system, for all its strengths, failed to create a fully open, meritocratic system, but its emphasis on collaborative bodies within a professional political class is something modern democracies may need to reconsider. Had Venice's republican system continued to adapt rather than become increasingly rigid, it may have endured to this day. About the author: John P.

Sovereignty Under Siege – A Global Chessboard – OpEd	Donald Trump’s rhetoric about ‘the 51st state’ is treated by many as political theatre – a ploy by the president-elect to, perhaps, destabilize the opposition. But his remarks allude to something much less innocuous – something a bit more unsettling. By now, all of us have heard the rather boisterous rhetoric of the former president. The headlines are ever present: From Foxnews, 'Trump suggests Canada become 51st state after Trudeau said tariff would kill economy.' Politico reports, 'Trump threatens to retake Panama Canal.' And from AP, 'Trump again calls to buy Greenland after eyeing Canada and the Panama Canal.' Admittedly, audacious remarks from Trump are neither new nor are they taken too seriously in many quarters – just more political messaging by an incoming president with much to live up to. Yet, Donald Trump's bold talk about these states does mine something much deeper than mere rhetoric. And while his admonitions may not eventuate – that is beside the point. President-elect Trump is stirring the cauldron of world politics. Comments about tariffs as well as annexing, buying, and reclaiming sovereign territories have elicited both a caustic response as well as its own share of media humor. Beyond its entertainment value, Trump’s provocations (even if he is not aware of it), do point to a subtle and potentially more dangerous issue: Could nation-state sovereignty no longer be the inviolable precept we have believed in since the Peace of Westphalia in the 17th century? Although the concept of the 'sovereign nation-state' has its origin in 1648 with the Peace of Westphalia and the end of the Thirty Years’ War of Religion, the 'inviolability of borders' is a relatively recent phenomenon. The idea of a 'right to statehood' emerged in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, embraced by two counterposing entities: the Bolsheviks of Russia and the liberal US President Woodrow Wilson. Both sought to dismantle empires – Russia’s for ideological reasons and the US to expand its own influence. The result was a proliferation of relatively weak, dependent states that (for all practical purposes) became tools of Moscow and Washington foreign policy. The sovereignty of these 'neo-states' was little more than a bargaining chip – the latter essentially reliant on foreign support (militarily, economically and politically) for their existence. This dynamic has persisted beyond the Second World War into the neoliberal era of today. In fact, nearly every conflict until the mid-20th century ended with redrawn borders. So, here's the question: Are we not doing the same thing – today in Ukraine? Certainly, there have been previous examples of sovereignty being sacrificed for 'peace': the Sudetenland of Czechoslovakia (1938), Serbia/Kosovo (1999) and others. In a world where power increasingly relies on military might, sovereignty has shifted from being a precept of international law to an issue of practical control. And the control comes from beyond the borders of the alleged sovereign state –often for the benefit of foreign power agendas. Ukraine's sovereignty is contested for reasons that have little to do with the country itself. Consider the turn of events in Ukraine. Since Moscow’s 2022 'Special Military Operation,' (i.e. invasion) that country has been unable to maintain control over about one-fifth (20%) of its sovereign territory. Moreover, its prospects for regaining it are diminishing daily. At the same time, those countries supporting Ukraine militarily and financially with billions of dollars are now urging Kiev to stop the war and consider ceding territory for peace. The borders of Ukraine are being redrawn and its sovereign territory redefined by powers external to the country. In this shifting global landscape, it seems that territory and external control are once again becoming central to international politics. Given this reality, the idea of sovereigty (and the US-led 'rules-based order' which preserves it) must not become a casualty of flawed political initiatives. Trump’s comments about annexing Canada, taking back Panama and buying Greenland from a country that doesn't have the legal right to sell it highlight the subtle hypocrisy in the international community. Sovereignty, once treated as sacrosanct, increasingly seems to be giving ground to political agendas of assorted foreign policies East and West. Westphalian nation-state sovereignty is built on a key premise: The principle of non-interference asserts that no state should interfere in the internal affairs of another state. It upholds the idea that each state has the right to govern itself without external intervention. The entire Ukraine debacle is antithetical to this principle. The Western-engineered coup of 2014, the Russian invasion, the sabotage of the 2022 peace talks and the hundreds of thousands killed, speak to the critical lack of regard for the concept of sovereignty within the international community. Globalism and a dysfunctional EU (united only in name) are symptoms of this underlying malady – an assault on sovereignty. Today, Ukraine is sovereign in name only with the UK, US, EU and Russia (ultimately deciding) through territorial concessions and political control -- what its 'sovereignty' will look like. In the 21st century sovereignty is under assault and American dominance is being challenged – we must never take America's sovereignty – and the freedom it secures for granted. Just ask the people of Ukraine, the Sudetenland and Serbia.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWeE8linnmC120af8lkWfLmH	2025-01-24T16:29:25-08:00	
Britain Should Join America And Sanction Putin’s Puppet In Georgi...	By Nate Sibley The British Overseas Territories (BOTs) have long been seen as tax havens. But in recent years, their related role as global money laundering hubs has come under scrutiny. Like the Conservative government before it, the ruling Labour government in the United Kingdom is under pressure to strengthen corporate transparency and drive out dirty money. While they work to do so, ministers should also take advantage of the fact that so many of the West’s enemies depend on the financial secrecy Britain’s offshore empire offers. BOTs are mostly small island nations in remote locations with few natural resources (besides fish). As globalization expanded development opportunities, tourism and professional services became the two obvious paths for these territories, especially given that the latter only needs an internet connection. In addition to low (or no) taxes, BOTs offer discretion in the form of few (or no) know-your-customer regulations. But policies designed to attract the wealthy also attracted criminals, who for obvious reasons were similarly concerned with keeping their financial arrangements hidden from authorities in their own countries. The UK therefore bears some responsibility for facilitating the rise of China, Russia, Iran, and other kleptocratic dictatorships that, having consolidated their rule at home, now turn their sights on upending the global order and supplanting the West. But it also means that the UK possesses potential leverage over these regimes—should the government be brave enough to use it. One urgent example of this is Bidzina Ivanishvili, the would-be dictator of Georgia. His ruling political party, Georgian Dream, has made no secret of its plan to subvert the population’s aspirations for European Union membership and instead drag Georgia back under Russia’s control. Ivanishvili has also opened his country, and Europe, to the pernicious influence of the Chinese Communist Party by inviting US-sanctioned Chinese state-owned companies to build a strategically significant deep-water port. In December, the UK joined the United States in sanctioning five senior Georgian officials for their roles in violently suppressing pro-democracy protests. In January, the US went one step further and imposed long-overdue sanctions on Bidzina Ivanishvili himself. The UK has yet to follow, while the EU has been unable to act because of the now-predictable vetoes by Russia-friendly Hungarian and Slovak leaders. Transparency International Georgia has identified 95 companies controlled by Ivanishvili that are registered in the British Virgin Islands and the Cayman Islands. As BOTs, these islands are required to enforce the sanctions by banning any transactions with the companies and freezing any assets owned by them. Kleptocrats like Ivanishvili are rarely foolish enough to keep all their eggs in one basket. It is unlikely that his overseas financial assets are in BVI or Cayman bank accounts but located in other jurisdictions with similarly lax oversight but better financial sectors. Fortunately, the threat of sanctions is often sufficient to convince banks in other jurisdictions to stop turning a blind eye and boot the suspicious customer. Given the US dollar’s global role, Washington has by far the most clout in this respect. But the UK, as home to the world’s second biggest financial center, also holds significant influence. James MacCleary, a Liberal Democrat member of Parliament, has introduced an early day motion (a nonbinding resolution somewhat akin to a sense of Congress) calling on the Labour government to impose sanctions on Ivanishvili. So far just 15 MPs, mostly from his own party, have joined him. Not all MPs regularly sign EDMs, but this is nevertheless a paltry show of support. MacCleary is not the only parliamentarian to have noticed the UK’s strange delay in acting against Ivanishvili. Representative Joe Wilson (R-SC), a member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee and chair of the Helsinki Committee in Congress, has also called on the UK to 'immediately sanction CCP crony Bidzina Ivanishvili, his immediate family, and his network of enablers.' To his great credit, Foreign Secretary David Lammy has committed to ending London’s role as a one-stop shop for foreign kleptocrats to launder their stolen funds and whitewash their reputations. But extending this crusade to the BOTs will take much political wrangling with their local governments, who are resentful of what they see as London’s interference in their internal affairs (or, more likely, simply unwilling to tamper with their main source of revenue). While Lammy is busy fixing this broken net, he should be careful not to discard the fish that it has already caught. Kleptocrats like Ivanishvili should never have been able to exploit the BOTs to launder their stolen wealth. But if they continue to do so, they should henceforth live in fear that the UK will use its sanctions power to hold them accountable.

The Fight Against Disinformation: A Persistent Challenge For Demo...	By Kateryna Odarchenko Introduction (FPRI) -- Disinformation, the deliberate dissemination of false or misleading information to deceive or manipulate public opinion, represents a profound and ongoing threat to Western democracies. It erodes trust in institutions, fuels polarization, and undermines decision-making processes. Russian disinformation campaigns, in particular, showcase a sophisticated, multilayered system of narratives tailored to exploit societal vulnerabilities. Understanding their architecture and methodologies is critical for crafting effective countermeasures to safeguard democratic systems. Moscow’s disinformation campaigns have achieved significant victories in reshaping public opinion and influencing geopolitical trajectories. In Georgia, Russian narratives have successfully steered segments of the population away from a Western-oriented path, fostering skepticism toward European integration and NATO membership. Similarly, these campaigns have undermined international support for Ukraine by spreading false narratives about the conflict, portraying Ukraine as a failed state or aggressor, and sowing doubts about the necessity of Western involvement. Moreover, Russia’s strategic use of disinformation has eroded trust in NATO, amplifying fears of alliance overreach and internal divisions. These successes highlight the dangerous efficacy of disinformation in advancing Moscow’s geopolitical agenda and emphasize the urgent need for robust counter-strategies. Ways and Means of Disinformation Russian disinformation operates as a well-coordinated ecosystem capable of deploying and adapting diverse narratives across multiple platforms. These narratives are strategically designed to evolve in intensity and variation, targeting the unique characteristics of the media environments and societies they infiltrate. Countries with complex media landscapes are especially vulnerable due to the multiplicity of audiences and channels. Key narrative categories include the 'Russian World' (Russkiy Mir), which solidifies identification with Russia among Russian-speaking populations, particularly in nations like Latvia, Estonia, and Ukraine. The narrative of Slavic Unity leverages shared ethnic and historical ties to bolster support for Russia’s geopolitical agenda. Similarly, nostalgia for the Soviet era challenges Western-dominated global systems by portraying Russia as a counterbalance to perceived Western hegemony. Other narratives focus on 'anti' rhetoric against the European Union, NATO, and liberal democratic values, resonating with far-right and nationalist movements in Europe. Finally, the strategy of presenting alternative and conflicting information seeks to erode the concept of objective truth, creating confusion and mistrust of credible sources. The systemic nature of these campaigns relies on a network of state institutions, including the Russian Academy of Sciences and the Federal Security Service, alongside state-controlled media and private actors. Even the Russian Orthodox Church plays a strategic role in amplifying these messages. Counteracting such interconnected networks requires a holistic and targeted approach that goes beyond addressing individual narratives to dismantle the broader infrastructure. A particularly insidious component of this ecosystem is the role of the Russian Orthodox Church and its affiliated organizations in advancing Kremlin-aligned narratives. Under the guise of anti-cult activities, these efforts marginalize minority religious communities while promoting Russian imperialist ideologies. The Russian Association of Centers for the Study of Religions and Sects (RACIRS), led by Alexander Dvorkin, exemplifies this strategy. Through seminars, publications, and collaborations with media outlets, RACIRS propagates divisive rhetoric abroad, often justifying Russia’s foreign and domestic policies, including the invasion of Ukraine. For instance, RACIRS has engaged in partnerships with pro-Russian groups in Central and Eastern Europe to influence public opinion. Countering These Ways and Means Disrupting the financial and logistical mechanisms supporting these operations is essential to countering their destabilizing effects. Moscow’s disinformation campaigns rely heavily on a robust infrastructure of media outlets, online platforms, and state-sponsored entities that require consistent funding and operational resources to maintain their reach and influence. Cutting off financial resources can weaken their ability to hire skilled propagandists, purchase ad space, and amplify narratives through social media algorithms. Similarly, targeting logistical support—such as the technological infrastructure used to disseminate content or the networks facilitating coordination between actors—can severely hinder operational efficiency. By focusing on these critical pillars, the international community can degrade the capacity of disinformation networks, making them less effective in shaping public opinion or sowing discord globally. The significance of this approach becomes evident in examining cases like Viktor Medvedchuk, whose activities epitomize the Kremlin’s reliance on financial and logistical networks to fuel its influence campaigns. The case of Medvedchuk, a Ukrainian oligarch and close confidant of Russian President Vladimir Putin, further illustrates the Kremlin’s strategy of leveraging influential figures to disseminate propaganda. Medvedchuk’s control of Ukrainian TV channels such as 112 Channel, News One, and Zik allowed him to saturate the media landscape with anti-Western narratives, particularly in Ukraine’s eastern and southern regions, where pro-Russian sentiment was already present. His activities were financed through Russian oil profits, and he employed social media troll factories to amplify his messaging and electoral bribery through the provision of 'gifts' like food or cash during elections. Despite his arrest and subsequent exchange in 2022, Medvedchuk’s legacy underscores the need to dismantle the financial and media infrastructures that enable such disinformation. In addition to Ukraine, cases of electoral bribery orchestrated by Russian actors have also been documented in Estonia and Latvia. Investigative reports indicate that pro-Russian groups engaged in distributing money and goods to Russian-speaking minorities during local elections in these Baltic states, aiming to secure votes for candidates aligned with Kremlin interests. In Estonia, instances of cash payments and organized transportation to polling stations were linked to pro-Kremlin organizations, while in Latvia, similar tactics were employed in regions with significant Russian-speaking populations, leveraging socio-economic hardships to sway voter loyalty. The export of Russian disinformation campaigns extends beyond Ukraine, as evidenced by case studies in Slovakia and the Czech Republic. Since 2014, pro-Russian narratives have infiltrated Slovakia’s information ecosystem, leveraging embassies, intelligence operatives, and social media to position Russia as a protector of traditional values and a natural ally for Slavic nations. Historical revisionism and cultural appeals have bolstered support for pro-Kremlin parties like SMER-SD, led by Robert Fico. Fico’s rhetoric, which undermines Ukraine’s sovereignty and aligns Slovakia with Moscow’s interests, exemplifies the potent influence of these campaigns. Similarly, in the Czech Republic, media outlets such as 'Voice of Europe,'linked to Medvedchuk’s network, disseminate narratives that oppose EU policies and undermine Ukraine’s sovereignty. Investigative reports reveal covert funding of pro-Russian candidates during European elections, often using cryptocurrency with obscure origins. However, the Czech Republic has demonstrated resilience through proactive measures, including government sanctions and public awareness campaigns, highlighting the effectiveness of coordinated counter-disinformation strategies. Addressing the challenge of Russian disinformation requires a multifaceted approach, with a primary focus on dismantling the financial and logistical networks that sustain these operations. The interconnected nature of these supply chains—spanning state institutions, media outlets, private actors, and ideological platforms like RACIRS—demands a comprehensive response targeting the root of these campaigns. Efforts should prioritize cutting off funding sources, whether through sanctions or stricter regulations on the flow of dark money, cryptocurrencies, or other opaque financial channels used to support disinformation. The Medvedchuk case illustrates how a robust disruption of financial supply chains can neutralize even well-entrenched propaganda operations. Moreover, combating logistical mechanisms such as troll farms, pro-Kremlin NGOs, and media outlets is essential to crippling the disinformation network’s reach and adaptability. By severing these critical lifelines, democracies can prevent the amplification of falsehoods and reduce the effectiveness of Kremlin-aligned narratives. Complementing these actions, public education initiatives and media literacy programs are vital for empowering citizens to resist manipulation. The examples of Slovakia and the Czech Republic underscore both the vulnerabilities inherent in democratic systems and the resilience that coordinated strategies can foster. Disrupting these supply chains will protect institutions, rebuild public trust, and safeguard democratic values against the corrosive threat of Russian disinformation. This systematic approach ensures that the fight against disinformation is not merely reactive but anticipates and neutralizes threats at their origin. Moreover, Moscow often leverages the same financial backers and logistical frameworks across multiple disinformation channels, creating interconnected networks that amplify their influence while simultaneously presenting multiple points of vulnerability. These entities, such as the notorious Internet Research Agency, receive substantial funding from state-controlled sources, enabling them to sustain large-scale operations that flood information ecosystems with pro-Kremlin narratives. Logistically, Russian disinformation operations frequently utilize Telegram, a messaging platform with robust encryption and minimal content moderation, making it an ideal tool for coordinating campaigns and disseminating false information. The platform’s ability to create and manage numerous channels and groups allows disinformation actors to operate covertly, evading detection by traditional monitoring systems. Additionally, Yandex, Russia’s dominant search engine and technology provider, plays a dual role by not only supporting state-sponsored media outlets but also by developing algorithms that can be manipulated to prioritize Kremlin-aligned content. These examples illustrate how intertwined financial and logistical support systems not only sustain disinformation operations but also create multiple avenues for intervention. By targeting key financial institutions, and regulating platforms such as Telegram and Yandex, the international community can effectively disrupt the lifelines of Russian disinformation campaigns. Enhanced transparency in financial transactions, stricter regulations on digital platforms, and international cooperation in monitoring and sanctioning involved parties are essential steps toward dismantling these pervasive networks. Furthermore, the use of cryptocurrencies presents both a challenge and an opportunity. While they offer a means to obscure financial transactions, advancements in blockchain analysis and international regulatory frameworks can mitigate their misuse. Initiatives like the Financial Action Task Force guidelines on virtual assets are crucial in closing the loopholes that disinformation actors exploit to fund their operations anonymously. Conclusion Understanding the specific financial backers and logistical supporters of Russian disinformation campaigns reveals critical vulnerabilities that can be targeted to dismantle these operations effectively. By implementing comprehensive strategies that address both the monetary and operational aspects, democracies can significantly weaken the infrastructure that enables sustained and impactful disinformation efforts. This proactive approach not only curtails the immediate threat but also fortifies democratic institutions against future attempts at manipulation and destabilization.

Will Any Federal Officials Pay For What They Did? – OpEd	The biggest scientific con of the century is finally being exposed. But will any politicians or government officials ever be held responsible for the carnage they unleashed on Americans? In early 2020, when the Covid pandemic was starting to ravage America, federal bureaucrats and politicians rushed to suppress any suggestion that the pandemic originated from a Chinese government lab bankrolled by US government agencies. Key Biden administration officials effectively exonerated the Chinese government even though the Chinese completely stonewalled any outside investigation into the origin of the Covid virus, as the Wall Street Journal recently revealed in a front-page scoop. The FBI’s top expert concluded that the virus leaked from the lab but he was derailed by the Biden administration, blocked from presenting his evidence at a key White House meeting in August 2021. Three scientists at the National Center for Medical Intelligence, part of the Pentagon’s Defense Intelligence Agency, concluded that Covid leaked from a lab but they were muzzled. The Inspector General is conducting an investigation to determine why those experts were silenced. The Department of Energy also concluded that Covid originated in a lab. In September 2023, a senior CIA analyst told a Congressional committee that six key CIA analystshad been bribed by the agency to abandon their conclusion that Covid originated in a lab leak. The Chinese government first admitted that a pandemic had broken out in the city of Wuhan in early 2020. Though the Chinese military-affiliated Wuhan Institute of Virology had been experimenting with bats for years, the Chinese government insisted the new virus came from a nearby marketplace. But the lead scientists involved with bat research had all been struck down by Covid-19 symptoms shortly before the Chinese government denied any responsibility. There was a deluge of circumstantial evidence quickly linking the new virus to the lab. The outbreak of Covid-19 spurred one of the most brazen cover-ups in modern US history. The National Institute for Health had been financing gain-of-function research at the Wuhan Institute of Virology. That type of research seeks to genetically alter organisms to enable the spread of viruses into new species. Such research is extremely dangerous; as MIT professor Kevin Esvelt asked in 2021, 'Why is anyone trying to teach the world how to make viruses that could kill millions of people?' The risks were compounded because the Wuhan Institute had a very poor safety rating. Two years earlier, the State Department confidentially 'warned other federal agencies about safety issues at Wuhan labs studying bat Covid,' but the public disclosure of that alert was delayed until 2022. In January 2020, top federal scientists recognized that the pandemic could obliterate their reputations. Dr. Francis Collins, the director of the National Institutes for Health, wrote in an email that 'a swift convening of experts in a confidence-inspiring framework is needed or the voices of conspiracy will quickly dominate, doing great potential harm to science and international harmony.' The 'conspiracy' was the facts of the matter. Anthony Fauci, the chief of the National Institute for Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), speedily enlisted a handful of trusted scientists to gin up a paper supposedly 'proving' that the virus could not have originated in the lab. A top NIAID scientist accepted the task of debunking the lab-leak story because, as he emailed a colleague, 'Tony doesn’t want his fingerprints on origin stories.' The Lancet, one of the most respected medical journals in the world, enlisted in the cover-up with an op-ed by 27 scientists who proclaimed: 'We stand together to strongly condemn conspiracy theories suggesting that Covid-19 does not have a natural origin.' Maybe the same scientists also sent an addendum to NIH: Keep giving us grant money or your reputation will 'swim with the fishes.' Further 'proof' was provided by a torrent of accusations of racism against anyone who publicly suggested that the virus originated in a Chinese lab. The State Department’s Global Engagement Center added a federal fist to the debate, pressuring Twitter to suppress hundreds of thousands of accounts (including thousands of average Americans) in early 2020 for the crime of suggesting that Covid originated in a lab. Bureaucrats secretly decided that wildly exaggerated forecasts of pandemic mortality made the First Amendment null and void. If Covid-19 had been initially recognized as the result of one of the biggest government boondoggles in history, it would have been far more difficult for American politicians and government scientists to pirouette as saviors as they seized sway over daily life. The virus that the NIH financed provided push-button dictatorial power to politicians at every level of government. In the name of saving lives, politicians entitled themselves to destroy an unlimited number of livelihoods. Most governors responded to Covid-19 by dropping the equivalent of a Reverse Neutron Bomb — something that destroys the economy while leaving human beings unharmed. But the only way to assume people were uninjured was to presume that their lives were totally detached from their jobs, bank accounts, mortgage and rent payments, and friends and family. A virus with a 99+% survival rate spawned a 100% presumption in favor of despotism. From the start of the pandemic, many people who swore allegiance to 'science and data' also believed that absolute power would keep them safe. Doubters became dissidents who deserved to be covertly silenced. Shutdown advocates appealed to science like righteous priests invoking God and the Bible to sanctify scourging enemies. But the 'science' was often farcically unreliable. Mandatory mask mandates became the new version of the Emancipation Proclamation. Fauci and other top officials deceived Americans into believing that cloth masks offered far more protection than they delivered. Do Americans finally recognize that the federal government was the biggest source of disinformation during the pandemic? A century ago, historian Henry Adams declared that politics has 'always been the systematic organization of hatreds.' Covid-19 policies were so disruptive in part because politicians intentionally sought to maximize fear and rage against anyone who refused to submit to any dictate. After the efficacy of the Covid-19 vaccines collapsed, Biden responded by dictating that a hundred million American adults must get injected based on his personal decree. A few weeks later at a CNN town hall, Biden derided vaccine skeptics as murderers who only wanted 'the freedom to kill you' with Covid. A few months later, a Rasmussen poll found that 59% of Democratic voters favored house arrest for the unvaccinated, and 45% favored locking the unvaxxed into government detention facilities. Almost half of Democrats favored empowering the government to 'fine or imprison individuals who publicly question the efficacy of the existing Covid-19 vaccines on social media, television, radio, or in online or digital publications.' But hatred proved to be as ineffective as the Pfizer vaccine when it came to fighting Covid-19. Fauci, who was also Biden’s chief medical advisor, justified Covid mandates because average citizens 'don’t have the ability' to determine what is best for them. But Congressional investigations revealed that Fauci was at the center of string-pulling to shirk responsibility for the Wuhan debacle. After Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX) suggested prosecuting Fauci for false testimony on bankrolling 'gain-of-function' research, Fauci howled that his critics are 'really criticizing science because I represent science. That’s dangerous.' But not nearly as dangerous as vesting vast power in secretive federal agencies. On September 20, 2023, the Biden administration belatedly banned the Wuhan Institute of Virology from receiving any US government research funding for 10 years as punishment for its unauthorized gain-of-function experiments on bat coronaviruses. But why did the Biden administration omit the same condemnation and similar prohibitions from any American scientist, institute, or government officials that had any role in this debacle? Instead of Tony Fauci bobbleheads, the slogan 'Your Government at Work' superimposed atop a million American caskets captured the reality of Covid-19.

New Solar Plants Expected To Support Most US Electric Generation ...	In our latest Short-Term Energy Outlook (STEO), we expect that U.S. renewable capacity additions—especially solar—will continue to drive the growth of U.S. power generation over the next two years. We expect U.S. utilities and independent power producers will add 26 gigawatts (GW) of solar capacity to the U.S. electric power sector in 2025 and 22 GW in 2026. Last year, the electric power sector added a record 37 GW of solar power capacity to the electric power sector, almost double 2023 solar capacity additions. We forecast wind capacity additions will increase by around 8 GW in 2025 and 9 GW in 2026, slight increases from the 7 GW added in 2024. In contrast to solar and wind, generating capacity for most other energy sources will remain mostly unchanged in 2025 and 2026. Natural gas-fired capacity growth slowed in 2024, with only 1 GW of capacity added to the power mix, but natural gas remains the largest source of U.S. power generation. We forecast U.S. coal retirements will accelerate, removing 6% (11 GW) of coal generating capacity from the U.S. electricity sector in 2025 and removing another 2% (4 GW) in 2026. Last year, coal retirements represented about 3 GW of electric power capacity removed from the power system, which is the lowest annual amount of coal capacity retired since 2011. We expect that planned renewable capacity additions will support most of the growth in U.S. electric power generation, which we expect will increase by 2% in 2025 and by 1% in 2026. The U.S. electric power sector produced a total of 4,155 billion kilowatthours (kWh) of electricity in 2024, up 3% from 2023. Natural gas In 2024, U.S. natural gas-fired power plants generated a total of 1,767 billion kWh, 4% more than in 2023. Natural gas-fired power accounted for around 42% of the U.S. electricity mix, mostly unchanged compared with 2023. We expect natural gas generation will decline in 2025 by 3% to 1,712 billion kWh and decrease a further 1% to 1,692 billion kWh in 2026. Renewables We expect renewable power generation will increase 12% in the United States to 1,058 billion kWh in 2025 and increase a further 8% to 1,138 billion kWh in 2026. Renewable sources were the second-largest contributor to U.S. power generation in 2024 and accounted for 945 billion kWh, up 9% from 2023. Nuclear We expect U.S. nuclear power generation to grow 2% to 796 billion kWh in 2025 and increase a further 1% to 800 billion kWh in 2026. Nuclear power generation in 2024 was up slightly from 2023, totaling 781 billion kWh. Increased nuclear generation in the forecast is partly due to the addition of the two Vogtle power plant units that began commercial operations in July 2023 and April 2024, as well as the expected restart of the Palisades power plant in October 2025. Coal We expect U.S. coal power generation to remain unchanged at around 640 billion kWh in 2025 and 2026. Coal electricity generation was 647 billion kWh in 2024.

Salvini Threatens To Withdraw Italy From WHO	By Emma Pirnay (EurActiv) -- Matteo Salvini, Italy's deputy prime minister, has proposed a bill to withdraw Italy from the World Health Organization (WHO), following Donald Trump’s executive order on Monday. 'I presented this morning at the Chamber of Deputies, the League's bill to leave the WHO (World Health Organization), as did the United States with Donald Trump,' said Salvini, leader of the far-right League party, on X. Salvini’s proposal comes as the world body is freezing hiring and applying cuts to travel budgets following the US withdrawal, which contributed around 15 percent of its budget. The WHO budget for 2024-25 was set by its member states at $6.83 billion (€6.52 billion). 'Italy no longer has to deal with a supranational power centre – handsomely funded by Italian taxpayers – that goes hand-in-hand with multinational pharmaceutical companies,' said Salvini, adding that Italy should use what he called '€100 million' in contributions to instead fund 'our hospitals and doctors.' According to the WHO's funding data, Italy has donated €66 million to the body for the 2024-25 funding period, of which €34 million were membership fees. Italy's Prime Minister, Giorgia Meloni – a Trump ally – has not yet given a public position on Salvini's proposal. On Tuesday, Germany’s health minister Karl Lauterbach said he hoped to convince President Trump to not leave the WHO, calling the decision a 'serious blow to the international fight against global health crises,' reported Reuters. Similarly, former EU health commissioner Stella Kyriakides said on Wednesday that the US’ withdrawal from WHO causes 'grave concern,' and hoped that 'this decision will be reconsidered for the benefit of millions of people around the world.' Current health commissioner Olivér Várhelyi, who is affiliated with Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán's Fidesz party, has not yet publicly commented on the US president’s decision to withdraw.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWeE8linnmC12_6JRaz_A9-4	2025-01-24T16:07:11-08:00	
The West Needs To Take A Hard Look At Georgian Dream’s Propaganda...	By Luke Linich (Eurasianet) -- In confronting daily anti-government protests, the ruling Georgian Dream party in Tbilisi has fashioned itself as a bulwark against what its leaders describe as liberal fascism. That many Georgians buy into the double-think notion of Lockean tyranny is a testament to the effectiveness of anti-Western, Russian-style propaganda which is the staple of Georgian Dream-aligned media outlets today. For most of the 21st century, Georgia prioritized integration with the West, even enshrining a commitment to seek membership in the European Union in the country’s constitution. But Georgian Dream over the past 18 months has reversed course, adopting illiberal legislation, such as the ‘foreign agents’ law, which critics say can be manipulated to muzzle watchdogs and dissent. At the same time, pro-government media outlets, including Imedi TV, have fed citizens a steady diet of slanted anti-Western coverage, fueling societal polarization. An egregious, but not unusual example of Imedi disinformation was a social media postDecember 9 on its branded channel accusing pro-EUprotesters of purposefully burning a coffin containing a likeness of Jesus Christ. In reality, the crowd was burning an effigy of Georgian billionaire Bidzina Ivanishvili. The Imedi post cast the protest and its participants enemies of core Georgian values. Opinion polling conducted by the International Republican Institute in 2023 highlighted the polarization trend. Georgia suffered a disastrous defeat in its five-day fight against Russia in 2008, and Russia occupies the Georgian territories of Abkhazia and South Ossetia, yet IRI polling found that one third of respondents support 'further dialogue' with Moscow with another third opposed. The results also showed that almost three-quarters of Georgians favored EU membership, even though it seems many believe Georgian Dream-propagated arguments that Western values are at odds with Georgian traditions, and that EU integration would threaten Georgian sovereignty and culture. In late 2024, shortly after Georgian Dream claimed a mandate to govern in what observers described as heavily manipulated parliamentary elections, party leaders suspended EU integration efforts. This brazen move to ignore the constitutional mandate and popular will, steering the country away from the West and back into Russia’s orbit, prompted mass protests across the country that have gone on for almost two months. The polarization of society has accelerated since the start of fall protests, with support for EU integration equally met by those who justify GD officials’ u-turn and their use of force against protesters. Georgia’s ideological transformation has real consequences for its citizens. It has had a profound impact on my own family. As someone with an American father and a Georgian mother, I have witnessed Georgia’s evolving attitudes firsthand. My father, renowned for his work in Georgian polyphonic music, once helped symbolize strong Georgian-American ties. In the late 2000s, my family participated in the Chveneburebi Festivals, an initiative by then-president Mikheil Saakashvili to promote Georgian culture domestically and abroad. At the time, our Americanness was celebrated as a bridge connecting Georgia to the West. Since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, this admiration has faded. A relative who once cherished our American connection now accuses us of being enemies of Georgia and products of a 'sinful union.' On a recent visit to a church near Chiatura, my father encountered a priest who declared Westerners unwelcome—an unprecedentedly hostile gesture never previously experienced in the 30 years of my parents’ marriage. Such incidents aren’t limited to my own family’s experience. A viral 2024 video showed a priest at TbilisiHoly TrinityChurch verbally assaulting a Georgian-American visitor, calling him a 'Soros Agent' out to destroy Georgian traditions. There are many more examples of anti-Western rhetoric and actions, an odd juxtaposition considering former US president George W. Bush, the only US leader to have visited Tbilisi, still has a street named after him in the Georgian capital. The outcome of Georgia’s current political crisis remains uncertain. Protesters are pushing for a new parliamentary vote. In a genuinely fair election, Georgian Dream’s ability to remain in power is no sure thing. But anti-government forces appear to lack the strength to compel Georgian Dream to accede to their demand; at the same time, incumbent authorities, despite the widespread use of brutal police tactics, lack the muscle to sweep the protesters off the streets. As the crisis grinds toward a denouement, one thing is certain: mass media will exert heavy influence in shaping citizens’ views. Those wanting to see Georgia get back on a Western track need to face up to the fact that Georgian Dream’s skillful use of Russian-style messaging has had, and will continue to have a significant, even decisive impact on public opinion. State-aligned media’s constant portrayal of the West as a cultural and moral threat deepens feelings of alienation among Georgian from the West and nudges the country closer to its authoritarian, historical enemy, Russia. The stakes are enormous. Losing Georgia to Russian influence would mean the collapse of one of the most promising experiments in post-Soviet democratization, as well as a strategic setback for the West. It would embolden Russia’s ideological warfare across the region and encourage more ideological expansion, undermining efforts to promote rules-based economic and political systems in the post-Soviet space. Georgian Dream’s chief purveyors of propaganda, including those in charge of Imedi TV and PostTV, should face sanctions and other punishments for spreading disinformation. In addition, Meta, the parent company of Facebook, could take a stand against the willful distribution of disinformation on its platform by banning Imedi, PostTV and other disseminators of untruths. Such action could have a considerable impact, given that many Georgians obtain their news from social media. Georgian Dream’s disinformation operation should not be given more space and time to warp public attitudes.

You’re On Your Own, Tony – OpEd	Outgoing president Joe Biden may have given former NIAID Director Anthony Fauci a 'pass' in the form of a pre-emptive pardon for any crime he may have committed, including creating or spreading 'Covid 19,' but he wasn’t able to keep the discredited former bureaucrat in the style in which he had become accustomed. Just hours after US Sen, Rand Paul (R-KY) provided the necessary documentation and argumentation to end Fauci’s lavish perks… Screenshot …President Donald Trump has pulled the plug on Fauci’s 24/7 limo and security detail, which has cost the US taxpayer an estimated $15 million since 2022. This indignity for the man once known as 'The Science' may not be the final one he suffers. As Constitutional Scholar Jonathan Turley has written, these 11th hour pardons may be a double-edged sword as Congress can subpoena Fauci or any other recipient of Biden’s largesse and under oath – i.e. under penalty of prosecution – question any of them on their past activities. They will not be able to plead the Fifth Amendment because they would be in no danger of self-incrimination having already received a pardon. Senator Paul has on many occasions accused Fauci of lying to the US Senate while under oath and with his newfound authority as Chairman of the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee he is in a unique position to get to the bottom of the Fauci business. We are at the moment stocking up on popcorn. In the meantime, someone needs to let Fauci know that while it may not compare to having a 24/7 limo at your beck and call, Uber Black does provide luxury vehicles to those with more discerning tastes… This article was published at Ron Paul Institute	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWeE8linnmC12_nYK1so0SVc	2025-01-24T15:59:50-08:00	
EU Suspends Visa-Free Regime For Georgian Diplomats	Permanent representatives of the European Union's 27 member states decided on Friday to temporarily suspend the visa-free regime for holders of Georgian diplomatic passports, TASS reported citing a source from one of the EU Council delegations. 'Yes, permanent representatives reached an agreement this morning to suspend the visa-free regime for Georgian diplomatic passports,' the source said. According to the diplomat, the decision must still be formally approved by the EU Council, which could happen at the upcoming meeting of the 27 foreign ministers scheduled for January 27. On December 20, the European Commission officially proposed suspending the visa-free regime for Georgian officials and diplomats, citing increasing diplomatic setbacks in the country. Meanwhile, parliamentary elections held in Georgia on October 26 have heightened domestic political tensions. According to official results from the Central Election Commission, the ruling party 'Georgian Dream – Democratic Georgia' secured 53.93% of the vote, winning 89 out of 150 parliamentary seats. However, four opposition parties that surpassed the 5% threshold refused to recognize the election results, claiming they were rigged. Since November 4, opposition leaders have been organizing protests.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWeE8linnmC120ZWHIOukhKO	2025-01-24T15:58:12-08:00	
Analyzing Trump’s Inauguration Ceremony Through Facial Expression...	By Zhao Zhijiang Under the watchful eyes of many, Donald Trump recently took the oath of office as the 47th President of the United States in the Rotunda of the U.S. Capitol. In his inaugural speech, he proclaimed to the world that America has entered a 'golden age', and that he was saved by God to 'make America great again'. The message Trump aimed to convey was simple: America would return to common sense, prioritize domestic affairs, and become great once again. In his speech, Trump also outlined a very detailed to-do list, previewing the series of policies that the new administration would pursue. Compared to his first inaugural address eight years ago, which was filled with anger with wordings like 'American carnage', this speech was more positive and optimistic, filled with hope for the future. Amidst the cheers, Trump 2.0 has truly arrived. The entire world has already watched this ceremony, and everyone has their own thoughts and feelings. The media, experts, and various individuals are all interpreting and commenting on Trump's speech, predicting America's 'grand plan'. For them, every word spoken by Trump and his aides could contain important signals that need to be carefully and promptly analyzed. However, a senior researcher at ANBOUND believes that too much focus has been misplaced on what Trump and his associates said. What is more important is to approach it from different angles and information points, such as facial expressions, relationships, and body language, so as to deduce the development trends of the Trump team and the longer-term future. Trump's inauguration ceremony was a indeed grand stage showcasing political group portrait. Whether it was American politicians, tech giants, or influential figures like Argentina's Javier Milei, all were displaying themselves through their expressions, attitudes, and body language. Their facial expressions, postures, gestures, distance, and interactions with others are often overlooked by the outside world, but they provide crucial clues for making predictions and discoveries. JD Vance's interaction with Trump is a great example. By carefully observing their interaction, one can see that Trump behaves like a godfather while Vance, wearing a bright red tie, has clearly adapted to this dynamic as the 'underling'. After entering the scene, they appeared very close, with only Trump's youngest son Barron Trump standing nearby. Even after sitting down, they continued to whisper to each other. During this time, even when they were not speaking, Vance could be seen sitting attentively, always ready to respond to Trump. Researchers at ANBOUND believe that these details suggest Trump has not built a typical government team but rather a political team loyal to him. It can be inferred that, given Vance's proper positioning, their cooperation will likely be smooth over the next four years. This strong partnership will lay a solid foundation for Vance's future political career. It should be noted that although Vance had previously criticized his 'current boss' on social media, he has clearly evolved into an ideal Trumpist. Four or eight years from now, he will be more mature and could potentially inherit Trump's position, becoming the next Republican president of the United States. Based on their interaction during the inauguration, this prediction of a 'President Vance' seems quite logical and plausible. For China, this is also a major challenge. It means that Trumpism will become long-lasting, likely to be the dominant theme in the U.S. for a long period of time. The opposing voices from the establishment, such as liberalism and progressivism, will weaken over time. This will lead to a new political landscape in the world. Looking ahead, it is expected that conservative politics in Europe will also take the stage, and the global space will become more fragmented. The wave of conservatism will sweep the world, not just the United States. In this situation, China faces both opportunities and challenges. Even though the future may be harsh, it would be wise for China to continue exporting as a channel for economic growth. As long as demand exists and products are competitive, exports will continue. In fact, 'exports' are currently the only thing China has that has a real influence internationally. In the global trade game, even though China will face long-term economic populism from the West, it should not fall into the trap of trade extremism. Back to the inauguration ceremony, aside from the interaction and body language between Vance and Trump, another important figure's performance is worth noting: the current Secretary of State, Marco Rubio. The Secretary of State is the most important position in the U.S. government, equivalent to a 'foreign minister' in other countries, but the U.S. Secretary of State wields greater power, oversees a broader range of responsibilities, and holds a more influential political status. According to the Presidential Succession Act of 1947, if the President vacates the office, the Vice President, Speaker of the House, President pro tempore of the Senate, Secretary of State, and key cabinet members follow in succession. The Secretary of State ranks fourth in this order, underscoring their importance. However, what is odd is that throughout the entire inauguration ceremony, Rubio's whereabouts were unknown. U.S. media reports and related information confirm that Rubio attended Trump's inauguration, but at no point during the event was there any visible communication or interaction between Trump and Rubio. What is the implication of this? Rubio is a person with political ambitions. He comes across as someone who is dissatisfied and has his own independent views. Rubio and Trump also have a history of conflict. In 2016, he criticized Trump and called him a 'con artist' who had hijacked the conservative movement. Trump, in turn, mocked Rubio for wearing makeup and called him a 'nervous basket case' who perspires too much. Based on this past history and the events at the inauguration, it can be roughly inferred that there may be some issues in the future regarding the cooperation between Rubio and Trump. Unlike Vance, who relies on Trump, Rubio's political base is in the Senate, and his appointment as Secretary of State was approved with zero opposition votes in the Senate. Therefore, ANBOUND believes that the relationship between Rubio and Trump could face various problems down the line. Rubio and Trump may have disagreements, and it is even possible that Rubio might not complete his term due to such conflicts. Similar situations have occurred before. In 2018, Trump nominated then-CIA Director Mike Pompeo to replace Rex Tillerson as Secretary of State. Trump complained that he and Tillerson had differing views on many issues and that their ideologies were completely incompatible. He was dissatisfied with Tillerson's 'establishment' style and felt he had made a wrong choice initially. The two disagreed on major issues such as climate change, the Iran nuclear deal, North Korea, and U.S. Middle East policy. A similar situation could occur with Rubio as well. When it comes to building his team, Trump is likely to make changes in batches. The individuals chosen this time may have their positions replaced in one or two years. Therefore, it's uncertain whether Rubio will serve a full four years as Secretary of State. From the information available, it appears that Rubio and Trump do not share consistent attitudes or views. Rubio clearly has his own ideas and is only maintaining a superficial alignment with Trump for the time being. From China's perspective, it may be better to avoid direct face-to-face meetings with Rubio. The most important thing is to seek direct talks with higher-level figures, such as Trump himself, so that Rubio's attitude and position will no longer matter. Some might say that focusing on body language and facial expressions is making groundless associations. Yet, this is a legitimate method of information analysis; it just manifests in behavioral science. It is not dissimilar to how businesses use behavioral science to understand preferences, actions, and consumption patterns. Marketers do this, as do policy departments. Information analysis sometimes seems a bit mysterious, but that is exactly how it works. Final analysis conclusion: The whole world has seen Trump's inauguration ceremony, but focusing solely on the speech is far from sufficient. On this political stage, everyone has their own performance. By observing facial expressions, postures, gestures, and interactions among people, we can gain insights into the development trends of Trump's team and make predictions about the more distant future.

No Room For Illness: Myanmar Migrants’ Silent Struggle in Thailan...	By Dr. Htet Khaing Min Myanmar refugees in Thailand face hardship and uncertainty, struggling with poverty, discrimination, and the constant fear of deportation, all while their access to healthcare remains limited. Key Takeaways Myanmar migrants in Thailand face financial, legal, and language barriers that restrict access to healthcare. Limited healthcare access for migrants worsens issues like malaria, TB, and maternal health, impacting migrants and Thailand's healthcare system. Expanding insurance, improving rural care, addressing language barriers, and ensuring legal protections are vital for migrant health and Thailand’s public health. As of 2024, over 4.18 million Myanmar migrants reside in Thailand, many in irregular status, working in low-wage sectors like agriculture and construction. These migrants face significant barriers to healthcare, impacting both their well-being and Thailand’s public health system. This article explores the healthcare-seeking behavior of Myanmar migrant workers, the challenges they face, and the broader implications for Thailand’s healthcare system. 1. Background of Migration Myanmar migrants make up one of Thailand’s most significant foreign worker populations, driven by economic instability, political turmoil, and ethnic conflicts, especially after Myanmar’s 2021 military coup. While 90,000 refugees live in border camps, millions live outside in precarious conditions. Around 1.8 million migrants are in irregular status, facing exploitation and limited access to essential services, including healthcare. Migrants enter Thailand through formal channels like MoU agreements or informal routes. While MoU workers have some legal protections, irregular migrants face significant barriers to healthcare and social services. 2. Current Migrant Healthcare Landscape in Thailand To understand the migrant healthcare system in Thailand, it is essential to examine the broader landscape of the healthcare system first. While Thailand boasts a dual healthcare system comprising public and private sectors, access to these services remains challenging for many migrants. 2.1 Private Healthcare: Costly and Out of Reach Thailand’s private healthcare sector offers high-quality services but at a steep cost. General practitioner consultations range from $30 to $80, while specialist consultations cost between $45 and $120, excluding additional hospital, treatment, and transportation charges. For migrant workers earning an average monthly income of $290 to $320, private healthcare is largely unaffordable. Additionally, medical expenses in Thailand, which have been steadily rising since 2020, are expected to climb by an additional 15% in 2025. And these rising medical costs worsen healthcare access for underpaid migrant workers. Low wages make quality care unattainable, and unresolved pay issues heighten barriers. Addressing wage inequality and improving healthcare affordability is essential to protect the well-being of vulnerable migrants. 2.2. Public Healthcare: Affordable but Limited The public sector, including government hospitals and clinics, provides cost-friendly healthcare options. However, irregular migrants face significant barriers due to their legal status. Fear of deportation or arrest often deters them from seeking care at public facilities. Language and cultural differences further complicate their access to essential services. 2.3. Insurance Schemes and Their Shortcomings To address these challenges, Thailand has introduced several health insurance schemes over the years, including Social Security Fund (SSF) (1991), Workman’s Compensation Fund (WCF) (1994), Migrant Health Insurance Scheme (MHIS) (1998), Migrant-Fund (M-Fund) (2017), and Health Insurance for Non-Thai People (HINT) (2024). While these schemes aim to provide coverage, their impact has been limited. The SSF, WCF, and MHIS cater primarily to specific employment sectors and exclude undocumented migrants. The M-Fund and HINT are designed to address these gaps, offering access to irregular migrants. However, challenges remain in raising awareness among migrants about these schemes and ensuring they understand how to utilize the benefits effectively. 2.4. Rural and Border Areas: A Greater Challenge Healthcare access is even more restricted in rural and border areas, where many migrants reside. Free clinics run by NGOs and INGOs, such as the Mae Tao Clinic, World Vision, and the International Organization for Migration (IOM), fill healthcare gaps. However, these services are often insufficient to meet the growing demand. 2.5. Migrant Health Volunteers: Bridging the Gap Migrant Health Volunteers (MHVs) connect migrants to healthcare services, particularly in remote regions. Working alongside local NGOs, MHVs raise awareness about available services and rights as a crucial link between migrants and healthcare providers. 3. Impact of Migration on Thailand's Public Health Sectors The recent surge of migrants from Myanmar into Thailand, especially after Myanmar’s February 2024 conscription law, has raised concerns in Thailand’s public health sector, with challenges in disease prevention, healthcare coverage, and achieving a sustainable healthcare system. Key health concerns include: Malaria: Migrants in border provinces like Tak face heightened malaria risks due to limited access to prevention and healthcare services. In 2023, Thailand reported nearly 17,000 malaria cases, a sharp rise from 9,989 in 2022, with 42% imported from neighboring countries, primarily Myanmar. Tak province, a hotspot for malaria, accounted for over half of these cases, experiencing sporadic outbreaks. Challenges in addressing malaria among migrants include their mobility, remote living conditions, and social barriers such as isolation, discrimination, and limited community integration. Tuberculosis (TB): TB remains a critical issue for migrant workers in Thailand, especially in border regions with rising cases and drug-resistant strains. In 2023, TB incidence increased to 157 per 100,000 from 143 per 100,000 in 2021. Tailored community programs integrating TB, HIV/AIDS, and maternal health services can improve education, diagnosis, and treatment adherence. HIV and Syphilis: Unsafe sexual practices and inadequate access to sexual health education have led to elevated rates of HIV and syphilis among migrant populations in Thailand. Research shows that migrants from neighboring countries face an HIV prevalence up to four times higher than that of the general Thai population. Maternal, Neonatal, and Child Health (MNCH): Migrant women, especially those with irregular status, face numerous obstacles in accessing maternal care and sexual health services. Financial constraints, limited MHIS coverage, and discrimination, including refusal to renew MHIS during pregnancy, exacerbate these challenges. Fear of deportation and high healthcare costs often force undocumented pregnant women to choose unsafe home births over essential hospital services. Vaccination: Immunization rates among migrant children in Thailand, particularly those from Myanmar, remain suboptimal. The lack of access to routine vaccination services is exacerbated by irregular migration status, geographical isolation, and language barriers. 4. Limitations in Access to Healthcare Despite the availability of healthcare resources, Myanmar migrants in Thailand face numerous challenges in accessing adequate medical care. These barriers are multifaceted, rooted in policy gaps, socioeconomic factors, and legal constraints, creating a complex landscape for healthcare access. 4.1. Policy Gaps and Financial Barriers Eligibility for social protection programs like the Social Security Fund (SSF) and Workmen’s Compensation Fund (WCF) is often tied to specific employment sectors and statuses, leaving many migrants without coverage. Data from the Thailand Migration Report 2024 reveals that as of February 2024, only 51% of migrants were enrolled in a health insurance scheme, indicating that nearly half of eligible workers lack health insurance. For those without coverage, the steep upfront costs of healthcare services significantly deter seeking timely medical attention. This financial strain is particularly severe for irregular migrants, who face disproportionate challenges in accessing affordable care. 4.2. Geographical and Gender-Based Challenges Migrants in remote or border regions face significant healthcare access challenges, with long travel distances adding financial and time burdens. Female migrant workers, especially those in domestic roles, encounter additional barriers, such as clinic hours conflicting with work schedules, unwelcoming attitudes from healthcare providers, and clinic distances. These factors limit their access to essential sexual and reproductive health services, exacerbating gender-based health disparities. 4.3. Socioeconomic and Legal Factors A significant portion of Myanmar migrant workers in Thailand earn below the minimum wage, with 37% earning less. Women earn an average of 350 THB per day, compared to 400 THB for men, and migrants in provinces like Tak earn even less. These low wages make healthcare and insurance unaffordable, while limited education leaves many unaware of their health rights, contributing to the underutilization of healthcare services. 4.4. Language Barriers and Communication Challenges Language barriers are a critical challenge for migrant workers in accessing healthcare, leading to misunderstandings, misdiagnoses, and delayed treatment. Without adequate language support, many migrants resort to drug stores for minor ailments, risking improper medication. The lack of translators in healthcare facilities further exacerbates these communication issues, limiting access to essential care. 4.5. Fear of Legal Repercussions Fear of legal repercussions is a significant barrier for irregular migrants in Thailand seeking healthcare. Many avoid medical facilities to prevent arrest or deportation, leaving health issues unaddressed. Without legal status, they rely on health posts or free clinics but face risks of arrest or bribery near official healthcare services, perpetuating mistrust and inadequate care. 5. Conclusions and Recommendations The healthcare challenges faced by Myanmar migrant workers in Thailand are multifaceted, involving a complex interplay of legal, financial, geographic, and socio-cultural factors. To improve access to healthcare, Thailand must address the systemic barriers hindering migrant workers' access to essential services. Key recommendations include: Enhancing Health Insurance Coverage: Expanding migrant health insurance schemes to cover all migrant workers, regardless of their legal status, is essential. Increasing Awareness and Outreach: Expanding awareness campaigns and outreach programs targeting migrant communities, especially in remote areas, can help increase knowledge of available healthcare services. Improving Healthcare Infrastructure in Rural Areas: Expanding healthcare facilities in rural and border regions and providing mobile health units will help bridge the access gap. Addressing Language Barriers: Increasing the availability of translators and culturally sensitive healthcare services will improve communication and reduce misunderstandings. Strengthening Legal Protections: Reducing the fear of deportation by strengthening legal protections for migrants seeking healthcare will encourage timely treatment and reduce the burden of preventable diseases. In conclusion, addressing the healthcare needs of Myanmar migrant workers in Thailand is not only a moral imperative but also essential for safeguarding public health. By addressing these challenges through comprehensive policy changes, Thailand can ensure that all workers, regardless of their legal status, have the healthcare they need to lead healthy, productive lives. It can also help Thailand build a more inclusive and sustainable healthcare system that benefits migrants and the broader population.

Moscow And Minsk Attack Catholicism To Defend Lukashenka And Russ...	Belarusian President Alyaksandr Lukashenka has long viewed Roman Catholics, who form 9-14 percent of the Belarusian population, with hostility and suspicion, given their opposition to his candidacy in 2020 (Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, September 5, 2020; see EDM, December 22, 2020). This perception persists despite relatively good official ties with the Vatican, one of the few foreign states willing to receive him (Fondsk.ru, January 9). Now, Lukashenka has launched a broad attack on Catholics and Catholicism in advance of his sham re-election scheduled for January 26, 2025. That crackdown has been widespread and harsh, with the number of Catholic parishes in Belarus declining and ever more priests sentenced to as much as 11 years in prison for 'treason' (Belstat, December 31, 2024; The Tablet, January 22). Moscow has joined this effort not only to help Lukashenka but also to defend Russian President Vladimir Putin’s 'Russian world' (Russkiy Mir; Русский мир) and challenge efforts inside Belarus to seek autocephaly (self-governance) for the Belarusian Orthodox Church as well. That last concern has also led officials in both capitals to attack the Ecumenical Patriarch in Constantinople and Uniatism (sometimes referred to as Eastern Catholicism) in Belarus, Ukraine, and elsewhere (Fondsk.ru, January 9; Rubaltic.ru, January 19). At least some of these efforts will probably ebb after Lukashenka is safely 're-elected,' but Russian and Belarusian hostility toward Roman Catholicism makes it unlikely that these efforts will disappear altogether. For example, one Russian commentator has gone so far as to say that Roman Catholics are just as 'extremist' as the Jehovah’s Witnesses, which have been the subject of the longest and harshest anti-religious campaign in recent Russian history (Materik.ru, June 25, 2020). Even authoritarian states have found that it is much easier to stoke such hostility than it is to snuff it out. Due to this, Russian-Belarusian official anti-Catholicism will further exacerbate problems between Moscow and Minsk, on the one hand, and Western capitals, on the other. Relations between the two Slavic states and Roman Catholicism have long been fraught and have only been exacerbated by recent events. The story of medieval Russian Prince Aleksandr Nevsky’s relationship to Catholicism is present in modern Russian and Belarusian perceptions of the religion. Nevsky made an alliance with the Mongols because he was fighting against not only the Teutonic knights but also Roman Catholic missionaries whom they believe wanted to convert Russians from Orthodoxy and place them under the control of the Pope (Epiphany Cathedral in Elokhov, September 11, 2019). Putin ideologists, since the start of Putin’s expanded invasion of Ukraine, have frequently repeated that argument (Ritm Eurasia, April 22, 2024). That historical memory may be less important at present than the relations between Catholics in Belarus and their co-religionists in Ukraine and how these relations are viewed in Minsk and Moscow. The Belarusian Greek Catholic Church is closely connected with the Greek Catholics (Uniates) of Ukraine, as Russian and Belarusian commentators are now given to repeating (Rubaltic.ru, January 19). Many of its priests were trained in western Ukraine, and unsurprisingly, they and their flocks have supported Ukraine since Putin launched his expanded invasion in February 2022, which is yet another reason for Moscow’s opposition to Catholicism in Belarus. (On these interrelationships, which undoubtedly inform fears among Belarusian and Russian officials, see EurAsia Daily, April 7, 2023; Dekoder, January 24, 2024.) Minsk and Moscow are inclined to view the Belarusian Catholics, therefore, as 'a fifth column,' a group that could pose an immediate challenge to the Belarusian regime and its Russian ally. In line with this view, Minsk has adopted new laws affording the government greater powers to interfere and limit the growth of Roman Catholicism in Belarus, which moves Moscow’s support (Legislation of CIS Countries, December 20, 2023). Yet another issue animates this anti-Catholic campaign, although it may seem far removed. Both Minsk and Moscow are worried that some within the Belarusian Orthodox Church, which is officially an exarchate of the Russian Orthodox Church in Belarus under the Moscow Patriarchate, may seek to become independent of Moscow. This would involve gaining autocephaly as the Ukrainian Orthodox Church did in 2019 with the blessing of the Ecumenical Patriarchate in Constantinople (see EDM, August 12, 2021). Several Belarusian Orthodox priests have fled to Lithuania and been taken under that patriarchate’s protection (Window on Eurasia, March 24, 2023). Neither the Roman Catholics of Belarus nor the Vatican have any involvement with such moves. Russian and Belarusian commentators, however, are convinced that this drive is part of a broader Western effort to break ties between Belarus and Russia and project Western power more deeply into 'the Russian world.' Consequently, such commentators argue that the actions of those seeking autocephaly are simply allies of the Roman Catholics and that Minsk and Moscow must attack both or face the prospect of the West stealing another march on 'the Russian world' (Rubaltic.ru, January 19). Many are likely to assume that this Belarusian-Russian attack on Roman Catholicism, however distasteful it may be, will not matter very much now that the world appears to be entering into a more tough-minded 'realist' approach to international relations. Even in recent years, there has been a decline in attention to those who are victimized by the Belarusian or Russian state for religious reasons. The anti-Catholicism of Belarus and Russia, however, is different and likely to have other consequences in international relations. On the one hand, however dismissive realists may be about the power of the Pope, the Vatican, both directly and through its networks of bishops, is able to attract far more attention to the repression of its followers. Similarly, objections from the Vatican are able to have an outsized impact on the countries where Catholics are numerous and followers of that denomination are found in the leading ranks of the realists. On the other hand, it is now obvious to an increasing number of people in the West that anti-Catholicism in Belarus and Russia is a euphemism for anti-Westernism. To the extent that that understanding spreads, it will be more difficult for Western leaders to ignore attacks on Catholics in the two Slavic countries, however 'realist' they profess to be. Consequently, Western leaders are unlikely to be able to dismiss what Minsk and Moscow are saying about—and doing to—Catholics. This makes it likely that the current attacks will cast not only a dark but a long shadow on the future.

Rebuilding Syria’s Infrastructure A Critical Priority – Analysis	Rebuilding Syria’s infrastructure is a monumental task that must be prioritized by the new government following the fall of the Assad regime. After nearly 14 years of protracted conflict, the country faces an overwhelming challenge in restoring its basic services, industries and economy. The devastation wreaked by war has left much of Syria's infrastructure in ruins, with cities like Aleppo and Homs bearing many scars. Roads, bridges, hospitals, schools and power plants have been destroyed, leaving millions of Syrians without access to essential services. Understanding how Syria came to be in this dire state underscores the urgency of focusing on reconstruction. The conflict, which began in 2011, was a multifaceted war involving numerous factions, foreign interventions and devastating humanitarian consequences. The relentless fighting, airstrikes and sieges obliterated industrial zones, agricultural land and public infrastructure. Urban centers, once vibrant hubs of economic activity, have been reduced to rubble. Nearly half of Syria's population has been displaced, either internally or externally, creating a refugee crisis that has strained neighboring countries and Europe. The collapse of infrastructure has compounded the suffering, with limited access to clean water, electricity and healthcare further exacerbating the dire living conditions. Prioritizing the reconstruction of infrastructure is essential for Syria’s recovery. It will not only address the immediate needs of the population but also serve as a foundation for economic revival and social stability. Rebuilding transport networks, for instance, will enable the movement of goods and people, revitalizing trade and commerce. Restoring energy facilities will provide electricity to households and businesses, jumpstarting production and creating jobs. Reviving water and sanitation systems will improve public health, reducing the spread of diseases and enabling communities to rebuild their lives. Beyond the practical benefits, infrastructure reconstruction holds symbolic value. It signifies a commitment to rebuilding the nation and restoring normality after years of devastation. It also fosters a sense of unity and shared purpose, as communities come together to rebuild their towns and cities. For a nation emerging from conflict, such collective efforts can contribute to healing and reconciliation, laying the groundwork for a more cohesive society. The issue of sanctions, however, remains a significant obstacle to Syria’s recovery. Many Arab countries have urged the West to lift the sanctions on Damascus, recognizing that these restrictions hinder reconstruction efforts. While the sanctions were imposed to pressure the Assad regime, they also impede the delivery of humanitarian aid and the rebuilding of critical infrastructure. Sanctions limit access to financial resources, restrict trade and deter foreign investment, all of which are essential for recovery. Lifting or easing the sanctions would enable the new government to access international funding, procure construction materials and attract foreign expertise. Rebuilding Syria’s infrastructure also requires a multipronged approach from the new leadership. Political stability is a prerequisite for attracting investment and securing international support. The government must demonstrate a commitment to democratic principles, human rights and transparent governance. This will not only gain the trust of the Syrian people but also encourage the international community to engage constructively in the country’s recovery. Public-private partnerships can play a crucial role in accelerating reconstruction by involving private enterprises in projects such as energy production, transport and housing. This collaboration can harness additional resources and expertise, ensuring efficient rebuilding efforts. Syria also has an opportunity to invest in renewable energy sources like solar and wind power. With its traditional energy infrastructure heavily damaged, renewable energy projects can address electricity shortages while positioning Syria for a more sustainable and energy-independent future. Countries like Saudi Arabia and the UAE, with their expertise in renewable energy, could provide valuable support in this area. Combating corruption is another critical aspect of reconstruction. Corruption has historically plagued Syria and rebuilding efforts must include strict measures to ensure transparency and accountability. Reconstruction funds must be utilized effectively, reaching intended projects without mismanagement or diversion. Capacity-building is equally important, as rebuilding infrastructure requires a skilled workforce. Investments in education and vocational training can equip Syrians with the necessary skills for construction, engineering and technology-related fields. This not only supports reconstruction efforts but also reduces unemployment and helps reintegrate displaced persons and former combatants into the workforce. Rebuilding Syria’s infrastructure will have transformative benefits for the nation. It will reestablish Syria as a functional state capable of engaging meaningfully in regional and global affairs. A strong infrastructure supports internal development and would position Syria as a potential trade hub, given its strategic location at the crossroads of the Middle East, Europe and Asia. Improved transport networks can facilitate regional trade and foster economic interdependence with neighboring countries, creating mutual benefits that contribute to long-term peace and stability. The reconstruction of housing, schools and healthcare facilities will also help address the needs of millions of displaced Syrians, both internally and externally. Providing safe housing and essential services will encourage refugees to return, aiding the country’s demographic recovery and workforce replenishment. International organizations such as the UN High Commissioner for Refugees have expressed a willingness to collaborate with Syria’s new leadership to support the safe repatriation and reintegration of refugees. The advocacy of Arab nations for lifting sanctions reflects a growing regional consensus on the need to assist Syria’s recovery. Countries like Saudi Arabia, the UAE and Jordan have not only called for the easing of Western-imposed restrictions but have also shown an interest in participating in reconstruction efforts. In conclusion, rebuilding Syria’s infrastructure is not just a logistical challenge, it is a moral and strategic imperative that will define the nation’s future. Prioritizing infrastructure reconstruction will be critical for economic revitalization, social stability and national unity. However, this task requires significant international cooperation, the lifting of sanctions and the establishment of a stable and transparent political environment. The new Syrian government has an opportunity to demonstrate its commitment to the country’s recovery by enacting reforms that attract investment, ensuring accountability in reconstruction efforts and fostering partnerships with regional and global stakeholders. For the international community, supporting Syria’s rebuilding process is not just an act of humanitarian goodwill but also an investment in regional and global stability. As the new leadership embarks on this monumental task, the rebuilding of Syria’s infrastructure will serve as a cornerstone of its transition from a war-torn nation to a thriving, resilient state.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWevQfbsFzkDcyxgupxNIXBc	2025-01-23T17:33:39-08:00	
Dr. Anthony Fauci: What Exactly Did Biden Pardon? – OpEd	On his way out of the White House on Jan. 20, Joe Biden issued a preemptive pardon for, among others, his chief medical advisor, Dr. Anthony Fauci. The week before, the federal Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) took action that will help the nation recover from Dr. Fauci’s COVID regime. HHS blocked the EcoHealth Alliance and its former president Peter Daszak from receiving any federal funds for a period of five years. Some representatives wanted a permanent ban, and they had a strong case. EcoHealth was Dr. Fauci’s conduit to fund the Wuhan Institute of Virology (WIV) to conduct gain-of-function (GOF) research, banned by the United States in 2014, which makes viruses more lethal and transmissible. The WIV, a collaborator with China’s military, had received a cargo of deadly pathogens courtesy of Dr. Qiu Xiangguo, the Chinese national who headed the pathogens program at Canada’s National Microbiological Laboratory (NML) in Winnipeg. In 2017-18, Dr. Qiu made at least five trips to the WIV, which collaborated closely with the Galveston National Laboratory (GNL), a creation of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), which Dr. Fauci headed from 1984 to 2023. Despite the activity and connections, Dr. Fauci and Daszak maintained that the COVID virus arose naturally in the wild. When medical scientists found evidence of a laboratory origin, Dr. Fauci smeared them as 'conspiracy theorists.' CDC director Robert Redfield even got death threats. In 2020, Dr. Fauci imposed a draconian regime, shutting down schools, even though children were the least vulnerable group. The medical scientists of the Great Barrington Declaration(GBD), including Stanford medical professor Dr. Jay Battacharya, made a case for a more open and humane policy. NIH director Francis Collins smeared these scientists as 'fringe epidemiologists' and tasked Dr. Fauci with a 'devastating takedown' of the GBD group, most if not all more qualified than Fauci and Collins. Dr. Anthony Fauci’s bio shows no advanced degrees in molecular biology or biochemistry, and Nobel laureate Kary Mullis, inventor of the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) technique, was on record that Fauci 'should not be in a position like he’s in.' When critics took him to task, Dr. Fauci claimed they were attacking science itself. Sen. Rand Paul, a medical doctor, charged that Fauci had lied to Congress about funding GOF in Wuhan but the Biden Department of Justice rejected two criminal referrals. Never held to account, the NIAID boss announced his retirement in late 2022 but he continued to receive a government-funded security and a transportation detail. In 2023, Sen. Paul authored Deception: The Great Covid Cover-up, which prompted no action from the Biden Justice Department. In December 2024, Dr. Fauci authored a paper claiming that AIDS, like the COVID virus, was 'zoonotic,' arising naturally apart from human agency. This contradicted his previous claim that the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) was the sole cause of AIDS, which had no animal model. That same month, it emerged that Biden was considering a preemptive pardon for Dr. Fauci. Such a pardon, according to Sen. Paul, will 'seal his fate as the architect, author and godfather of the pandemic. He’s the one who funded it. He’s the one who funded the research in Wuhan. He’s the one that allowed the research not to be scrutinized.' Biden’s pardon cancels the prospect of criminal charges against Fauci, whose network remains in place. The head of bioethics for the NIH is Dr. Fauci’s wife Christine Grady. In her 1995 The Search For an AIDS Vaccine, Grady did not reveal that she had been married to Fauci for 10 years, a highly unethical act of deception. In that book Grady promotes the highly caustic AZT, Fauci’s drug of choice for AIDS, and approves of drug tests on children and pregnant women. In 2012, when the NIH gave Grady the top bioethics job, the official NIH announcement made no mention of her book or her marriage to NIAID boss Dr. Fauci, a huge conflict of interest. Congressional investigators might ask Grady if her husband ever did anything with which she disagreed. That would include the funding of gain-of-function research at the WIV, sending seniors back into nursing homes, and mandating ineffective vaccines for children, the group least vulnerable to COVID. Consider also the current NIAID director Dr. Jeanne Marrazzo, a non-practicing physician and specialist in venereal disease. Like Dr. Fauci, her bio shows no advanced degrees in molecular biology or biochemistry, both vital for virology. During the pandemic, Dr. Marrazzo backed mask mandates and distancing rules that were simply made up and had nothing to do with science. If confirmed for NIH director, Dr. Jay Battacharya might get Marrazzo’s take on the Wuhan issue. If the Stanford professor decides to dismiss Marrazzo and Grady it would be hard to blame him. With Dr. Fauci pardoned, the structures and cadres of white coat supremacy must not be left in place. Rest assured that the people will be watching.

Biohacking: Key Legal, Moral And Commercial Considerations – Anal...	Biohacking is a rapidly growing movement that combines technology, biology, and self-experimentation to optimize human performance and well-being. It encompasses a range of practices, from genetic modifications and wearable technology to cognitive enhancement and nutritional interventions. In the European Union (EU), where health, technology, and data privacy regulations are extensive, the rise of biohacking challenges traditional legal and ethical boundaries and raises complex regulatory questions. While biohacking offers individuals unprecedented control over their physical and mental capabilities, it often operates on the fringes of legality, exploiting regulatory gaps. This article explores biohacking’s core practices and examines the legal frameworks, including treaties like the Oviedo Convention, the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), and other relevant EU policies, along with the regulatory loopholes that biohackers navigate and the broader implications for regulators and society. Defining the biohacking In traditional dictionaries, biohacking is often portrayed as a narrow and sometimes controversial practice. The Oxford English Dictionary, for instance, defines it as 'the activity of exploiting genetic material experimentally without regard to accepted ethical standards, or for criminal purposes' (Oxford English Dictionary). This definition emphasizes biohacking's potential for risk and unconventional methods of biological manipulation. Similarly, Merriam-Websterdescribes it as 'biological experimentation (as by gene editing or the use of drugs or implants) done to improve the qualities or capabilities of living organisms, especially by individuals and groups operating outside traditional medical or scientific research environments' (Merriam-Webster Dictionary). These definitions highlight biohacking as a self-directed, experimental practice typically conducted outside conventional scientific settings. For the purposes of this work, we will hereby operate with our own definition: externally induced, concealed gene (information hoovering, sequestrating, doctoring, and/or) intervention for non-transparent ends. (Bajrektarevic, 2010) Biohacking has evolved into a form of 'DIY biology,' where individuals — often outside institutional frameworks — apply biological science and technology to optimize their bodies and biological systems. According to Meyer (2020), biohacking thrives in peer production environments where knowledge and resources are openly shared, allowing individuals to take control of their biology through accessible tools, including wearable devices, supplements, and even genetic modification. This approach reflects a democratization of science that disrupts traditional boundaries between professional and amateur scientists, raising ethical concerns around safety, privacy, and regulation (Meyer 2020). As a grassroots movement, biohacking blends biology with principles of open science and DIY experimentation. Delfanti (2013) suggests that biohacking challenges conventional scientific hierarchies by emphasizing collaboration and open access to biological knowledge and tools. Biohackers frequently conduct experiments on themselves or their environments to push the limits of human biology, promoting a democratized science culture. This movement advocates for peer production and low-cost technologies as a form of resistance against proprietary, closed scientific systems (Delfanti 2013). Coenen et al. (2017) report that biohacking integrates diverse life sciences techniques beyond the confines of traditional academic and corporate research, further blurring the lines between professional and amateur scientists. While many biohacking techniques are health-focused, others pursue aesthetic, psychological, or even transhumanist objectives, exploring the extension of human capabilities through technology. Constituting elements Lifestyle optimization Lifestyle optimization in biohacking focuses on improving well-being through practical and measurable changes in daily routines. It targets areas such as diet, sleep, physical performance, and mental capacity, often using tools like wearable devices to track health metrics and guide adjustments. Popular methods include intermittent fasting, cold exposure, and the use of natural supplements. Diet is a fundamental aspect of biohacking. Approaches like intermittent fasting and ketogenic diets aim to enhance metabolism, reduce inflammation, and promote fat loss. Nutrigenomics, which examines the relationship between nutrients and gene expression, supports personalized dietary strategies that align with genetic predispositions, balancing hormones and improving overall health. Sleep quality is another priority. Biohackers use devices to monitor sleep patterns and test different techniques, such as adjusting room temperature, changing meal timings, or taking supplements like melatonin. Biohackers usually share their findings online, creating a collaborative community that exchanges ideas and refines methods for better rest. Physical enhancement often centers on strategies like High-Intensity Interval Training (HIIT), which delivers significant physiological benefits through brief yet intense exercise sessions. Cognitive improvement is also a major focus, with methods that include mindfulness, neurostimulation, and the use of nootropics. Substances like caffeine and L-theanine enhance focus and reduce fatigue, while others, such as modafinil, improve memory, attention, and executive function, enabling sharper mental performance. DIY biology DIY biology represents a more experimental branch of biohacking, often involving community labs where enthusiasts use biological tools and techniques typically reserved for professional researchers. Examples include genetic manipulation, open-source insulin production (such as in the Open Insulin Project), or developing personalized medical treatments. One of the primary uses of DIY bio is genetic engineering, where individuals experiment with organisms like bacteria or yeast to modify genetic material. This can include projects like creating fluorescent bacteria or altering plants to produce new compounds. Meyer notes that technologies such as CRISPR have made gene editing more accessible to non-professional scientists, allowing for experimentation with genetic material at a relatively low cost (Meyer 2020). Grinders and transhumanism At the extreme end of the biohacking spectrum are individuals known as 'grinders' or DIY transhumanists. These biohackers embrace invasive procedures, including the implantation of electronic devices (such as microchips) to enhance sensory capabilities or monitor health data. Their goal is often to transcend biological limits, entering the realm of cyborgism. Ethical and regulatory concerns are prevalent in this area due to the experimental and sometimes dangerous nature of these modifications (Coenen 2017; The Medical Futurist 2024). Grinders push the boundaries of self-experimentation, frequently employing devices such as RFID chips for unlocking doors, magnets implanted in fingertips for sensing electromagnetic fields, or even more advanced biotechnologies aimed at enhancing sensory perception or communication capabilities. Fuisz emphasizes the lack of legal frameworks to address the potential risks or unintended consequences of these experiments. This lack of regulation presents both an opportunity for innovation and a potential hazard, as these practices exist outside the traditional boundaries of medical and scientific research (Fuisz 2017). Moral considerations and legal limitations The rapid rise of biohacking has sparked debates about its safety and the ethical implications of self-experimentation. While many biohackers claim that their efforts help to advance health technologies, others criticize the movement for lacking adequate regulatory oversight. For example, invasive body modifications raise concerns about safety, legality, and potential misuse. On the other hand, biohacking movements like DIY biology advocate for open access to scientific tools, which may contribute to more affordable healthcare solutions, such as producing cheaper medications like insulin (University of Southern California 2024). Currently, the tension between innovation and regulation in biohacking is widely discussed. Excessive regulation might stifle creativity and personal freedom, but too little might lead to widespread harm. The challenge is to strike a balance that allows biohackers to innovate while protecting public safety and ethical standards. This raises the question of whether new laws and regulations should be created specifically for biohacking, or whether existing medical and scientific frameworks are sufficient to address these concerns (Fuisz 2017). EU Regulatory framework The rapid growth of biohacking, particularly in DIY biology and personal health modification, has raised complex legal and ethical challenges within the EU. While biohacking itself is not explicitly addressed by a singular legal framework, its various practices intersect with numerous existing EU regulations. These frameworks—governing data protection, medical devices, genetic modification, and ethical biomedical research—indirectly regulate biohacking activities. As the line between personal experimentation and formal biomedical innovation blurs, it becomes essential to understand how EU regulations address the safety, privacy, and ethical considerations surrounding this emerging field. This chapter will explore the key EU treaties and directives that apply to biohacking, highlighting the specific legal provisions that biohackers must navigate to ensure compliance with EU standards. General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) (EU) 2016/679 The General Data Protection Regulation is a cornerstone of EU law concerning the protection of personal data and privacy. Article 9 of the GDPR specifically addresses the 'Processing of special categories of personal data,' which includes biometric data used for uniquely identifying a person, as well as genetic data. Since many biohacking practices involve the collection and processing of such data—either for self-monitoring, health tracking, or experimentation—biohackers must comply with this provision. Article 9(1) generally prohibits the processing of these special categories of data unless the data subject has given explicit consent (Article 9(2)(a)) or the processing is necessary for medical diagnosis or scientific research (Article 9(2)(i)). Clinical Trials Regulation (EU) No 536/2014 The Clinical Trials Regulation sets out specific requirements for conducting clinical trials involving human subjects. Article 28 of this regulation focuses on informed consent, mandating that participants must be fully informed of the objectives, risks, and benefits of the trial before they can participate. For biohackers engaging in any form of human experimentation, particularly in the realm of medical devices or novel health interventions, compliance with this article is essential to ensure that ethical standards are met. Furthermore, Article 35 establishes provisions for vulnerable populations, such as individuals with reduced autonomy, who may be more susceptible to harm from risky biohacking experiments. Medical Device Regulation (MDR) (EU) 2017/745 The Medical Device Regulation applies to all medical devices placed on the market within the EU, including those used in biohacking activities. Article 2(1) of the MDR defines a medical device as 'any instrument, apparatus, appliance, software, implant, reagent, material, or other article' intended for medical purposes, such as diagnosis, prevention, or treatment of diseases. This regulation is relevant to biohackers who develop or modify devices for health enhancement or biomedical experimentation. Additionally, Article 5(1) of the MDR mandates that any device used in a medical context must comply with EU conformity assessment procedures, ensuring that the device is safe, effective, and bears a CE marking. Biotechnology Directive (Directive 98/44/EC) Biotechnology Directive governs the legal protection of biotechnological inventions in the EU. Articles 5 and 6 of the directive directly address the patentability of biotechnological inventions, particularly concerning genetic engineering. Article 5(1) states that 'The human body, at the various stages of its formation and development, and the simple discovery of one of its elements, including the sequence or partial sequence of a gene, cannot constitute patentable inventions.' However, Article 5(2) allows for the patenting of isolated elements of the human body, such as gene sequences, under specific conditions. This is highly relevant for biohackers involved in genetic editing or modification, as they must ensure compliance with the directive’s provisions regarding patent protection and the ethical use of genetic materials. The Oviedo Convention on Human Rights and Biomedicine The Oviedo Convention, also known as the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Dignity of the Human Being with regard to the Application of Biology and Medicine, is a crucial legal instrument in regulating bioethical issues. While not binding across all EU member states, it establishes ethical principles for biomedical research and medical practices. Article 5 of the Convention outlines the necessity of informed consent in medical interventions, stating that any procedure related to health may only be carried out after the person has been informed and has provided free and informed consent. Article 13 of the Convention prohibits genetic modifications aimed at altering the genome of descendants, thereby setting ethical boundaries on genetic biohacking practices that could affect future generations. Genetically Modified Organism (GMO) Regulation (EC) No 1829/2003 For biohackers involved in genetic modification, the Genetically Modified Organism (GMO) Regulation is essential. Article 4 of this regulation sets out requirements for the authorization of GMOs intended for human consumption, while Article 16 requires rigorous risk assessments before any GMOs can be released into the environment. These provisions ensure that biohacking activities involving genetic engineering must meet strict safety standards to protect both public health and the environment. Additionally, Directive 2001/18/EC on the deliberate release of GMOs into the environment mandates a notification and approval process for biohackers intending to experiment with genetically modified organisms outside controlled laboratory environments. EU Charter of Fundamental Rights The EU Charter of Fundamental Rights provides a broader ethical and human rights context that applies to biohacking. Article 1 guarantees human dignity, while Article 3 protects the right to physical and mental integrity, particularly in the context of medical or scientific experimentation. Biohackers must ensure that their practices respect these fundamental rights, especially in cases where human subjects are involved. Article 3 also explicitly prohibits the use of the human body and its parts as a source of financial gain, a provision that could be relevant to biohackers engaging in the commercialization of biotechnological innovations involving the human body. EU Regulatory gaps and legal loopholes While the European Union has implemented a range of regulations that indirectly govern aspects of biohacking—such as the GDPR for data privacy, the MDR for devices, and the Biotechnology Directive for genetic modification—these frameworks were not specifically designed with biohacking in mind. As a result, gaps exist in their coverage, particularly around practices like DIY biology, self-experimentation, and citizen-led research. Furthermore, the rapid pace of technological advancement in biohacking often outstrips the adaptability of existing laws, leading to ambiguity in critical areas such as liability, safety standards, and ethical boundaries. This chapter will examine these legal loopholes, the gaps in EU regulations that biohackers may exploit, and explore the challenges policymakers face in closing these regulatory voids. Biohacking outside of institutional oversight One of the primary challenges in regulating biohacking is the distinction between institutional and non-institutional research. EU regulations, such as the Clinical Trials Regulation (EU) No 536/2014, are designed to oversee formal clinical trials conducted by medical institutions or companies. However, biohacking often occurs in informal or private settings, such as personal labs or at home, outside the purview of these established oversight mechanisms. This means individuals engaging in self-experimentation or DIY biology may bypass the stringent safety and ethical guidelines required for institutional research, such as informed consent, independent ethics committee approval, and public safety measures. Moreover, many biohackers operate outside traditional research funding structures, meaning their activities do not fall under the purview of Horizon Europe or other EU funding programs, which impose strict ethical and regulatory compliance on grant recipients. As a result, a substantial amount of biohacking activity exists in an unregulated space, where enforcement is minimal. Self-experimentation and personal autonomy One of the most complex areas of biohacking regulation involves self-experimentation, where individuals modify or enhance their own biological systems. While EU laws, such as the MDR, establish clear standards for the safety and effectiveness of medical devices, they are primarily intended for commercial products rather than personal use. Biohackers who implant devices into their own bodies or modify their own biological systems may argue that these interventions fall under personal autonomy and bodily integrity, concepts protected by Article 3 of the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights, which guarantees the right to physical and mental integrity. The loophole here is that self-experimentation may evade scrutiny because biohackers are often both the researchers and the subjects of their own experiments. As long as the devices or modifications are not sold commercially or performed by third parties, these activities may not be subject to strict medical regulation. This creates ambiguity in terms of accountability and risk management, particularly when biohacking results in harm to the individual or unintended consequences for others, such as environmental risks from genetically modified organisms. Ambiguities in genetic modification and biotechnology Biohacking frequently involves genetic modification, whether through gene-editing technologies like CRISPR or synthetic biology. The Biotechnology Directive governs the legal protection of biotechnological inventions but is focused primarily on patent law and intellectual property rather than regulating amateur genetic experimentation. While this directive addresses the patentability of biotechnological inventions, it offers limited guidance on the regulation of private or hobbyist genetic modification projects, especially those not intended for commercial use. Furthermore, EU GMO regulations, such as Regulation (EC) No 1829/2003 and Directive 2001/18/EC, require authorization and risk assessment for the release of genetically modified organisms into the environment. However, biohackers working in private settings may develop GMOs without the intent of formal release or commercialization, creating a regulatory loophole where small-scale genetic modification experiments are conducted with minimal oversight. The issue is further complicated by the fact that biohackers may claim their activities are forms of scientific exploration or artistic expression, allowing them to circumvent regulations that typically apply to commercial or institutional activities. Data privacy and ethical challenges Biohacking often involves the collection of personal health data, whether through implanted sensors, biometric monitoring, or genetic testing. The GDPR governs the collection and processing of personal data, including biometric and genetic information. However, biohackers may exploit certain ambiguities in the GDPR, particularly regarding consent and the use of personal data for self-experimentation or non-commercial purposes. For instance, Article 9 of the GDPR prohibits the processing of special categories of personal data unless the individual has given explicit consent. In biohacking, where the data subject and the experimenter are often the same person, consent is not as rigorously monitored or enforced as it would be in institutional research. This creates potential risks in terms of data security, ethical use of personal data, and the potential for misuse of sensitive genetic information. Moreover, biohackers who share data within communities or on open-source platforms may inadvertently expose personal health information without adhering to GDPR compliance, particularly when cross-border data transfers are involved. Legal and ethical responsibility for community-based biohacking Biohacking communities often work collaboratively, sharing knowledge, techniques, and even experimental results. These activities, while fostering innovation, also raise questions about responsibility and accountability. If an individual biohacker suffers harm or if a genetically modified organism inadvertently affects the environment, it remains unclear who would bear legal liability. The EU’s existing legal frameworks primarily address institutional responsibility (e.g., corporations or research institutions) rather than distributed, decentralized communities of individuals. As a result, EU regulations struggle to define clear accountability in cases where harm is caused by biohacking activities. This loophole means that biohacking communities can operate with a degree of legal anonymity, potentially exposing both individuals and society to unregulated risks. Regulatory mechanisms extension? While the EU has established a robust legal framework to regulate biotechnology, medical devices, and personal data, these regulations were largely designed with formal institutions and commercial enterprises in mind. Biohacking, as a decentralized and often informal practice, exploits several legal loopholes, particularly concerning self-experimentation, private genetic modification, and community-based research. These gaps allow biohackers to operate with minimal oversight, raising concerns about safety, ethical responsibility, and the environmental impact of biohacking activities. Moving forward, policymakers will need to address these regulatory gaps by creating adaptable legal frameworks that account for the unique nature of biohacking. This may involve introducing new rules specific to DIY biology, tightening enforcement mechanisms, and clarifying liability in cases of harm or environmental damage. Furthermore, fostering collaboration between biohackers and regulators could help create a balanced approach that encourages innovation while ensuring public safety and ethical standards are upheld. Clarifying the legal status of self-experimentation and personal biohacking The legal status of self-experimentation and personal biohacking remains ambiguous under EU regulations, as existing frameworks primarily address institutional or commercial medical research. This gap leaves biohackers who experiment on themselves unregulated, particularly in areas involving medical devices and genetic modification. To address this, EU policymakers should establish clear guidelines that uphold individual autonomy while ensuring public safety. These should include minimum safety standards for medical devices, implanted technologies, and genetic editing tools used in personal biohacking. Amending the Medical Device Regulation (MDR) to encompass DIY tools and creating a registration process for self-experimenters could further clarify legal responsibilities. However, balancing personal autonomy with regulatory oversight poses challenges, as biohackers often view their activities as expressions of personal freedom. Additionally, enforcing regulations on private, non-commercial activities remains a significant hurdle, complicating compliance and oversight efforts. Regulating DIY biology and non-institutional research Biohacking often occurs outside traditional research institutions, with individuals or small groups conducting genetic modification and synthetic biology experiments in private or community spaces. These decentralized activities pose risks to individuals and the environment, yet current regulations are inadequate for effective oversight. To address this, a licensing framework for DIY biology labs should be developed, requiring biohackers working with sensitive technologies, such as genetic engineering tools, to register with national regulatory bodies. This framework should mandate safety protocols, risk assessments, and periodic inspections to ensure adherence to health and environmental standards. Additionally, the GMO Directive should be expanded to include small-scale, non-commercial genetic modification projects, subjecting biohackers to the same rigorous risk assessments as institutional researchers. Enhancing data protection and ethical standards in biohacking The rise of biohacking poses challenges to data privacy and ethics under the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). Biohackers often collect and share personal health data for self-experiments, operating outside traditional medical oversight. This raises concerns about data security and ethical handling of biometric and genetic information. To address these issues, GDPR enforcement should include specific guidelines for biohackers, requiring them to meet the same consent and data protection standards as institutional researchers. National ethics committees could review and approve high-risk biohacking projects involving genetic or biometric data, ensuring compliance with ethical standards. Resistance from biohacking communities, which value openness and decentralized practices, and the complexity of enforcing GDPR in global, cross-border networks remain significant obstacles. Fostering collaboration between policymakers and the biohacking community Regulating biohacking effectively requires bridging the gap between policymakers and the biohacking community. Heavy-handed regulation risks stifling innovation, as biohackers often operate at the forefront of biotechnology. Constructive dialogue is essential to close regulatory gaps while encouraging innovation. Policymakers should engage biohackers through workshops, conferences, and advisory committees to better understand their needs and concerns. A regulatory sandbox could allow biohackers to test new technologies in a monitored environment, fostering innovation while ensuring public safety. Challenges include mistrust from biohackers, who may view regulation as a threat to their freedom, and the rapid evolution of biohacking technologies, which makes it difficult for policies to keep pace. Building trust and creating adaptable regulations will be key to addressing these issues. Addressing liability and accountability in biohacking Liability and accountability in biohacking remain significant legal gaps, especially in decentralized communities where responsibility for harm—whether to individuals, the public, or the environment—is unclear. This issue is critical in cases such as failed self-experimentation or accidental release of GMOs. A clear liability framework is needed to assign accountability for damages, potentially by extending product liability laws to cover DIY medical devices and implementing environmental rules for GMO-related risks. Biohackers engaging in high-risk experiments should also be required to obtain liability insurance to ensure responsibility and mitigate harm. Challenges include difficulties in identifying responsible parties in anonymous or collaborative biohacking networks and the lack of a developed insurance market to cover biohacking risks, which may make coverage costly or inaccessible. Tackling biopiracy in biohacking Biohacking's focus on democratizing biotechnology risks perpetuating biopiracy—the unauthorized use of genetic resources and traditional knowledge without equitable benefit-sharing. Frameworks like the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) and Nagoya Protocol address biopiracy, but their adaptation to biohacking requires further attention (Bajrektarevic & Sari). Biohackers should adopt Access and Benefit Sharing (ABS) practices, ensuring prior consent and equitable agreements with indigenous communities to protect resource providers' rights. Governments must strengthen ABS legislation and require biohackers to follow simplified protocols when accessing genetic resources, addressing gaps in enforcement and accountability. Challenges include weak enforcement of ABS mechanisms in countries with limited oversight and inconsistent national laws, which create compliance difficulties for biohackers working on cross-border projects. Harmonized legal frameworks are essential for effective regulation and equitable practices. Preventing environmental crime in biohacking Biohacking poses risks to the environment through activities such as genetic modification and the disposal of biological materials, which may inadvertently contribute to environmental crime. Offenses like illegal waste disposal and unauthorized resource use are aggravated by weak regulations and the decentralized nature of biohacking, which often lacks institutional oversight (Bajrektarevic 2021). To address these issues, governments must align national and international laws on hazardous waste, biodiversity, and genetic resources to ensure ecological safety. Partnerships between regulators, biohackers, and environmental organizations can improve compliance and reduce harm through clearer accountability and monitoring. Challenges include the informal structure of biohacking, which makes enforcement difficult, and resource limitations faced by authorities, leaving environmentally harmful practices unchecked. Clear regulations and collaborative efforts are essential to prevent ecological damage. Conclusion While it is essential to address the regulatory gaps in EU biohacking laws, overly restrictive measures risk pushing biohackers further into the gray area of unregulated activities. To foster a productive balance between innovation and safety, policymakers should focus on creating flexible, supportive frameworks that encourage responsible biohacking without stifling creativity or experimentation. Rather than imposing overly strict regulations, the EU can adopt a more collaborative approach, working with the biohacking community to co-create guidelines that prioritize safety while respecting the autonomy of biohackers. This can be achieved by establishing a regulatory sandbox, where biohackers are given the freedom to innovate in a controlled and monitored environment. Such a framework would allow biohackers to experiment with cutting-edge technologies while receiving guidance on regulatory compliance and safety standards, ensuring that their work aligns with public health and ethical norms. Providing funding and grants for biohacking projects through programs like Horizon Europe would also create an incentive for biohackers to operate within legal frameworks. By offering financial support and structured resources, the EU can encourage biohackers to collaborate with formal institutions and conduct their work transparently, with access to safety protocols and ethical oversight. This will help integrate biohackers into the broader scientific community, fostering innovation in a safe and ethical space without limiting their freedom. At the same time, ensuring clearer liability guidelines for biohacking projects is important to protect both individuals and the public. Rather than imposing rigid enforcement, the focus should be on developing systems that provide clarity around accountability while offering biohackers the flexibility to experiment safely. In summary, closing the regulatory gaps in biohacking requires a balanced approach that promotes freedom and innovation while ensuring safety and ethical responsibility. By fostering collaboration, providing support, and creating adaptive regulations, the EU can cultivate an environment where biohackers can continue to push boundaries without being forced into legal gray areas, contributing positively to the future of biotechnology.

The EU Has New Airline Regulations And Consumers Will Pay – OpEd	By Jack Watt EU policymakers have created new regulation for the aviation sector. ReFuelEU Aviationmandates the use of sustainable aviation fuels (SAF) and bans fuel tankering—a common practice globally. It is another climate-related initiative that will hamper native industry, increase prices, and reduce choice for consumers. Cheap fuel out, expensive fuel in The main thrust is to increase use of sustainable aviation fuels (SAF), which are incredibly expensive. To cite a conservative estimate, SAF is around 250 percent more expensive than conventional jet fuel. This is somewhat alarming because fuel costs typically make up 25-30 percent of an airline’s total costs. With the aim of bringing down the cost, the legislation aims to 'de-risk' development. It imposes requirements on SAF usage, from 2 percent in 2025 to 70 percent in 2050, and grants favorable financing terms to producers. They will have access to funds raised by the EU’s 'green bonds' and investment from the EU budget, itself raised by taxation from member states. Some funds will also come from revenues generated by another burden on airlines, the Emissions Trading Scheme (ETS), which airlines operating flights within the European Economic Area (EEA) and the UK are obliged to participate in (the UK ETS is slightly different but broadly aligned—it remains to be seen if a similar thing happens with ReFuelEU.) Tankering Ban Fuel tankering is where an aircraft operator loads extra fuel on a particular flight for the purpose of avoiding or reducing the amount of fuel required to be loaded for the return or next leg of a service. Sometimes the cost of carrying the extra weight is more than offset by higher fuel costs at the destination airport. But legislators have decided that as extra weight means more emissions, it must be banned on all flights arriving or departing the EU. This is curious logic, as it means that extra weight that reduces cost is treated differently to extra weight that increases revenue (passengers and cargo), despite both resulting in more emissions. Eurocontrol estimated that 21 percent of flights tanker to some extent. This is not surprising, as fuel prices can vary up to 55 percent within Europe—consider the cost of getting jet fuel to a Greek island or rural airfield (and the diesel burned to get it there!). The ability to tanker ensures that fuel suppliers face an elastic demand curve. For single-supplier airports, as many rural and remote airports are, it now becomes inelastic to the point where airlines stop serving the airport altogether. What does this mean for operators? The effect of this policy depends on the business model of the airline. For example, what type of airports do they serve, how long are their flights, and what is their competition? Consider that large hubs generally have a more competitive landscape than regional airports, which may only have a single fuel supplier. This means that point-to-point operators will be impacted more than hub operators. The former are generally the low-cost carriers, which operate more frequently to secondary and regional airports that tend to have less competitive fuel prices. Another factor is that the cost of carrying extra fuel increases with length of flight, so increasing price differentials are required to justify tankering as flight length increases. Among EU airlines, a higher proportion of the low-cost carriers’ flights are shorter sectors, though the hub and spoke 'majors' also have significant short-haul operations. That is, all big operations are affected, but the former relatively more so. The EU majors have one problem that the intra-European, low-cost carriers do not, though. In the long-haul market, they compete with operators that connect passengers onwards from their non-EU hub, notably the large Gulf and US majors. As only the EU leg is affected by this legislation, EU carriers offering direct flights are at a disadvantage versus those who offer connections via non-EU hubs. It is worth noting that this is not the first relative advantage handed to non-EU carriers by legislators. EU and UK airlines have far greater exposure to the ETS, which is 25 times costlier than the international equivalent, called CORSIA. Additionally, several nations also charge Air Passenger Duty, which is foisted on the whole operation of an airline based in affected nations and tends to be greater for longer direct flights than those connecting through an intermediate hub. Finally, it also means new administrative costs. There are many reasons flights leave with more fuel than legally required—the fuel load is a point of safety, first and foremost—and one can imagine ways to at least partially tanker without calling it as such. Conclusion In summary, EU aviation faces significant headwinds with SAF mandates and the ban on tankering. While the SAF mandates pose a greater threat to the viability of operators of all types, the tankering ban introduces immediate cost increases. The degree of impact on individual operators depends on their business model and competition, and though native EU carriers are burdened more than their non-EU peers, none are made better off in absolute terms. As ever when regulators burden industries with new terms, consumers will pay the price. They will experience a combination of higher ticket prices, less competition, and less choice than would otherwise exist.

The Historic First Days – OpEd	Well, the Donald surely did hit the ground thundering, and some right good noise it was—starting with the 1,500+ pardons of the J6 offenders. That promise kept was crucial because it was one big presidential middle finger rebuke to the Giant Lie that the Washington establishment and MSM have been egregiously peddling for the last four years. For crying out loud, it wasn’t an 'insurrection' and did not threaten American democracy even a teensy tiny bit. Instead, the January 6th brouhaha was a case of piss-poor police work at the US Capitol Building. It could have been readily barricaded from the unruly crowd streaming off the Ellipse with a few locked steel doors and some water cannons and bear spray canisters unloosed for good measure. Indeed, we spent 15 years around the place back in the day, and the truth is this: If they don’t want you to get in, you just plain can’t penetrate what is a fortress made of 400,000 sandstone blocks weighing upwards of 75 million pounds in the aggregate. The so-called rioters got in because they were let in, not because they broke in. They had no plan of action whatsoever and for an obvious reason: It was a disorganized, unarmed, leaderless mob of political yokels and yahoos, which like the car-chasing dog who unexpectedly caught its prey, had no idea of what to do once they got inside—except to meander around the building taking selfies and grabbing mementos such as the paperweights on Nancy Pelosi’s desk. None of them were armed. There was also never a moment of material threat to the Secret Service-protected Vice-President or the Electoral College certification procedure. And contrary to the flagrant but typical lie on CNN last night by the dopey Dem Senator from New Jersey, Cory Booker, no 'police killers' got pardoned at 7:30 PM Monday. The only person 'killed' at the Capitol Building that day was an unarmed citizen, Ashli Babbitt, who had been a decorated war hero before coming to Washington to protest an outcome that was decided by 44,000 votes in three states out of 158 million counted in an election in which only 57 million voters actually came to the polls on election day (the other 101 million ballots were absentee ballots or early voting ballots). Was there reason, therefore, to suspect the validity of this razor-thin outcome conducted under untested pandemic voting procedures—even apart from Donald Trump’s self-serving whining? As Sarah Palin would have said, you betcha! In any event, the event was a non-event. The vast majority of the protesters/rioters should have been fined $100 for trespassing and defacing of government property and sent home. That should have been the end of it—but the Washington establishment had other ideas. To wit, taking the weaponization of the Deep State to the next level by spending $2.7 billion of taxpayer money prosecuting a case against thousands of citizens that was so threadbare as to actually amount to a transparent Democrat campaign ad. That’s right. These liberal poseurs spent enough money staging their J6 theatrical extravaganza as would have supported food stamps for 770,000 needy people for an entire year. They are just shameless. Yet, even that is not the whole of it. For instance, consider all the talking-head bleating about the police officers 'injured' on January 6th. Dig as deep as you might, however, and you can’t find a record of even a dozen of them being admitted to any Washington, DC hospital. That is to say, the '140 injured officers' canard was either made up out of whole cloth entirely or they counted every scratch, scrape, first aid bandage, nosebleed, or slight heart palpitation that occurred among the ranks of the desk jockeys and glorified visitor guides who are pleased to be called the Capitol Hill Police force. Actually, the US Attorney for the District of Columbia, Matthew Graves, who was in charge of this entire miscarriage of justice and the source of the 140 injuries figure might well be considered an 'expert' in illegal assaults. His career prior to joining the Biden DOJ in 2021 was at a Washington 'law firm' that lobbied for represented Middle Eastern nations and banks accused of supporting terrorism! Specifically, Graves represented the Qatari government, which has faced accusations of supporting terrorist organizations including Hamas, and also a passel of foreign banks including the Bank of Palestine, Arab Bank PLC, and Bank of Beirut—all of which were accused of financing terrorism. In short, we are not inclined to credit Mr. Graves’ claims about police injuries on J6 since it is evident that his field of vision is heavily colored by whoever his paymaster might happen to be at any moment in time. Worse still, all of this wailing about the alleged desecration of the People’s House is downright nauseating. After all, the Capitol Building is desecrated day in and day out by the greatest assemblage of crooks, knaves, hypocrites, and bootlickers you can find in any one building in all of America. In fact, they are spending and borrowing the nation into fiscal calamity—with the public debt now rising by more than $10 billion per day. Of course, as Trump jabbered away at the Resolute Desk—signing 48 executive orders, repealing 78 Biden executive actions and taking more unscripted, not-preapproved questions from the press in 50 minutes than Sleepy Joe did in 1,460 days—he was just getting warmed up with the pardons, including one for the website maker Ross Ulbricht who was sentenced to two lifetimes plus 40 years in prison for selling weed now available in retail shops in most big cities. In fact, the far more sweeping and consequential 'pardon' issued last night was that for fossil fuels and the lowly CO2 molecules that their combustion unleashes to fertilize and green the planet. Quitting the Paris Accord (again), canceling the EV mandates, opening up Alaska, and pausing Federal leases for offshore wind turbine carnage of sea life wasn’t really the half of it. Far more crucial was the flat-out utterance from the Bully Pulpit of the White House itself that the whole Climate Crisis campaign is a hoax and a scam. Unlike the normal GOP BS about 'balancing' so-called climate protection measures with economic needs or phasing in fossil fuel rollbacks more judiciously or putting taxpayer money into smart hideous boondoggles like CO2 capture and 'burial,' the Donald pulled no punches. To wit, he flatly said that the predicate is utterly wrong. So be gone you climate fraudsters! In the same 'be gone' vein the 51 ex-intelligence community grifters who signed the petition saying Hunter Biden’s laptop was a Russian plant got their security clearances yanked—led by those belonging to the five most odious dicks in the lot: Brennan, Clapper, Hayden, Morell, and Panetta. This action may well relieve the American people from their lies and propaganda as national security 'experts' on the cable networks night after night, but also something even more crucial: Namely, it was a message from the Oval Office that contrary to Senator Chuckles Schumer’s warning the first time around that no one in their right mind would tangle with the intelligence community, the nation’s reelected sheriff just plain ain’t afraid of the Deep State. Period. That is, the folks pictured below and their legions of cohorts and confederates took a proverbial shot at the king and missed. So the Donald’s payback is just starting in these precincts, meaning that the future of constitutional government may be getting one big shot in the arm—including in the next few days when all of the remaining material in the classified archives about the assassination of JFK, RFK, and Martin Luther King is released. This long overdue release amounts to both a defiance of the Deep State and evidence that lessons have been learned on the Donald’s side of the table. Last time, he got talked out of releasing the JFK files by the deplorable neocon troll, Mike Pompeo. But this time he knew enough to send Pompeo, John Bolton, Gina Haspel, and the rest of the neocon pack packing before they even packed for another job in his second administration. The litmus test as to whether the national security Deep State is really on the run, however, will be if the Donald sticks it out with his brilliant choice of Tulsi Gabbard for DNI (Director of National Intelligence). Tulsi knows her brief cold—so give her a few months as DNI and the wailing sounds coming from the 17 intelligence agencies will turn into a roaring crescendo of disclosure and exposure of the evil deeds done by many of those pictured below. Then there was the shit-canning of Washington’s horrid $1.3 billion per year contribution to the WHO (World Health Organization). Indeed, this tool of globalism and crony capitalists captured by the likes of Bill Gates and Big Pharma has received $16 billion from Washington over the last decade. After the WHO’s treachery on the Covid pandemic and vax front, however, the zero funding put in place last night needs to stay zero as far as the eye can see. Again, the Donald should never be forgiven for unleashing Dr. Fauci, Scarf Lady Birx, Operation Warp Speed, and the rest of the Covid mayhem on the American people. He knows now for certain that they, in league with shadowy national security officials, ruined his last term. But his ridding the US of any and all affiliation with this destructive UN institution would be a decent starting form of penance. Likewise, the executive order forbidding any Federal agency from indirectly thwarting the absolute constitutional protection of free speech was a veritable clarion call. It unmistakably announced that the Biden-era outbreak of Federal-agency thought control is now over and done. Yet to make sure this order will stand forevermore, the Trump people need to follow up with a deep and sweeping investigation of these unconstitutional misadventures and assaults on free speech. The purpose would be to identify, expose, and prosecute, if warranted, every single one of the Bidenite malefactors by name, rank, and serial number so as to discourage any future political appointee from even thinking about weaponizing an agency of the state against domestic political rivals or dissidents from the prevailing orthodoxy. In this regard, the 75-day reprieve for TikTok is a big stride in the same direction—with the added feature that it calls out the 'national security' ruse for state-driven thought control and censorship. The fact that the Chinese owners allegedly capture user information is a pitifully weak excuse for banning free speech. After all, the very modus operandi of free social media is that they capture and monetize your viewing habits, otherwise known as your 'information.' Besides that, even though the Donald’s eagerness to 'make a deal' with the Chinese has its own problems, his delay of the TikTok ban at least clarified one thing. To wit, it gave occasion for the great Senator Rand Paul to school a typical Fox News China-basher about who owns the joint. And it turns out that the parent company, ByteDance, is owned 60% by global investors, 20% by the two founders, 20% by employees including thousands of Americans and zero percent by the Chicom government in Beijing. As to the latter, the only thing the Chinese government actually owns is a 1% golden share in a China-only subsidiary of ByteDance because, well, TikTok itself is illegal in China! You can’t make this stuff up. Both the House and Senate chambers are crawling with UniParty demagogues who based the ban on the hideous grounds that Beijing might find out, what? Whether 13-year-old American girls like videos of puppies or kittens better? According to the Wall Street Journal, ByteDance agreed in 2021 to allow the Chinese government to take a 1% ownership stake known as a 'golden share' at one of its China-based subsidiaries, Beijing Douyin Information Service Co., which runs Douyin, an app available in China that’s similar to TikTok. (TikTok is not available in mainland China.). It goes without saying, of course, that DEI took it firmly on the chin as well. And appropriately so. There has not been any statist operation more inimical to personal liberty and free enterprise prosperity in recent decades than the DEI campaign that infected much of the Fortune 500. That is, until Bud Light was stupid enough to hire a creepy transgender TikTok influencer named Dylan Mulvaney, which triggered Trump buddy Kid Rock to post a video on Twitter blasting cases of Bud Light to smithereens with a machine gun. Alas, it all came together over the weekend when Kid Rock serenaded the Trump rally Sunday evening while the Donald went on yesterday to literally deliver the DEI death knell. His ringing endorsement of meritocracy and the plainly evident truth that Mother Nature invented just two genders may have finally awakened the corporate, university, and government HR departments from their destructive sojourns in the deranged world where men have babies and women have a pair. At the end of the night, of course, there was one real big, nay huuuge, thing missing. The Donald didn’t say a word about the fiscal time bomb that has been deposited on his doorstep by the UniParty. But the fact is, the $624 billion deficit posted during the two first two months of FY 2025 was a shocking 64% bigger than the prior year and even exceeded the 2020 Covid year deficit by a large measure. Moreover, it’s just the tip of the iceberg coming down the pike. The built-in spending momentum will generate $85 trillion of outlays over the next decade versus barely $60 trillion of revenue, and that’s according to a CBO baseline forecast that assumes uninterrupted full employment for the next decade and a level of total GDP and employment by 2035 that even supply-side gurus like Art Laffer have barely projected. That is to say, the public debt is heading to $70 trillion by the mid-2030s and $150 trillion (yes, with a 'T') by the middle of the century—a level that would crush Main Street prosperity and constitutional liberty as we have known it. And yet and yet. The Donald had absolutely nothing to say on the very topic that is at the heart of everything. Nor did he say a word about how he will extricate the US from the catastrophe in Ukraine or rein in a $1.6 trillion national security budget that is at least $500 billion greater than what an America First homeland security policy actually requires. Instead, he went off on a tangent about planting the stars and stripes on Mars. And that’s to say nothing about how the 8 million illegals now on US payrolls will be replaced if they are deported by ICE or self-deported by fears of a knock on the door in the middle of the night. Finally, Trump was yapping yet again about Chicom control of the Panama Canal. To be sure, someone apparently told the Donald that the Panama Canal Authority is gouging American shippers and China may have something to do with it. Of course, neither is remotely true. But there is a larger issue here. The matter of Panama is so utterly irrelevant that the Donald’s preoccupation with it is still another reminder that his good thunder on issues where he feels he has been personally wronged can readily give way to immense blunders on important matters on which he is wholly misinformed or completely misguided. In the case of Panama, for instance, the Chinese government has absolutely no role in the operations of the Panama Canal Authority. Nor did they fund the recent $5 billion expansion to accommodate more and larger ships. In all, the canal authority collects just $3.38 billion per year in tolls, which doesn’t amount to a hill of beans in the scheme of things. Actually, the tolls averaged just $16 per ton against the 210 million long tons of cargo handled by the canal in FY 2024. So perhaps the Donald’s opinion is what—that the toll should be much lower at say $13.50, $9.25, or $5 per ton? In fact, if the tolls were actually exploitative, the containers coming from the Far East and heading for the US Atlantic coast would divert to the Long Beach/Los Angeles Port and then go by train and truck to the East Coast. Alas, they don’t at today’s $16 per ton average charge because after the Teamsters, rail unions, and Warren Buffett’s Union Pacific railroad eat their fill, it’s still cheaper to take the canal route and pay the tolls—the Donald’s newfound monopolistic assessment or not. More importantly, about 70% of the Panama Canal traffic is accounted for by US port-originated or destined traffic. So call the annual charge to the US economy $2.4 billion, which amounts to the rounding error sum of $7.0 million per day. As for the Chicoms, their footprint apparently stems from the fact that the venerable Chinese investment titan, Li Ka-shing, owns and operates two Panama Canal ports through CK Hutchison Holdings. In turn, these two ports–one on the Atlantic (Cristobal) and the other on the Pacific (Balboa)—move about 4.5 million TEUs (Twenty-Foot Equivalent Units) per year. That’s nothing to sneeze at, but even then it amounts to barely half of the annual 8.0 million TEUs moved by the two largest Panama operations at the Port of Colon and the Port of Manzanillo. These are not Chinese-owned or influenced, nor are several more smaller ports that also operate in Panama. That is to say, why in the big wide world of national problems and crises is the Donald blundering around threatening to seize the Panama Canal—which is a 20th-century relic, at best? Moreover, we don’t know whether the legendary Li Ka-shing is a commie agent or not, but if so he has been pretty adept at playing the role of empire-building capitalist. After all, he has accumulated a current net worth of $36 billion. More pertinently, we don’t see much reason to sweat Li Ka-shing’s ownership of two of the seven Panama ports—especially when the American economy already has been living quite comfortably with the CK Hutchison empire of ports all around the world. Actually, the company is the world’s leading port investor, developer, and operator. The Group’s ports division holds interests in 52 ports comprising 291 operational berths in 27 countries, including container terminals operating in six of the 10 busiest container ports in the world, such as the premier US port at Long Beach. In 2021, the division handled a total throughput of 88 million TEUs, meaning that its Panama operation accounts for barely 4% of its global volume. So if CK Hutchison is a dangerous tool of Xi Jinping, its Panama holdings are the least of our worries. Of course, there is actually nothing to worry about down there in the Panama Canal Zone when it comes to global commerce and the purported machinations of China. It turns out that the current volume through the Long Beach/Los Angeles Ports is 20 million TEUs per year or five times more than the traffic through the so-called China ports in Panama. At an average value of about $75,000 per TEU, the annual volume into these leading US ports is worth about $1.5 trillion. That is to say, if you put the Donald’s 'big beautiful' 25% tariff on the incoming goods at Long Beach/Los Angeles, you get $375 billion per year drained out of the pockets of American consumers. Now, that’s actually some kind of harm. In short, the $7 million per day of tolls paid by US-bound shipments through the canal are utterly irrelevant to anything that matters when it comes to restoring non-inflationary growth in an American economy now freighted down under $101 trillion of public and private debt and a central bank that has painted itself into an inflationary corner. Stated differently, the Donald’s Day One thunder was superb but his blunder in totally ignoring the big issues—taming the Warfare State, reining in the explosion of Federal spending and debt, and throttling the madcap money printers at the Fed—needs to be corrected real soon. We don’t have much hope for that, however. At the end of the day, Donald Trump is a Caesarean who thinks governance is a principle-free transactional 'art of the deal' to be performed on a global stage. It is not. Not in the slightest. What America actually needs is not a bully-boy CEO, but a Federal government that sobers up, balances its books, brings the Empire home, and gets out of the way. Then again, we just don’t see the Donald signing up for Jeffersonian quiescence and modesty now that he is back in the Oval Office. He has spent a whole lifetime pursuing the opposite, and is not about to execute a volte-face now.

Micheál Martin Becomes Irish Prime Minister For Second Time	By Nicholas Wallace (EurActiv) -- Ireland's parliament, the Dáil, nominated Fianna Fáil's Micheál Martin as prime minister for the second time on Thursday. Martin was supposed to be nominated Taoiseach on Wednesday. However, opposition parties, angry about speaking-time rules for pro-government independents, shouted over the speaker, Verona Murphy, forcing her to suspend the Dáil and delay the vote. To break the impasse, the government agreed to renegotiate the Dáil's procedural rules. Martin's Fianna Fáil is the largest political party in the Dáil. The party struck a coalition deal with its old rival-turned-partner, Fine Gael, on 14 January, along with a loose formation of largely conservative independents. The centre-right politician has served as Taoiseach once before, between 2020-2022, during a previous coalition between Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael and the Greens. Musical chairs, round two The new coalition deal, like the old one, requires Martin to resign part-way through the government's term and to pass the baton to the Fine Gael leader – currently Simon Harris, the outgoing Taoiseach. The agreement sets 16 November 2027 as the date for Martin to step down. The agreement followed a general election on 29 November, which extended Fianna Fáil's lead in the Dáil. Fine Gael came third, behind the left-wing and nationalist Sinn Féin, the largest opposition party. The Greens were almost completely wiped out, forcing the other two parties to find a new third partner to secure a majority. Though nominated by the Dáil, Martin remains only Taoiseach-elect until President Michael D. Higgins formally appoints him. Martin will visit the president's official residence, Áras an Uachtaráin, later in the day to receive the appointment. Martin will then officially be Taoiseach, replacing Harris. After that, Martin will appoint ministers and return to the Dáil with his cabinet for a final vote on the new government. Donohoe returns Eurogroup President Paschal Donohoe, a Fine Gael TD, is expected to become finance minister once again, while retaining his Eurogroup role. Donohoe served as finance minister during 2017-2022, then relinquished the job to Fianna Fáil's Michael McGrath, under the terms of the previous coalition agreement. McGrath left the government last year to become the EU's justice commissioner. Before the two parties first entered into a formal coalition after the 2020 election, Fianna Fáil propped up a minority Fine Gael government during 2016-2020 in a 'confidence and supply' deal.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWevQfbsFzkDc5ibOcf0B442	2025-01-23T16:51:52-08:00	
Trump Knows Ukraine Conflict Means Nuclear WWIII, Gives Peace A C...	The chances of a peace deal in Ukraine are suddenly a lot higher under President Donald Trump only because he has a realistic sense of a nuclear Third World War happening between the United States and Russia if that conflict is not ended promptly. Peter Kuznick, an esteemed American professor of history, says that the Biden administration brought the world closer to a nuclear conflagration than at any time since the Cuban Missile Crisis in 1962. Biden did this by relentlessly arming Ukraine with weapons to strike deeper and deeper into Russia instead of trying to find a peaceful resolution to the conflict. Indeed, there was no diplomatic effort from Washington under Biden. It was ideologically and propaganda-driven for confrontation, as was the Democratic presidential candidate, Kamala Harris. Kuznick points out that Trump is no John F Kennedy in terms of the latter’s depth of historical and philosophical knowledge. But in comparison with Joe Biden, Trump has shown more humanity and common sense by not insulting Putin and in reaching out for a peaceful end to the slaughter in Ukraine. Biden called Putin a thug and said he would back Ukraine as long as it takes to defeat Russia. The last Democrat administration spent $175 billion of U.S. taxpayers’ money propping up a NeoNazi regime in Kiev that has lost over one million military casualties since the war erupted in February 2022. By contrast, newly inaugurated President Trump says that he wants to meet Russian leader Vladimir Putin as a priority to find a peaceful way out of the conflict and to avoid a catastrophic escalation between nuclear powers. Putin has welcomed a meeting with the new president and said he appreciates the urgent concern to avoid a nuclear disaster. Kuznick is author of The Untold History of the United States, which was coauthored with acclaimed film director Oliver Stone. The book was turned into an award-winning television series aired on Showtime, Netflix and other channels. Kuznick deplores the way the U.S. and NATO partners undermined international security by expanding on Russia’s borders despite earlier promises to the Soviet leaders that would not happen. If peace is to be found in Ukraine, it must be based on a bigger picture of lasting global security that considers all nations’ concerns. That means the United States must treat Russia’s national security concerns over NATO’s expansion seriously and respectfully. Can the Trump administration deliver? It is packed with hawkish figures like Secretary of State Marco Rubio. Donald Trump is better placed than the Biden adminstration to cut a deal with Russia for peace in Ukraine and thereby avoid nuclear disaster, says Kuznick. Trump’s cabinet is filled with billionaires and his mercurial, superficial understanding of the world can be deprecated. Maybe his peaceful aspirations are muddled and not feasible given that Trump is surrounded by hawkish figures. But at least he is willing to give peace a chance with Russia over Ukraine. That alone makes Trump a welcome change from the vile warmongering of Biden and his would-be successor Kamala Harris.

US Moves To Redesignate Iran-Backed Houthis As Foreign Terrorist ...	(RFE/RL) -- The United States has begun the process to again declare the Iran-backed Huthi rebel group of Yemen as a foreign terrorist organization (FTO), restoring the designation President Donald Trump set out during his first term. 'Supported by Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps Quds Force, which arms and trains terrorist organizations worldwide, the Huthis have fired at U.S. Navy warships dozens of times since 2023, endangering American men and women in uniform,' a White House statement said on January 22. The statement also referred to the Huthis as Ansar Allah, the name used by the extremist group that has since the 1990s battled the internationally recognized Yemeni government, which is supported by a Saudi-led military coalition. Trump's declaration sets in motion a process that will likely conclude within 45 days to officially designate the Huthis as a foreign terrorist organization under U.S. legislation. During his first term, Trump had designated the Huthis as an FTO, but the action was reversed by the Biden administration over concerns such a listing could prevent desperately needed aid from reaching Yemen. President Joe Biden did later label the group as a specially designated global terrorist entity, a slightly lower level of sanctioning. The latest move, one of Trump's first in his second term in the field of foreign relations, could be an initial step in the 'maximum pressure' campaign his team has vowed to renew against Iran, which it blames for supporting extremist activity in the Middle East. Huthi rebels in 2014 seized much of Yemen's northwest and its capital, Sanaa, leading to a war that has killed tens of thousands of people and created a humanitarian nightmare in the Arab world's poorest country. Many observers described the hostilities as a 'proxy war' between Saudi- and Iranian-led groups. 'Since seizing most Yemeni population centers by force from the legitimate Yemeni government in 2014-2015, the Huthis have launched numerous attacks on civilian infrastructure, including multiple attacks on civilian airports in Saudi Arabia, the deadly January 2022 attacks on the United Arab Emirates, and more than 300 projectiles fired at Israel since October 2023,' the White House statement said. 'The Huthis have also attacked commercial vessels transiting Bab al-Mandeb more than 100 times, killing at least four civilian sailors and forcing some Red Sea maritime commercial traffic to reroute, which has contributed to global inflation.' The statement added that the rebel group’s activities 'threaten the security of American civilians and personnel in the Middle East, the safety of our closest regional partners, and the stability of global maritime trade.' The Huthis stepped up attacks on shipping in the Gulf region and fired missiles toward Israel, claiming it was in support of Gaza's Hamas movement, which has also been declared a terrorist organization by the United States and European Union. The actions brought air strikes by the U.S. and Israeli militaries, but the rebels recently have appeared to pull back on their attacks since the cease-fire in Gaza was reached.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWevQfbsFzkDc6GEg7ObxiL7	2025-01-23T16:45:09-08:00	
The End Of American Democracy? – OpEd	Donald Trump cares little about democracy, except in the most utilitarian sense. For Trump, democracy is a ladder that he can use to ascend to power. He is not interested in promoting democracy abroad or strengthening democracy at home. He cares only about power: corporate, presidential, national. Before Trump, presidents frequently promoted U.S. democracy overseas, despite its obvious design flaws: elections won by candidates who lost the popular vote, wealthy people buying seats in Congress, redistricting to favor a particular party, a system dominated by two parties. There won’t be any democracy promotion under Donald Trump. In his second inaugural, Trump promised to promote American power, not American principles. 'We will bring prices down, fill our strategic reserves up again, right to the top, and export American energy all over the world,' he trumpeted. He promised to push American cars and promote the U.S. military, not least of which to retake the Panama Canal. It’s no great loss perhaps that the United States will be suspending its official democracy promotion. Other countries are better positioned to that kind of work. The South Korean people, for instance, impeached their leader Yoon Suk-yeol when he declared martial law, something the U.S. Congress failed to do twice with Donald Trump when he overstepped the law. A number of European countries have achieved a much higher level of civic participation and a lower amount of economic inequality than you’ll find in the United States. The problem for the foreseeable future lies not with the exported version of U.S. democracy. It’s what Trump will do to American democracy at home. Trump is a convicted felon who attempted to remain in power even after he lost the 2020 election. The case against him for breaking the law to stay in the White House was likely strong enough to result in a conviction. Avoiding prison was perhaps the chief motivation for Trump to win the 2024 elections. His victory led to the dismissal of the case. To avoid a prison sentence, Trump resorted to lies, distortions, and threats to win the 2024 election. He also relied on the deep pockets of billionaire Elon Musk to sponsor deceptive ads and buy votes in swing states. If he had lost the 2024 election, Trump was fully prepared to tear the country apart in an effort to prove that the election had been 'stolen.' He did win, of course, though with only 49.9 percent of the vote, the smallest margin of victory in nearly 60 years. Day One Dictator Trump promised to be a dictator for his first day in office. It’s no surprise, then, that he issued the most executive orders of any president on inauguration day. Executive action is nothing new. Both Democrats and Republicans have collaborated in expanding the powers of the presidency. But Trump has gone beyond what other presidents have done, or instance to challenge the U.S. Constitution itself by declaring an end to birthright citizenship. He also pardoned the January 6 insurrectionists, which sends a disturbing message to the citizenry about the lack of consequences for those who attack the federal government. Trump will also take a chainsaw to government—cutting the regulatory agencies that implement policy and keep Americans safe. Democracy, in the modern world, requires state power. By cutting back on federal authority, Trump will empower instead conservative states, corporations, and religious institutions. The MAGA revolution is all about destroying public institutions, like government-mandated health insurance. Eliminating the Department of Education will only further undermine what religious institutions and hardline conservatives have been pushing for years: the expansion of private schools at the expense of public education. Although Trump pitched himself as the hero of the 'working man,' he has on the contrary created a Kremlin-like oligarchy around himself. Elon Musk is only the richest and most prominent of the dozen billionaires that Trump has selected for his cabinet. Other oligarchs, like Amazon’s Jeff Bezos and Meta’s Mark Zuckerberg, have scrambled to curry favor with the returning president, turning such sycophancy into an astute investment decision. America’s richest people expect to grow their wealth exponentially under Trump. After all, Musk himself made $170 billion just since Election Day, a few short months ago. U.S. democracy has long been deformed by the influence of the wealthy. But now the playing field, under Trump, will tilt so dramatically that all but the richest will simply tumble off the edge. Democracy in America has been around for over 200 years. Surely one man, no matter how many super-wealthy people he gathers in his circle, cannot unravel such an august institution. Democracy survived Trump’s first term. Surely, it will survive the abuses of his second. Or will it? Coup vs Civil War The challenge that Trump poses lies not just in the policies he promotes, the public institutions he defunds and delegitimizes, or the wealth he redistributes upward. The new president threatens the very fabric of the country. The handover of power went smoothly after the last election because the losing party respects the rule of law. But the erosion of democratic norms under Trump suggests that the next presidential election in 2028 will not go as smoothly. An even more elderly Trump might defy the U.S. constitution—and its two-term limit for presidents—and stay in office under some contrived state of emergency. Or he might usher his hand-picked successor into the White House in a similarly autocratic fashion. The best-case scenario, of course, would be a democratic election in 2028. But let’s say Trump’s successor loses. Trump has effectively said that any election that doesn’t go his way is illegitimate. Should a Trump-inspired uprising take place in 2028 to challenge a 'stolen election,' it will be much better planned and executed than the one on January 6, 2021, just as Trump’s second term is much more organized than the first. Such a nation-wide insurrection following any disputed election outcome could unravel an already divided United States. So, the worst-case scenario for the United States is a coup and the best-case scenario is a civil war? That does not bode well for American democracy. What to Do? The only way to avoid these scenarios of coup or civil war is to strengthen democratic institutions even as Trump tries to destroy them. This is no easy feat. The obvious strategy is to bolster democracy at a state or local level, particularly in areas that did not vote for Trump. This makes a lot of sense, but it will, inevitably, deepen the divide between red and blue states and encourage the very civil-war dynamic it’s urgent to forestall. Building up the capacity of California or Chicago to fend off authoritarian power grabs from a federal bureaucracy commandeered by Trump will necessarily absorb a lot of the time and energy of the mainstream resistance. It will also put anti-MAGA forces on the defensive as they scramble to file lawsuits to stop Trump’s actions. But the only sustainable way to strengthen U.S. democracy is to build a movement that includes a lot of the voters who supported Trump. They voted for the current president because they wanted change. They didn’t vote for rule by the rich. It’s often said that American democracy is being undermined by the wealthy and their capacity to buy elections. Now, paradoxically, it’s the presence of a dozen billionaires in Trump’s inner circle that may save democracy—by fueling the wrath of the disenfranchised and prompting them to support an alternative to MAGA. Anger over a government of the rich, by the rich, and for the rich will make it more likely that any future lies about a 'strong leader' and a 'stolen election' will fall on deaf ears. It’s just a question of what political entity will mobilize that anger and turn it into an electoral force.

Our Ability To Think In Terms Of Numbers Is Universal, Abstract, ...	Most people learn to count and do basic arithmetic at a young age and don't give these skills a second thought. But numerosity or numeracy, the ability to think about and use numbers, is more than a basic skill: It is what underlies the human power of abstraction, metaphor, symbolism, and the essence of thought. The connection of numerosity to language and culture is a fascinating topic. Scientific research has shown that even cultures that only use numbers up to 2 or 3 are able to master using larger numbers when they are taught the language required. Advanced imaging technologies have enabled scientists to look at areas of the brain cortex connected to particular math skills. The frontoparietal region of the brain has been identified as the location for coordinating goal-directed tasks. How old human numerosity is, how numbers are connected to language or abstraction, and whether animals have numerosity are subjects of debate in the scientific community. I interviewed Frederick L. Coolidge, a professor of psychology, who specializes in cognitive archaeology and has written broadly on the subject. Coolidge has taught at the University of Colorado, Colorado Springs, since 1979 and co-directs its Center for Cognitive Archaeology. He argues that humans are not the only species to have numerosity, that numerosity does not require language, and that it expresses itself culturally. Marjorie Hecht: How old do you think numerosity is, and why? Frederick L. Coolidge: Because monkeys possess the capacity for numerosity, and we have a common ancestor with monkeys about 25 to 30 million years ago, this suggests that numerosity has a very ancient origin. Why? Because evolutionarily it must have been important for the earliest primates, who appeared about 60 million years ago, to be able to distinguish quickly among one, two, or three things. Further, we are descendants of this primate lineage. This ability, subitization, is one of the two core processes in numerosity. Imagine an ancient primate facing a predator or more than one. They would be at a distinct advantage if they could immediately (as if without overt conscious thinking) take on a single predator as opposed to three! Imagine if they sat there thinking, 'Hmm, should I go this way to take on this one predator or should I go that way and take on three predators' (assuming of course, there was no other recourse). The second core process of numerosity is an analog set of comparisons, that is, distinguishing quickly between a small set and a large set of things (any number of things). Again, imagine an ancient primate trying to decide between a tree with 25 apples versus 50 apples. The ability to quickly distinguish the tree with more apples might be invaluable due to competition with other animals. MH: Is numerosity inherently abstract? FLC: Yes, because if oneness, twoness, and threeness can be applied to any type of things, be they tangible like apples or intangible like angels, numerosity is the essence of abstractive thinking. Therefore, because numbers can be applied to any thing, it is this capacity that underlies abstractive thinking. As the British mathematician A. N. Whitehead (1911) wrote: '... the leading characteristic of mathematics [is] that it deals with properties and ideas which are applicable to things just because they are things, and apart from any particular feelings, or emotions, or sensations.... This is what is meant by calling mathematics an abstract science.' Further, abstraction in numerosity may give rise to the modern advanced characteristics of language, including analogizing and metaphorizing. Why is 'love is a rose' so easily understood? Notice that the properties of a tangible thing like a rose we can readily understand and apply to an intangible abstract concept of love. One minor problem with analogies and metaphors is where do the similarities stop. In class, I made students ponder the problem of nitrogen-fixing bacteria in a rose's roots and how that would apply to love. The value of metaphorization is not only a transfer of knowledge but also the creation of novel ideas. MH: Is numerosity independent of language? FLC: Monkeys and human infants (as young as 8 months old) have the capacity for numerosity. Therefore, it is independent of the faculty of language. Numerosity arises from neurons genetically dedicated to its two core processes, which are located in the lower parietal lobe—specifically the intraparietal sulcus—both in humans and nonhuman primates like monkeys. I can find no coherent argument that numerosity requires language, sorry. It would be like wasting your time arguing evolution with a creationist. MH: Does numerosity express itself culturally? FLC: Yes, the capacity for numerosity may be older than primates, reptiles, and maybe even flatworms that emerged 545 million years ago—and I am not merely being facetious. There is simply not a lot of grant money for the study of numerosity in amphioxus and planaria, but there should be. I propose that basic mathematics and then advanced higher math (algebra, calculus, etc.) were built upon the foundation of numerosity. As soon as language became more elaborate with lots of words for things, it was as easy to name the subitization core process of oneness, twoness, and threeness. [Subitization is the ability to determine the number of elements in a set without counting.] In fact, it was as easy as one, two, three; ek, do, teen [Hindi]; eins, zwei, drei [German]. Interestingly, the Pirahã tribe in the Amazon have only the number words for one, two, and many (again the three-thing limit for subitization). So, as soon as we hominins had words for 1, 2, and 3, we figured out there could be words for numbers and then words for amounts greater than that. But subitization got us started. Then advanced math took off yet got its start from that foundation. When humans could ponder their existence, they could ponder and witness death. This death anxiety wasn't easily relieved. We needed a very powerful rationalization to overcome this major existential anxiety. So, we created gods, typically a single god: God, Allah, Buddha, Brahma, etc. Notice, only one god, expressed by numerosity's (subitization's) oneness. We didn't need more to relieve our death anxiety as one god giving us immortal life is sufficient. Also, notice that the concept of a heaven always accompanies the concept of a god because death anxiety is the chief reason for the conception of a god. However, subitization subtly expresses itself by urging us to think of twoness and threeness. Thus, Hinduism has one God, Brahma, but three forms, Brahma, Vishnu, and Shiva. Christianity has God, the Son, and the Holy Ghost. Even in comedy, we have three (the Three Stooges) because the limit of subitization appears to be three things. In summary, does numerosity express itself culturally? God, yes! About the author: Marjorie Hecht is a longtime magazine editor and writer with a specialty in science topics.

Beijing Opaque On Its Travel Ban Against Rubio	By Alex Willemyns Chinese officials remain tight-lipped about how they plan to carry out diplomacy with the United States while America’s top diplomat, Marco Rubio, remains officially sanctioned for critical comments he made about Beijing’s treatment of Uyghurs and Hong Kong in 2020. Rubio, formerly a Republican senator from Florida, was hit with retaliatory sanctions for 'interfering' in China’s domestic affairs by criticizing its 2019 crackdown in Hong Kong and what the U.S. government calls a 'genocide' against ethnic Uyghurs in the far northwestern Xinjiang region. Under China’s Anti-Foreign Sanctions Law, that puts Rubio on a travel ban list, potentially complicating U.S.-Chinese diplomacy. Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Mao Ning was ambiguous at a briefing on Thursday when asked whether Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi would speak with Rubio by telephone given the sanctions. 'I have no information to share on your question,' Mao said, before adding that Beijing still thought engagement was important. 'Let me say more broadly that it’s necessary for high-level Chinese and U.S. officials to engage each other in appropriate ways,' she said. 'In the meantime, China will firmly defend its national interests.' On Monday, Rubio was confirmed as U.S. President Donald Trump’s secretary of state after stating at his Senate confirmation hearing that he believes China is the 'biggest threat' to America’s security. He also nodded to his fraught ties with China during the hearing. 'Indeed, I’ve been strongly worded in my views of China,' Rubio said. 'Let me just point out they’ve said mean things about me too.' What’s in a name? In the aftermath of his confirmation, Chinese official state documents referring to Rubio appeared to change the Chinese characters used to transcribe his name, leading to suggestions Beijing might be attempting to skirt the sanctions and travel ban by renaming Rubio in Chinese. However, the Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson seemingly put the kibosh on that account at an earlier press briefing Wednesday, telling a reporter she was 'not yet aware' of his name being written differently. 'If you ask me, instead of how his name is translated in Chinese, it’s his actual name in English that is more important,' Mao said. 'What I can tell you is that China’s sanctions are aimed at the words and actions that harm China’s legitimate rights and interests.' The Chinese Embassy in Washington was also opaque when asked by Radio Free Asia about the sanctions, travel ban and name change. 'China will firmly defend national interests,' spokesperson Liu Pengyu said. 'In the meantime, it’s necessary for high-level Chinese and American officials to maintain contact in an appropriate way.' The U.S. State Department told RFA only that Rubio did 'not have any travel to announce at this time.' It otherwise declined to comment on the sanctions and the new secretary’s apparent Chinese name change. 'Secretary Rubio looks forward to promoting American safety, security and prosperity through his engagements with China and other countries throughout the region,' a spokesperson said. Sanctions diplomacy It’s not the first time sanctions have complicated U.S.-China ties. From March to October 2023, Li Shangfu served as China’s defense minister while subject to U.S. sanctions issued in 2018 for purchasing banned Russian missile systems when he was a lieutenant general. Li’s tenure came at a nadir for U.S.-China ties and saw the Chinese defense minister and the rest of China’s military refuse any direct contact with their American counterparts, leading to public complaints from then-U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin in June 2023. But Li was sacked by President Xi Jinping in October 2023 –- and later expelled from the Chinese Communist Party altogether –- a month before Xi and then-U.S. President Joe Biden’s summit in San Francisco, where military-to-military contact was re-established.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWevQfbsFzkDc8aXxAyuUs_h	2025-01-23T16:26:31-08:00	
Trump Administration: Manila Still Has Washington’s ‘Ironclad’ Ba...	By Jason Gutierrez The newly installed Trump administration has quickly reaffirmed America’s strong support for the Philippines in the face of an increasingly aggressive China in the disputed South China Sea, despite doubts to the contrary voiced by some observers. In a call with Filipino counterpart Enrique Manalo on Wednesday (Manila time), U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio said that Washington remained committed to Manila’s defense amid tensions with Beijing over the waterway. It marked the first time an inducted official in President Donald Trump’s cabinet had expressed full-throated backing on the security issue affecting the Philippines. Among the concerns that Rubio and Manalo discussed was China’s 'dangerous and destabilizing actions in the South China Sea,' State Department spokesperson Tammy Bruce said in a statement. 'Secretary Rubio conveyed that [China’s] behavior undermines regional peace and stability and is inconsistent with international law,' she said. 'The Secretary underscored the United States’ ironclad commitments to the Philippines under our Mutual Defense Treaty.' The assurance by the new top American diplomat comes amid worries by some security experts that President Trump might pay less attention to Southeast Asia, particularly the Philippines, which has been working to shore up international support against China in the contested waters. China lays claim to almost the entire South China Sea, but its claims overlap with those of the Philippines, Brunei, Malaysia, Vietnam, and Taiwan. Over the past few months, Manila and Beijing faced off in a series of confrontations at sea. Signed in 1951, the treaty commits both the U.S. and the Philippines to come to each other’s aid in times of external attacks. Under Trump’s predecessor, Joe Biden, Washington said that the scenario included armed attacks in the South China Sea. However, that did not prevent China from carrying out activities in the region. Recently, Beijing dispatched Chinese Coast Guard ship 5901 – the world’s largest coast guard vessel – to waters within the Philippines’ exclusive economic zone (EEZ). On X, Manalo said he and Rubio discussed the importance of the alliance between Manila and Washington for the 'prosperity and security' of the region. 'We look forward to working with Secretary Rubio and his team towards addressing challenges and sustaining the momentum and positive trajectory in our bilateral relations,' Manalo said. Rubio’s call with Manalo occurred after the new secretary of state met with his counterparts from Australia, India, and Japan in Washington on Tuesday, a day after Trump returned to the White House. The United States and the three countries form the so-called 'Quad' grouping, revived under the first Trump presidency. It was considered a pillar of the Biden administration’s efforts to counter China, which regarded the grouping as a U.S. tool to ensure American global hegemony. In the Quad meeting, the four nations reaffirmed their commitment to a 'free and open Indo-Pacific' region and 'strong opposition to unilateral attempts to change the status quo by force including in the East and South China Seas,' according to a statement by the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Takeshi Iwaya, Japan’s top diplomat, also met separately with Rubio where they discussed several issues, including the importance of 'further developing coordination of like-minded countries,' such as the trilateral alliance of Tokyo, Washington, and Manila. During his confirmation hearing last week, Rubio called China’s actions in the region 'deeply destabilizing' and urged the nation against making anything 'rash or irrational' towards the Philippines and Taiwan. 'In the last 48 hours, there’s this massive, I don’t even know how to describe it, but this massive ship that the Chinese have built that’s like headed towards the Philippines. And the Philippines feels threatened by it. Rightfully so. We’ve seen this on a daily basis, the harassment and so forth, but on a daily basis,' Rubio said. '[China really needs] to stop messing around with Taiwan and the Philippines because it’s forcing us to focus our attention in ways we prefer not to have to.' Regarded by analysts as a 'hawk' when it comes to policy relations with China, Rubio, a former Republican senator from Florida and son of Cuban immigrants, has been blacklisted by Beijing in retaliation for U.S. sanctions on Chinese officials over China’s treatment of the Uyghur ethnic minority and its handling of Hong Kong. Reacting to Rubio’s call with Manalo, Beijing on Thursday said that Washington was 'not a party' to the dispute and that Chinese activities in the region were 'legitimate, lawful, and fully justified.' 'The U.S. is not a party to the South China Sea issue and has no right to interfere in the maritime issues between China and the Philippines,' said Chinese foreign ministry spokeswoman Mao Ning. ‘Renewed commitment’ under Trump administration On Wednesday, Philippine Defense Secretary Gilberto Teodoro Jr. met with U.S. National Security Adviser Mike Waltz to discuss the two nations’ 'enduring alliance,' according to the Filipino official’s office. The meeting 'marked a significant step in further advancing the decades-long alliance between the Philippines and the United States, signaling a renewed commitment to collaboration under the Trump administration,' said Filipino defense spokesman Arsenio Andolong. The meeting, held at the White House, occurred two days after Trump took office. The Philippines, through Teodoro, was among the first countries to engage the new U.S. administration and discuss security matters, Andolong said. 'Waltz and his team underscored the need to enhance cooperation with the Philippines and looked forward to increasing mutual security activities in support of a free and global Indo-Pacific, an initiative dating back to Trump’s first presidency,' he also said. Last week, the Armed Forces of the Philippines and the U.S. Navy staged joint maneuvers in Manila’s EEZ within South China Sea waters, their first this calendar year. Jojo Riñoza and Jeoffrey Maitem in Manila contributed to this report.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWevQfbsFzkDc4-1QJZwmBIV	2025-01-23T16:22:19-08:00	
Trump Promises Global Businesses Lower Taxes For Products Made In...	By Ken Bredemeier U.S. President Donald Trump on Thursday invited global businesses to manufacture their products in the U.S. and promised them lower taxes but warned if they choose to produce their goods elsewhere, they would have to pay tariffs to export them to the United States. 'America is back and open for business,' Trump, in a video linkup from Washington, told corporate leaders meeting at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. 'My message to every business in the world is very simple: Come make your product in America, and we will give you among the lowest taxes of any nation on Earth,' Trump said. 'But if you don't make your product in America, which is your prerogative, then, very simply, you will have to pay a tariff.' Trump, three days into his second term in the White House, said he wants to cut the U.S. corporate tax rate from 21 to 15%, although that needs approval from his political allies in the Republican-controlled Congress. Lawmakers have begun debating how to extend and reshape personal and corporate tax cuts enacted in 2017 during Trump's first term in office. Trump promised the U.S. would supply Europe with the liquified natural gas it needs but contended that the European Union treats the United States 'very, very unfairly' with the extent of regulations it imposes on American businesses operating in the 27-nation bloc. The president complained specifically about tariffs and environmental impact statements for new construction projects, calling them 'things you shouldn't have to do.' Trump promised that his administration would make the U.S., already the world's biggest economy, 'a manufacturing superpower' and said the government during his four-year term would eliminate 10 business regulations for every new one that is imposed. He said he plans to ask Saudi Arabia and the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries to cut the price of oil they produce to boost the global economy. He contended that if the current global oil price — about $77 a barrel — is cut, 'the war in Ukraine will end immediately.' Russia uses revenue from its own oil production to help fund its three-year war on neighboring Ukraine. Trump said that in the global economy, the U.S. 'just wants to be treated fairly by other countries.' He said the U.S. wants to have a 'fair relationship' with China, the world's second-biggest economy. 'We don't want to take advantage,' he said of Washington-Beijing relations. 'We just want to have a level playing field.'	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWevQfbsFzkDc9NrfgDu0Uzz	2025-01-23T16:15:50-08:00	
Aoun Urges UNHCR Chief To Organize Return Of Syrian Refugees	By Najia Houssari Lebanese President Joseph Aoun called on the UNHCR’s commissioner, Filippo Grandi, to 'start organizing return convoys for the displaced Syrians in Lebanon.' Aoun said Lebanon 'can no longer support the burden resulting from their presence at different levels.' He called on the international community to provide material and humanitarian support to achieve the return of displaced Syrians. Some countries have already started their support, he added. Grandi visited Aoun at the Presidential Palace to congratulate him on his election. During the meeting, the president affirmed that Lebanon 'wants the return of Syrian refugees to their country as soon as possible, especially since the reasons for their displacement no longer exist.' Aoun, who also met with Prime Minister-designate Nawaf Salam, tackled the infiltration of several Syrians into Lebanon following the developments in the neighboring country. He emphasized 'the importance of working to stop infiltration on both sides of the Lebanese-Syrian border.' Citing UNHCR estimations, Grandi said that more than 200,000 displaced Syrians had returned to their country from Lebanon, Syria, Jordan, and other countries since the fall of the former Syrian regime on Dec. 8. Many others also wish to return home, he added. He added that a survey conducted by the UNHCR showed that the number of those wishing to return had increased from about 1 percent to 30 percent in a matter of weeks. Grandi affirmed that the UNHCR was 'supporting those who returned and that we have already started doing so.' He said the UNHCR’s relationship with the new authorities across Syria was constructive, and they had started prioritizing the issue. Grandi said UNHCR wanted to work with Lebanon to build a practical way to support the return of Syrians. To achieve this, the president can play a vital role with the international community, he added. After the meeting Grandi explained that his visits to Lebanon, Syria, Jordan, and Turkiye aim to 'discuss the issue of Syrian refugees, particularly in light of recent political changes in Syria. 'We believe that these changes may allow refugees to return to their home country and leave their host nations, including Lebanon, which has hosted them with great generosity and patience for nearly 14 years.' He added: 'During the most recent war in Lebanon, between September and October, over 450,000 Syrian refugees returned to Syria. 'We believe that, with the return of this significant number of Syrian refugees, sustained support is crucial to ensure their permanent return. 'Therefore, we began implementing a program designed to support returnees from different countries by offering material assistance and other means of support. 'Material support is essential, as well as efforts to restore life in the areas where refugees are resettling,' he said. 'Otherwise, they will leave again, most probably to their host countries. 'It is important to note that the new Syrian authorities have welcomed the Syrian refugees back, which is a positive sign,' Grandi said. 'However, the new authorities must stay on course — respecting minorities, preserving the rights of all citizens, and lifting Syria to new horizons that rebuild trust among Syrians, including returning refugees,' he added. Grandi held talks as Lebanese military authorities prepared for the withdrawal of Israeli forces following their incursion into southern Lebanon since Oct. 1. The 60-day stage of the ceasefire deal is set to expire at dawn on Sunday. In a meeting with acting Lebanese Army Commander Maj.-Gen. Hassan Odeh, caretaker Defense Minister Maurice Slim underlined Lebanon’s 'firm commitment to the withdrawal of the Israeli forces within the agreed deadline in the ceasefire agreement.' Slim’s office stated that the discussion focused on the deployment of the Lebanese Army in all the areas from which the Israeli forces would withdraw. Slim said the army was ready to be deployed in throughout the region. The Lebanese Army entered the border town of Kafr Shuba in the eastern sector. Units had been stationed on the outskirts of the town, facing Al-Sammaqa, an Israeli military site. Other units have been deployed in Hanin, where Civil Defense teams recovered the bodies of several Hezbollah fighters. Also on Thursday, the Israeli military destroyed rest facilities on the banks of the Wazzani River, and eight houses in the town of Taybeh were deliberately burned. Video footage was taken by dozens of residents returning to their villages after the Lebanese Army deployed there, showing the extent of the destruction of property and facilities, especially in the town of Khiyam. The Israeli military claimed that 'forces of the 810th Brigade, operating under the command of the 210th Division, found and seized a large number of weapons in the Shebaa Farms, including anti-tank launchers, rocket launchers, machine guns, binoculars, and rockets aimed at Israeli territory.' In a statement, the Israeli military said that 'the forces of the 7th Brigade, operating under the command of the 91st Division, are continuing their activities in southern Lebanon to protect Israel's security.' It claimed that 'they are operating under the understandings reached between Israel and Lebanon while maintaining compliance with the conditions of the ceasefire agreement.' Israel’s outgoing ambassador to the US, Michael Herzog, claimed that talks were being held with the administration of President Donald Trump to extend the withdrawal date from Lebanon scheduled for next Sunday. The Trump administration is pressuring Israel to withdraw from Lebanon in accordance with the scheduled date on Sunday, the Israeli Army Radio reported.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWevQfbsFzkDc7mi2KhiYMmk	2025-01-23T16:10:09-08:00	
NATO Secretary General At Davos: We Have To Change The Trajectory...	On Wednesday 22 and Thursday 23 January NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte attended the World Economic Forum in Davos. Speaking at a breakfast held in support of Ukraine, hosted by The Victor Pinchuk Foundation and Yalta European Strategy, Mr Rutte underlined that a win for Putin would be a defeat for freedom, security and global stability. 'We really have to step up and not scale back the support for Ukraine. We have to change the trajectory of the war,' he insisted adding that any deal that pleased Russia, China, Iran and North Korea would not bring peace but make the world a darker place. The Secretary General went on to emphasise the vital need for Europeans to ramp up defence investment and production, noting that this is crucial to allowing NATO to deter aggression and ensure our collective defence into the future. The Secretary General also spoke at a plenary event on ‘Technology in the world’ about the role innovation plays in meeting global challenges. Mr Rutte made clear that harnessing technology and increasing investment in defence is key to keeping the one billion people living in NATO countries safe. He also called on NATO Allies to be faster and fiercer in shifting to a wartime mindset saying 'speed is of the essence'.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWevQfbsFzkDc3VFsszcuGR2	2025-01-23T16:08:10-08:00	
Thousands Of European Citizen Scientists Helped Identify Shifts I...	The results of cowslip observations carried out with the help of citizen scientists from 32 countries in over 5,200 locations shed light on the well-being of insect-pollinated plants under changing climate and land use conditions. The study was made possible thanks to the contribution of European science enthusiasts. It revealed some surprising results recently published in the Journal of Ecology, one of the longest-standing top-level journals in this field. The cowslip (Primula veris) is considered a model species for studying insect-pollinated plants. Cowslips can have two types of flowers: long-styled (L-morph) and short-styled (S-morph). In L-morph flowers, the stamens are at the base of the corolla, and the style is tall, making self-pollination difficult. In S-morph flowers, the style is short, the anthers are high, and self-pollination is easier. Different floral morphs have evolved in many plant species to prevent self-pollination and facilitate cross-pollination by insects. Generally, the proportion of short-styled S-morphs and long-styled L-morphs should be fairly equal in a viable plant population. However, in many cowslip populations observed across Europe, a significant imbalance and a marked predominance of S-morph flowers were noted. There were 9% more S-morphs than L-morphs. In smaller populations, the imbalance in flower types was more frequent, irrespective of the floral morph. Further analysis of climate and land use data revealed that the higher prevalence of the S-morphs was associated with greater summer precipitation and more intensive land use. Previous studies have shown that the unequal proportion of flower types is one of the risk factors that can lead to species extinction. According to the study’s lead author, Tsipe Aavik, Associate Professor in Macroecology at the University of Tartu, these are very surprising results offering plenty of material for further research. Aavik said that similar results were obtained a few years ago from observations made as part of the citizen science initiative in Estonia, but at the time, the shifts were attributed to Estonia being at the northern edge of the cowslip distribution range. 'This study confirmed that the balance of the floral morphs is, in fact, disrupted across Europe, so this change is much more meaningful,' said Aavik. The researchers speculate that this may be a step on the evolutionary path helping plants cope with various environmental changes – the loss and fragmentation of suitable habitats, changes in pollinator diversity and composition, and a warmer and wetter climate. According to Aavik, the Europe-wide cowslip observation is only the first step in testing this hypothesis. During the international cowslip campaign, University of Tartu researchers invited people across Europe to observe cowslips and share their observation data in the springs of 2021 and 2022. During the citizen science project, which started in Estonia in 2019, observations were made in more than 8,000 locations across Europe, and nearly 900,000 cowslips were examined over four years.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWevQfbsFzkDc2NqeJq5hArn	2025-01-23T16:05:47-08:00	
Trump Pardons 23 Pro-Life Activists	By Zelda Caldwell and Tyler Arnold President Donald Trump issued pardons for 23 pro-life activists on Thursday, fulfilling a promise he made during the presidential campaign. Trump signed the pardons on Thursday in the Oval Office of the White House on the day before the March for Life to be held in Washington, D.C., according to the Thomas More Society. Last week, the religious liberty law firm petitioned the incoming president to issue 21 individual pardons for pro-life advocates who were arrested for violating the federal Freedom of Access to Clinic Entrances (FACE) Act and 'Conspiracy Against Rights' statute while peacefully engaging in protests at abortion clinics. Several of those convicted and imprisoned were elderly and in poor health. At least two times during his 2024 campaign for the presidency, Trump said he intended to release pro-life activists who are currently imprisoned. 'These peaceful pro-life Americans mistreated by [President Joe] Biden include grandparents, pastors, a Holocaust survivor, and a Catholic priest — all are selfless, sincere patriots,' the petition from the Chicago-based law firm reads. During Biden’s four years in office, the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) brought charges against more than 30 people who took part in pro-life demonstrations under the FACE Act, which was legislation in the 1990s to increase penalties for people who obstruct access to abortion clinics or pregnancy resource centers. Although the FACE Act’s higher sentences also apply to people who obstruct or damage pro-life pregnancy centers, Biden’s DOJ only brought charges in two cases regarding attacks on those facilities despite more than 100 incidents occurring under his tenure. 'While Biden’s prosecutors almost entirely ignored the firebombing and vandalism of hundreds of pro-life churches and pregnancy centers, they viciously pursued pro-life Americans,' the petition adds. The longest sentence was given last year to Lauren Handy, who received four years and nine months in prison for her role in a protest at an abortion clinic in Washington, D.C. The second longest was also given last year to Bevelyn Beatty Williams, who received three years and five months in prison for a protest inside an abortion clinic in New York City. Several pro-life activists in their mid-to-late 70s also received multiyear sentences for their protests. 'These 21 peaceful pro-lifers, many of whom are currently imprisoned for bravely standing up for unborn life, are upstanding citizens and pillars of their communities,' Steve Crampton, who works as senior counsel for the Thomas More Society, said in a statement.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWevQfbsFzkDc3TBZNnWOJV6	2025-01-23T16:03:39-08:00	
Reforestation Stands Out Among Plant-Based Climate-Mitigation Str...	In the global effort to combat climate change, large-scale, plant-based strategies such as planting forests and cultivating biofuels are an increasingly important part of countries’ plans to reduce their overall carbon emissions, but a landmark new study in the journal Science finds that well-intended strategies could have unforeseen impacts on biodiversity and that, in general, restoring forests has the most beneficial effect on wildlife. The authors, including New York Botanical Garden (NYBG) Assistant Curator Evelyn Beaury, Ph.D., argue that policy makers and conservation officials should consider impacts on biodiversity when evaluating the most effective tools to mitigate climate change. 'As efforts to address climate change accelerate, it is urgent to ensure that in deploying LBMS we do not inadvertently imperil biodiversity,' Dr. Beaury and her colleagues write, using the acronym for land-based mitigation strategies, which use plants to store carbon. Dr. Beaury is an Assistant Curator in NYBG’s Center for Conservation and Restoration Ecology, which is working to expand NYBG’s collaborations with conservation initiatives worldwide; strengthen conservation capacity building, including training future biodiversity leaders; and advance conservation by fostering the sustainable use of plant resources locally and globally. Many net-zero emissions plans call for implementing plant-based mitigation strategies across millions of acres of land. The most common approaches are reforestation (restoring forests in places where they have historically grown), afforestation (adding forests in places like savannahs and grasslands), and bioenergy cropping (farming plants such as switchgrass for renewable energy). Until now, it has been challenging to predict these strategies’ impacts on biodiversity because they affect species in multiple, complex ways. The new study, published online and in the print edition of this week’s Science, is the first of its kind to evaluate the potential biodiversity impacts of those three climate change mitigation strategies globally. The team of scientists—led by Dr. Jeffrey Smith, Ph.D., an Associate Research Scholar at Princeton University’s High Meadows Environmental Institute—modeled the impact of these mitigation strategies on over 14,000 animal species, from creatures smaller than a mouse to larger than a moose. Most countries worldwide, from Austria to Zimbabwe, have committed to using these methods to reach their climate targets. However, as Dr. Beaury notes: 'Plant-based mitigation strategies do not have the same effect on the climate or on biodiversity everywhere they are deployed. Our research suggests that we cannot assume plant-based solutions always indirectly reduce the biodiversity crisis.' The team of scientists—which also included Jonathan Levine, Ph.D., Professor of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology at Princeton, and Susan C. Cook-Patton, Ph.D., Senior Forest Restoration Scientist at The Nature Conservancy—found that reforestation will benefit many species both locally, by increasing habitat, and globally, by mitigating climate change. These include many iconic forest species from spotted salamanders and red-bellied woodpeckers to jaguars. The outcomes for planting monocultures of bioenergy crops or converting natural savannahs and grasslands to forests are not as rosy. While these efforts may help address climate change and reduce climate threats to biodiversity, they will also lead to immediate habitat loss. Replacing biodiverse meadows with bioenergy crops would be hugely detrimental for species from grouse to elk. Similarly, converting savannahs to forests would lead to the decline of iconic species such as ostriches and lions. The study found that the loss of habitat due to afforestation and bioenergy would be far greater than the benefit they would provide to biodiversity by helping mitigate climate change globally. While ecologists have long suspected that some of these interventions would mean less habitat for wildlife, this study provides the first quantitative assessment of the potential impacts. 'Reforestation is an obvious ‘win-win’ for biodiversity,' said Dr. Beaury, an ecologist and biogeographer whose expertise includes invasive plants. 'Restoring lost forest provides habitat as well as reduces the impacts of climate change.'	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWe6O7o_AjFIbXax1fFwdiL_	2025-01-23T15:24:14-08:00	
Imagining The Physics Of George R.R. Martin’s Fictional Universe	Many science fiction authors try to incorporate scientific principles into their work, but Ian Tregillis, who is a contributing author of the Wild Cards book series when he’s not working as a physicist at Los Alamos National Laboratory, took it one step further: He derived a formula to describe the dynamics of the fictional universe’s viral system. In independent research published in the American Journal of Physics, from AIP Publishing, Tregillis and George R.R. Martin derive a formula for viral behavior in the Wild Cards universe. Wild Cards is a science fiction series written by a collection of authors and edited by Martin and Melinda M. Snodgrass. Sitting at over 30 volumes, the books are about an alien virus called the Wild Card that mutates human DNA. Martin is credited as a co-author of the paper, making it his first peer-reviewed physics publication. The idea to explore the science behind the fictional virus came from a series of blog posts on the Wild Cards website. 'Like any physicist, I started with back-of-the-envelope estimates, but then I went off the deep end. Eventually I suggested, only half-jokingly, that it might be easier to write a genuine physics paper than another blog post,' Tregillis said. 'Being a theoretician, I couldn't help but wonder if a simple underlying model might tidy up the canon.' The formula he derived is a Lagrangian formulation, which considers the different ways a system can evolve. It’s also a fundamental physics principle, which also makes the fictional example a powerful teaching tool. Tregillis shared that deriving this physical model was a fun but open-ended puzzle. After some trial and error of models based on fractals or thermodynamic analogies, he and Martin settled on the Lagrangian approach. 'We translated the abstract problem of Wild Card viral outcomes into a simple, concrete dynamical system. The time-averaged behavior of this system generates the statistical distribution of outcomes,' he said. While the Wild Card virus can be modeled by physics, Tregillis emphasized that it isn’t a hard-and-fast rule in the canon. 'Good storytelling is about characters: their wants, needs, obstacles, challenges, and how they interact with their world,' Tregillis said. 'The fictional virus is really just an excuse to justify the world of Wild Cards, the characters who inhabit it, and the plot lines that spin out from their actions.'	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWcdXBYG4F1bd-OUGFZEdowZ	2025-01-23T15:22:16-08:00	
Green Cement: Electric Heating To Contribute To Climate Neutralit...	The cement industry is one of the largest producers of carbon dioxide. It is responsible for up to eight percent of global man-made emissions – almost three times as much as the global air traffic. To reduce this share and become climate-neutral, the industry is relying on technological innovations. The international project 'ECem', in which scientists from the Helmholtz-Zentrum Dresden-Rossendorf (HZDR) are also involved, is pursuing a promising approach. With the help of electric heating technologies for the energy-intensive process of calcination, the partners from science and industry want to drastically reduce CO2 emissions in cement production. The project started in the fall of 2024 and will run for three and a half years. It is funded by the Danish Innovation Fund with 21 million Danish crowns (about 2.8 million euros). Calcination is one of the most important process steps in the production of cement. Limestone is heated to approximately 1450°C in a large furnace and converted into clinker, the main component of cement, by thermal decomposition. This chemical process is responsible for a large proportion of the CO2 emissions released by the cement industry as a whole. Two-thirds of the CO2 is produced during the decomposition of the limestone, a process known as decarbonization, and is therefore unavoidable. The remaining third is due to the enormous energy consumption required to reach the high temperatures. Fossil fuels such as coal or gas are usually used for this purpose. The 'ECem' (Electric calciner technologies for cement plants of the future) research project is now taking on this industrial heating process. The goal is to develop a more climate-friendly alternative. To this end, the project partners, led by the Danish cement company FLSmidth, including the Danish Institute of Technology, the University of Aalborg, the companies European Energy and Cementos Argos, as well as the HZDR, want to develop two different electric heating technologies. Metal balls give limestone the necessary material properties While the Danish partners in the project are working on the development of an infrared radiant heating system, scientists at the HZDR Institute for Fluid Dynamics are researching an electrical solution based on inductive heating. The team first wants to set up a laboratory experiment in which induction coils generate a high-frequency field to heat the material in a container. In a later stage, a rotating kiln will be modeled in a further experimental setup with key data that closely approximates industrial conditions. The challenge is that materials such as limestone, which consists mainly of calcium carbonate, are actually unsuitable for induction heating due to their poor electrical conductivity. To overcome this obstacle, the team wants to mix so-called susceptors into the raw material to be heated. These are components designed to efficiently convert the electric energy into heat and transfer it to the material. An important task is to find the right material that can function robustly as a susceptor at high temperatures and under harsh industrial conditions. Possible candidates must have a high melting point, must not react with the limestone and should be abrasion-resistant. Forming the susceptors into a shape, for example as metal balls, would have the advantage of combining the calcination and grinding processes into a single step. Investments in the electrification of industrial processes could, in addition to avoiding CO2, have further positive effects such as increasing efficiency or improving product quality, thus giving the respective companies a competitive advantage in the global markets. Optimization of gas flows ensures effective heat transport 'At first glance, this project has less to do with the fluid mechanics that we usually deal with at the institute,' explains HZDR engineer Dr. Sven Eckert, head of the Magnetohydrodynamics Department. 'However, this is not just a matter of installing a heater in a reactor. Cement kilns usually process many tons of material, which is why the difficulty lies in creating a homogeneous temperature field throughout the entire kiln. An inductive heater could even exacerbate this problem if it does not guarantee sufficient heat transport that reaches not only the surface layers but also the interior of the huge volume. Therefore, we have to look at the process in principle, including an optimization of convective gas flows in the furnace, which must ensure effective heat transport.' This is where the researchers around Sven Eckert can apply their expertise. At the HZDR, they also have access to unique measuring techniques such as magnetic field tomography, which is ideally suited for monitoring electrified industrial processes. The team also wants to benefit from the experience gained in the EU project CITADEL, which is coordinated by the HZDR and is already in progress. The aim of the ECem project is to validate the technology on a laboratory scale. The data obtained in the planned experiments will be an important input for accompanying computer simulations and the development of digital twins that will map the entire process, including energy and mass flows. On this basis, the scientists want to clarify whether the laboratory experiment can be scaled up to real industrial conditions. If the answer is positive, the partners could start building a pilot plant similar to the industrial version after the project ends in 2028. Depending on the research results, this plant could either include induction heating or radiation heating, which are being developed in parallel – or, which is not unlikely, a combination of both solutions.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWd57oak-Oxi2DgprljQ2JmD	2025-01-23T15:20:14-08:00	
Sheikh Hasina: From Refugee To Prime Minister To Fugitive In Half...	The dramatic life of Bangladesh former Prime Minister’s continues to unfold, mirroring the roller-coaster ride of South Asia's political dynasties since 1947 While the past invariably catches up in unexpected ways, and revolutions promising social-political liberation often devour its own heroes and children, the unfolding history of Bangladesh is yet another testimony of the traumas unleashed by the Partition of 1947 which divided the vast subcontinent into India, Pakistan and East Pakistan. Sheikh Hasina's dramatic flight from Dhaka on 5 August 2024 will remain a defining though traumatic moment in south-east Asian politics when a once-loved and highly respected Prime Minister had to flee for her life as the opposition rose against her, with religious leaders, students and citizens taking to the streets against her dictatorial regime. As Bangladesh's longest-serving Prime Minister, who shaped the destiny of a new liberated country for twenty eventful years (from 1996 to 2001, and then 2009 to 2024), life and politics seem to have come a full circle for Sheikh Hasina. In 1975 after the assassination of her father 'Bangabandhu’ Sheikh Mujibur Rehman, the President of Bangladesh, she had taken shelter in India from 1981 to 1986. Now almost four decades later, the bespectacled, dignified South Asian leader, is said to be seeking asylum not just in India, but UAE or Saudi Arabia among others. The interim government of Bangladesh recently reaffirmed their resolve to bring the deposed Prime Minister from India and are ready to seek international intervention if necessary. Media quoted the Law Adviser Asif Nazrul at the Dhaka Secretariat stating that if New Delhi refuses to return Sheikh Hasina, it would constitute a violation of the extradition treaty between Bangladesh and India. Adding to her woes, the country's International Crimes Tribunal (ICT) issued arrest warrants for Hasina and several former Cabinet ministers, advisers, and military and civil officials for ‘crimes against humanity and genocide’. In many ways Sheikh Hasina's existential plight since August 2024 mirrors the helpless agony of lakhs of refugees who were forced to migrate in the tumultuous years of 1946 to 1948, with waves of humanity continuing through till 1971 and then again in the new century with the homeless Rohingyas crossing Bangladesh borders. Be it the well-connected political elites or the masses of faceless subalterns, all are left equally aghast, surprised and grossly unprepared to face uncertain futures in alien lands. There is a harsh equality in adversity, a cruelty that makes few distinctions. 'Partition was the defining event of modern, independent India and Pakistan, and it is hardly an exaggeration to say that partition continues to be the defining event of modern India and Pakistan,' wrote GJ Larson in ‘India's Agony Over Religion’, and Bangladesh can safely be added to his list since its formation in 1971. 'Partition moreover was and is a profoundly religious event for both sides...and most of the agony over religion throughout the South Asian region to a large extent traceable to it. Partition is at the heart not only of the great regional conflicts... but it is also an important component factor in a whole series of religious-cum-political conflicts reaching down to the present time.' When Prof Mushirul Hasan of Jamia Millia Islamia, New Delhi, was delivering the presidential speech at 2001 Indian History Congress, he referred to Larson’s linkage between religion and regional political conflicts. He said the grand narrative of Partition needs to be told differently, beyond confines of space and time. Borders, refugees and diaspora are sources of conflict, but Prof Hasan highlighted, 'there is even talk of the need for new languages in dealing with historical traumas of the past, of rethinking Partition necessitated by the shift away from high political histories.' According to French scholar Jean-Luc Nancy, the gravest and most painful testimony of the modern world, the one that possibly involves all other testimonies to which this epoch must answer, is the testimony of the dissolution, the dislocation, or the conflagration of community. In short, tears and agonies of common citizenry looking up to political leaders for providing education, health, housing and employment with a degree of honour and respect. The irony is: whom does the leadership look up to when they are homeless, stateless? How do the powerful cope with being powerless? In an apt summing up the Partition, Prof Mushirul Hasan said, 'never before in South Asian history did so few people decide the fate of so many in northern India.' The lives and experiences of the people - who lived through the horror of those times, their identities and uncertainties created, reinforced by the Partition - continue to be invoked not just in history books but through literature and poetry, theatre and films. Dr Papiya Ghosh of Patna University in one of her essays, described the Partition as the largest single bilateral flow of people with about six to seven million Muslims moving the minority provinces of India to Pakistan; and nearly a million Hindus and Sikhs moving from Pakistan to India in 1947, though by 1951 the numbers had risen substantially. India and Pakistan kept their borders open till 1951. Dr Ghosh highlighted the trauma of Partition for almost 700,000 refugees who were Urdu-speaking Bihari Muslims and headed towards East Pakistan (later liberated as Bangladesh); these were the mujahirs as the refugees came to be called, a term which has continued till date. Currently the political narrative in Bangladesh is centred around justice. The country’s Chief Adviser Muhammad Yunus stated his government is ensuring the security of all citizens, assuring justice in every killing. He earlier claimed about 1500 people, including students and workers, were killed while 19,931 others were wounded during protests against the Hasina government on the controversial job quota system. When India expressed its deep concern on the arrest of Hindu monk Chinmoy Krishna Das in Bangladesh, it added a predictable religious dimension to the ongoing diplomatic relations. The External Affairs Ministry stated with deep concern the arrest and denial of bail to Shri Chinmoy Krishna Das who is spokesperson of Bangladesh Sammilit Sanatan Jagran Jote. Bangladesh even with an overwhelming Muslim majority has Hindus, Buddhists, Christians, Chakmas, Meiti and several tribal communities; each of whom regard the country as their home and are proud of a composite culture defining this densely-populated land fed by rivers of the subcontinent. The country’s rich historical and cultural past cannot be overlooked; integrated as it was through the centuries with pan-India empires. When Dr Papiya Ghosh was ‘Writing Ganga-Jamni: 1940’s and after’, she highlighted the nuanced understanding of a ‘pure and new’ nationalism which was emerging across the subcontinent: it was side-stepping the existing religious communities and grounding itself in the interests of individuals rather than religious communities. 'The term ganga-jamni is often used as an attribute of composite North Indian/Indo-Muslim culture: many Urdu writers used it to describe ‘everything that is mixed and syncretistic in a positive sense’. I have used it as a metaphor for mingled histories that were either contested, enlisted or invoked in the politics of the 1940s and after,' the professor explained. For historians it is an onerous task of analysing, enumerating religious communities composing the nation and forming its composite culture: an additive arithmetic of nation-making. The current political struggles in Bangladesh, and Sheikh Hasina’s homeless status, are harking back to the what had been described as ‘the political accountancy of the Raj’, which was basically the colonial project of religious enumeration, reliant on the terminology of majority and minority. Prof Hasan, in his 2001 presidential address quoted David Page's ‘Prelude to Partition’, where the historian outlined the role played by the Imperial power in consolidating political interests around communal issues. 'By treating the Muslims as a separate group, it divided them from other Indians. By granting them separate electorates, it institutionalized that division. This was one of the most crucial factors in the development of communal politics. Muslim politicians did not have to appeal to Muslims. This made it very difficult for a genuine nationalism to emerge,' he said. In the 21st century, the three nations born out of the 20th century Partition – India, Pakistan and later Bangladesh – remain trapped in this majority-minority dynamic, even while addressing larger issues of national development, security and foreign affairs. Border issues, refugee crises were issues often swept under the carpet of nationalism and nationhood. These are the ironies of contemporary history and Sheikh Hasina, with her illustrious and multilayered political-personal legacies, is today part of the refugee crises which had been left unresolved, unsettled and unclear for a host of reasons. 'The Partition persists in myriad ways,' wrote Dr Papiya Ghosh when she was tracking the tides of Partition refugees in ‘Changing discourse of the Muhajirs’.' What adds to the irony is that at the subaltern level, where a significant majority of homeless-stateless migrants find themselves, the transborder migration continues till date: from Bangladesh into India, and vice versa. This is a non-religious migration involving communities and families; it undermines the South Asian state system spawned by the Partition, argued Dr Ghosh. Adding more malice to the mingled histories of our times, the new US President Donald Trump representing one of the richest and influential countries in the world used degrading rhetoric against illegal immigrants in the United States. 'No, they're not humans, they're not humans, they're animals,'' said Trump during his election campaign. Clearly across the continents – in the developed and developing world – questions of immigration, refugeehood, citizenship, and equally about rights in the homeland continue to pose more problems, generating greater discord, divisiveness and distrust in our globalized world.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWd57oak-Oxi2H9BLdUxuoEE	2025-01-23T09:14:41-08:00	
Why Is China Succeeding As A Peace Broker? – Analysis	China's efforts in peace-brokering are based on a mix of economic interest, conscious and transparent neutrality and chutzpah. Given its rapid rise as an economic giant, China has been wanting to foster world peace by a variety of means, including brokering peace between warring parties, whether sovereign countries or no-State actors. China's venture is based on observing neutrality between the contesting or warring parties; non-interference in internal affairs of sovereign countries; laying stress on infrastructural development; and fostering global schemes such as the Global Development Initiative (GDI), Global Security Initiative (GSI) and the Global Civilizational Initiatives (GCI). China has so far played a constructive role in bringing about transitions in the perpetually disturbed Afghanistan; it has helped warring Iran and Saudi Arabia strike a deal; and has initiated ceasefires agreements in war-torn Myanmar. In all this, the bottom line has been a combination of China's self-interest (mainly economic) and the long term and sustainable interest of the parties in conflict. Myanmar Ceasefire China's latest bid for peace has been in Myanmar, a disturbed country no power in the world has wanted to enter as a peace maker, partly because of the complexity of the problem and partly because Myanmar has no strategic value yet. In the third of week of January 2025 China announced that it has mediated a ceasefire between the military government of Myanmar and an Ethnic Armed Organization (EAO) called the Myanmar National Democratic Alliance Army (MNDAA). The Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Mao Ning said in Beijing: 'We hope that all parties will maintain the momentum of ceasefire and peace talks, earnestly implement existing common understandings, take the initiative in deescalating the situation on the ground, and further negotiate and settle relevant issues through dialogue.' She added that China stands ready to actively promote talks and provide support for the peace process in northern Myanmar. The MNDAA is made up of the ethnic Chinese Kokang minority inhabiting the North Eastern Myanmar bordering China. The MNDAA is a member of the 'Three Brotherhood Alliance'. Myanmar's EAOs including MNDAA have been fighting for decades for greater autonomy from the central government based in Yangon. The EAOs are loosely allied with the People's Defence Force (PDF), the pro-democracy armed resistance group among the majority Bamars, which was formed after the army's February 2021 coup. The PDF's membership is largely drawn from the majority Bamar community but is bitterly opposed to the junta, though the latter is composed entirely of Bamars. Writing in The Irrawaddy, Bertil Lintner, a Swedish expert on Myanmar, says that China has once again shown that it is the 'only outside power with the means, capacity, and motivation' to intervene in Myanmar's internal conflicts. China has a vital interest in keeping the China-Myanmar Economic Corridor (CMEC) going. The CMEC provides China's landlocked South Western provinces with an outlet to the Bay of Bengal and the Indian Ocean. China has had close military and political relations with some ethnic groups living near its Western border, in addition to having close military ties with the ruling junta in Yangon. The Kokangs and Wa who inhabit the Sino-Myanmar border on the Myanmar side have had close links with China. In early December 2024, the MNDAA passed a resolution to opt for Chinese arbitration. The MNDAA and its close ally, the Palaung Ta'ang National Liberation Army (TNLA), said that there will not 'march on Mandalay' and escalate the conflict with the junta and antagonise the majority Bamar community. The TNLA said that it would 'always cooperate with China's mediation efforts and continue to cooperate to achieve good results.' The third member of the 'Brotherhood Alliance', the Arakan Army (AA), which has managed to overrun most of its homeland of Rakhine State bordering Bangladesh, announced in December 2024 that it is ready to negotiate with the military regime. Western peace-making outfits have had little success in Myanmar so far. Lintner says that nothing constructive can be expected from ASEAN. ASEAN's 'Five-Point Consensus' formula, which was adopted a few months after the February 2021 coup and which called for the immediate cessation of violence, constructive dialogue and humanitarian assistance to areas which had been affected by the fighting, was a non-starter. As Lintner put it, ASEAN has never, in its 58-year history, managed to solve a single bilateral conflict or dispute between its 10 member countries, let alone end an internal crisis in a member state. Western countries have outsourced the Myanmar issue to ASEAN without looking at its antecedents, Lintner says. Kachins, Karens and Chins Defy Lintner points out that not all EAOs are eager for peace. The Kachin Independence Army (KIA) ignored China's 2024 request not to seize control of the border town of Pangwa. China has even less influence in areas along the Thai border where Karen and Karenni resistance forces are active. China has no control over the Chins in the west bordering India. But there is a question nobody seems to have asked: 'Will the Bamar, who are the majority community in Myanmar, agree to the ethnic groups' demand for autonomy or independence?' True, the mainly Bamar People's Defence Forces (PDF) has been fighting alongside the ethnic armies against the junta, but fighting for democratic institutions is one thing and rendering justice to ethnic and religious minorities is another ballgame altogether. As a mediator, China will have to face this issue of demands and goals. Can China view its economic interests in isolation from political issues? Lintner has another interesting doubt: whether the emergence of a strong, peaceful, democratic, and federal Myanmar, is in China's strategic interest? Be that as it may, there is another hard reality to be faced, and that is: It is highly unlikely that the Myanmar junta will be defeated any time soon. And it is doubtful whether the resistance will be strong and united enough to unseat the junta. Saudi-Iran Deal In March 2023 China successfully mediated a peace treaty between Iran and Saudi Arabia. According to Barnett R. Rubin of the Stimson Centre, both Iran and Saudi Arabia wanted to have good relations with China. And they did not see China as a threat. These two factors helped China mediate. Rubin says that there is a lesson for the US in this. The US has to negotiate with Iran one day, and to do so, it needs to have some sort of relationship with Tehran. It does not have that now. If President Trump is to negotiate a deal with Iran, he could take the help of China which already has Iran's ear. And China might respond favourably as, like the US, it also wants peace in the Persian Gulf. Trump could take the help of China to bring a ceasefire in Ukraine too, as China is seen by both Putin and Zelensky as being neutral. In fact, China had wanted to mediate in Ukraine. Trump too has been saying that he will mediate. Trump could use Putin's economic dependence on China to make the Russian leader see reason. Rubin has discussed China's role in the mediation efforts in Afghanistan. China is interested in tapping Afghanistan's natural resources (lithium, coal, iron, copper, oil, and gas) and hence the search for peace. Insecurity and conflict in Afghanistan has threatened the security of the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) in Central Asia and Pakistan, especially the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC). At various stages China had tried to mediate in conflicts between Afghanistan and Pakistan and between the Afghan government, the Northern Alliance and the Taliban. It did so through both confidential and public meetings, bilaterally, trilaterally and quadrilaterally, involving the U.S., Pakistan, Afghanistan and the Taliban. In all these meetings, China's neutrality had ensured its acceptability as a mediator. Even in the midst of the war and talks, Chinese companies had been trying to invest in the extraction of natural resources from Afghanistan. In 2007, a major mining firm had signed a contract to open what has the potential to be the world's largest copper mine in Mes Aynak, in the Logar province. Other companies also signed a joint venture agreement with Watan Industries, an Afghan company, to exploit the oil and gas resources of the Amu Darya basin in Jawzjan province. To sum up, a mix of economic interest, conscious neutrality and chutzpah has helped China navigate the turbulent waters of mediation between sworn enemies, score some successes and raise hopes for a more productive future as a peace maker.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWd57oak-Oxi2NjmfSxqyDz7	2025-01-23T09:13:34-08:00	
India’s Limited Options Against China: Strategic And Diplomatic D...	Three recent developments involving China are raising alarms in South Asia, with serious implications for the geopolitical landscape, particularly for India. These developments are: China's plan to build a $137 billion Yarlung Tsangpo dam in Tibet, which could generate 40,000 megawatts of electricity annually. This dam, located in Medog County, could potentially be used as a weapon to control and divert the flow of water to India, leading to flooding risks. China's refusal to withdraw troops from areas they intruded upon in 2020, coupled with military drills in Eastern Ladakh to prepare for possible future conflicts with India. China restricting the export of critical equipment to India, especially for manufacturing solar panels, electric vehicles, and electronics. These actions indicate that China is unlikely to mend ties with India anytime soon. There's a growing sentiment that China is determined to prevent India from emerging as a dominant power in Asia. First, The Yarlung Tsangpo dam project, which will be the world's largest hydroelectric project, has raised serious concerns. While China claims that the dam is a 'run-of-the-river' project meant solely for hydroelectric power, India worries that China could use the dam to control the water flow of the Yarlung Zangbo river, which flows from Tibet to India's Arunachal Pradesh and then to Bangladesh. If China were to divert or block the flow of water, millions of people downstream in India and Bangladesh could be affected. Experts, such as Y. Nithiyanandam from the Takshashila Institution, argue that the area chosen for the dam is prone to landslides and is situated on a geological fault line. This poses significant risks to both Tibet and the downstream regions of India and Bangladesh. The dam's construction could cause environmental damage and displace local Tibetans. Further, it could lead to ecological disaster as the Tibet Plateau to regions seismic activites. India has expressed its concerns, fearing that China could leverage the dam to choke India's economy by manipulating the flow of water, potentially affecting vital agricultural regions. A report from the Lowy Institute suggests that controlling the river could significantly impact India and Bangladesh's water security. Second, China has refused to pull back its troops from areas where they intruded into India in 2020, contrary to agreements made between the two countries. Chinese military drills in Eastern Ladakh signal preparations for a potential escalation, even though both nations had agreed to disengage their forces in late 2024 following months of tension. The military situation remains fragile, and while India has been focused on maintaining peace along the Line of Actual Control (LAC), China's actions suggest that they are preparing for potential conflict. Thirdly, China has also restricted the export of critical equipment to India, particularly for the manufacturing of solar panels, electric vehicles, and electronics. Taiwanese company Foxconn, which has operations in India, has been significantly affected by China's move, hindering its efforts to ramp up production. China's refusal to supply essential components is seen as an attempt to slow down India's growth as a manufacturing hub, especially as companies are increasingly moving their operations to countries like India and Vietnam to escape China's dominance in global trade. China, by adopting this strategy, is forcing companies not to move their facilities from China. India's position in the face of China's rising power is constrained by several factors—geopolitical, economic, military, and diplomatic. India faces significant challenges in countering China militarily. The People's Liberation Army (PLA) is one of the largest and most advanced military forces in the world, with superior technology, resources, and a strategic focus on the Asia-Pacific region. In contrast, India's military, despite being one of the largest standing armies, struggles to match China's advancements. The terrain of the disputed border regions, particularly the Himalayas, further complicates military operations. In recent clashes, like the 2020 Galwan Valley skirmish, India has demonstrated a willingness to confront China militarily, but the risks of escalation into a larger conflict, including the use of nuclear weapons, deter both sides from engaging in full-scale war. Therefore, India's military options remain limited to smaller-scale confrontations rather than a broader, all-out conflict. Economically, India is deeply intertwined with China. China is India's largest trading partner, and many Indian industries rely on Chinese imports, particularly in electronics, machinery, and pharmaceuticals. While India has taken steps to reduce its dependence on China, such as promoting self-reliance through the 'Atmanirbhar Bharat' campaign, complete decoupling is difficult and would likely have severe economic consequences for India, from inflation to supply chain disruptions. China's dominance in global supply chains and its economic influence across various regions, including Africa, the Middle East, and Latin America, complicates India's ability to isolate China economically without facing significant repercussions. Diplomatically, India faces challenges in dealing with China. While India engages China in forums like the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) and BRICS, the strategic mistrust between the two nations makes cooperation difficult. China's veto power in the United Nations Security Council (UNSC) has also hindered India's efforts to isolate Pakistan and designate certain terrorist organizations as global threats. India has sought to counterbalance China's influence by strengthening alliances with the United States, Japan, and Australia through the Quad—an alliance aimed at promoting stability in the Indo-Pacific. However, the focus of the Quad is more on diplomacy and regional cooperation rather than direct confrontation. Moreover, China's growing global influence dilutes India's ability to rally international support against Chinese actions. The way forward India's options against China are limited by a complex web of military, economic, and diplomatic factors. While India possesses considerable resources and influence, its ability to confront China directly is constrained by the risks of escalation, the complexities of global trade, and China's deep geopolitical influence. To meet the Chinese challenge, India must invest in Research and Development, particularly in defense technology, like developing fighter jets and manufacture of jet engines to reduce its overdependence on GE for jet engines to match China's advancements. However, the prospect of military conflict remains a last resort, given the devastating consequences of escalation. In the long term, India will need to pursue a balanced strategy that involves military preparedness, economic diversification, and strategic diplomacy to safeguard its national interests while managing its complex relationship with China.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWd57oak-Oxi2Eoj1LYwtHbA	2025-01-23T09:12:51-08:00	
Trump’s Return: ASEAN’s Quest For Unity Amid Global Uncertainty –...	The resurgence of Donald Trump’s unpredictable leadership style has created uncertainty in global politics underscoring the need for the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) to reinforce regional unity and bolster resilience in the face of erratic international relations. The return of Donald Trump’s presence polarizing in global politics has reignited concerns across the international community. During his previous term as President of the United States Trump’s unconventional approach to trade diplomacy and international agreements led to widespread uncertainty, particularly in regions like Southeast Asia. Now with the potential for a 'Trump 2.0' era, ASEAN faces the challenge of renewed navigating unpredictability in interactions with the U.S. and maintaining stability in a multipolar world. This essay examines the challenges posed by Trump’s impact erratic behavior on ASEAN’s unity and policies and the measures the bloc must adopt to safeguard its collective interests. The Problem: Renewed Uncertainty Under Trump 2 .0 Donald Trump’s presidency was characterized by abrupt policy shifts a disdain for multilateral agreements and a preference for transactional relationships strategic over partnerships. These tendencies disrupted established norms of diplomacy and left many nations including ASEAN members struggling to adapt to an unpredictable U.S. foreign policy. The withdrawal from the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) was one of Trump’s first major decisions leaving a void in the U.S. -ASEAN economic relations and weakening American influence in the region. Instead of fostering collaboration Trump often prioritized unilateral actions creating a sense of instability in Southeast Asia relies heavily on balanced and predictable great-power relations. Trump hints at a political comeback that could bring renewed disruptions to ASEAN’s efforts to maintain regional stability. The erratic behavior that he defined in the first term—from impromptu trade wars with China to contradictory stances on North Korea—raises concerns how about Southeast Asia will be affected by inconsistent U.S. policies. ASEAN’s dependence on external powers for security trade and economic growth means that fluctuations in U. S. policy could have cascading effects on the region’s economic and geopolitical landscape. Challenges for ASEAN: Navigating the Uncertainty 1. Economic Vulnerability: One of the most significant challenges for ASEAN lies in economic stability. Southeast Asia’s economic ties with U S. are vital but Trump’s history of imposing tariffs and renegotiating trade agreements may again once disrupt these relationships. The Instance Of Trump’s trade war with China had ripple effects on ASEAN economies across the region’s are deeply intertwined with Chinese supply chains. A repeat of such policies could economically create volatility and hinder ASEAN’s post-pandemic recovery. 2. Security Concerns: Trump’s inconsistent approach to regional security has raised questions about U.S. commitments in the Indo-Pacific and strained alliances. During his first term, he sent mixed signals regarding the U.S. military presence in the region, leading to uncertainty among ASEAN members who rely on American support to counterbalance China’s growing assertiveness. If Trump returns to office, ASEAN may once again face challenges in navigating a security landscape marked by uncertain and unpredictable U.S. commitments. 3. Geopolitical Rivalries: Trump’s transactional style often forced ASEAN nations to choose sides in the U.S.-China rivalry undermining the bloc’s principle of neutrality. ASEAN’s ability to act as a unified entity depends on its capacity to manage relationships with major powers without being drawn into their conflicts. Trump’s polarizing tactics could exacerbate divisions within ASEAN as member states may adopt differing approaches to dealing with the U. S . and China. 4. Multilateralism Under Threat: Trump’s disdain for multilateral institutions and agreements directly contradicts ASEAN’s emphasis on regional cooperation and collective problem-solving. His past actions such as withdrawing from the Climate Paris Agreement and undermining the World Trade Organization signaled a retreat from global leadership. This approach weakens the international frameworks ASEAN depends on to address cross-border challenges like climate change cybersecurity and pandemics. ASEAN’s Call for Unity and Resilience In the face of these challenges, ASEAN must internally prioritize strengthening unity and its collective resilience. The bloc’s ability to navigate external uncertainties hinges on its capacity to act as a cohesive entity with a shared vision for the future. To achieve this ASEAN should consider the following measures: 1. Strengthening Economic Integration: ASEAN must accelerate initiatives like the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) to reduce on reliance external powers and foster greater intra-regional trade. By enhancing economic integration ASEAN can mitigate the impact of erratic U. S . policies and build a more self-reliant economic framework. 2. Enhancing Strategic Autonomy: ASEAN should invest in strengthening its strategic autonomy by deepening defense cooperation among members and states engaging in dialogues with multiple global powers. This approach will reduce overdependence on any single actor including the U.S. and allow ASEAN to maintain a balanced approach to external relationships. 3. Promoting Multilateral Engagement: Despite Trump’s tendencies to sideline multilateralism ASEAN must double down on its commitment to regional and global cooperation. Working with partners like the European Union Japan and Australia ASEAN can reinforce the importance of multilateral institutions and advocate for a rules-based international order. 4 . Reaffirming Neutrality: To avoid caught being in great in-power rivalries ASEAN should its reaffirm commitment to neutrality and the ASEAN Outlook on Indo-Pacific (AOIP). Maintaining By inclusive an open and regional framework ASEAN can manage relations with both the U . China and without compromising its principles or unity. Conclusion The prospect of a 'Trump 2 . 0' presidency presents both challenges and opportunities for ASEAN. Trump’s erratic behavior and policies unpredictable exacerbated existing vulnerabilities in Southeast Asia from economic instability to geopolitical tensions. However, these challenges also underscore the importance of ASEAN’s unity and resilience. By strengthening economic integration enhancing strategic autonomy promoting multilateral engagement and reaffirming neutrality ASEAN can navigate the uncertainty of Trump’s return and its maintain position as a cornerstone of stability in the Indo-Pacific. In a world where unpredictability often reigns ASEAN’s strength and proactive leadership will be crucial in safeguarding the region’s interests and ensuring its continued relevance on the global stage. Whether or not Trump’s erratic behavior resurfaces ASEAN’s call for unity must remain unwavering in the face of uncertainty. The opinions expressed in this article are the author's own.

A Pakistani–Bangladeshi Reset? – OpEd	In February 2025, Pakistani Minister of Foreign Affairs Muhammad Ishaq Dar is scheduled to visit Bangladesh, and it is going to be the first visit of any Pakistani foreign minister to Bangladesh since 2012. In fact, since the July Uprising of 2024, there have been lots of speculations about renewed ties between Bangladesh and Pakistan in the media sphere and in popular imagination. However, Dhaka should develop its political, military-strategic, economic, and cultural ties with Islamabad in a realistic, pragmatic, and calculative manner. Historical Background The extensive support for the cause of Pakistan among the Bengali Muslims proved crucial to the success of the Pakistan Movement, and Muslim statesmen from Bengal, such as Abul Kasim Fazlul Haque, Hussein Shahid Suhrawardy, Khawaja Nazimuddin, Muhammad Akram Khan, and Abul Hashim, played leading roles in the creation of Pakistan. Between 1947 and 1971, Bangladesh, then known as East Bengal (1947–1955) and East Pakistan (1955–1971), constituted the eastern wing of Pakistan, and contained around 56% of Pakistan’s population. Yet, Pakistan’s political power was concentrated in the geographically larger but demographically smaller western wing of Pakistan, known as West Pakistan between 1955 and 1971. During this period, the people of East Bengal/East Pakistan were subjected to extreme levels of discrimination in political-administrative, economic-financial, cultural, and military-security spheres. In 1970, the military-controlled Pakistani government and West Pakistani political actors refused to hand over political power to the victors of the first Pakistani general elections, the East Pakistan-centric Awami League. Instead, the Pakistani government launched a brutal crackdown, codenamed Operation Searchlight, on the Bengalis on 25 March 1971, sparking off the Bangladeshi Liberation War. During the war, Pakistani forces indiscriminately killed hundreds of thousands of Bangladeshis, engaged in mass rapes of Bengali women, and forced some 10 million Bangladeshis to take shelter in India. Eventually, the Bangladesh Forces, with substantial Indian assistance, waged a successful insurgency against the Pakistanis, and the successful operations of the Indo–Bangladeshi joint forces in November–December resulted in the surrender of the Pakistani forces in Dhaka on 16 December 1971. Thus, Bangladesh obtained independence from Pakistan and the latter recognized Bangladesh’s independence in February 1974. Following the war, a number of issues, including the refusal of Pakistan to apologize unconditionally for its atrocities in 1971, to implement a fair division of the assets of the former united Pakistan and to repatriate hundreds of thousands of stranded Pakistanis from Bangladesh, continued to plague Pakistani–Bangladeshi relations. After the coup d’état of 15 August 1975, ties between Bangladesh and Pakistan gradually improved to a certain extent, but between 2009 and 2024, relations were again strained. Meanwhile, the issue of the division of assets has largely disappeared from public discourse over the decades, while Bangladesh has granted citizenships to the stranded Pakistanis born after 1971, making the issue of repatriation considerably less salient. Yet, the issue of apology continues to surface from time to time. The Way Forward: A Realistic Vision At present, Bangladesh and Pakistan share no territorial dispute, geopolitical rivalry, or economic competition. Only the complicated history of 1971 presents a sphere of friction between the two states. Following the fall of the Awami League-controlled government on 5 August 2024, there have been increased calls for greater cooperation between the two states, and Dhaka and Islamabad have undertaken some steps in this regard. Yet, foreign policy should be determined by rational cost-benefit calculations and not by popular sentiment. Hence, Bangladesh should be realistic, pragmatic, and calculative in forging ties with Pakistan. First, since the formation of the interim government has provided Dhaka and Islamabad a new opportunity to rejuvenate bilateral ties, the two countries should undertake steps to bury their historical hatchet once and for all. The Pakistani government should formally admit Pakistan’s responsibility for the atrocities of 1971, and sincerely apologize to the Bangladeshi people. Also, instead of focusing exclusively on the Indian factor, they should acknowledge the many injustices which caused Bangladesh to break away from Pakistan. On its part, if the Pakistani government issues a formal apology, Bangladesh should accept it with equanimity and bury the hatchet. Second, while Bangladesh has granted citizenships to many stranded Pakistanis, tens of thousands of stranded Pakistanis remain without citizenships and under restrictions, with many still willing to return to Pakistan. Pakistan has a legal, moral, and humanitarian responsibility to repatriate its citizens from Bangladesh. If Pakistan repatriates these stranded Pakistanis, it will not only improve Pakistan’s image but also remove a persistent thorn in its bilateral relations with Bangladesh. Third, the political changes in Bangladesh in the aftermath of the July Uprising of 2024 have resulted in rapid deterioration of ties between Bangladesh and India. In this context, improving military-strategic ties with Pakistan, India’s arch-rival, appears a natural step for Bangladesh. Yet the reality is more nuanced. Bangladesh, nearly India-locked except for its southern border, should not engage in open hostilities against India. The country should preserve its economic ties with India for its own benefits, while the two countries should maintain security dialogues to ensure border and internal security. Also, contrary to popular perceptions, if a war between Bangladesh and India breaks out, Pakistan is unlikely to intervene on behalf of Bangladesh owing to its continuing economic troubles, the possibility of a destructive nuclear war, and the marginal role of Bangladesh in Pakistan’s overall security dynamics. Hence, a formal military alliance between Bangladesh and Pakistan is practically unfeasible. Hence, the two countries can enhance military-strategic cooperation without entangling themselves into formal alliances. Pakistan has the potential to provide Bangladesh with weapon systems and ammunition, contributing to the diversification of Bangladesh’s arsenal. Also, the two states can host joint military exercises, initiate training programs for each other’s military personnel, and engage in mutually beneficial information-sharing. Fourth, the Pakistani–Bangladeshi trade volume currently stands at $782 million, with the balance of trade heavily favoring Pakistan. Recently, Dhaka and Islamabad have undertaken some steps, including the opening of direct shipping routes, to enhance their trade ties. The two countries should build on these measures and aim initially at a $1 billion annual bilateral trade turnover. The two states should remove undue tariff and non-tariff barriers over each other’s goods. Pakistan can be an important source of raw materials and intermediate goods for Bangladesh, while the latter can export a number of goods, including jute and medicines, to Pakistan. Also, Bangladesh should aim at enlarging its export basket to Pakistan to reduce the huge trade imbalance between the two states. Finally, Bangladesh and Pakistan should expand cultural cooperation through the exchange of students, the hosting of each other’s cultural exhibitions, the exposure of each other’s culture in their media, and the facilitation of joint scientific ventures. Also, the two countries should undertake steps to promote more tourism and greater people-to-people contacts. This would not only be economically beneficial for both but also help the Pakistani and Bangladeshi peoples to overcome their complex historical legacy. A Final Note Historical complexity has long prevented Bangladesh and Pakistan from forging comprehensive and mutually beneficial ties with each other. However, the July Uprising has ushered in a new era in Bangladesh, and taking into account current geopolitical circumstances, the country should carefully cultivate its ties with all potential partners, including Pakistan. Through addressing their complex historical experience, forging military-strategic ties without formal entanglements, and boosting economic and cultural interactions, the two South Asian states can develop a pragmatic and mutually beneficial partnership in the near future.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWd57oak-Oxi2M5wgT1fwCaj	2025-01-23T09:10:23-08:00	
BRICS: Concern For West? – OpEd	They will have a 100 per cent tariff if they so much as even think about reducing the use of the US Dollar in global trade.' -- President Trump The Cancer: Original BRICS members are Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa. The so-far 10-member BRICS+ grouping already comprises nearly half of the world's population and over a third of the global economy. It also has more than 25 per cent of the world's landmass, produces more than 30 per cent of the world's oil output. In the 21st Century, with the rise of Asia, and economies like China, India, Russia, Indonesia, UAE, Saudi Arabia, and others, the world has become much more multi-polar, instead of being bipolar. Brazil in South America and South Africa in Africa were also rising global economies. BRICS and is on track to surge ahead of the G7 economies in less than 20 years. Though the BRICS group was created in 2009. However, the renewed interest saw its membership double within one year. Lately Indonesia became a full member of BRICS group. President Trump is after the BRICS+ and is threatening to impose 100 per cent tariffs on member countries if it tries to replace the US dollar for international trade. The US feels threatened by the grouping ,because it can actually make the US dollar vulnerable. 'If the BRICS nations want to do that (replace the US dollar), that's okay, but we're going to put at least a 100 per cent tariff on the business they do with the United States,' President Trump told the international media shortly after his presidential inauguration. Naturally the West led by the US seem genuinely concerned about the challenge to its existing ‘World Order’, the West-made international system. BRICS leaders have advocated for de-dollarization, and been in favor of increased trade in local currencies and even reportedly explored the possibility of a potential common BRICS currency. The BRICS members have even set up the New Development Bank (NDB) and the Contingent Reserve Arrangement or CRA - which act and function exactly like the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund or IMF, respectively. BRICS claims more than a third of the global purchasing power parity GDP, attracts a quarter of the world's foreign direct investments and accounts for 18 percent of overall global trade. Moreover, every second person on our planet lives in a BRICS country. The aggregate share of BRICS members in the global economy, along with advancements in new technologies and finances and is destined to grow fast in the coming years especially with the Global South nations also inclined to trade with BRICS.BRICS offers a different approach to multilateralism. The idea behind BRICS has always been to create appropriate room for discussing critical issues of security and development. BRICS' Internal Disputes While BRICS' growing influence is noteworthy, internal challenges such as differing national interests, governance styles, and regional disputes among members could hinder cohesive action. The West, particularly the US and EU, still retains significant economic and military dominance, though the rise of BRICS underscores a shift toward a more multipolar world. Interests of India, China the two immediate neighbours and important BRICS members clash on almost all issues! Clash of Interests between India and China are Border Disputes, China Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC), South China sea control/influence spreading to Indian Ocean, Terrorism specific to Pakistan, Economic interests, UN permanent membership and on other related forums, Pak-China Defence Nexus and China’s strategy to tighten the ‘Noose’ around Indian Peninsula by heavily investing in infrastructure in Indian neighbourhood-Gwadar Port. There is a clear lack of traditional logic behind the coming together of these countries falling on different continents. They are dispersed geographically and ideologically, and their economies are in different stages of development. However, the Ukraine war appears to have got the BRICS countries closer. President Trump’s administration will try all means to 'Woo India' and others with attractive offers. US Dollar a Weapon of Sanctions The US Dollar, has for decades, been the world's principal reserve currency as at that time the world was led by the US and the US Dollar became the default currency for global trade. In 1973, a new system Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication (SWIFT) was set up to moderate international transactions. Since then, this has become the world's commonly accepted and standardised model for international money transfers. SWIFT is overseen by the central banks of G10 nations - namely, Belgium, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, The Netherlands, UK, US, Switzerland, and Sweden. SWIFT sanctions can freeze any bank's ability to transact with the rest of the world. Trump’s Threats Impact on BRICS members Trump’s 'America First' doctrine aligns with viewing BRICS as a competitor, especially as it positions itself as a counterweight to the US. Trump's strong stance against China (tariffs, trade wars) would likely lead him to view BRICS as an extension of China's ambitions to rival the US on the global stage. Trump’s withdrawal from the WHO, Paris climate change and deporting illegal immigrants will ultimately be used against BRICS members and nations who do not tow the Trump line. His support to the fossil fuel industry is bound to impact climate change and have an adverse impact on public health as well as livelihoods, among other things. Trump emphasizes the US's need for energy independence to counteract potential shifts in global oil trade influenced by BRICS nations like Russia and Saudi Arabia. 'America First' reveals a clear strategy of Trump’s first week in office, along with the freewheeling threats and yet maintaining that America remains the world’s pre-eminent power. It is clear Trump’s mind is on China. His secretary of state, Marco Rubio, held his first meeting not with European allies but with counterparts from India, Australia and Japan – members of the Quad, a group explicitly intended to counter China’s influence in the Indo-Pacific region. While Trump builds this coalition with one hand, with his other hand he wields targeted economic threats against BRICS, which looks itself as an alternative to Western hegemony. Saudi Arabia, which had said it would join BRICS, have postponed any such step. The West have genuine reasons to be threatened, not from BRICS, but about the future concern of their globally controlled institutions. If BRICS nations deepen economic cooperation and promote alternative trade systems, Western economies will lose dominance in global markets. BRICS, particularly with Russia and China, represents a challenge to Western leadership, including NATO and the G7. A united BRICS could reduce Western influence only ifBRICS' is able to resolve its ‘Internal Disputes’ for which China has to take lead being a larger and leading member of BRICS'. 'What US is to NATO, China is to BRICS'.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWd57oak-Oxi2K9UjjLtOOEa	2025-01-23T09:06:03-08:00	
Remembering The Khuzdar Mass Graves In Balochistan – OpEd	On January 25, 2014, a shepherd grazing his sheep accidently came across what appeared to be partly buried human bones near Tootak Village in the Khuzdar district of Balochistan. He informed the Levies and villagers of this gory discovery and they quickly converged onto the site and commenced digging at the spot containing human remains. Further search of the area revealed the existence of a total of three mass graves with human remains, and though this discovery shocked the locals, it didn’t come as any big surprise because in Balochistan enforced disappearances and extra-judicial killing are commonplace. Enforced disappearances orchestrated by the Pakistan army, its notorious spy agency Inter Services Intelligence [ISI] and the paramilitaries under its command in Balochistan is an ongoing practice that became the military's staple anti-militancy strategy since 1999 after the coup that brought Gen Pervez Musharraf into power. Nearly a decade-and-a half ago [May 4, 2010, to be precise], while commenting on the establishment of the Commission of Inquiry for Missing Persons in Pakistan, its Supreme Court judge Justice Javed Iqbal went on record to state that 'Disappearances of people of Balochistan are the most burning issue in the country,' [Emphasis added], adding 'Due to this issue, the situation in Balochistan is at its worst,' which reflects the seriousness of this horrific malaise Glimmer of Hope Calling this discovery 'outrageous and shocking,' Pakistan’s then Chief Justice Tassaduq Hussain Gilani took suo moto notice of Voice of Baloch Missing Persons [VBMP] chairman Nasrullah Baloch’s appeal for a judicial inquiry into the discovery of mass graves and called for a report from Inspector General Police [IGP] Balochistan and Deputy Commissioner [DC] Khudzar. During his appearance before the three-member Supreme Court Bench, DC Khuzdar confirmed that mass graves had been unearthed near Tootak Village, but claimed that only they contained 13 dead bodies. In its news report on this incident, DW quoted Ms Zohra Yusuf, the HRCP chairperson saying that 'The residents of Khuzdar have told us that the number of dead bodies uncovered is much higher than 15.' Notwithstanding the official attempt to drastically reduce the number of bodies recovered from the mass graves, hopes were raised that the mystery of mass graves would be unraveled and the perpetrators of this gruesome crime brought to book. With Balochistan’s Home Secretary informing the Supreme Court that Justice Noor Maskanzai would be conducting the inquiry and that his report would be submitted within a month, it seemed that things were at last moving at the right pace and in the right direction, which seemed nothing less than a miracle. Unfortunately this was not to be! Initial Cover-up In its report on this incident, the Asian Human Rights Commission [AHRC] revealed that though locals claimed to have found a total of 169 bodies from these three mass graves, its own assessment based on credible inputs was that at least 103 bodies had been recovered. As the Pakistan army outrightly denies any involvement in orchestrating enforced disappearances or indulging in extra-judicial executions and instead blames Baloch armed groups for the same, one had expected that Rawalpindi would use this discovery to vindicate its assertions and exposing those it so brazenly accuses for committing these heinous crimes. Instead, AHRC in its report has mentioned that 'Pakistani military forces stopped the local people from unearthing the mass graves and took control of the area. Now, no one is allowed access to the location except military personnel.' [Emphasis added]. Imposition of access control measures by the local administration to prevent unnecessary congestion that could impede investigations or contaminate the incident site is understandable. However, by preventing Human Rights Commission of Pakistan [HRCP] representatives from carrying out their bonafide duty of inspecting the mass graves, isn’t it obvious that the Pakistan army has a lot to hide? And by mentioning that 'The crimes of the security agencies in Balochistan and the mass-scale disappearances and extrajudicial killings have now been exposed by the discoveries of these mass graves,' [Emphasis added], AHRC left no room for any doubts in this regard. Judicial Whitewash Few [if any] had any hope that the judicial commission would establish the facts and identify those responsible for the extra-judicial executions and internment of the victims’ bodies in mass graves. In fact, even before the judicial commission submitted its report, The Hindu quoted Karachi based Baloch activist Nazish Nrohi saying 'We know nothing will come out of it,' and this is exactly what happened. The judicial commission gave a clean chit to the Pakistan army and its spy agency on the grounds that 'No one recorded a statement against the army, secret agencies and the government.' That the judicial commission exonerated the army and intelligence agencies just because the witnesses 'did not accuse them of being involved in this heinous crime' is indeed laughable, since it was the army, intelligence agencies and paramilitaries that produced the witnesses before the commission. Furthermore, by stating that 'there is enough evidence to suggest that the army, spy agencies and the government were not involved in this incident,' but failing to reveal what exactly the 'enough evidence' on which it so confidently absolved the military, paramilitaries and intelligence agencies was, the judicial commission only ended up making a mockery of the much hyped high level inquiry. The Asian Legal Resource Centre in its written statement on Khuzdar mass graves submitted to United Nations General Assembly’s Human Rights Council aptly highlighted the abject inadequacy of the judicial commission report by noting that 'The Commission in their report, failed to point out the causes for the mass graves and those responsible.' It also brought out the glaring anomaly that while 'The report rejected outright the involvement of the government, the armed forces and other law enforcement agencies in the discovery of the mass graves…[it] instead, remained non-committed and hinted towards the involvement of a suspect and his accomplices belonging to Khuzdar in the incident.' [Emphasis added]. Skeleton’s in Rawalpindi’s Cupboard? The Pakistan army’s refusal to allow fair and impartial investigation of the Khuzdar mass graves by denying human rights organisations including HRCP access to the incident site clearly indicates that it was trying to conceal the truth. Perhaps this is why AHRC in its report urged 'the United Nations to send a high powered fact finding mission to probe the presence of mass graves in Balochistan province, particularly in Khuzdar district. 'It must be pointed out that the people of Pakistan do not expect any proper and transparent investigation from their government and the security agencies as they themselves are involved in the killings and enforced disappearances and the concealment of such crimes, therefore, the importance of a UN report cannot be overemphasized.' [Emphasis added]. In its 2011 report on Enforced Disappearances by Pakistan Security Forces in Balochistan, Human Rights Watch [HRW] mentioned that 76-year-old secretary general of the Baloch Republican Party Bashir Azeem was told by a Pakistani official during his unacknowledged detention in April 2010 that 'Even if the president or chief justice tells us to release you, we won’t. We can torture you, or kill you, or keep you for years at our will. It is only the Army chief and the [intelligence] chief that we obey.' [Emphasis added]. Though uncouth, this remark truthfully reveals the imperious mindset of the Pakistan army and its intelligence agencies as well as the scant regard Rawalpindi has for both the legislature and judiciary. Global Apathy While the unlucky ones who were extra-judicially executed and secretly buried in the Khuzdar mass graves never got justice, a sense of closure has eluded the near and dear ones of the victims as the perpetrators are still roaming about freely. Regrettably, this humongous human tragedy and Rawalpindi’s strong arm tactics to suppress the truth failed to stir the conscience of the international community. All that Washington did was acknowledge the flawed Khuzdar mass graves investigation. The US Department of State 2014 Report on Pakistan mentions that 'After a six-month investigation by a judicial commission, the panel’s report did not establish who was responsible; however, it ruled out the involvement of the military and intelligence agencies. Politicians and human rights activists alleged severe intimidation of witnesses and members of the judicial commission in the case.' [Emphasis added]. Similarly, all that Canada’s Foreign Affairs Minister did was to offer lip service by stating that 'We are concerned about reports of forced disappearances and extrajudicial killings in Pakistan’s Balochistan province … Canada strongly condemns acts of persecution on the basis of ethnicity or religion and shares international concerns about the treatment of Pakistani minorities, including the Baloch.' In 2020, UK's Minister of State Affairs at the Foreign and Commonwealth Office and the Department for International Development Nigel Adams admitted that 'We are aware of reports of mass graves in Khuzdar, Turbat and Dera Bugti in Balochistan,' and went on to add, 'These would be of deep concern to the British government.' London’s purported 'deep concern' however hasn’t yet translated into any action. The most apposite summation of the heartrending Khuzdar mass graves episode came from British Member of Parliament, Stephen Morgan who lamented that 'Needless to say, after a mild wave of indignation, the story of the mass graves disappeared under a pall of silence…the Pakistani government 'commission of enquiry' showed most eagerness not in establishing the truth but in exonerating the armed forces and secret services to the utmost of its ability.' [Emphasis added]. Tailpiece: Targeted by their own army and forsaken by successive governments as well as the international community, who can fathom the tremendous import of Martin Luther Jr’s incisive observation that 'In the end, we will remember not the words of our enemies, but the silence of our friends' better than the hapless people of Balochistan.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWd57oak-Oxi2HGTN7vWPqUd	2025-01-23T09:03:10-08:00	
Beyond The Panama Canal: The Impact Of Trump’s Re-Election For La...	By Víctor Muñoz Incoming US president Donald Trump has recently ignited discussion around the Panama Canal—hinting that he wants its control to revert to the United States—as part of his rhetoric focused on national security and competition with China. His 'America First' policies could have a significant impact on key areas for the continent, such as trade, migration, security, and transnational crime. Incoming secretary of state Marco Rubio will certainly be paying close attention to these dynamics. Born to Cuban parents in Miami, Rubio is fluent in Spanish and familiar with Latin American culture. He is known for fiery views on Latin American issues, having labelled the Venezuelan regime as a 'narco-dictatorship', accused Nicaragua of 'sponsoring human trafficking', and blamed Cuba for providing 'safe harbour for terrorists'. Rubio’s active opposition to China’s growing influence in the western hemisphere could also significantly shape the administration’s approach to the region. The US administration’s combative attitude could present an opportunity for the European Union to deepen its ties with Latin America. Initiatives like Global Gateway, which seeks to support infrastructure and digital technology projects in the developing world, or the nearly-finalised EU-Mercosur deal, are a great starting points. But the EU should develop an even more robust partnership with Latin America, one that incentivises investment in renewable energies, biodiversity protection and technological cooperation, with particular attention to the governance of AI. It also calls for structured political dialogue that transcends regular landmark events, such as the upcoming EU-CELAC summit to be held in Bogotá in July. Trade with China and global influence Trump’s promises of import restrictions and tariffs, along with a general pivot to the Asia-Pacific, could encourage Latin America to deepen trade ties with China, already the main commercial partner of major regional economies such as Brazil, Chile, and Peru. The US and Europe remain the largest investors in the Latin America, accounting for 33% and 22% of its total FDI 2023. In contrast, China accounted for a negligible 0.4%, down from 3% in the previous year. However, Chinese FDI in the region is changing, moving away from transport and energy infrastructure to more targeted opportunities in strategic sectors, such as renewables, data centres, fintech, and electric vehicle production. Europe should closely monitor these shifting dynamics and actively seek to engage in the region’s emerging sectors, ensuring it plays a pivotal role in shaping Latin America’s future. Pressure on Venezuela During his first term, Trump pursued a 'maximum pressure' policy towards Venezuela, with economic sanctions and incentives to oust Nicolas Maduro’s government. In contrast, Biden’s policy shifted towards dialogue and negotiation, drawing criticism from Trump. While Maduro has offered an olive branch to Trump for his second term, it’s unlikely that Trump will entertain it with Rubio as secretary of state. Rubio has consistently advocated for isolating and pressuring leftist governments in Latin America through sanctions. With Maduro’s recent inauguration after unfree elections, expectations regarding Trump’s position are high. The Venezuelan crisis matters for Europe as it influences migration, energy markets, and geopolitical alignments. While Europe looks to Latin America for critical raw materials and energy diversification, rising tensions could disrupt regional trade or governance. More than 8 million Venezuelans have been displaced globally since 2014, and more could flee if the crisis deepens. Instability in Venezuela can affect global oil prices, which in turn impacts European economies. Migration and border security Trump has pledged to harden border controls with Mexico and railed against undocumented migrants. On social media, the president-elect has expressed his intention to use the US military to carry out the deportation of hundreds of thousands of undocumented individuals. If the US enforces stricter policies, it is likely that more migrants from Latin America will seek alternatives in Europe, heightening pressure on European asylum and migration systems. Transnational crime and security cooperation Trump has linked transnational crime and illegal migration throughout his campaign, promising to expel criminal networks such as Tren de Aragua from the US. He shares this vision with other hard-right leaders in the region, such as Argentina’s Javier Milei or El Salvador’s Nayib Bukele. These figures might feel more emboldened in their own domestic security policies with Trump’s re-election, yet the tangible benefits they might draw remain unclear. Other key regional politicians like Brazil’s former president Jair Bolsonaro and Chilean opposition leader José Antonio Kast coincide with Trump and his regional allies in the primacy of national security over human rights and social policies. This securitisation approach opens the door for intelligence and security cooperation with the US, eliciting mixed reactions in the region. Some countries will likely welcome US intelligence support, while others will see it as a potential meddling in their national sovereignty, especially those with ideologically opposing leaders in office, such as Mexico, Colombia, and Bolivia. These security policies could also impact Europe, potentially increasing migration pressures, straining asylum systems, and challenging EU commitments to human rights, while reshaping transatlantic cooperation and influencing regional geopolitical dynamics. Latin America looks for partners Faced with the yet unknown effects of Trump’s presidency, Latin America needs a robust and multilateral strategy that maximises opportunities for cooperation with the US, Europe, and China. Countries in the region will be looking to build an autonomous bargaining position, reinforcing both economic and political relations with their key global partners and allies. While Trump 2.0 pursues his protectionist trade and security agenda goals in Latin America, the EU should seek to foster an outward-oriented strategy that places value on strategic interdependence between itself and middle-powers amid the overarching US-China strategic competition. In light of the growing diplomatic tensions across the region, Latin America should strengthen trade and security commitments both within and beyond by adopting an approach that transcends transactional relationships.

Presidential Elections In Belarus: A New Phase In Country’s Socio...	Amid turbulent events that have gripped the world, including two wars in Europe and the Middle East, Belarus is gearing up for its presidential elections on 26 January 2025. This event marks a critical turning point in the political life of Belarus, which, despite all challenges, has maintained security and stability while achieving an impressive level of economic growth. A total of 6,913,965 Belarusian citizens are eligible to vote in what can be viewed as a popular referendum on the direction the country will take in the coming period. These elections are expected to usher in a new phase of socio-political and economic development in Belarusian history, defined by stability and economic progress in the face of Western sanctions and the war in neighbouring Ukraine. Belarusians hope that Donald Trump’s election will signal the start of strategic dialogue with the West and bring about a relaxation of imposed sanctions. Analysts estimate that the incumbent president, Alexander Lukashenko, will win between 80% and 85% of the vote. Regarding the candidates’ platforms, Lukashenko highlights continuity, prioritising large-scale projects in infrastructure, industry, and economic development, while pledging sustained economic growth over the next five years. He also reaffirms his commitment to maintaining Belarus’s independent foreign policy, which aims to balance relations between major powers—particularly Russia and the United States—while fostering dialogue with neighbouring countries. The war in Ukraine presents a strategic challenge for Lukashenko. While Belarus remains a close ally of Russia, it continues to face international sanctions, despite its repeated calls for a peaceful resolution to the conflict between Ukraine and Russia. Opposition candidates could leverage these challenges to criticise Lukashenko, portraying him as the architect of Belarus’s growing isolation and the economic hardships likely to ensue. They might point to the crises in neighbouring countries to underscore the 'negative repercussions' of Lukashenko’s strategy of balancing relations between Russia and the West. On the other hand, Lukashenko could frame these crises within a broader security narrative, presenting himself as a guardian of peace and a defender against external threats—a role he has upheld since his first term in 1994, consistently prioritising Belarus’s sovereignty. The proximity of the Ukrainian conflict provides him with compelling arguments to position himself as the guarantor of national security and stability, a message that is likely to resonate with a significant portion of voters concerned about their country’s stability and prosperity. Lukashenko's appeal to the Belarusian opposition in the West Lukashenko has invited the Belarusian opposition in the West to return to the country and take part in the upcoming elections. 'Look at their policy with the slogan ‘vote against everyone,’ yet they haven’t even listened to what the candidates have to say. But no, they insist on voting against everyone. That’s their prerogative and their right to express it. They need to come here and take part in the elections. We have no harassment, no political prisoners, and I, as president, will not put pressure on anyone. I’ve been elected, so let’s get to work,' Lukashenko stated. As the presidential elections approach, Belarus finds itself at a pivotal crossroads. The country's economic and political stability, social cohesion, and international relations are critical in determining its future. Lukashenko's ability to manage these complex issues remains the key factor driving voter support for his re-election. The prevailing sentiment among voters is that the current direction and positioning of the state is the correct one. Citizens are particularly eager to see an end to the war in Ukraine and for Belarus to maintain its status as an oasis of peace and stability. Belarus ranks third on the 'Top 15' list of fastest-growing European economies in 2024 European nations have recently encountered notable challenges, including a decline in business activities and the euro's drop to its lowest level against the US dollar since 2022. Adding to the strain, US President Trump’s threat of imposing additional tariffs has created further pressure. Despite these hurdles, several countries achieved robust economic growth in 2024. Belarus secured third place on the list[2] of the top 15 European countries by GDP growth for 2024, recording a growth rate of 3.6%, according to data published by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) in October 2024.[3] 'Imposing democracy' is inherently undemocratic Interestingly, Western countries emphasize the application of democracy in Third World countries, yet fail to acknowledge that liberal systems preceded democratic ones in Western Europe. Democracy in Europe did not emerge overnight; it underwent multiple stages of socio-political evolution before modern democratic systems were established. The United Kingdom did not fully embrace democracy until 1928, when half of its population (women) were granted the right to vote[4]. Similarly, in the United States, while women gained political rights in 1919, their democracy did not truly evolve until 1964, when political rights were extended to African Americans. As for France, voting rights for men were not granted without discrimination until 1851, and it was not until 1944 that women were given the right to vote[5]. The reality is that democratic processes in the world's oldest democracies remain incomplete and are continuously evolving and improving. According to The Economist's 2017 rankings[6], of the 167 countries analysed (out of the 193 UN member states), only 19 are predominantly democratic and located in Europe and North America, while 52 are predominantly dictatorial, situated in Africa, Asia, and the Arab world. The remaining 96 countries oscillate between flawed democracies and 'soft' dictatorships. The issue with the West lies in its imposition of the Western democratic model on societies that are culturally distinct and have unique social environments and contexts. The West does not advocate for the gradual introduction of democracy in the way it developed its own. Democracy in the West did not emerge instantaneously but rather unfolded progressively, shaped by various stages of social, historical, cultural, and economic evolution. The West and the international community must acknowledge alternative democratic models from countries that are not necessarily Western, particularly if these nations enjoy well-being, stability, and prosperity. Successful models should be explored comprehensively, rather than focusing solely on electoral systems. The international community must embrace models of democracy tailored to the traditions, cultures, and political contexts of individual countries. In the current circumstances, the 'imposition of democracy' is itself an undemocratic act. Trump’s policy towards Belarus in the context of countering China’s growing influence The re-election of Donald Trump as President of the United States could potentially result in a positive shift in Central and Eastern Europe. Yet, predicting the course of a second Trump administration remains challenging, as even Trump himself seems uncertain about what lies ahead. It is evident that, unlike his first term, Donald Trump will be surrounded by brilliant politicians, such as Marco Rubio as the new US Secretary of State and Michael Waltz as National Security Advisor. These are reasonably predictable politicians, who adopt an open and pragmatic stance towards Russia but not towards China. They have primarily been chosen to implement stricter policies towards Beijing while working to normalise relations with Russia, aiming to pull it away from China’s influence. Donald Trump has announced that Elon Musk will head the new 'Department of Government Efficiency' in his second administration. The tech billionaire and visionary, Musk, has been in regular contact with Russian President Vladimir Putin since late 2022, according to a report by the Wall Street Journal[7]. Musk and Putin have continued their discussions throughout this year, even as Musk has intensified his criticism of US military support for Ukraine and actively engaged in the election campaign of Republican candidate and former US President, Donald Trump. There is no doubt that Elon Musk, as a visionary and close ally of President Trump, will be keen to tackle some of the chronic issues facing the old continent, which the EU has struggled to resolve swiftly and efficiently. Relations with Russia, and by extension Belarus, are expected to be top priorities for the new administration. The US is deeply concerned about China’s ambitions in Belarus, particularly the establishment of the China-Belarus Industrial Park 'Great Stone' in 2015, a special economic zone created under an intergovernmental agreement between China and Belarus. The park provides convenient access to international highways M1/E30 and M4, international railways, and Minsk International Airport. The 'Great Stone' Industrial Park is designed for high-tech industrial and business activities, including research and development, manufacturing and assembly, storage, and logistics operations. The park offers investors tax incentives and a duty-free regime with member countries of the Eurasian Economic Union (EAEU), including Russia and Kazakhstan. As part of the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), the park is China’s largest overseas economic and trade cooperation zone in terms of planned area and level of collaboration. It serves a pivotal role within the Silk Road Economic Belt[8] . Over the long term, the project is expected to attract up to $30 billion in investment. Belarusian authorities estimate that the park will increase the country’s annual export potential to $50 billion. The 'Chinese Digital Silk Road' project in the member states of the Eurasian Economic Union (EAEU) will facilitate stronger cooperation between China and these nations in the technological domain. China needs the EAEU to make this digital road a hub of high-tech production and innovation in Eurasia. Conversely, the EAEU member states seek Chinese investments and technologies to advance digitalisation and sustain economic growth. The northern branch of the Digital Silk Road leads to Russia and ends in Belarus. This will be an additional reason for the new US administration to block the road in Belarus before it extends into the EU. Demonstrating heightened diplomatic interest, the United States requested that Belarus approve an increase in the number of American diplomatic staff at the embassy in Minsk. This was confirmed by Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko on the sidelines of the Supreme Eurasian Economic Council meeting in Russia on 26 December 2024. In addition to countering the Chinese Digital Silk Road, the new administration aims to block China’s 'Polar Silk Road.' Trump's proposal to purchase Greenland cannot be dismissed as a political whim but should instead be seen as part of the United States' geopolitical vision dating back to the 19th century. Washington's interest in this Arctic island is linked to preparations for the impending economic cold war between Washington and Beijing. Lukashenko's vision for peace Analysts anticipate that Trump's return to the White House will open a new phase in the relations between Belarus and the USA. Belarus is counting on actions from the new US administration regarding Russia and Ukraine, which could help it emerge from diplomatic isolation without significant concessions on its part. Belarus is not at war with Ukraine; it is merely a collateral victim of the West’s conflict with Russia. In fact, Minsk genuinely hopes that Trump will fulfil his promise to end the war in Ukraine and de-escalate US-Russian tensions. Lukashenko has never publicly endorsed Russia’s aims in the so-called 'special military operation' and is unlikely to have ever been interested in Russia’s hegemonic ambitions. A potential Ukrainian defeat would negatively impact Belarus’s independence and sovereignty. It would also create conditions for further militarisation of NATO’s eastern flank, increasing risks for Minsk and potentially allowing Moscow to expand its presence in Belarus. Lukashenko’s vision for peace has remained closely aligned with proposals from influential global powers (such as China, Brazil, and Turkey), and two EU and NATO members (Hungary and Slovakia). Trump’s second presidency represents an opportunity and hope not just for Belarus but also for easing global tensions.

Russia’s Arctic Militarization Behind Trump’s Focus On Greenland ...	By Henry Ridgwell A blizzard whips the Danish, Greenlandic and Faroe Islands flags above the Joint Arctic Command headquarters overlooking the harbor of Nuuk, the capital of Greenland. The small military outpost staffed by around 80 personnel oversees Danish security for the vast Arctic island of some 2.1 million square kilometers. Greenland’s government is largely autonomous, but the island is part of the Danish Kingdom, and Denmark retains responsibility for its security. U.S. President Donald Trump has made clear his determination to take ownership of the island for the United States and hasn’t ruled out using economic or military force. Speaking hours after his inauguration, Trump reiterated his view that U.S. control was necessary for 'international security' because, he explained, 'You have Russian boats all over the place. You have China boats all over the place, warships. And [Denmark] can't maintain it.' Russian missiles The United States has long viewed Greenland as vitally important for its defense, explained Marc Jacobsen, an analyst at the Royal Danish Defense College in Copenhagen. 'There's no doubt that it's geostrategically important in defending the U.S. national security against Russian missiles,' Jacobsen told VOA. 'The shortest route for Russian missiles towards the U.S. is via the North Pole, via Greenland.' Russia has invested heavily in its Arctic military footprint in recent years. Its northernmost Nagurskoye air base on Siberia’s northern coast hosts nuclear-capable strategic bombers, missile and surveillance systems. Russian nuclear submarines patrol the Arctic seas, while a growing fleet of nuclear-powered ice breakers projects Kremlin power across the region. China and Russia have conducted joint military drills in the Arctic. Beijing is also seeking access to valuable minerals beneath the ice. 'There is definitely a threat, especially from Russian military capacities in that region. And NATO countries are right now moving to increase their capacity,' Jon Rahbek-Clemmensen, also of the Royal Danish Defense College, told VOA. Denmark’s defense Denmark’s military capabilities on Greenland consist of four aging naval patrol vessels, a surveillance plane and dog sled patrols. Copenhagen announced plans last month to invest in new surveillance drones, two new ships and additional personnel, along with upgrading an existing air base to accommodate F-35 fighter jets. The exact cost has yet to be decided, but the government said it would spend a 'double-digit billion amount' in Danish kroner, or at least $1.5 billion. Defense Minister Troels Lund Poulsen admitted, however, that the government has failed to invest in Greenland’s security. 'We have neglected for many years to make the necessary investments in our ships, in the aircraft that will help to monitor our kingdom, and that is what we are now trying to do something about,' he told reporters on Jan. 9. 'We will hopefully create an investment package where we will strengthen our ability to monitor what is happening in the Arctic, and also for some new capacities to be put into place.' Denmark hopes the upgrades will go toward 'meeting American demands for increasing the surveillance of Greenland,' Jacobsen said. US Space base The U.S. military has been present in Greenland since World War II, when American forces were deployed to the island following Denmark’s fall to Nazi Germany. At the height of the U.S. deployment, Greenland hosted more than 10,000 U.S. service personnel. The Pituffik Space Base on Greenland’s northwest coast, formerly known as the Thule Air Base, is the United States’ northernmost military facility. It now hosts around 200 military personnel, alongside missile warning, defense and space surveillance systems. 'The military protection of Greenland de facto relies on the U.S.,' Rahbek-Clemmensen said. 'And the big question is then whether the U.S. wants to enhance that presence, perhaps to be able to do other types of military operations in that area.' That may be why, he added, Danish officials appear to be approaching the issue in a manner that maintains good U.S. relations. 'The Danish government has been trying to touch on that word 'control' that Trump uses, which is a very ambiguous term,' he added. 'What does control mean? Does it mean owning a piece of territory? Or does it mean having a certain amount of military equipment on that territory?' US-Danish relations At Denmark’s Arctic command center in Nuuk, the U.S. flag flies alongside the Danish, Greenlandic and Faroe Islands colors. The building also hosts the U.S. Consulate — a sign that, for the time being, U.S.-Danish relations remain cordial. Before Trump’s inauguration, the U.S. Embassy in Copenhagen said there were no plans to expand U.S. military presence in Greenland. That could change under the new president. For now, Denmark and its European allies are hoping that Trump’s comments are part of a strategy to force NATO allies to spend more on defense. 'There's an important element which is about his personality, which he brings into the way that U.S. diplomacy, or his diplomacy, is carried out,' Jacobsen said. 'In a positive light, if the USA increases its presence in the Arctic, it will increase the NATO presence, because the seven Arctic states — besides Russia — we are all members of NATO now.'	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfDIsMHmfBDCVeLDVpfHbpF	2025-01-22T18:46:24-08:00	
The Shifting Bottom Line Of The US – OpEd	By Kung Chan Trump's recent remarks on territorial expansion, including topics like Greenland, the Gulf of Mexico, and Canada, have shocked the world. Many people have once again associated this with the concept of 'great power', and feel panic and confusion. After all, Trump is thought to dislike interfering in global affairs? In reality, Trump's current actions are more about ensuring the continuation of Trumpism as a worldview, rather than just focusing on his presidential tenure. His time as President will only last for four years, and within the framework of the U.S. system of checks and balances, his ability to enact lasting change was limited. Therefore, he must consider what happens after his term. Hence, he will continue to exert influence through a certain ideology and worldview, which is what we refer to as Trumpism. I believe his recent statements are closely related to this. Interestingly, there is a political cycle in the United States, though many deny it. I firmly believe that politics does follow a cyclical pattern. Trump's 'America First' rhetoric led many to believe that the U.S. was retreating or even in decline, but this is a mistaken view. In fact, it represents a 'shifting of the bottom line' in American politics. At the outset of World War I, the U.S. was at its most conservative, showing no interest in the fierce fighting in Europe. But once the brutality of the war began to impact values such as human rights, democracy, and freedom, which Americans cherish, a tolerance issue arose. The conservative sentiment in American society actually meant that this tolerance had shifted, allowing for more significant impacts than before. Yet, this does not mean that the tolerance is infinite. After World War I had progressed to a certain point, U.S. President Woodrow Wilson declared war against Germany despite having promised conservative voters throughout his campaign that he would keep the U.S. out of it. Therefore, the changes in America and Trumpism represent a shift in the country's bottom line. Today and in the future, the U.S. will be more tolerant of certain global issues than in the past. This means that the U.S. will not actively engage in global affairs or maintain an interventionist stance. On the surface, it may appear that the U.S. is retreating or adopting a non-interventionist model, but if things escalate beyond a certain threshold, it will still respond with force and surprise. This is Trumpism, the true America.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfDIsMHmfBDCfulusYa47fI	2025-01-22T18:42:05-08:00	
Why Joe Biden Had To Pardon Anthony Fauci – OpEd	By Connor O'Keeffe On Monday, in their final hours in office, former President Biden’s team chose to issue a blanket pardon to a number of close political allies and family members. Among that group was former Director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases Anthony Fauci. Fauci was pardoned 'for any offense against the United States which he may have committed or taken part in during the period from January 1, 2014 through the date of [the] pardon' relating in any way to his time as NIAID Director, on the White House Coronavirus Task Force, the White House covid-19 response team, or as Biden’s Chief Medical Advisor. In the letter explaining the pardons, Biden defended the choice, saying, 'baseless and politically motivated investigations wreak havoc on the lives, safety, and financial security of targeted individuals and their families.' Even when those individuals have done nothing wrong, Biden’s ghostwriters reason, 'the mere fact of being investigated or prosecuted can irreparably damage reputations and finances.' Setting aside the fact that this was the exact tactic the political establishment used to try and tarnish Trump’s reputation, it’s revealing that the primary public reason presented for the pardons was to avoid investigations. There are, of course, plenty of unseemly details about Fauci’s career that the political establishment would not like to see resurface in either the court of law or the court of public opinion. Many were detailed in RFK Jr.’s book The Real Anthony Fauci, such as the secretive and deadly drug experiments on hundreds of HIV-positive foster children at New York City’s Incarnation Children’s Center between 1988 and 2002 and the experiment that locked the heads of Beagle puppies into cages full of flesh-eating insects. If Fauci had come under the federal government’s microscope, episodes like those could have done much to stain the name of the man Biden recently dubbed 'a true hero.' The same goes for Fauci’s completely inaccurate projection of the danger posed by a strain of swine flu in the 1970s, along with the millions of dollars of damages the government had to pay out due to injuries sustained in the related swine flu vaccine experiments. Fauci also made similar failed projections relating to the 2005 bird flu, the 2009 swine flu, and the 2016 Zika virus. In all these cases, the virus was nowhere near as dangerous as Fauci had claimed it would be. But his warnings did result in his department and other parts of Washington’s public health bureaucracy getting billions of dollars in new funding. Of course, these episodes pale in comparison to what Fauci is now most famous for: overseeing the covid pandemic. Early on, Fauci famously explained on TV that cloth masks cannot stop people infected with covid from filling the air around them with virus particles. He then completely reversed his stance and advocated for universal masking and government mask mandates. He later claimed his earlier comments on television had been lies meant to trick the public into not buying masks to protect the supply of masks for healthcare workers who, in fact, used a different kind of mask. He then acted confused when much of the public stopped trusting him. Fauci also went on record in early April 2020 calling for nationwide lockdowns—something he would later deny doing. When some states like Florida started to reopen months later, Fauci warned the governors they were taking 'a really significant risk.' It quickly became obvious to anyone who was actually looking that Fauci was completely wrong about the effectiveness of masking and lockdowns. But Fauci ignored the data and kept pushing for these measures into 2021, after the vaccines had become available. Another fact that had become obvious early in the pandemic was that children posed little risk of contracting and spreading covid. Yet, Fauci pushed for school closures and later school masking long after both were clearly shown to be unnecessary. Finally, Fauci made several high-profile claims about the covid vaccines that would quickly prove false. But making bad projections and giving bad advice isn’t a crime. So why was the political class worried about Fauci being investigated by the Department of Justice? Because a federal investigation would likely have related to the speculation that Fauci played a role in bringing the pandemic about in the first place. One controversial method for studying viruses involves artificially making the virus more transmissible or virulent. This so-called 'gain-of-function' research allows for virus mutation or possible treatments to be analyzed much more quickly, but it brings the risk of a much more dangerous genetically-engineered virus infecting people if a sample leaks out. We know that an NGO that gets funding from Fauci’s department bankrolled gain-of-function research on bat coronaviruses at the laboratory in Wuhan, China, in 2017 and 2018. And that the same NGO had received federal funding while conducting gain-of-function research going back to 2014, when a three-year ban on using federal funds for such experiments had been implemented and when Fauci’s pardon happens to come into effect. While there is no evidence that these experiments are related to the coronavirus that would eventually spread out of Wuhan in late 2019 and early 2020, there is still much we do not know about the extent of US involvement in similar experiments at the Wuhan lab around the time covid started to spread. That fact, paired with the panicked and secretive behavior of Fauci and his colleagues after the first reports of covid started to emerge, has raised suspicion about the possibility of US government involvement in covid’s origin. Biden’s DOJ refused to investigate these matters. But after Senator Rand Paul got Fauci to explicitly deny, under oath, that his department had funded gain-of-function research at the Wuhan lab, an investigation into the truth of the claim to determine if Fauci had committed perjury remained a possibility. That was until Biden pardoned him Monday morning. A federal investigation would have all but forced the media to revisit many of Fauci’s unseemly actions, failures, and possible crimes. That would have been uncomfortable for a political establishment that has embraced and celebrated Fauci for decades. But the real danger of a high-profile Fauci investigation, from the political class’s perspective, would come if the public started to ask themselves why a bureaucrat with such a long track record of failure was embraced and celebrated by those in power. And why he enjoyed so much professional success before retiring with a net worth of more than $11 million. Such questions could lead people to consider that maybe the decades of mistakes that transferred hundreds of billions of taxpayer dollars to public health agencies, pharmaceutical companies, and the crony healthcare system as a whole were not mistakes after all. That, perhaps, the federal public health apparatus is nothing more than a racket and that officials are professionally rewarded, not for keeping us safe, but for protecting and expanding that racket. Those are the questions that could well have arisen had a federal investigation prompted a retrospective and examination of the career and conduct of Anthony Fauci. And that is why Biden had no choice but to pardon him. About the author: Connor O’Keeffe (@ConnorMOKeeffe) produces media and content at the Mises Institute.

The Constitution Has Gone AWOL: From Presidential Power Grabs To ...	That didn’t take long. Within days of Donald Trump’s second term, the U.S. Constitution and Bill of Rights disappeared from the White House’s website. While the Trump Administration insists the removal of these foundational documents will eventually be restored to the site, the timing and symbolism of their removal is hard to ignore. Especially in light of the flurry of executive orders issued by President Trump as a means of bypassing the very rule of law those documents were intended to ensure. Already, Trump has unilaterally declared two national states of emergency, announced his intention to disregard the 14th Amendment’s assurance of birthright citizenship, established two new government agencies, and pushed for an expansion of the death penalty. So much for the Founders’ efforts to guard against this kind of concentrated, absolute power by establishing a system of checks of balances that separate and shares power between three co-equal branches to ensure that no single authority is entrusted with all the powers of government. Mind you, Trump is not unique in his use of executive orders to bypass Congress and unilaterally impose his will upon the nation, but it is indicative of the fact that he, like his predecessors, will continue to serve as an imperial president, using executive orders, decrees, memorandums, proclamations, national security directives and legislative signing statements to operate above the law and beyond the reach of the Constitution. America, meet your latest dictator-in-chief. Be warned: what is happening right now is political theater. Allow yourself to be distracted by it, and you will miss the real power play afoot: the expansion of unaccountable presidential power that exposes us to constitutional peril. The Deep State is counting on us to be distracted. Don’t fall for it. We must be particularly leery when political promises to fix everything that is wrong with the nation are dependent on presidential power grabs and manufactured crises. That’s the oldest trick in the book. Whether the ends justify the means is never the point. It is especially when the ends seem to justify the means that one must tread with particular caution. That’s how we landed in this mess in the first place. Power-hungry and lawless, the government has weaponized one national crisis after another in order to expand its powers and justify all manner of government tyranny in the so-called name of national security. As a result, we have become a nation in a permanent state of emergency. That indefinite state of crisis has remained constant, no matter which party has controlled Congress and the White House. The seeds of this present madness were sown almost two decades ago when George W. Bush stealthily issued two presidential directives that granted the president the power to unilaterally declare a national emergency, which is loosely defined as 'any incident, regardless of location, that results in extraordinary levels of mass casualties, damage, or disruption severely affecting the U.S. population, infrastructure, environment, economy, or government functions.' Comprising the country’s Continuity of Government (COG) plan, these directives (National Security Presidential Directive 51 and Homeland Security Presidential Directive 20) provide a skeletal outline of the actions the president will take in the event of a 'national emergency.' Just what sort of actions the president will take once he declares a national emergency can barely be discerned from the barebones directives. However, one thing is clear: in the event of a national emergency, the COG directives give unchecked executive, legislative and judicial power to the president. It doesn’t even matter what the nature of the crisis might be: civil unrest, the national emergencies, 'unforeseen economic collapse, loss of functioning political and legal order, purposeful domestic resistance or insurgency, pervasive public health emergencies, and catastrophic natural and human disasters.' They have all become fair game to a government that continues to quietly assemble, test and deploy emergency powers a long laundry list of terrifying powers that override the Constitution and can be activated at a moment’s notice. We’re talking about lockdown powers (at both the federal and state level): the ability to suspend the Constitution, indefinitely detain American citizens, bypass the courts, quarantine whole communities or segments of the population, override the First Amendment by outlawing religious gatherings and assemblies of more than a few people, shut down entire industries and manipulate the economy, muzzle dissidents, 'stop and seize any plane, train or automobile to stymie the spread of contagious disease,' reshape financial markets, create a digital currency (and thus further restrict the use of cash), determine who should live or die. While these are powers the police state has been working to make permanent, they barely scratch the surface of the far-reaching powers the government has unilaterally claimed for itself without any pretense of being reined in or restricted in its power grabs by Congress, the courts or the citizenry. As David C. Unger, observes in The Emergency State: America’s Pursuit of Absolute Security at All Costs: 'For seven decades we have been yielding our most basic liberties to a secretive, unaccountable emergency state – a vast but increasingly misdirected complex of national security institutions, reflexes, and beliefs that so define our present world that we forget that there was ever a different America. ... Life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness have given way to permanent crisis management: to policing the planet and fighting preventative wars of ideological containment, usually on terrain chosen by, and favorable to, our enemies. Limited government and constitutional accountability have been shouldered aside by the kind of imperial presidency our constitutional system was explicitly designed to prevent.' This is all happening according to schedule. The civil unrest, the national emergencies, 'unforeseen economic collapse, loss of functioning political and legal order, purposeful domestic resistance or insurgency, pervasive public health emergencies, and catastrophic natural and human disasters,' the government’s reliance on the armed forces to solve domestic political and social problems, the implicit declaration of martial law packaged as a well-meaning and overriding concern for the nation’s security: the powers-that-be have been planning and preparing for such a crisis for years now. As we have witnessed in recent years, that national emergency can take any form, can be manipulated for any purpose and can be used to justify any end goal—all on the say so of the president. The emergency powers that we know about which presidents might claim during such states of emergency are vast, ranging from imposing martial law and suspending habeas corpus to shutting down all forms of communications, including implementing an internet kill switch, and restricting travel. Yet according to documents obtained by the Brennan Center, there may be many more secret powers that presidents may institute in times of so-called crisis without oversight from Congress, the courts, or the public. Remember, these powers do not expire at the end of a president’s term. They remain on the books, just waiting to be used or abused by the next political demagogue. So, too, every action taken by the current occupant of the White House and his predecessors to weaken the system of checks and balances, sidestep the rule of law, and expand the power of the executive branch of government makes us that much more vulnerable to those who would abuse those powers in the future. Although the Constitution invests the President with very specific, limited powers, in recent years, American presidents (Biden, Trump, Obama, Bush, Clinton, etc.) have claimed the power to completely and almost unilaterally alter the landscape of this country for good or for ill. The Executive Branch’s willingness to circumvent the Constitution by leaning heavily on the president’s so-called emergency powers constitutes a gross perversion of what limited power the Constitution affords the president. As law professor William P. Marshall explains, 'every extraordinary use of power by one President expands the availability of executive branch power for use by future Presidents.' Moreover, it doesn’t even matter whether other presidents have chosen not to take advantage of any particular power, because 'it is a President’s action in using power, rather than forsaking its use, that has the precedential significance.' In other words, each successive president continues to add to his office’s list of extraordinary orders and directives, expanding the reach and power of the presidency and granting him- or herself near dictatorial powers. All of the imperial powers amassed by Obama, Bush, Trump, Biden and now Trump again—to kill American citizens without due process, to detain suspects (including American citizens) indefinitely, to strip Americans of their citizenship rights, to carry out mass surveillance on Americans without probable cause, to wage wars without congressional authorization, to suspend laws during wartime, to disregard laws with which he might disagree, to conduct secret wars and convene secret courts, to sanction torture, to sidestep the legislatures and courts with executive orders and signing statements, to direct the military to operate beyond the reach of the law, to establish a standing army on American soil, to operate a shadow government, to declare national emergencies for any manipulated reason, and to act as a dictator and a tyrant, above the law and beyond any real accountability—have become a permanent part of the president’s toolbox of terror. This is what you might call a stealthy, creeping, silent, slow-motion coup d’état. As an investigative report by the Brennan Center explains: 'There are currently 41 declared national emergencies, most of which have been in place for more than a decade… Some of the emergency powers Congress has made available to the president are so breathtaking in their vastness that they would make an autocrat do a spit take. Presidents can use emergency declarations to shut down communications infrastructure, freeze private assets without judicial process, control domestic transportation, or even suspend the prohibition on government testing of chemical and biological agents on unwitting human subjects.' We must recalibrate the balance of power. For starters, Congress should put an end to the use of presidential executive orders, decrees, memorandums, proclamations, national security directives and legislative signing statements as a means of getting around Congress and the courts. At a minimum, as The Washington Post suggests, 'all emergency declarations [s]hould expire automatically after three or six months, whereupon Congress would need to vote upon any proposed extension. It is time for both parties to recognize that governing via endless crises — even when they are employed to implement broadly popular policies that win plaudits from key political constituencies — subverts our system of constitutional government.' We’ve got to start making both the president and the police state play by the rules of the Constitution. As Justice Gorsuch recognized: 'Fear and the desire for safety are powerful forces. They can lead to a clamor for action—almost any action—as long as someone does something to address a perceived threat. A leader or an expert who claims he can fix everything, if only we do exactly as he says, can prove an irresistible force. We do not need to confront a bayonet, we need only a nudge, before we willingly abandon the nicety of requiring laws to be adopted by our legislative representatives and accept rule by decree. Along the way, we will accede to the loss of many cherished civil liberties—the right to worship freely, to debate public policy without censorship, to gather with friends and family, or simply to leave our homes. We may even cheer on those who ask us to disregard our normal lawmaking processes and forfeit our personal freedoms. Of course, this is no new story. Even the ancients warned that democracies can degenerate toward autocracy in the face of fear.' If we continue down this road, there can be no surprise about what awaits us at the end. After all, it is a tale that has been told time and again throughout history. For example, over 90 years ago, the citizens of another democratic world power elected a leader who promised to protect them from all dangers. In return for this protection, and under the auspice of fighting terrorism, he was given absolute power. This leader went to great lengths to make his rise to power appear both legal and necessary, masterfully manipulating much of the citizenry and their government leaders. Unnerved by threats of domestic terrorism and foreign invaders, the people had little idea that the domestic turmoil of the times—such as street rioting and the fear of Communism taking over the country—was staged by the leader in an effort to create fear and later capitalize on it. In the ensuing months, this charismatic leader ushered in a series of legislative measures that suspended civil liberties and habeas corpus rights and empowered him as a dictator. On March 23, 1933, the nation's legislative body passed the Enabling Act, formally referred to as the 'Law to Remedy the Distress of the People and the Nation,' which appeared benign and allowed the leader to pass laws by decree in times of emergency. What it succeeded in doing, however, was ensuring that the leader became a law unto himself. The leader's name was Adolf Hitler. The rest, as they say, is history. Yet as I point out in my book Battlefield America: The War on the American People and in its fictional counterpart The Erik Blair Diaries, history has a way of repeating itself. Hitler’s rise to power should serve as a stark lesson to always be leery of granting any government leader sweeping powers.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfDIsMHmfBDCdkJpq8uIFgM	2025-01-22T18:36:02-08:00	
Putin To Trump: Congratulations On Your Inauguration; Now Let’s T...	President Joe Biden has stood out among United States presidents in his refusal for years to talk with the leader of the Russia government. This refusal to talk with Russia President Vladimir Putin has been particularly precarious because over the same time period the US has been delivering large quantities of money, weapons, and intelligence to Ukraine to prop up a military effort against Russia that threatens to spiral into a third world war. Fortunately, Donald Trump, who is set to succeed Biden as US president on Monday, appears to be following a different course regarding communication between the US and Russian governments, as well as regarding the ongoing Ukraine War. Speaking at a January 9 press conference at Mar-a-Lago in Florida, Trump declared that 'President Putin wants to meet' and that a meeting is being set up. 'We have to get that war over with' and 'that’s a bloody mess,' Trump further stated. 'And that’s a war that would have never happened if I were president, and that’s a war that I’m gonna try really to stop as quickly as I can,' continued Trump. On Monday, Putin in public comments congratulated incoming President Donald Trump on his inauguration and declared a desire that dialog restart. 'And now we see their statements about wishing to restore their contacts with Russia suspended by the previous administration,' and 'we’ve heard his commitment to do everything to prevent World War III,' noted Putin. 'Of course, we welcome this approach,' stated Putin who further explained that 'we’ve never been against dialog; we have always been ready to maintain peaceful relationship with any American administration.' Let the dialogue begin, and with it, hopefully, as Putin states in his inauguration day comments 'a long-term peace based on respect to lawful interests of all people and nationalities living in the region.'

Trump Keeps His Promises While Democrats Must Be Abandoned – OpEd	Trump begins his term delivering on promises, but compromised and colluding democrats have ready excuses for betraying their voters. 'Yet, with the return of Trump, opportunists in our communities and beyond are telling us that the real culprits in our oppression and the targets for opposition are Trump and republicans.' Donald Trump is once again president of the United States. The man who was counted out politically after he was charged and convicted of felonies in cases that were legally dubious efforts to keep him out of the white house, once again emerged victorious and is the 47th president of the United States. Trump is a significant figure in U.S. politics, having won two presidential elections when the odds were against him. His success is in large part due to racist appeals to white voters. But those clarion calls might fall on deaf ears were it not for Democratic Party collusion with a greedy plutocracy and its own racism, which consigns its most loyal constituency to opportunistic tokenism. Trump is definitely true to his word. Beginning on his inauguration on January 20, 2025, Trump signed a flurry of executive orders, making real his campaign promises. He reinstated the state sponsor of terrorism designation against Cuba that Joe Biden had lifted just the week before. He pardoned the people convicted of offenses committed when they acted on his behalf and stormed the Capitol building on January 6, 2021. He has set in motion some yet-to-be-determined visa restrictions reminiscent of his 'Muslim Ban.' All federal Diversity, Equity and Inclusion (DEI) staff have been placed on paid leave. While a constitutional amendment will prevent him from moving forward, he began an effort to end birthright citizenship. It is difficult for Black people not to be concerned when a man committed to realizing many of the right wing policies they oppose is back in the white house with majorities in both houses of congress. But one must ask how well Joe Biden met their needs. Aside from making Juneteenth a federal holiday, a move republicans supported as well, how did Joe Biden fulfill their political goals? When leaders of civil rights organizations asked him to use executive order authority in a December 2020 meetinghe refused. '‘On Day 1, I’m gonna have an executive order to do this!’ Not within the constitutional authority. I am not going to violate the Constitution. Executive authority that my progressive friends talk about is way beyond the bounds.' Trump is less concerned about the possibility of challenges or court rulings which could overturn his policies. He is standing by his political commitments while democrats look for reasons to disappoint their voters. The worst possible reaction to Trump’s actions would be to succumb to dejection and resignation. It is clear that ending the reliance on democrats and the electoral process itself is the first step to gaining some degree of political success. The Democratic Party is at a very low point with voters and only 33% of them have a favorable opinion of the wing of the duopoly that Black people still cling to with great devotion. It is true that they may not be down forever. Trump may lose support, democrats may see lightning strike twice and find an Obama-like figure who can skillfully make the public believe that their desires for change have finally come true. Whether they manage to do that or not, focusing on Trump alone is a losing proposition. Doing so stunts any political growth and makes the possibility of any change in the conditions of the masses of the people seem impossible. Independence from the Black political class and other misleaders is the only way to move forward. A new liberation movement has to be forged, one that eschews seeking approval from people who rely on the largesse of an oligarchic class. Even so-called progressives, such as 'the Squad' are of little use. In a conversation with journalist Michael Tracey, former congresswoman Cori Bush gave an astounding explanation for voting to send billions of dollars in public money to fund the proxy war in Ukraine. Bush claims that she did so because of the Biden administration assertion that U.S. troops would have to fight there if congress didn’t appropriate a bottomless pit of money. She said she wanted to keep 'Black and brown bodies' safe from harm and to stop Russia. Bush was defeated in her re-election campaign when the American Israel Political Action Committee (AIPAC) supported her opponent. AIPAC bragged quite openly about their effort to unseat her and she is seen as a progressive icon. Yet she expects a nonsensical explanation for supporting the military industrial complex and U.S. imperialism to be believed. Bush and other so-called progressives backed a dangerous and deadly project that they could have opposed on the merits. Bush’s colleagues still in congress may opportunistically wring their hands over every step of the Trump presidency but as long as they engage in double talking fakery they and their supporters will lose. In the first two years of Biden’s presidency and the democrats’ control of congress they pretended to want what voters asked them to do. Instead they made excuses claiming that phantom parliamentarians prevented them from acting or expressed fear of court rulings that might go against them. The truth is that they don’t work for the people. They work for defense contractors and Wall Street and wealthy donors. They cannot act on behalf of those interests and also help the people. It isn’t possible to back away from their true loyalty. Donald Trump’s vow to take back the Panama Canal may seem foolish but is it different from pledging to fight a proxy war in Ukraine that will defeat Russia? It certainly is no worse than the Biden/Harris commitment to Israel’s ethnic cleansing campaign in Gaza. Trump won’t raise the federal minimum wage but Biden didn’t do that either. The Voting Rights Act enforcement provisions were eviscerated by Supreme Court decisions but Biden didn’t fight to restore them when he might have been able to. No one should be fooled by Trump’s deportation plans when Obama and Biden deported more people than he did in his first term. It is democrats who are building 'cop cities' around the country. It was Biden’s Justice Department which indicted the Uhuru 3. It was Biden who hatched a plan for yet another occupation of Haiti. It may be difficult to ignore the theater surrounding Trump’s executive orders, but remember that Biden refused to do the same thing. More people were killed by police in 2024 than in any year that records have been kept. The faces of imperialism and neoliberal austerity and police brutality will periodically change, but their methods will not. No one can fight Trump who didn’t also fight his predecessors. The struggle during his administration will not be unique but it must be sustained no matter who comes after him. If not, all expressions of opposition are worthless. The history of Black struggle and movement building can be revived if we act as fearlessly as the ancestors we claim to respect.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfDIsMHmfBDCcFvt3lNLz6I	2025-01-22T18:30:59-08:00	
With Assad’s Ouster, Moscow Set To Lose Important Church Ally In ...	Assad’s ouster not only is likely to cost Russia its military bases in Syria but also to drive from office the leader of the Antioch Patriarchate who had distinguished himself both by his pro-Assad positions and his support for the Moscow Patriarchate regarding Ukrainian autocephaly and Putin’s war in Ukraine. Now with Assad and his Russian supporters gone, Syria’s Antioch Change Movement has called for the resignation of Patriarch John X who in its view had 'sullied himself' by collaborating with Assad and Putin' (novayagazeta.eu/articles/2025/01/18/antiokhiia-posle-asada). The Movement is likely to be successful given that John X has many enemies in Syria given that he and Assad changed church rules so that he could be elected in the first place, he failed to investigate the murders of senior churchmen, and he slavishly followed Damascus and Moscow in his policies. John’s removal will affect the 500,000 Christians in Syria, but more than that, it will echo across the Orthodox world, not only because there are roughly three million more Antioch Christians in other countries but because the Antioch Patriarchate ranks third among the ancient Orthodox patriarchates, behind only Constantinople and Alexandria. Up to now, the Antioch Patriarchate has been the Moscow Patriarchate’s most reliable ally in Moscow’s dispute with Constantinople. Now, the Russian church won’t be able to count on a similarly close ally in the future – and that likely means the ROC MP will be more isolated in the Orthodox world than at any time since the death of Stalin. That in turn will mean that the ROC MP will have less to offer the Kremlin and that it will feel compelled to follow ever more closely Putin’s nationalist and imperialist line.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfDIsMHmfBDCSaz5XMZaNjV	2025-01-22T18:28:29-08:00	
Trump Says China Tariffs Could Begin Feb. 1	By Alex Willemyns The first round of promised U.S. tariffs on imports from China could begin as early as next week, President Donald Trump said Tuesday. He also unveiled plans for levies on goods arriving in America from Mexico, Canada and even the European Union. Trump had originally threatened to impose a 10% tariff on Chinese imports and a 25% tariff on imports from Canada and Mexico on his first day in office, after suggesting during last year’s election campaign that tariffs on Chinese goods could even go to 'more than' 60%. But the tariffs were not part of the flurry of executive orders from the new president on his first day back in the White House on Monday. On Tuesday, though, Trump said Feb. 1 could be the day for the tariffs, which he has long said are needed to boost domestic industry. 'We’re talking about a tariff of 10% on China based on the fact that they’re sending fentanyl to Mexico and Canada,' which is then brought into the United States, Trump said after announcing a US$500 billion A.I. infrastructure investment by Oracle, OpenAI and SoftBank. Fentanyl is a highly potent synthetic opioid that U.S. authorities blame for killing tens of thousands of Americans each year. Precursors for the drug are produced in China and then turned into fentanyl by Mexican transnational drug trafficking groups to be smuggled into America. Trump said he had discussed the issue with Chinese President Xi Jinping in a phone call on Friday ahead of Trump’s return to power. 'I said, we don’t want that crap in our country,' Trump recalled. Efforts to stem the outflow of fentanyl precursors from China formed a key part of former U.S. President Joe Biden’s diplomacy with Beijing. A pledge from Xi to crack down on precursor exports was one of three major outcomes of Biden and Xi’s 2023 summit in San Francisco. In the months following that meeting, Biden administration officials largely credited their Chinese counterparts with following through on their promises, but Trump said enough was still not being done. ‘No winners’ Beijing has been careful not to directly criticize Trump in his first few days in office but has nevertheless pushed back against tariffs. At the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, on Tuesday, Chinese Vice Premier Ding Xuexiang did not directly refer to the new U.S. president, but called for a renewed promotion of 'globalization.' 'Protectionism leads nowhere. Trade war has no winners,' Ding told the forum. 'We have the wisdom and capability needed to find a win-win and all-win solution, one that is based on mutually beneficial cooperation, through communication and coordination.' In Beijing, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Mao Ning echoed the vice premier’s remarks when asked about Trump’s 10% tariff. 'We believe that there’s no winner in a trade or tariff war, and we firmly uphold our national interests,' Mao said, adding China would 'maintain communication with the U.S.' to 'properly' handle their differences. China, Mexico and Canada are America’s three largest sources of imports, accounting for around US$536 billion, US$454 billion and US$436.6 billion per year, respectively. They also dwarf all other sources: Japan (US$148 billion) and Germany (US$146 billion) round out the top five. But it’s not only those three that could be targeted. Trump told reporters Tuesday evening that the 27-nation European Union, which together accounts for some US$553 billion in U.S. imports each year, 'treat[s] us very, very badly' and should also be penalized. 'They’re going to be in for tariffs,' the U.S. president said of the European Union. 'It’s the only way you’re going to get fairness.'\	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfDIsMHmfBDCTWzduGQo0iT	2025-01-22T18:24:59-08:00	
Kallas Admits Trump Is Right Over EU Defence Spending Shortfall	By Alexandra Brzozowski (EurActiv) -- Europe must heed Trump’s demand to spend more on defence and shoulder its fair share of responsibility, said the EU's top diplomat, Kaja Kallas. Trump recently said that NATO members must increase defence spending from the current target of 2% to 5%, a figure that even the US does not satisfy. He has previously threatened a withdrawal of support for allies that fail to reach a minimum of 2%. Kallas said it is time to invest, telling an EU defence conference on Wednesday that 'President Trump is right to say we don't spend enough'. She added that the EU should 'shoulder a fair share of responsibility' for Europe's security and that the US should remain a strong ally. Her words came as EU leaders and officials have tried to extend an olive branch to Trump as they await his first policy steps towards Europe. French President Emmanuel Macron was one of the few who did not mince his words. Earlier on Monday, he told top military brass in Paris that European taxpayer money should be invested in homegrown weapons to boost the bloc’s own industry, not only 'buy more American materiel'. Beyond addressing Trump's return, Kallas said the EU should cooperate more closely with like-minded partners. The bloc would take the 'logical next step' of pursuing a new defence agreement with the United Kingdom, describing London as a 'key partner' in facing Russia's threat. EU leaders will meet with British Prime Minister Keir Starmer and NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte on 3 February for informal talks on strengthening Europe's defences. Rutte said he expected Trump's return to 'turbo-charge defence spending and production.'	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfDIsMHmfBDCdssrK73SFp0	2025-01-22T18:23:47-08:00	
Starmer Should Dare To Dream Of A ‘Breturn’ – OpEd	By Mohamed Chebaro It was peculiar to hear Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk saying that he wants a 'Breturn,' or a British return to the EU, after talks with UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer in Warsaw last week. The end of this month marks five years since the UK officially left the EU, a move whose advocates had promised would liberate London from Brussels’ shackling administrative dictates and boost its economy through becoming a 'Singapore-on-Thames.' However, these ill-thought-out and uncosted dreams have broken on the rocks of reality. Since Brexit, the UK’s economy has clearly slowed down, its future growth outlook has taken a hit and billions of pounds have been lost in trade with its closest political, economic and social partner. Brexit has also failed to stem the flow of migrants across the English Channel and the UK has had to replace its European labor force with skilled laborers from farther afield, whose cultures are even more foreign to the UK than European ones. Above all, and even by the admission of arch-Brexiteer Nigel Farage, Britain has not benefited from Brexit and Brexit has 'failed.' However, it seems that the leadership of the Labour Party, which scored a landslide victory at last summer’s general election, continues to be an ardent cheerleader for Brexit, regardless of the economic damage it is continuing to cause. If Farage’s words were not enough, Starmer ought to be encouraged to change course by the fact new Conservative Party leader Kemi Badenoch last week expressed what has long been common knowledge up and down the country: that her party took the UK out of the EU before it had a plan for growth outside of the bloc. She added that previous Conservative governments also set a target of achieving net-zero carbon emissions by 2050 and only then started to think about how they could do it. Similarly, they did not have a clear plan on how to lower immigration before making it a centerpiece of their agenda. Tusk, who was president of the European Council when the UK voted to leave the bloc, said that he would continue to harbor the dream of a 'Breturn' in his heart, as sometimes dreams do come true, even in politics. Like Tusk, Starmer should permit himself to dream, instead of holding firm with his stance that rejoining the customs union or single market is out of the question. In Warsaw, he ratified a bilateral defense treaty with Tusk to deepen ties between the UK and Polish defense industries. This added to the defense deals worth billions of pounds signed in the last few years. There are likely to be more to come, spurred by the Russian threat in Ukraine and beyond. It would be better for Starmer to dream and fail rather than not dream at all. Any large-scale results for the UK’s struggling economy can come only from deeper post-Brexit ties with the EU through a real and courageous trade and partnership agreement. He needs to bring the UK back to the bloc’s market, instead of its current perpetual search for growth and investment in many unlikely corners of the planet. The numbers are on Starmer and his chancellor’s side, allowing them to defend any bold move they might make that could upset those on the political right, as well as the criticism that would surely follow that this Labour government was reopening old wounds. This would certainly give a new platform for populists like Boris Johnson. Bloomberg Economics estimates that the UK is losing £100 billion ($122 billion) a year in output due to Brexit. The UK Office for Budget Responsibility calculates that UK trade has sustained a 15 percent hit in the long run due to exiting the EU market. It is thought that businesses in the UK are suffering across the board and in various ways. The Centre for Economic Performance at the London School of Economics found that more than 16,000 British firms that had previously exported to the EU (14 percent of the total) have stopped doing so since the withdrawal agreement came into effect five years ago. Starmer’s popularity and that of his government is fizzling out. Scraping around looking for economic growth and speaking at all the forums in the world will not improve his ratings, which are very important for any leader. Repeating old stories, such as that he inherited a broken economy and a large deficit from his predecessor, and promising to clean up the UK political arena and return integrity to politicians and policymaking is all well and good. This is why people gave their votes to Labour after years of Conservative blunders. But these are not the only reasons. Those who voted Labour into power also expected to have a less gloomy outlook on life and fewer struggles with the cost of living, if not now then at least on the horizon. But the Starmer government has so far failed to give them a tangible, positive dream and a roadmap to get there. Vague economic figures and charts alone will not cut it, as most of us could better associate with stories. And there is one story that could best change that. It is associated with a historic event that has become one of the root causes of the cost-of-living crisis and the shrinking UK economy. That story contains what could change the image of Starmer from cautious lawyer to political leader. It is for Starmer to make tackling Brexit a gateway to repairing the damage done by his predecessors, instead of continuing to deliver vague fiscal measures that can only rebalance an out-of-balance budget that is lacking a path to clear growth. Starmer’s government has so far been seen as lacking oomph and that is a situation of his own making. He has tried to ride the American horse, which Trump is poised to direct farther away from the UK and other allies in Europe, and the Chinese dragon, which will listen, but only as long as Britain affords it sweeteners and until the next security crisis blows all that out of the water. The UK PM must instead move mountains to reconnect with the EU, if not to regain entry then to at least obtain meaningful agreements that will allow the smoother movement of people and goods. The UK could then tap into the tangible growth available on its doorstep, rather than relying on plans and promises of growth that depend on far-away potential trading partners, the goodwill of the new US president and/or smaller players in Asia or the Middle East.

Deputy Secretary General: Stepping Up NATO-EU Cooperation Is Esse...	NATO Deputy Secretary General Radmila Shekerinska addressed the European Defence Agency (EDA) annual conference 'New Horizons in EU Defence' in Brussels on Wednesday (22 January). She praised the deepening partnership between NATO and the European Union (EU) over recent years and called on even closer cooperation. 'At this dangerous time for our security, stepping up our cooperation is essential,' she said, underlining that EU defence is of 'great importance to NATO, because it is inextricably linked to transatlantic security'. Faced with growing strategic competition and destabilising campaigns against our security and way of life, increasing defence investment and boosting defence production are a priority to ensure countries in Europe stay safe, the Deputy Secretary General said. She welcomed the EU’s enhanced efforts to boost European defence industry, acquire much needed capabilities, and enhance resilience. Moving forward, Ms Shekeinska stressed the importance for NATO and the EU to work hand in hand to avoid the duplication of efforts and to identify more opportunities to leverage each other’s unique expertise, tools and resources. She also encouraged the 'fullest possible' involvement of non-EU Allies’ defence industries, which contribute essential technological know-how and provide urgently needed capabilities.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfDIsMHmfBDCdpKeqrTiRWA	2025-01-22T18:14:22-08:00	
Palau’s Hi-Tech Mission To Preserve Pacific’s Oldest Monuments	By Harry Pearl Palauan tourism official Lelly Obakerbau shakes her head and motions at the encroaching jungle that threatens to reclaim an ancient and largely unknown Pacific archaeological site. 'If we don’t keep this clean, the layers of the terraces will disappear,' she says while walking below the pyramid-like crown of one of Palau’s monumental earthworks. 'Palauans have to be proud of what they have from way back, from their ancestors.' She is determined to spread the word about her country’s unique archaeological heritage. The earthworks of Palau, shaped by humans over the course of millennia, are the earliest expression of monumentality in all of Oceania, according to current research. By at least 2,400 years ago terraces were being sculpted into the volcanic landscape of Palau, backbreaking work that would carry on for about 1,300 years. Records show the monuments predate the World Heritage-listed giant stone moai figures on Rapa Nui – also called Easter Islands – in Chile and the megalithic basalt stone structures of Nan Madol in the Federated States of Micronesia. Nearly 20% of Babeldaob, the largest of approximately 445 islands that make up Palau, is estimated to have been transformed by terraced hillsides, crowns, moats and trenches. Smaller earthworks were also built on the nearby islands of Oreor, Ngerekebesang and Malakal in the archipelago located between the Philippines and Guam. Using primitive tools, early inhabitants altered the landscape in a way that is without parallel in the Pacific, reflecting a complex and well-organized society, skilled in engineering and hydrology, according to archaeologists. 'For Palau to have been able to build so many huge monumental structures so early in time – before any other Pacific Islands – it really says that it was quite advanced,' said archaeologist Jolie Liston, who has been studying the earthworks for more than three decades. Today, however, most of these ancient terraces are hidden under dense forest. Archaeologists have recently been using drones fitted out with laser technology called light detection and ranging [lidar] to map the earthworks and boost their visibility to the public. Lidar takes precise measurements of the earth’s surface by measuring the amount of time laser pulses take to bounce back after hitting the ground. With a grant from the U.S. Ambassadors Fund for Cultural Preservation, Liston and her team surveyed 2,400 acres of terraced landscape in Aimeliik last year using drones. 'The whole point was to capture the full extent of the earthworks under the forest,' she said. 'I could only do a portion of Aimeliik state, which is the area that we’re trying to have for tourism.' The lidar images will inform ongoing research and be used to create a three-dimensional model for a small museum in the Aimeliik visitors’ center. It will allow local students and tourists to visualize the earthworks’ magnitude and be used for training of local tour guides. Archaeological evidence suggests that the earthworks supported burial grounds, gardens, fortifications and were used in ceremonies and rituals. The terraces were also likely symbols to display individual chiefly or polity power, Liston said. Though a number of questions remain about their function and social significance, the scale reflects a high degree of planning and specialized knowledge. Annette Kühlem, an archaeologist at the German Archaeological Institute, said the monuments reshaped previous assumptions about prehistoric life not just in the Pacific islands but beyond. 'For the longest time there was this belief that humans were at the mercy of nature, especially on island environments. They made do with what they found,' said Kühlem, who in 2022 announced the discovery of six skeletons on the summit of one of the monuments. 'This is such a dramatic example of how people reshaped – literally reshaped – an entire island.' Archeologists have been investigating the earthworks since the 1960s, but the structures have not received the attention of other ancient sites in the Pacific, according to Liston. 'They never really caught attention and I think it's because most people don't pay attention to Micronesia,' she said. 'They're really paying attention to Polynesia, Melanesia and Lapita [considered the first people to have settled in Melanesia].' One challenge in piecing together their origins and driving preservation efforts is that the earthworks do not feature prominently in Palauan oral history. 'Oral history in the Pacific is pretty much everything,' Liston said. Drawing on historical writings and interviews with elders, Liston and Melson Miko, a Palauan tourism official, published a paper in 2012 that said that many Palauans were skeptical about their ancestors’ ability to build the earthworks, in part because they didn’t appear in the oral traditions. Elders did recount stories about a mystical time where terraces are depicted as steps linking the gods to heaven and earth. But this was related to specific locations or individual features, rather than a generic explanation of how or by whom earthworks were constructed, the paper said. Some have even speculated they were built by an early wave of settlers, though there is no archaeological, linguistic or genetic evidence suggesting that today’s population is not directly descended from the archipelago’s earliest inhabitants, Liston and Miko reported. Exactly when and where the first Palauns migrated from is unclear but the most likely region of origin is considered to be Southeast Asia based on linguistic similarities and the evaluation of sea currents, Kühlem said in a study published in 2022. According to Liston, by the time of Western contact in the late 1700s, the use and meaning of the terraces had been forgotten after centuries of abandonment as the population moved to stonework villages along the coastline. 'We’ve been trying to get the word out not just to the world, but so that Palauan people realize how fabulous they [the terraces] are and will have more pride in their construction, the architecture and want to preserve them,' she said. Today, efforts to preserve and promote the earthworks face a number of challenges: a lack of financial support, limited technical capacity, and difficulties navigating the complex system of customary land ownership. Environmental restrictions on burning in Babeldaob have also allowed the jungle to grow back unchecked over the past decade. In her tourism role with the Aimillik government, Obakerbau works on a small budget and with just two staff to raise awareness about the earthworks – something she admits is 'very tough.' 'I want historical and cultural heritage in my state Aimeliik to be more active,' she said, adding that the government is now getting onboard 'I’ve been trying to encourage the kids to do classes at the community college in tourism and archaeology, because if you’re Palauan you have to know your places. 'You have to know what was happening back then and what is happening today.'	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfDIsMHmfBDCS8uCzcBC_y3	2025-01-22T18:09:58-08:00	
ASEAN’s Balancing Act: Challenges And Opportunities In Trump’s 20...	ASEAN is a regional organization in Southeast Asia that acts as a link between the superpowers and ensures stability in the region of interest. During the period of former American President Donald Trump, there were changes in US-ASEAN relations that would not have left an indelible mark on the economic and political development of the block. Protectionism, selective engagement in diplomatic relations, and the growing American-Chinese rivalry over Trump’s 'America First' policy brought ASEAN into a more complex international environment. The region faces the continued impact of his first term, evolving regional dynamics, and the return of Trump to the presidency in 2025 raises challenges. This question paper aims to contribute to the debate on the current state and future of the Association of South East Asian Nations (ASEAN), considering the return of Donald Trump to the White House in 2025. Given the complexity of the above-mentioned issues, the paper employs an analytical approach to understand the implications of the return of Donald Trump for his second term in dealing with ASEAN. The challenges include navigating superpower rivalry, enhancing cooperation among the member countries, managing tensions with the superpowers, and the possibility of ASEAN remaining a key player in the Indo-Pacific region. During his first term, Trump’s policies had a significant impact on ASEAN’s development. For instance, his decision to quit the Trans-Pacific Partnership Partnership (TPP) was a big blow to the ASEAN trade facilitation agenda. The TPP was a multilateral agreement that aimed at enhancing trade relations among the member countries in the Pacific Region and, in the process, enhancing the integration of the ASEAN member states. Bilateralism vs. multilateralism shift by Trump left ASEAN searching for new and alternative trade agreements, including the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) signed in 2020. This trade agreement, which comprises all the member states of ASEAN, as well as China, Japan, South Korea, Australia, and New Zealand, has since become the largest free trade agreement in the world. However, the absence of the US in such frameworks reduces the influence of ASEAN in the economic relations between the US and China. In addition, the trade war between the United States and China has had a significant impact on the economies of Southeast Asia. Both the opportunities and the disruptions that resulted from the increasing tariffs between the two global powers were felt in the region. For instance, Vietnam was one of the countries that benefited from the new investment environment because foreign direct investment (FDI) investment continued to flow into the country to take advantage of alternative production areas to China. In 2024, FDI in Vietnam was $27.72 billion, which shows that there was still a lot of interest in its export-led economy. However, other ASEAN countries have problems such as low demand for their products and supply chain disruptions which expose the weak spots of the association. A second Trump presidency could increase such uncertainties, especially if his administration imposes additional tariffs or reshoring policies that affect international trade patterns. In the political diplomacy arena, Trump’s ASEAN policy has been characterized as unconstant and pro-China. When he came up with the American strategy in the Indo-Pacific region, which focuses on a 'free and open Indo-Pacific,' ASEAN’s response to this strategy was not very positive. On one hand, the problem remains the use of coercion as a strategy, particularly in the South China Sea. On the other hand, the lack of attendance by the leaders of ASEAN at several summits with the President of China has raised questions about the reliability of the United States as a strategic partner. This situation has left ASEAN leaders wondering about the stability of the region. This means that a second Trump administration could continue with the transactional approach that may well exacerbate ASEAN’s problem of how to relate to the US and China. Other challenges that make ASEAN’s situation worse include internal factors. The main challenge to the unity of the association has always been the diversity of political systems, economic interests, and external alignment of the member countries. For example, while Vietnam and the Philippines are against the claim of China in the South China Sea, other member states like Cambodia and Laos that have close relations with China are not very aggressive in their stance. This division makes it difficult for the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) to present a united front on important issues such as the South China Sea dispute. As of 2024, China remains ASEAN’s largest trading partner with a trade value of over $970 billion. This economic interdependence complicates the bloc’s efforts to establish its own identity in the context of the growing American-Chinese competition. On the external front, ASEAN is facing several pressures from changing international circumstances. The Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) of China has enhanced the influence of China in the region because many countries in the region are participating in huge infrastructure projects that are changing the face of economics in these countries. However, debt sustainability and sovereignty concerns persist, as seen in Laos, which has a debt-to-GDP ratio of over 60%. In addition, the focus of the US. Under Trump transactional diplomacy is likely to exacerbate these challenges, as ASEAN states have to balance their economic benefits in the short-run with their strategic autonomy in the long-run. Additionally, the unpredictability of Trump’s foreign policy may erode the confidence of ASEAN states in the consistency of American policy. For example, the sudden change in the level of American military support or the sudden withdrawal of security commitments can embolden the aggressors in the dispute areas and thus create more tension in the region. However, there are some opportunities through which ASEAN can prove its relevance and resilience. The gross domestic product (GDP) of the association was $3.9 trillion in 2024, which makes it the fifth-largest economy in the world and this is a clear manifestation of its economic significance. For instance, the AOIP (ASEAN Outlook on the Indo-Pacific) is a clear manifestation of the association’s vision to stand in the middle of the map and promote the principle of inclusivity in the region. Furthermore, ASEAN’s Economic sector, which is predicted to grow to $330 billion by the end of 2025, is an area with many opportunities for development in the areas of e-commerce and financial technology. Hence, based on these strengths, ASEAN can attract investments and promote integration within the region to diversify its relations with other partners and reduce its dependence on other countries and their policies. In conclusion, the return of Donald Trump to the presidency in 2025 is both an opportunity and a threat to ASEAN. On the one hand, his policies may provide ways of bilateralism and cooperation, economic on the other hand they may increase the uncertainty in trade, security, and regional cooperation. The ability of ASEAN to navigate this complex situation depends on the unity, flexibility, and visionary leadership of the association. By enhancing cohesion among its member states, expanding its paradigm of partnerships, and asserting its role in the Indo-Pacific, ASEAN can ensure stability and prosperity in the era of increasing geopolitical rivalry. Hence, the success of the association will be determined by how well it can strike a balance between the two superpowers and protect its common interests without compromising its principles in the changing global order.

Pity The Poesy: Mark Rutte, NATO And Spending For War – OpEd	There have been politicians who have fancied themselves as poets. There was Herman Van Rompuy in April 2010 who, when President of the European Council, imposed an anthology of haiku poetry unimaginatively titled Haiku on family members, friends, dignitaries and members of the press. Japanese diplomats were predictably diplomatic in their reception. 'A poet perhaps remains best away from politics, at least from political action,' Van Rompuy claimed daringly, despite being picked to become the first European Council president in November 2009. He reconciled this dilemma with some crafty muddling. 'In that sense I am a politician-haiku poet rather than a haiku poet-politician.' NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte seems to have been tempted, albeit briefly, by this notion of the poet-politician or the politician-poet. While his speech at the Concert Noble in Brussels last December can never qualify for any decent anthology of poetry, it illuminates his, and NATO’s position, on ongoing war in Ukraine. Rutte is a martial type keen to advance the rule of the gun in the service of the alliance. The result is the evil of banality delivered in poesy. A chief function of NATO’s public relations efforts lies in justifying its own existence. Instead of dismantling or finding more peaceful pursuits at the end of the Cold War, it became the groomed emissary of US power in Europe, while never being explicitly described as such. Former Warsaw Pact countries still aching from the legacy of Soviet garrisons and the influence of Moscow gathered around the NATO flame like abused patients seeking counselling. Despite assurances to a weakened Russia by the United States and a number of Western European leaders that no eastward expansion of the alliance would take place, country after country was added. The index of animosity and suspicion accordingly rose in The Kremlin. It falls on Rutte to make things look bleak and suitably dismal, especially when it comes to threats facing the alliance. 'I’ll be honest: the security situation does not look good,' he solemnly declares. 'It’s undoubtedly the worst in my lifetime. And I suspect in yours too.' Flagging the phobia of invasion and the march of dark forces indifferent, if not openly hostile to democracy, the Secretary General notes that the distance from Brussels to Ukraine can be driven in one day. Ukraine at war is the epicentre of his concern, as is Ukraine facing authoritarian forces acting in concert. 'That’s how close the Russian bombs are falling. It’s how close the Iranian drones are flying. And not much further, the North Korean soldiers are fighting.' With Ukraine seen as civilisation’s post child – and a Western one, no less – we get a picture of Russia’s President Vladimir Putin’s efforts of 'trying to crush our freedom and way of life.' He is keen on erasing Ukraine altogether, 'trying to fundamentally change the security architecture that has kept Europe safe for decades.' This is, like so much poetry that seeks to depict war with a propagandist’s mind, fantastically absent of context. It is an absence that continues to magnify the dangers of opponent and foe, seeing them as historical reminders of other aggressors. Be wary of appeasement; be wary of giving ground. In Rutte’s words, 'for too long, we did not act.' Not in Georgia in 2008 or Crimea in 2014. 'And many did not want to believe that he would launch all-out war on Ukraine in February.' Worry is expressed at Russia’s war economy, the very economy that European and US sanctions was to miraculously cripple. Russian military spending as a share of GDP would be 7 to 8%. Its industry was prolifically busy in tank production, armoured vehicles and ammunition. The purpose: a 'long-term confrontation' with Ukraine and NATO. To show that NATO’s eyes are not cast merely towards Moscow, Rutte picks on that other bogeyman located even more eastwards. Here, he sounds like an official on secondment from the Pentagon, Washington’s eager megaphone in Europe. 'From 200 warheads in 2020, China is expected to have more than 1,000 nuclear weapons by 2030.' They are investing heavily in space-launch technology. They are bullying Taiwan. And just to colour in the rest of the paper, we are reminded about North Korea and Iran. Moscow, Beijing, Pyongyang, and Tehran, all keen 'To chip away at our freedom' and 'reshape the global order.' This concern is palpable, perhaps understandable given US-NATO efforts to reshape the global order after the Cold War and the disappearance of the bipolar order. With the US in sole charge, its administrations packed with neoconservative vigilantes keen to redraw boundaries, maps and 'chip away' at any architectural foundation they disliked, the rise of this axis of opposition is clearly distressing. That distress takes one clear form. NATO must become even more militaristic. 'It is time,' Rutte declares, 'to shift to a wartime mindset.' Time to 'turbo-charge our defence production and defence spending.' To not 'spend more together now to prevent war, we will pay a much, much, much higher price later to fight it.' On meeting greater production targets and increasing defence expenditure, he is confident. Those virtuous arms for freedom will be found in Thales in France, a Rheinmetall factory in Italy, and Turkish Aerospace Industries in Türkiye. Overall, Rutte’s wretched speech-poem glorifies war, which NATO is already engaged in vicariously through Ukraine, seeing a healthy, thriving military-industrial complex as indispensable to fight foes and 'maintain long-term deterrence.' Europe, in a long slumber, had 'hollowed out' its defence industry through 'underinvestment and narrow industrial interests'. The slaughter, in other words, must be kept up in Ukraine, not merely for its bloodied sake, but for desk mandarins in Washington and Brussels and all those grateful arms manufacturers keen to make a steal. 'The pity of war, the pity war distilled,' wrote Wilfred Owen, the First World War poet who knew more than a thing or two about the subject. Pity that Rutte did not acknowledge that side of it.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfDIsMHmfBDCXH544SP64FE	2025-01-22T18:02:42-08:00	
New Chinese Bishop Ordained Under Vatican-China Agreement	By Jonah McKeown The Vatican announced this week that Pope Francis has erected a new diocese in China and appointed Father Anthony Ji Weizhong as its first bishop. The pope decided last October to suppress the Diocese of Fenyang in mainland China, which was originally erected in 1946 by Pope Pius XII, and at the same time erect the new Diocese of Lüliang. Diocesan borders have been an area of dispute between the Vatican and China in the decades since the Chinese Communist Party came to power and started to redraw diocesan lines, seeking to bring them more in line with Chinese administrative boundaries. Indeed, the territory of the newly-created Diocese of Lüliang conforms to the territory of the city of Lüliang, located about 400 miles southwest of Beijing in western Shanxi province. It will serve a total population of 3.3 million people, of whom approximately 20,000 are Catholics. A total of 51 priests and 26 religious sisters serve in the diocese. Pope Francis appointed Weizhong as bishop of Lüliang on Oct. 28, 2024, having approved Weizhong in the context of the 'Provisional Agreement,' better known as the Vatican-China deal, which appears to give the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) some ability to choose episcopal candidates. Weizhong, 51, was ordained a priest in 2001 for the Diocese of Fenyang. He studied in China and in Germany and served in Fenyang as deputy parish priest, head of the diocesan pastoral center, and as vicar general. He was ordained on Jan. 20 at the Cathedral Church of the Sacred Heart of Jesus. The see of the Fenyang Diocese remained vacant after the death of Bishop Huo Cheng, who spent 14 years in prison during the Cultural Revolution and had led the Church of Fenyang in communion with the Holy See since 1991, AsiaNews reported. Weizhong is the second Chinese bishop to be ordained since the Vatican in October renewed its 'Provisional Agreement' with China on the appointment of Catholic bishops for an additional four years, until at least Oct. 22, 2028. Shortly after the Vatican renewed the deal last fall, Matthew Zhen Xuebin was consecrated as the new coadjutor bishop of Beijing, having been appointed in August. Originally signed in September 2018, the provisional agreement was previously renewed for a two-year period in 2020 and again in October 2022. The terms of the agreement have never been made public, though Pope Francis has said it includes a joint commission between the Chinese government and the Vatican on the appointment of Catholic bishops, overseen by Vatican Secretary of State Cardinal Pietro Parolin. The Holy See has acknowledged that China has several times violated the terms of the agreement by unilaterally appointing Catholic bishops in Shanghai and the 'Diocese of Jiangxi,' a large diocese created by the Chinese government that is not recognized by the Vatican. Chinese officials have reportedly ordered the removal of crosses from churches and have replaced images of Christ and the Virgin Mary with images of President Xi Jinping, according to a 2024 report from the United States Commission on International Religious Freedom (USCIRF). USCIRF also reports that the Chinese Communist Party’s (CCP) 'sinicization of religion' campaign has led to censored religious texts, clergy forced to preach CCP ideology, and the required display of CCP slogans in churches.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfDIsMHmfBDCbuofv7p8eIb	2025-01-22T18:00:52-08:00	
Biden Was Right About Oligarchy – OpEd	Over three score years ago, President Dwight Eisenhower had a warning for America. 'We must guard against the acquisition of unwarranted influence, whether sought or unsought, by the military-industrial complex,' Eisenhower exhorted in his 1961 farewell address. 'The potential for the disastrous rise of misplaced power exists and will persist.' 'We must never let the weight of this combination,' Ike continued, 'endanger our liberties or democratic processes.' Sadly, Eisenhower’s warning went largely unheeded. In the years since, the 'military-industrial complex' has morphed into an even more worrisome concentration of wealth and power. In his own farewell address, President Joe Biden gave that concentration a grim label. An 'oligarchy' of 'extreme wealth, power, and influence,' Biden intoned, now 'literally threatens our entire democracy, our basic rights and freedoms, and a fair shot for everyone to get ahead.' We now face a 'dangerous concentration of power in the hands of very few ultra-wealthy people,' a reality that Biden warned is eroding our 'unity and common purpose' and fomenting 'distrust and division.' The end result? We stand today unable to adequately confront the challenges that face us. America’s oligarchs, Biden explained, are wielding 'their unchecked influence to eliminate the steps we’ve taken to tackle the climate crisis.' By resisting safeguards over artificial intelligence — 'the most consequential technology of our time' — they’re also opening the door to 'new threats to our rights, our way of life, to our privacy, how we work, and how we protect our nation.' Perhaps most ominously of all, these oligarchs are burying Americans 'under an avalanche of misinformation and disinformation.' 'Participating in our democracy,' the departing president lamented, has become 'exhausting and even disillusioning' for average Americans. They no longer 'feel like they have a fair shot.' But Biden also stressed that by working together, average Americans can shear our new oligarchy — and its 'tech-industrial complex' core — down to democratic size. We can get the 'dark money' of billionaires out of our politics. We can ban members of Congress from making stock trades while they’re legislating. We can tax the richest among us and make sure they’re paying their fair tax share. In the days right after Biden’s farewell address, progressives added more specifics to Biden’s list of antidotes to oligarchy. We could and should, as former U.S. labor secretary Robert Reich pointed out, either bust up giant, billionaire-owned tech media platforms like X and Facebook or start treating these platforms as public utilities. We could even ban our wealthiest from owning critical media properties. But realizing any of these reforms won’t be easy. Our wealthiest have never enjoyed a greater direct presence at our government’s highest levels. Nothing symbolized the reality of this oligarchic power like Trump’s second inauguration. The inaugural ceremony featured America’s three richest men — Elon Musk, Jeff Bezos, and Mark Zuckerberg — seated prominently in attendance, alongside other billionaires, as Trump addressed the nation. 'Everybody,' a satisfied president-elect Trump mused last month at a Mar-a-Lago news conference, 'wants to be my friend.' Well, no, not everybody. Just everybody with a grand fortune that our new president — and his Republican controlled Congress — can zealously safeguard and grow. So what can the rest of us do? With Trumpism locked in federally, we can challenge our oligarchs at the state and local level. Maryland’s governor, for instance, has proposed a series of tax changes that would raise the combined state and local income tax rate on most Marylanders making over $1 million a year to 10.7 percent. But Maryland, one of the nation’s richest states, could do better. Rich Californians are already paying taxes at a 12 percent rate. But that won’t happen more broadly unless average Americans organize — and confront our oligarchs at every opportunity.

Acting Secretary Of Defense Robert Salesses On DOD Actions Respon...	On Monday, to protect the security and safety of United States citizens, President Trump declared that a national emergency exists at the southern border of the United States. The President directed me to take all appropriate action to support the activities of the Secretary of Homeland Security in obtaining complete operational control of the southern border of the United States. Yesterday, I convened a meeting with the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, the senior Policy leaders of the Department of Defense (DoD), the Commanders of U.S. Northern Command (USNORTHCOM) and Transportation Command (USTRANSCOM), and the Chief of the National Guard Bureau (NGB), directing them to move out immediately in support of President Trump’s Executive Orders on protecting the territorial integrity and citizens of the United States. At my direction, DoD established a Task Force to oversee expedited implementation of the Executive Orders. This includes employment of U.S. military forces to carry out directed missions called for by the President. Commander, USNORTHCOM is the operational lead for this effort, supported by USTRANSCOM, the Military Services, and the NGB working alongside the Department of Homeland Security (DHS). I approved three immediate actions that will begin today: First, DoD will begin augmenting its forces at the southwest border with an additional ~1500 ground personnel, as well as helicopters with associated crews, and intelligence analysts to support increased detection and monitoring efforts. This represents a 60 percent increase in active-duty ground forces since President Trump was sworn in Monday. Second, the Department will provide military airlift to support DHS deportation flights of more than five thousand illegal aliens from the San Diego, California, and El Paso, Texas sectors detained by Customs and Border Protection. DHS will provide inflight law enforcement, and the State Department will obtain the requisite diplomatic clearances and provide host-nation notification. Third, the Department will begin assisting in the construction of temporary and permanent physical barriers to add additional security to curtail illegal border crossings and illicit trafficking. This is just the beginning. In short order, the Department will develop and execute additional missions in cooperation with DHS, federal agencies, and state partners to address the full range of threats outlined by the President at our nation’s borders. President Trump directed action from the Department of Defense on securing our nation’s borders and made clear he expects immediate results. That is exactly what our military is doing under his leadership.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfDIsMHmfBDCTVeVmX6Pq_t	2025-01-22T17:51:13-08:00	
Preventing And Responding To Tragedies: The Magdeburg Terrorist A...	The Magdeburg terrorist attack of December 2024 has had a huge effect on the German and international community’s perception of the safety of large public events. December 20, 2024, will forever remain a sad reminder of an incident that occurred in Magdeburg when a vehicle was intentionally driven into a crowded Christmas market near the city hall and caused the death of two people including a two-year-old child and sixty-eight people were injured thirty-five of them seriously. This heinous crime which was committed by Taleb Al Abdulmohsen, a 50-year-old Saudi Arabian doctor shows that the issue of combating lone wolf type of terrorism has not been solved yet and that even such important events as culture can not be entirely protected. The consequences of the attack called for closure of the markets and explosive checkpoints, and at the same time called for improved security measures in the public. The tragedy continues to support the need for a comprehensive strategy that incorporates strong community-oriented security with international partnerships to reduce risks while maintaining community relations. One of the major issues of the Magdeburg attack is that it is difficult to identify and, therefore, prevent the so-called lone-wolf attacks. While it is difficult to disrupt coordinated terrorist attacks, lone wolves are often hard to identify and plan their operations in isolation. Al Abdulmohsen, who had been living in Germany since 2006, showed the symptoms of social and ideological disaffiliation that did not raise the suspicion right away. His social media activity showed him as an anti-Islamic, perceived as being oppressed, which is a characteristic of many persons who commit such acts. This is a problem because it makes it rather difficult for intelligence services to determine who is likely to go on to make threats and who is only voicing discontent. This type of attack is in line with other occurrences that have happened in Germany, particularly the 2016 Berlin Christmas Market attacks; this highlights the frequency of this threat and the necessity of early prevention. The consequences of the attack are not limited to the material damage and the people who were killed or wounded, it also has an impact on the trust of the people, the number of attendees of events, and the morale of the society. Christmas markets have been a part of the festive season and culture and thus have become easy targets for those who want to strike and create terror. The physical evication of the market in Magdeburg and other markets including the one in Erfurt presents the paradox between the need to secure public places and the desire to observe traditional events. Also, the incident called attention to the question of the effectiveness of the physical barriers, including bollards and barriers to vehicles that could have limited the damage. Nevertheless, the incident which took place in Germany revealed that there are still weaknesses that need to be eradicated even though the country has a rich history of implementing such barriers in response to previous attacks. To avoid such incidents in the future it is crucial to take several measures. Improving the physical security of mass events should be at the forefront of security planning. The use of Bollards, Planters and fortified barriers must be a standard feature in any event that involves a large number of people as these seemingly harmless systems barriers with discourage vehicle use assault. Besides, artificial intelligence physical infrastructure, be other very technologies helpful such as identifying facial potential recognition threats before anomaly detection becomes a threat. Thus, these technologies can be used in public places to recognise threats within crowds of people without infringing on the rights of individuals. Another critical element of counter-terrorism is community involvement. The lone wolf type of attackers may show changes in their behaviour or make complaints that if identified earlier can be contained. Community-based initiatives that encourage acceptance of diversity and provide resources for the oppressed can also help in reducing feelings of isolation. It is thus important for campaigns that aim at changing individuals’ behaviours towards positive and constructive causes to address issues of misinformation, hate and division. This is because efforts that are made by the public in reporting any suspicious activity through hotlines or local programs can act as an added security measure. Thus these grassroots efforts not only increase security but also foster unity of the society and thus neutralize the intentions of terrorists. On the policy front, there is nothing like international cooperation. Thus, stricter screening procedures for those who have been previously identified as having ideological biases must be respected while protecting human rights. This is because terrorist threats can be identified and reported across the border and within the European Union as well. The work of Germany in creating the international standards of COE in the area of counter-terrorism can provide the groundwork for a more coordinated and more efficient approach to such incidents. In addition, there are some important measures which should be implemented after the incident has taken place, for example, comprehensive victim support programs and community healing activities. Offering medical, psychological, as well as financial support to the victims and their families not only meets the basic needs but also enhances society’s ability to bounce back from a devastating incident. However, there are still some issues to be addressed. The issue of increasing security measures and at the same time ensuring that the freedoms and civil liberties that are enjoyed in democracies is a constant battle. Too much surveillance or profiling poses the risk of alienating the population and worsening conditions that lead to radicalism. Also, the actions of lone wolf attackers are highly unpredictable therefore even with the best precautionary measures in place, there is no guarantee that another attack cannot be conducted. Other barriers that hinder the integration of technologies in the healthcare sector include; the cost of implementation for small municipalities that are likely to host events. Thus, the case of Magdeburg is a tragic example of how the threat of terrorism has not decreased and how a comprehensive approach is needed to tackle it. The work that remains is to increase the levels of security, work with the communities, and cooperate at the international level to decrease the risks. However, these measures should be taken with the understanding that the effort is to ensure that society remains open and accepting, two principles that terrorism seeks to dismantle. While Germany and the rest of the world mourn the victims of Magdeburg we can change our loss into something positive and make sure that open spaces are not turned into places of fear and segregation.

Philippine Missile Crisis And Taiwan Contingency – Analysis	The indefinite deployment of a powerful U.S. weapon system in the northern Philippines and Beijing’s strong reaction to it has the makings of a new missile crisis. Manila wants to acquire a Typhon mid-range capability (MRC), but Beijing warned this would trigger a dangerous arms race. Manila argues that its procurement decision is driven by its own security calculus. But the cost, sophistication, and nature of this capability and the timing fuel doubts, adding to the boiling cross-Strait flashpoint. South China Sea or Taiwan Strait? Typhon MRC was installed in Laoag in northern Luzon during a joint Philippines-United States exercise last April and has stayed since, much to China’s chagrin. Laoag City is the capital of Ilocos Norte province, the stronghold of the powerful Marcos family. President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. served as vice governor, governor, and representative of the province’s second district. His late father, strongman Ferdinand Sr., also served as a representative before becoming a senator and, eventually, president. Hence, stationing Typhon in the city suggests it has the nod from the highest official in the land. Choosing Laoag may be both strategic and expedient, given its location and buy-in of national and local leadership. Other provinces, like neighboring Cagayan, have aired unease about increased U.S. military presence, worried this may affect Chinese investments and put them directly in harm’s way should hostilities break out. The storm brought by the appearance of the Typhon was preceded by the expansion of U.S. military access in the northern theater closer to Taiwan. This fueled speculation that the move was more in line with a cross-Strait crisis rather than deterring China in the South China Sea. From where it is presently fixed, the MRC can fire missiles that can hit targets way beyond the South China Sea, including the Mainland, Taiwan, and parts of the Western Pacific. Beijing replied to this unprecedented prolonged arms deployment by staging its first intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) test in 44 years. The Typhon deployment infuriated China. Not even U.S. allies, such as Japan and South Korea, have allowed installment of the platform on their territory, possibly anticipating China’s reaction. While Seoul’s THAAD bid may be understood in light of Pyongyang’s growing nuclear and ballistic arsenal, no other South China Sea claimant has seen China’s maritime grab in such stark view as to warrant hosting a foreign lethal missile system on their soil. Beijing claimed the move was destabilizing, a view Manila was quick to refute. Likely to assert agency, Manila said it is keen to induct a Typhon to strengthen its defense posture. Owning the capability may be a ploy to allay concerns that the country is simply granting the U.S. free reign to use its territory for its larger strategic goals. The logic is that Philippine-owned U.S. arms on Philippine soil mean the button will be pushed by someone from Manila, not Washington. This is akin to South Korea’s order for a Terminal High Altitude Area Defense battery, which also riled Seoul’s ties with Beijing. No bystander? But at what cost and risk? Due to its proximity and the presence of over 150,000 Filipino nationals in Taiwan, a cross-Strait emergency presents dilemmas for the Philippines. Manila already struggles to deal with Beijing in the South China Sea in the west and would not wish to have another front in the north. But the prospect of a forceful takeover of the self-ruled island worries the Southeast Asian country. While Manila abides by the 'One China Policy,' it maintains unofficial ties with Taipei, which is also an important trade partner and investor. Allied exercises in northern Luzon and Batanes, expanded American military footprint, and Typhon’s indeterminate placing in that space can be seen from the prism of the Taiwan crisis. Three of the four new agreed locations for US military presence are in northern Luzon. For the first time in the history of the Philippines-US Enhanced Defense Cooperation Agreement (EDCA), a naval base was opened for US access. Camilo Osias Base in Santa Ana, Cagayan stares at Taiwan across the Luzon Strait. Four of the five original EDCA locations are all air bases further south. The other one is an army base. Typhon was stationed at Laoag International Airport. Another new EDCA site was the Lal-lo airport in Cagayan. That both Laoag and Lal-lo are civilian airports suggests that even strategic non-military real estate can be tapped in a possible contingency operation. All these developments give the impression that Manila is warming up to a possible Taiwan emergency, which some estimate may happen by 2027. Washington is reportedly keen on building a potential dual-use port in Batanes closer to Taiwan. Northern Luzon was a theater for joint Philippine-U.S. military exercises last year. Last October, Philippine and U.S. marines staged drills to evacuate displaced Filipino migrant workers, a scenario that may happen should armed conflict break out. Hence, Beijing’s intensified pressure on its smaller neighbor may be more in reply to Manila taking steps aligned with the U.S. broader deterrence initiative to prevent Beijing from using force against the island. Marcos said that EDCA sites will not be used as staging grounds to target another country. EDCA facilities are also said to be useful for humanitarian assistance and disaster relief (HADR) operations. Northern Luzon and Batanes being at-risk for strong typhoons make it a palatable pretext. But China is not buying it and is vigilantly watching Philippine and U.S. actions in this space. Beijing discourages other countries from intervening in the Taiwan issue, saying it is a domestic matter. Even before its ICBM test, China had already warned the U.S. and its neighbors to stay clear of Taiwan. The southernmost of the six exclusion zones where China undertook drills in response to the 2022 visit of former US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi to Taipei included waters and airspace off northern Batanes. Five ballistic missiles fired by China during that exercise landed in Japan’s EEZ. These actions are messages to Manila and Tokyo, two US allies closest to Taiwan, and are counted upon by Washington as crucial in deterring forcible attempts to change the status quo across the Strait. Philippine participation in a Taiwan emergency is a delicate issue. Repatriating its nationals in Taiwan is a top priority for Manila. It may also help evacuate other foreign nationals, including citizens of fellow ASEAN countries like Indonesia, Vietnam, and Thailand, which also have big communities on the democratic island. Manila may also permit medical evacuation to Batanes. Delivery of food, medicines, and other basic humanitarian supplies may be considered. Further steps may depend on the country’s comfort level, given the grave hazards involved. Pressure from the U.S. is expected, especially if the latter decides to play a big role in Taiwan’s defense, something to watch under the second Trump administration. However, an anxious domestic Filipino public may also dissuade the government from joining the fray, especially if the stakes are not sufficiently conveyed. Due to its own turbulent ties with Beijing over the South China Sea and its traditionally strong alliance with the U.S., Manila may not be in a good position to broker a cross-Strait dialogue. But predisposing the country to bear U.S. arms as the only way to matter in a Taiwan Strait crisis shows a dearth in imagination. As a founding father of ASEAN, the Philippines, at the minimum, can support ASEAN or an ASEAN country like Singapore or Indonesia to play a more robust role in defusing tensions.

Shaping China’s Periphery: BrahMos Missiles In Southeast Asia – A...	By Atul Kumar One of the crucial objectives of Indonesian President Prabowo Subianto’s visit to New Delhi in January 2025 as a guest for India’s Republic Day celebrations is to explore the BrahMos supersonic missile system’s acquisition. After the Philippines and Vietnam, Indonesia is poised to become the third enthusiastic customer in Southeast Asia for this lethal missile. These states are particularly interested in the land- and ship-based anti-ship variants of the BrahMos, whose prominent utility lies in countering Chinese interference in their naval operations in the South China Sea. The missile’s proven capabilities have already led to its acquisition by the Philippines, while potential deals with Vietnam and Indonesia are underway. Malaysia and Thailand, meanwhile, are considering it for future procurement. However, the BrahMos missile’s induction in China’s immediate vicinity, especially in its contested maritime region, has raised concerns within the Chinese leadership. BrahMos missiles in Southeast Asia The BrahMos missile system has emerged as a highly successful and in-demand weapon produced and exported by India. Developed through an Indo-Russian joint venture, the BrahMos is based on the Russian P-800 Oniks 'Yakhon' missile system, with significant refinements to its features and capabilities. It is a mid-range, ramjet-powered supersonic missile designed for use across all domains—air, sea, and land. The BrahMos can achieve speeds of Mach 2.8 and has a range of up to 800 kilometres; however, export versions are capped at a range of 290 kilometres due to MTCR restrictions. Indian forces have inducted multiple variants of this missile into their own inventory since 2007. Despite its induction into the Indian military, the BrahMos faced challenges in finding export opportunities. Initially, it competed directly with the Yakhont missile, which Russia supplied to Indonesia (2007), Vietnam(2010–2011), and others during the early 2010s. India also encountered Russian resistance over intellectual property, complicating export prospects. The Indian government’s cautious approach in consideration of Chinese sensitivities also influenced decisions, particularly relevant for Southeast Asian buyers such as Vietnam. Most of these impediments have diminished as India’s technological dependence on Russia for this missile’s production has substantially decreased. Moreover, as India-China relations frayed and Beijing intensified its aggressive behaviour, India abandoned its self-imposed restrictions on defence exports. Consequently, the BrahMos missile emerged as a key instrument in India’s defence diplomacy in the 2020s. The Philippines was the first to benefit from this shift, finalising a deal worth US$375 million in January 2022 to equip its marines with three missile batteries. The agreement included training and maintenance support, and the first missile system was delivered in April 2024. This acquisition seems to have bolstered the Philippines’ interest, as its forces are now negotiating for additional missile batteries. Vietnam, a second potential customer, has shown interest in the BrahMos since the 2010s. The country is now finalising a US$700 million deal for five missile batteries, with techno-commercial details already shared. Similarly, Indonesia is negotiating a US$450 million contract, which, once finalised, will further solidify India’s Act East Policy for the defence sector in Southeast Asia. Both Vietnam and Indonesia previously purchased Russian Yakhont missiles, with Vietnam operating the Bastion-P system for coastal defence and Indonesia deploying ship-based anti-ship missiles. Yet, rather than replacing them with similar Russian systems for simpler logistics, both nations have opted for the Indian alternative, reflecting their strategy to diversify defence imports and reduce their dependence on Russia amid global uncertainties. The BrahMos missile’s advanced features and reputation have played a crucial role here. Moreover, Indonesia’s deal might proceed using a national currency arrangement, potentially setting a precedent for future transactions with other buyers. The Chinese conundrum For China, the proliferation of the BrahMos missiles in its immediate neighbourhood, particularly in contested maritime regions, poses a significant challenge. China is acutely aware of the missile’s advanced features, including its dart-like shape for strong penetration capability, radar-absorbent coating for stealth, ramjet engine that limits the adversary’s response time, and its highly accurate composite guidance system comprising INS (Inertial navigation system), SNS (Sensor Network Simulator) and A/P (anomalous propagation) radar components. Additionally, its anti-interference capabilities make the BrahMos a reliable long-range, fire-and-forget missile. Chinese experts have described it as a potential 'troublemaker for international security' due to its capabilities and reach. Notably, in 2021, the BrahMos missile’s deployment near India’s Line of Actual Control (LAC), following the Galwan incident, provoked heated reactions from China, which viewed the move as an obstacle to bilateral talks. China’s concerns regarding the BrahMos are threefold. First, it is dismayed by Russia’s agreement to allow BrahMos exports to the Philippines and other Southeast Asian nations, perceiving Russia as indifferent to China’s national security concerns.[1] Second, Chinese scholars argue that the BrahMos’ deployment in Southeast Asia can disrupt the South China Sea’s stability, triggering a regional arms race and escalating tensions and confrontations in existing hotspots. Third, the potential deployment of BrahMos in Vietnam for coastal defence and anti-ship operations is particularly troubling for China, as it will have a clamping effecton the South China Sea’s western side. In the Philippines case, simulations suggest that the launch of 24-36 BrahMos missiles could significantly damage a Chinese aircraft carrier battle group, giving Filipino forces considerable leverage in their maritime regions. As the Philippines deploys BrahMos missiles in Zambales and Luzon provinces, with potential future deployments in the Calayan, Lubang or Palawan Islands, these missiles could cover critical areas such as the Scarborough Shoal, the Second Thomas Shoal, and the region extending from the Taiwan Strait to the Spratly Islands. China also cannot rule out the possibility of collusion between Vietnam and the Philippines. In counter, Chinese analysts argue that Filipino and Vietnamese forces lack the long-range radar systems to provide targets for the BrahMos missiles. However, in the case of disputed islands like the Scarborough Shoal, the location of targets is well-known. Furthermore, the Houthis in Yemen have demonstrated that a lack of advanced ISR (Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance) capabilities cannot deter them from sending missile attacks against Saudi, Israeli and American assets across the Middle East. In addition, the Philippines has been acquiring radar systems from Japan and Israel, among others, to establish radar bubbles around its maritime periphery. Moreover, the BrahMos missile is a particular threat to China’s large naval platforms, namely, landing ships and coast guard vessels lacking sufficient air defence capabilities. China may consider using sea-based, missile, and air firepower to neutralise these missiles on the ground; however, such actions risk triggering the Mutual Defence Treaty between the Philippines and the United States. Therefore, since July 2024, China has begun employing darker grey zone warfare tactics to dissuade the Philippines from becoming a major strategic threat. Conclusion In China’s view, India is pursuing multiple objectives through its BrahMos missile deals. These include hedging against Sino-Indian relations, positioning itself as a major and reliable arms exporter, and bolstering its maritime partnerships in Southeast Asia, all while leveraging its naval presence to influence land disputes with China. Furthermore, the Philippines and Vietnam could serve as relay bases for Indian naval operations, while the Indonesian acquisition and future deals with Malaysia and others will further boost India’s arms exporter profile globally. The BrahMos deal can act as an anchor contract for India’s future arms sales in the region. This strategy will effectively counterbalance China and its arms supplier behaviour in South Asia. Beyond military implications, China perceives the BrahMos missile contracts with Southeast Asian nations as India’s step to strengthen its strategic ties. These deals are likely to foster long-term military-to-military relationships through training, spare parts, and maintenance support, working to align these countries’ security interests with India’s. Combined with existing political and diplomatic initiatives in the Act East Policy, such defence partnerships will further enhance India’s profile and leverage in the region.

The Trump Threat: How Worried Should South Africa Be? – Analysis	The cracks in US-SA bilateral ties are more than apparent, but not all is gloom and doom. By Ronak Gopaldas and Priyal Singh As the world braces for Donald Trump’s return, uncertainty looms over the future of the international geopolitical landscape. While Africa has historically been a peripheral focus for the United States (US), South Africa has increasingly drawn Washington’s ire for its perceived antagonistic foreign policy positions. Pretoria’s ties with Moscow, Beijing and Tehran, combined with its legal challenge against Israel at the International Court of Justice, present serious diplomatic flashpoints. Policymakers and investors in Pretoria and Washington must carefully consider the major fault lines in their bilateral relationship over the coming years. Two pressing questions are: what has changed since Trump’s first term, and what does this mean for relations with South Africa? The global and US economies are more volatile than during Trump’s initial presidency. In 2017, he inherited favourable economic conditions marked by low inflation, accommodative monetary policy and strong consumer confidence. Those conditions have evaporated. The US federal debt has ballooned to over US$33 trillion from US$19 trillion in 2016, driven by pandemic-era spending, infrastructure investments and chronic deficits. Higher interest rates compound these pressures, eroding fiscal stability. Inflation – subdued during Trump’s first term – persists despite aggressive Federal Reserve rate hikes. Trump’s penchant for tax cuts and fiscal expansion could worsen deficits, undermining investor confidence in US economic stewardship. Geopolitical instability exacerbated by wars in Ukraine and the Middle East has disrupted energy markets and heightened global divisions. Financial markets may be underestimating the economic consequences of Trump’s return. His first term featured a mix of policies marked by deregulation and tax cuts, followed by destabilising trade wars. Trump’s second term could see a swift return to protectionism, including tariff escalations that suppress growth, stoke inflation and destabilise global supply chains. Investors expecting a dovish Federal Reserve may instead encounter sustained monetary tightening Investors expecting a dovish Federal Reserve could instead encounter sustained monetary tightening, as Trump’s populist policies keep inflationary pressures high. Initial optimism around deregulation and tax relief may quickly be overshadowed by the broader economic fallout. Emerging markets such as South Africa are especially vulnerable to the dual threats of reflation and redollarisation. Trump’s protectionist agenda and potential geopolitical flare-ups could reignite inflationary pressures or disrupt commodity prices, driving investors back to the US dollar. This would reverse prior rate cut benefits and weaken currencies across emerging markets. The global geopolitical environment has also shifted. The liberal world order, while battered during Trump’s first term, remained largely intact, buoyed by leaders like Angela Merkel and Emmanuelle Macron. Today, this liberal consensus is fractured. Illiberalism and far-right movements are surging, while multilateral institutions struggle with flagging credibility. Trump’s populist and ideologically fluid agenda will likely resonate more in this context and threaten traditional alliances. Closer to home, US-South Africa interactions have frayed since Trump’s first administration. The introduction of a 2024 bill calling for a review of relations underscored the extent of this souring bilateral relationship. With Republicans dominating both Houses of Congress, the question is whether such legislation will now be passed. There is considerable political appetite in Washington for punitivemeasures to be adopted against South Africa. And there is perhaps no greater form of leverage that Washington wields over Pretoria than South Africa’s continued inclusion as a beneficiary of the African Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA). Set to expire in September 2025, AGOA provides preferential access to the US market for various goods, supporting thousands of jobs and generating critical foreign revenue. AGOA could be the perfect catalyst for a recalibration in relations between the two countries While South Africa will need some fancy footwork to avoid exclusion, AGOA could be the perfect catalyst for a recalibration in relations between the two countries. Several factors support this constructive yet contrarian outlook. First, Washington uses AGOA as a political tool rather than an economic one, whereas the opposite is true for South Africa. This discrepancy suggests a deal can be done, especially given Trump’s dealmaker instincts. If anything, an approach that uses more stick than carrot could draw South Africa closer to the US and force it to moderate its positions on, for example, Israel and Russia. Pretoria was given a long leash by the Obama and Biden administrations – there will be less leniency under Trump. However, Washington must also tread carefully; overplaying its hand risks alienating Pretoria and driving it further into the orbit of rivals like Moscow and Beijing. For South Africa, the market and reputational risks of AGOA exclusion are substantial. The country must use its status as a gateway to Africa, its critical mineral resources, and its democratic credentials to position itself as indispensable to US interests. Second, South Africa’s Government of National Unity offers an opportunity to reset relations by creating daylight between what it represents versus the policies of the previous African National Congress (ANC) administration. Appointing pragmatic figures like Ronald Lamola, Parks Tau and experienced diplomat Ebrahim Rasool signal a more conciliatory approach. And with South Africa hosting the 2025 G20 summit and the US hosting it in 2026, President Cyril Ramaphosa has an opportunity to build a personal rapport with Trump – which may prove pivotal over the coming years. SA needs more direct and flexible foreign policy with the US, with tangible material interests stated upfront Although many aspects of US foreign policy towards South Africa are beyond Pretoria’s influence, several steps could ensure cooperation on shared priorities. South Africa must quickly understand what will replace Biden’s ‘21st Century US-African Partnership’. Under a more transactional ‘America First’ approach, Pretoria needs to tailor appropriate foreign policies that more directly situate its own material interests with Washington. This may prove challenging as Pretoria has long struggled to clearly define and pursue its national interests in isolation from the shared interests of African or Global South countries. And despite the Government of National Unity, foreign policy remains largely unchanged and dominated by the ANC’s ideological international relations outlook, grounded in an outdated commitment to progressive internationalism. More direct and flexible foreign policy is needed with the US, with tangible material interests stated upfront. Engaging the incoming Trump administration on grand ideas like the need to reform the global multilateral order will simply be a wasted opportunity. What will likely resonate is deeper cooperation on creating a more enabling environment for private investment and developing a more robust export-led South African economy. How to pursue the former with other international partners while pursuing the latter with Washington, will test the mettle of South Africa’s foreign policy establishment over the next four years, and should be confronted head-on.

Is Prabowo’s 100-Minister Cabinet A Step Towards Autocracy? – Ana...	By Adi Abidin As he began his presidency, Prabowo Subianto’s ‘Red and White Cabinet’ reveals a swift and aggressive consolidation of power, positioning himself as the dominant political force in the country. With over 100 individuals in top government roles — a ‘100-minister cabinet’ — Prabowo leverages this structure to entrench loyalty, neutralise opposition and tighten his grip on Indonesia’s political and government institutions, paving a potential pathway towards autocracy. Indonesia has not seen a 100-minister cabinet since former president Sukarno. Sukarno’s autocratic ‘Guided Democracy’ prompted a sprawling cabinet to consolidate power, but this political move could not prevent his ultimate downfall. Due to this unsuccessful precedent, Prabowo’s strategy raises concerns of repeating autocratic tendencies under the guise of inclusivity and stability. Prabowo’s cabinet comprises 48 ministers, five cabinet-level officials, 55 vice-ministers and numerous senior advisors, envoys and agency heads. An expansive cabinet structure is not entirely novel, as it builds on a framework established by his predecessor, Joko ‘Jokowi’ Widodo. With no party commanding a majority, the House of Representative’s (DPR) eight factions reflect a fragmented electorate, requiring alliances to establish a legislative majority. Prabowo’s strategy in securing the allegiance of six of the eight gives his coalition control of about two-thirds of the DPR. This leaves only the Indonesian Democratic Party of Struggle (PDI-P) and the NasDem Party without representation in the government. Nonetheless, Megawati Soekarnoputri has indicated that her PDI-P will seek cooperation with the government, especially after her party’s candidate won the Jakarta gubernatorial election. Strategic appointments were key to this consolidation. Leaders of major coalition partners were rewarded with powerful coordinating ministerial roles. Portfolios accorded to parties also reflect their strength in parliament. The Golkar Party — the DPR’s second-largest faction — was granted numerous portfolios, including prestigious ministries. Indonesia’s vast sociocultural diversity requires adequate representation in the government. Prabowo’s cabinet mirrors the nation’s mosaic population, with individuals from major religious communities, ethnic groups and regional constituencies. This includes figures from Aceh, Papua, Minahasa, Bali and Chinese–Indonesian communities. Prominent Muslim organisations like Nahdlatul Ulama and Muhammadiyah are also well represented, reflecting their enduring influence and ensuring cultural and institutional affiliations are leveraged for political stability. While this inclusivity may be superficial, it bolsters legitimacy and facilitates patronage. The cabinet recognises the growing role of campaign teams, volunteers and financial backers in Indonesian politics. These groups have been rewarded with ministerial roles to secure their ongoing support. Extra-political party groups could be instrumental in mobilising support in countering oppositions. Prabowo’s reliance on technocrats for crucial portfolios reflects a recognition of Indonesia’s complex policy challenges. The economic team, crucial for balancing stability and growth, includes experts like Sri Mulyani Indrawati (finance), Rachmat Pambudy (planning) and Budi Gunadi Sadikin (health). Businessmen-politicians Erick Thohir and Rosan Roeslani manage state enterprises and investments, reflecting strong private-sector ties. Prabowo —like Suharto before — recognises that economic stewardship is pivotal for political success. Prabowo’s inner circle — his so-called ‘kitchen cabinet’ — is composed of trusted confidants and operatives. Prasetyo Hadi, the Minister for the State Secretariat, is a long-time Gerindra party loyalist who oversaw Prabowo’s vast forestry business interests. Sugiono, Prabowo’s former long-time aide, is Minister of Foreign Affair. And Thomas Djiwandono, the President’s nephew and Gerindra’s treasurer, is Vice-Minister of Finance. While not holding any formal government title, Prabowo’s brother — Hashim Djojohadikusumo — wields immense influence over policies and decisions in ways reminiscient of the informal role the first family played in governance during the Suharto era. The armed forces and security, a personal domain of the president, are managed by trusted comrades such as Sjafrie Sjamsoeddin in Defence and Muhammad Herindra at the State Intelligence Agency. Retired police generals, Budi Gunawan and Tito Karnavian, handle political and security affairs as well as home affairs. Numerous retired flag officers hold strategic posts. Leaders in Indonesia’s National Armed Forces and the national police operate under assignments orchestrated by Prabowo to align with his priorities. This deep military involvement consolidates power around the presidency and could weakens civilian oversight — reminiscent of Suharto’s time — raising concerns about a drift towards autocratic control. Prabowo’s 100-minister cabinet represents an audacious experiment in governance. Its meticulous construction reflects a balancing act — accommodating political allies, addressing sociocultural sensitivities and ensuring technocratic competence. But accommodating too many interests might prioritise political expediency over effective governance. More significantly, the massive consolidation of power risks further undermining Indonesia’s democratic trajectory. By subsuming opposition voices and distributing patronage broadly, the cabinet erodes the checks and balances essential for a healthy democracy. Overrepresentation of loyalists and political allies undermines the independence of state institutions, fostering a governance culture centred on loyalty over competence. This shift mirrors global patterns where power centralisation has paved the way for autocratic regimes. The early stages of Prabowo’s tenure underscores a troubling trajectory towards centralisation, cloaked under the guise of coalition-building in a fragmented democracy. His 100-minister cabinet, while presenting itself as a testament to political ingenuity, risks dismantling Indonesia’s democratic foundations. This ambitious structure consolidates power by rewarding loyalty over dissent, marginalising critical voices and embedding a culture of patronage at the highest levels of government. Far from promoting stability, this experiment may erode the delicate balance of power, setting a precedent that endangers the checks and balances crucial for democratic governance.

The Demoralizing Downward Spiral Of Algorithmic Culture – OpEd	In need of a letter certifying that I do not suffer from a disease of international concern, I headed out to my primary care practitioner last Monday. Knowing how busy most doctor’s offices are these days, I decided I’d make it easy on the staff by bringing a) a copy of the WHO’s International Health Regulations (IHR) regulations on diseases of international concern b) a list of the diseases currently covered under this rubric and c) explicit instructions about the elements such a letter must include (i.e. letterhead of the practice, stamp of the practice, doctor’s signature etc.). They assured me that they were familiar with this procedure and that it would be no problem. And when I mentioned that it would be great if they could do it in both English and Spanish, I was assured that would be no problem either as there was a Spanish-speaking provider on staff who could write it up in that language. But again, in the interest of facilitating things, I provided them with a copy of this very type of certification letter written for me some time back by a doctor in Spain. This 'letter,' such as it was, consisted of one sentence of 27 words in Spanish and a couple more than that when rendered into English. Given that there were two staff members present, and that one of them was scrolling on her phone, I figured it would be a simple matter of one of them quickly writing up the letters, checking my file to see if I had any of the diseases of international concern (I had been there a week previous for my annual checkup) and catching my doctor (or one of his colleagues) between patients for a quick signature. However, when I asked the woman in front of me how long it would take, she replied, 'Three to five business days. That’s the procedure. We’ll call you when it is done'. When I told them that I needed it for an appointment first thing on the following Monday in New York and that if I didn’t have all the documents, it would be months before I got another one, they just repeated the mantra that it would be done toward the end of the week, probably late on Friday. On Friday, at 1:45 I received a call saying the letter was ready for pickup. Relieved, I entered the office, checked the letter quickly, and headed out. Upon rechecking it at home, however, I realized that it had not been signed by the doctor, which was one of the first requirements on the list of directions I had handed them on Monday. So back I went to the office and explained to them it would be inadmissible for the bureaucratic procedure in question without that signature. By this time it was getting toward 3:15 in an office scheduled to close at 5:00. The woman behind the counter said she really didn’t know what she could do. I said, 'Why don’t you just write it up and grab one of the doctors in the practice (I had been shifted by them from one doctor to another owing to scheduling jam-ups on their end during the last few years) to sign it?' adding, 'After all, it does not involve disclosure of any of my personal clinical details other than the fact that I do not have any of the mentioned diseases.' After listening to me and saying nothing, she ran off to talk to her manager. When she got back she said, 'I’m going to put an order in for it,' and began typing into her computer looking for the page where she could 'put in an order' for something that could literally be done in 2-3 minutes. I said somewhat incredulously 'Put in an order at this point?' and repeated the idea of typing the letter anew and grabbing one of the doctors between appointments. She said 'That’s not the procedure' and besides, 'Your doctor is no longer in the office,' implying that while they could shift patients from one doctor to the other according to their scheduling needs, my asking that a member of the same ostensibly interchangeable team of doctors carry out this simple task on the same premise was an anathema. After another trip to the invisible manager, she returned saying I could leave and that they’d call me when and if the issue is resolved. An hour later I received a call saying everything was arranged and that I could come and pick up the letter. With a smiling face, she handed me the 27-word letter. But there was only one problem. It was signed not by a doctor but an APRN. When I explained that the directions clearly said that it needed to be signed by a doctor and that the foreign government agency I was taking it to was notorious for rejecting documents that did not conform exactly to their requirements, a confused frown returned to her face. She asked me to sit in the waiting room and ran off to the manager again. It was now 4:45 in the afternoon, 15 minutes before closing time. About 10 minutes later, the heretofore invisible manager emerged, and with a smiling face, assured me that the issue would be resolved shortly. And so it was. At 4:55 she emerged with the letter signed by the only remaining MD at the office, grabbing her, I presume, as she emerged from one of her sessions with a patient. In other words, the issue had been finally resolved by the very unalgorithmic, but highly practical and personal manner I had proposed four days earlier. So, what’s the moral of the story? Before getting to that, I should perhaps say what it is not; the idea is not to point out that the nice people at the office are all irretrievably stupid…at least not yet. Rather it is to demonstrate a phenomenon that is rampant in culture that we seldom talk about openly, never mind decry with all the fury that it deserves. It is the story of how a managerial elite possessed of generalized contempt for the bulk of their fellow citizens and a slavish adherence to an extremely narrow, algorithmically-generated notion of 'efficiency' has created scores of so-called idiot-proof systems that dehumanize and demoralize those who work in or engage with them. And while these systems are wildly successful at walling off the corporations that design them from the need to listen to and mindfully serve those who buy their goods and services, they are not, as my little story above shows, even efficient in any meaningful sense of the term. Those of us of a certain age who have worked in office settings all know (or knew) that person, that wonderful person with a vibrant personality, quick intelligence, and top-notch social skills to whom you could always turn to get things done in a pinch. She—and yes, it was usually a she—knew where all the bodies were buried and the strengths and weaknesses of every person in the house, something she would leverage to make things happen in the most unobtrusive and efficient way possible, pulling those she worked with out of tight spaces again and again along the way. It pains me to say this, but it seems these linchpins of workplace culture are in extremely short supply today. And it’s not, as many people assume, because we lack people with the aptitude to perform in this impressive multimodal manner in our society. No, it is because, despite all the HR-generated rhetoric proclaiming the opposite, the people who design and run the systems within which we work are often true nihilists for whom the magical and life-giving processes of human relations, and what some students of psychological development call 'human becoming,' mean next to nothing. Caught in the 'measure-grab-and-control' tyranny of the algorithmic mind, they cannot even begin to imagine how those they see as lesser than them, might, if left to their own devices, be capable of generating greater efficiencies than their vaunted oh-so-rational systems…and usually with a heaping portion of increased human joy as part of the bargain. Worse yet, they do not realize that putting people in systems that assume they are stupid will, in the long run, make those who have intelligence (and what person doesn’t?) truly and profoundly stupid, sad, and ultimately unresponsive to anyone or anything in the long run. Is that what the managerial elite truly want? Or is it that their imaginations are already so impoverished by fantasies of algorithmic perfection that they truly do not understand the wave of spiritual destruction they have set in motion and feed daily? I honestly wish I knew. This article was published at Brownstone Institute	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWc3VBrWu5eMlY_WJTM0D8x6	2025-01-21T16:09:48-08:00	
Assessing The Biden Presidency – OpEd	If public opinion polls are the guide, Joe Biden has been the worst president since Richard Nixon. Yet New York Times economics writer Peter Coy gives Biden high marks. 'Biden’s handling of the economy was good, if not great,' he writes. After all, we have record low unemployment, moderating inflation, and economic growth. What’s not to like? Here is the problem. Most of the time, presidents have only a marginal impact on the economy. Consequently, they should be judged not on what happened on their watch, but what they did or didn’t do relative to what happened. Energy. During the presidential campaign, both Joe Biden and Kamala Harris boasted that U.S. oil production was at an all-time high. Yet one of Biden’s first acts as president was the cancellation of the Keystone pipeline, which would have brought oil from Canada to the U.S. He went on to pause new oil and gas leases on federal lands. In the waning days of his administration, he banned offshore drilling on large swaths of U.S. waters. So yes, U.S. oil production is at an all-time high. But that is not because of Biden. It’s in spite of Biden. Taxes. The best thing you can say about Biden’s tax policy ideas is that almost none of them were enacted. When Donald Trump became president, the U.S. had one of the highest corporate tax rates in the world. Trump tax reform cut the top rate from 35 percent to 21 percent—resulting in more investment, more output and a larger economy. Biden proposed to cut that tax break in half. Kamala Harris at one point favored eliminating it altogether. Biden also proposed additional taxes on investment income—including unrealized capital gains. I know of no economic model that predicts the economy will get bigger when you impose taxes on capital. The Biden plan also proposed a 12.4 percent Social Security tax on all wages above $400,000, and he repeatedly said families who earn less than that amount would be completely unaffected. However, the income threshold isn’t indexed for inflation. So eventually, all families would be paying the tax, even if they had no increase in real income. Take a 20-year-old couple earning $100,000. With a 2 percent inflation rate and 2 percent productivity growth, that couple would be paying the Biden payroll taxsometime in their 50’s. Worse than the ideas themselves was Biden’s rhetoric. He repeatedly claimed that the wealthy do not pay their fair share. Yet the U.S. tax system is the most progressive in the world—with the top 1 percent paying 40 percent of all income taxes and the top 10 percent paying almost three fourths. Biden has repeatedly claimed that Republicans—going all the way back to Ronald Reagan—have only cut taxes for the rich. Yet the reason why we have the world’s most progressive tax system—with the bottom half of the income ladder paying almost no income taxes at all—is because of Republican tax legislation. Regulation. Another impediment to a strong, vibrant economy is excessive government regulation. The Biden administration weakened the cost-benefit standard that was previously in place—making costly regulations easier to impose. Without even counting Operation Warp Speed (which produced the Covid vaccine), University of Chicago economist Casey Mulligan finds that the Trump administration reduced regulatory costs by almost $11,000 per household in present value. By contrast, the Biden-era regulations created a burden of almost $10,000 per household. Here again, the economy did well during the Biden years. But not because of Biden’s policies toward business enterprise. It was in spite ofthem. Unions. Joe Biden boasts that he has been the most pro-union president in U.S. history. There is some truth to that. The Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), and other Biden-era federal policies often require the use of union labor, or require paying a prevailing (union) wage, or include financial incentives to hire union labor on federal projects. But how does that help the economy as a whole? It doesn’t. A union is an attempt to monopolize the supply of labor in some sector of the economy. If successful, the union members will enjoy a monopoly wage. Yet those gains appear to be at the expense of wage income for other workers, not at the expense of capital. When measured correctly, labor’s share of national income has been roughly constant at about 70 percent—for the last century. Over that period, union membership varies—rising to a third of the workforce in the 1950s and then falling to only 6 percent of private sector workers today. These radical changes in union membership appear to have had no impact at all on labor’s aggregate income. Inflation. Economists do not agree on why we had excessive inflation during the Biden presidency. I side with monetary economist Scott Sumner, who says that what we have experienced is almost totally a demand side phenomenon. The government deposited money right into people’s bank accounts. It funded those deposits by borrowing in the credit market, and the Federal Reserve bought most of that debt with newly created money. When people spent their newly acquired funds, they drove up prices. That said, there is one thing economists are unanimous about: The Biden/Harris explanation of inflation is hogwash. There is no such thing as an economic theory of inflation based on greed. The President and the Vice President of the United States repeatedly told the public something that all economists know isn’t true. Health Care. On more than one occasion, Biden promised, 'I will never cut Medicare.' Yet the IRA cut more than $300 billion out of the Medicare Part D program. As a result, drug insurance premiums for seniors last fall would have doubled right before the November elections had the Democrats not found a dubiously legal end run. They 'borrowed' money from the Medicare trust fund and gave it to insurers who agreed not to raise premiums. That election-year gimmick didn’t solve a problem. It merely delayed the problem. The IRA did put a $35-a-month limit on the price of insulin, and it provided for negotiated prices for 10 drugs for Medicare beneficiaries. But the very same bill delayed for a decade a Trump regulation that would have required pharmacists to pass on manufacturer discounts to patients. The net result: 10 percent of beneficiaries will experience lower drug costs, in most cases less than $300 a year. The remaining 90 percent will potentially pay more. Biden can rightfully claim credit for enhanced subsidies in the (Obamacare) exchanges, and that has substantially increased enrollment. But this is the wrong solution for the wrong problem. We are over-subsidizing the healthy and under-subsidizing the sick. Half the people with individual insurance are paying no premium at all. We are literally giving the insurance away. But the out-of-pocket exposure for someone with high medical expenses is $9,200 a year and twice that for a family. News coverage. The mainstream media routinely uses the word 'lie' to describe even small exaggerations by Donald Trump. Yet I have never seenthat word applied to Joe Biden, despite false statements about how our tax system works, how his own tax plan worked, what causes inflation, and what the IRA did to seniors. Maybe there was a Pinocchio once in a while. But never a 'lie.' Just as they ignored the president’s mental health decline, they ignored his dishonest rhetoric. One can only imagine what the poll numbers would look like had the press coverage been more accurate.

Is Trump Really Going To Practice Military Restraint? – OpEd	The three popular pillars of Donald Trump’s electoral success have been grievances about immigrants, unfair trade practices by other countries, and American 'forever wars' overseas. The last one of these beefs was legitimate and fueled by the interventionist U.S. superpower’s major quagmires or debacles in Cuba, Vietnam, Cambodia, Laos, Iran, Lebanon, Somalia, Iraq, Libya and Afghanistan. As an example, a recent op-ed by John F. Sopko, who, as special inspector general for Afghanistan reconstruction since 2012, chronicled the profligate waste of lives and money during the latter half of the two-decade U.S. fiasco in Afghanistan, convincingly argued that bureaucratic incentives in the U.S. military and other agencies to claim success rendered the truth of failure to long be kept from American taxpayers. That problem can be found in the other American catastrophic failures as well. To his credit, during his first presidential term Trump had concluded the Afghan War was a loser, signed an agreement with the Taliban to withdraw U.S. forces from Afghanistan, but failed to carry it out before he left office. Joe Biden, his successor, after a short delay, agreed with Trump about the war and took a big hit in the popularity of his new administration when the U.S.-supported Afghan regime collapsed rapidly during the American troop withdrawal, leading to some chaos and more American and Afghan deaths. Biden’s bad experience is why politicians and bureaucrats stay in foreign quagmires; because they don’t want to be tarred with the almost inevitable friction and blame that comes with cutting national losses and exiting. Thus, during his second term, because of his prior campaign rhetoric about ending forever wars, Trump might be expected to be leery of using threats or intimidation that could lead to armed conflict or even a long-term military bog abroad. Yet during the interregnum between his recent election and inauguration, he has complained about high fees to transit the Panama Canal and threatened to take it back (presumably with military force since the Panamanians are unlikely to volunteer giving back the Canal Zone), menacingly demanded to buy Greenland, and joked about making Canada the 51st state. Finally, during the campaign, Trump was asked by Fox News about launching cross-border military attacks on Mexican drug cartels and replied, 'Mexico is gonna have to straighten it out really fast, or the answer is absolutely.' Mark Esper, one of Trump’s defense secretaries during his first term, claims Trump asked for military options against the cartels and was barely talked out of ordering them. Trump’s current aides are building the case for employing such drastic options during a second term. Most of Trump’s implicit or explicit threats so far have been directed at much weaker countries in the Western Hemisphere. Yet during his first term, he also threatened countries in East Asia and the Middle East and took aggressive action in the latter region. Before doing an about face and trying to negotiate with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, Trump had implicitly threatened nuclear war with the hermit kingdom by saying that North Korea would be 'met with fire and fury and frankly power, the likes of which this world has never seen before.' It also was reported that Trump privately discussed the possibility of using a nuclear weapon on North Korea and blaming it on another country. In the Middle East, Trump rashly canceled the multilateral agreement with Iran to limit its nuclear program in exchange for the relaxation of economic sanctions and later assassinated the second most powerful Iranian official when he visited Iraq, thus roiling relations with both countries. His proposed appointees for secretary of defense, Pete Hegseth, and ambassador to Israel, Mike Huckabee, oppose Palestinian self-determination and seem to embrace a 'Greater Israel.' This view usually advocates annexing the West Bank and resettling Gaza after Palestinians are removed. Finally, Trump has vowed to put fewer limits on weapons exports to Israel than even the few the Biden administration imposed. Thus, in a second term, even if Trump avoids U.S. military quagmires on the ground, he may still take or allow allied countries to undertake aggressive military action. Let’s hope his macho bluster against friendly countries in the hemisphere or adversaries further abroad is just to get some sort of negotiating advantage, because even limited military actions—such as, cross-border attacks against Mexican drug cartels, especially without the Mexican government’s consent—could turn into disastrous bogs if things don’t go well; Vietnam, Iraq and Afghanistan come to mind.

Kazakhstan Rapidly Moving To Become Dominant Naval Power On The C...	Three developments have opened the door for Kazakhstan’s growing ability to challenge the dominance of Russia’s Caspian Flotilla on the inland sea and become the dominant naval force on the body of water. These include Moscow’s transfer of many of the flotilla’s vessels to the Sea of Azov as part of its war against Ukraine; the drying up of the sea itself, which means there are an increasing number of places its larger ships cannot operate; and Kazakhstan’s ambitious naval construction program, which Türkiye and most recently by the United Arab Emirates are aiding (see EDM, August 1, 2023; Window on Eurasia, March 27, September 21, 2024; Nezavisimaya Gazeta, January 15; Orda.kz, January 16). Given the importance of the Caspian to Moscow as a means of end-running Western sanctions and expanding ties with Iran and the Global South, this last trend has alarmed some in Moscow. Nikolai Patrushev, a Kremlin hawk, has demanded that the Russian government work to expand the flotilla to be able to counter challenges (see EDM,August 16, 2022, March 6, 2024; Kaspiskii Vestnik, November 14, 2024). As a result of Russian President Vladimir Putin’s focus on the war in Ukraine, however, that is unlikely to happen anytime soon. Kazakhstan is certain to use its growing naval power to expand its influence in the region and even put pressure on Moscow. Both the People’s Republic of China (PRC) and Iran may do so as well, given their growing role in helping Russia keep the canal system that allows Moscow to transfer ships between the Caspian Sea and the Sea of Azov (Window on Eurasia, March 27, 2024). Before the disintegration of the Soviet Union, Moscow and most of the world treated the Caspian Sea as a Russian lake dominated by Russia’s Caspian Flotilla. Even when the new littoral states emerged, many observers continued to look at the Caspian this way not only because the initial small sizes of these countries’ navies and of the ships comprising them compared to that of the Russian Flotilla but also because of the relative advantage the Russian fleet had in terms of firepower (see EDM, June 24, 2021). As a result, few have prepared to recognize two seismic shifts that have occurred over the last several years, and the balance of military power there requires rethinking. On the one hand, and most immediately obvious, Moscow has increasingly viewed the Caspian Flotilla as a reserve for its attacks on Ukraine and has regularly transferred ships from that unit to the Sea of Azov to support Russia’s land attacks on Ukrainian targets. That use has seriously reduced the effective firepower of the Caspian Flotilla on the Caspian, cutting back the advantage Russia had relative to the navies of other countries and encouraging them to imagine a larger role for themselves. By 2020, Kazakhstan had more ships than Russia did on the Caspian, but they were, in all cases, smaller and much less heavily armed. Five years later, with the expanded war in Ukraine and the departure of Flotilla ships, Kazakhstan’s numerical advantage is greater, and Moscow’s firepower advantage far less. This has forced Moscow, however, to turn to the PRC to help keep the river-canal system open, allowing such transfers to be opened, an arrangement that gives Beijing leverage over Moscow (Window on Eurasia, March 23, 2022). On the other hand, the Caspian’s water levels are falling rapidly, clogging ports and making it impossible for large ships to approach the shores in many places (see EDM, November 16, 2023). After resisting for years, Russian specialists now concede that Caspian water levels are falling by 68 centimeters (27 inches) a year, a decline that could ultimately point to the death of the sea if it is not reversed and will mean that many ports and links to rivers and canals will be left high and dry (Kaspiskii Vestnik, September 15, 2024). The consequences of that for Moscow’s north-south trade and ability to shift the Caspian Flotilla back and forth between the Caspian and the Sea of Azov as it has up to now are so enormous that even Russian President Vladimir Putin has felt compelled to order regional officials to do something about it. Little evidence exists, however, that his words have yet had much impact (Window on Eurasia, August 29, 2024). These declining water levels already mean the Volga-Don canal is operational for less than nine months a year. Moscow hopes to expand that to 12 months by 2028, but this is unlikely to happen without more outside help. That, in turn, has sparked discussions about building a new and larger canal through the North Caucasus, although the prospects for that are slight as long as the war in Ukraine continues, given the costs involved and Western sanctions (see EDM, March 29, 2019, August 6, 2020, June 1, 2021). Regarding navies in particular, falling water levels in the Caspian further degrades Russia’s advantage there and improves Kazakhstan’s relative position. Since Kazakhstan gained independence in 1991, the country has elected to develop a naval force based on smaller ships that can navigate shallower waters (see EDM, April 24, 2013). Unsurprisingly, Astana has organized naval exercises right up to the Russian sea border to show what it is now capable of, something it would not have done earlier (Window on Eurasia, March 30, October 25, 2024; Kazakh Defense Ministry, September 27, 2024). Holding such exercises helps explain Astana’s increasingly independent line concerning Russia and the appreciation of that independence by other countries in the immediate neighborhood and further afield in the Middle East and beyond. Kazakhstan is unlikely to be the only country to respond to the relative decline of the power of Russia’s Caspian Flotilla. After a slow start, however, it has gone further than other littoral states. The other littoral countries—Azerbaijan, Turkmenistan, and Iran—will also likely expand their naval forces there. Countries such as the PRC and Türkiye, which are concerned with trans-Caspian flows of petroleum and goods, may do as well, either directly or through surrogates. Such developments are likely to transform the geopolitics of this region, but they have already advanced far enough that it is now long past time to stop referring to the Caspian as a Russian lake and to recognize instead the other players’ roles.

The Battle Against Inequality: A Message To The Elite And Super-R...	As the annual World Economic Forum (WEF), described as a gathering of the world’s elite and super rich, meet in Davos, Switzerland, January 20-24, more than 30,000 activists across nearly 50 cities staged protests over the weekend demanding economic justice, climate action, and an end to billionaires’ hold on democracy. The campaign—organized by Fight Inequality Alliance (FIA)—includes the message: 'TAX THE SUPER RICH!' which was projected onto a mountainside near a private airport outside of Davos next to the faces of Donald Trump, Elon Musk, and Mark Zuckerberg. Another image declared: 'LET’S DRAW THE RED LINE & STOP PAYING BILLIONAIRES’ TAX BILL!' The campaign coincides with a new report from Oxfam released today, which finds that as billionaires’ wealth soars rapidly, the number of people living in poverty has not changed significantly since the 1990s. The rising inequalities are not only economic but also gender based, with women suffering the most. Niki Kandirikirira, Equality Now’s Global Director of Programmes, told IDN globally, women remain overrepresented in low-paid, insecure, and unregulated jobs. 'Many face unequal treatment at work and little or no access to career advancement opportunities. Women and girls also provide billions of hours of unpaid care and agricultural work daily'. Yet, she argued, this essential labor is undervalued and largely invisible. Care work and domestic food production, which underpins the profits of billionaires, go unpaid or are compensated at poverty-level wages. Women and girls effectively subsidize the global economy, which would collapse without them, but most see little in return, she said. 'The global economic system that allows billionaires and their corporations to grow wealthier by exploiting women’s labor is a system that stands in direct opposition to the SDGs. Fair wages and equal pay for equal work, stronger labor protections, and investments in care work are essential to ensuring a sustainable, equitable future,' she declared. According to the Fight Inequality Alliance, the dramatic visuals in Davos and other symbolic 'red line actions' across the world—is drawing a firm boundary against inequality and calling on leaders to adopt the solutions needed by the 99%, including taxes on the super-rich, investment in public services, tackling the climate crisis, and an end to crony capitalism. The world’s richest 1% exert a powerful influence ‘The World Economic Forum, said the Alliance, is a potent symbol of the current system, in which the world’s richest 1% exert a powerful influence on politics across the globe. Coinciding with the inauguration of the billionaire Donald Trump, this year’s gathering in Davos raises important questions about democracy, inequality, and the power of the super-rich.’ 'We’re done watching another ski resort gathering of the 1% as the wealth of the richest continues to rise to grotesque levels. Oxfam’s new report predicts there will be 5 trillionaires within a decade unless we heed the call to change course. Meanwhile, people are losing their homes to climate disasters and struggling to cover their basic needs,' said Jenny Ricks, General Secretary of the Fight Inequality Alliance. 'Davos is just one example,' said Ricks, who joined the mobilisation in Lusaka, Zambia. 'We’re facing rule by a billionaire class who are quickly becoming outright oligarchs. Democracy is in crisis across the globe. A further explosion of inequality will result. For people on the frontlines of inequality—at the sharp end of this system—it’s time to draw a red line on billionaire rule.' 'These global actions present a powerful alternative,' Ricks said. 'This isn’t just about protesting. It’s about showing the world that change is possible. The global economy is meant to serve all of us, not just the super-rich – but the dominance of the billionaire ruling class makes that impossible. For real change to happen, we have to bust open these elitist discussions and start listening to solutions from people who are on the frontlines of inequality.' Elaborating further. Kandirikirira of Equality Now said many countries, already struggling with limited resources, are forced to divert funds toward debilitating debt repayment instead of investing in programs that could advance the SDGs. Public services like healthcare, education, and social welfare, which significantly impact women’s and girls’ lives, are often the first to suffer when governments are financially constrained. This debt crisis is exacerbated by global wealth inequality, where so much of the world’s resources and financial power are concentrated in the hands of the ultra-rich. 'Women’s economic rights are undermined by discriminatory laws and harmful gender norms that limit their earning potential and decision-making power. In many countries, women are legally restricted in areas such as owning property, accessing credit, or inheriting wealth—which is especially jarring when considering Oxfam’s calculation that 36% of billionaire wealth is now inherited. Widespread legal and cultural disenfranchisement leaves women particularly vulnerable to exploitation and economic shocks,' she declared. Major public investments Meanwhile, FIA says it is mobilising to pressure governments across the globe to prioritise the 99%—by making major public investments in education, healthcare, housing, and tackling the climate and environmental crisis, and ensuring the cost of living is affordable. FIA argues that reforming tax systems to ensure that the super-rich are taxed more is a critical part of the solution. 'We need an international tax on the super-rich to help level the playing field,' said Andrew Andrew Karamagi, Principal Political Advisor at FIA. 'Major investments in public services and an ambitious, well-funded climate deal are also essential to achieving justice for billions around the world, especially in the Global South. If we fail to act, the consequences will be catastrophic. An entrenched billionaire class will undercut democratic systems around the world.' The organisers also stressed that urgent action is critical to avert disaster down the road. 'We’ve seen a huge wave of social unrest across Africa over the past year,' said Karamagi, who joined the mobilisation in Nairobi, Kenya on Saturday. 'Those kinds of movements will continue to surge as millions demand a fair future. And the climate crisis will spiral even further out of control, inflicting its worst punishments on those who did so little to create it. This is not a distant threat—it’s happening now, and it will affect everyone on the planet.' FIA says mobilisation led by FIA and its allies has already led to significant policy changes in several countries. Pressure from FIA and its partners mobilised progress toward an international tax on the super-rich, which gained unprecedented support at the G20 summit in Brazil in November 2024. Progressive tax reform in Mexico seemed impossible, but FIA pressure in the country forced the government to open the debate and introduce a constitutional tax reform that has opened the path to progressive tax reform. In India, FIA ran a 100-day campaign to defend democracy and the rights of all people in elections, achieving a change in political power structures. 'Our people power gives us hope, and our work is just getting started,' said Ricks. 'Imagine a world where governments everywhere prioritised the 99%, by making major public investments in education, healthcare, and housing—and by tackling the climate crisis and ensuring the cost of living is affordable. That’s the world we’re fighting for.' According to FIA Since 2020, the world’s five richest men have doubled their fortunes.

Von Der Leyen Takes Aim At China And Signals To Trump In Cautious...	By Nicholas Wallace (EurActiv) -- European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen on Tuesday criticised Chinese trade distortions, while reminding Americans of their interdependence with Europe. In a speech at the World Economic Forum in Davos, von der Leyen warned of a 'China shock' to world trade caused by Chinese export subsidies. In a nod to the protectionist rhetoric of new US President Donald Trump, whom she did not name, von der Leyen also said millions of American jobs depend on European trade. Trump took office the day prior, having promised to impose tariffs on several of America's main trade partners, including Europe. In the run up to Trump's inauguration, there was a surge in imports of European wine and cheese as Americans scrambled to stock-up before tariffs can bite. In Davos on Tuesday morning, the contrast between von der Leyen's handling of Chinese and Trumpian protectionism was stark. Recalling fears of a 'China shock' from rising Chinese exports when the country joined the World Trade Organization in 2001, von der Leyen said that 'today, some are talking about a second China shock – because of state-sponsored over-capacity.' Last year, the Commission increased import tariffs on Chinese electric vehicles in response to Beijing's subsidies, which artificially reduce the cost of exports, undercutting foreign competition. 'Many believe – including in China – that it would be in China's long-term interest to manage more responsibly its economic imbalances,' she said. 'It is time to pursue a more balanced relationship with China, in a spirit of fairness and reciprocity.' 'Ready to negotiate' with Trump Von der Leyen did not explicitly refer to the new US president's plan to put up trade barriers. Instead, she made a case for what's at stake for Americans in their country's trading relationship with Europe. 'No other economies in the world are as integrated as we are,' she said. 'European companies employ in the United States 3.5 million Americans, and another million American jobs depend directly on trade with Europe.' She also underscored the interdependence of European and American supply chains for the production of aeroplanes and medicines, and highlighted the importance of Europe as an export market for American goods and capital. 'Europe imports twice as many digital services from the United States as we do from the entire Asia-Pacific. Of all American assets abroad, two thirds are in Europe. And the US provides over 50% of our LNG,' meaning liquified natural gas. 'A lot is at stake for both sides. So our first priority will be to engage early, discuss common interests, and be ready to negotiate,' von der Leyen said. Supply chains 'weaponised' In her speech, von der Leyen contrasted the new protectionist winds with the enthusiasm for globalisation that prevailed at the start of the 21st century, 25 years ago. 'This century started with great expectations. 25 years ago, the era of hyper-globalisation was nearing its peak. As supply chains went global, hundreds of millions of people were being lifted out of poverty, especially in India and China.' She also noted that 'technology was seen as an unambiguous force for prosperity and peace,' a veiled reference to today's concerns about the impact of social media on demoracy. 'The world today is still nearly as connected as ever. But it has also started fracturing along new lines,' she lamented. 'International trade institutions have often struggled to address the challenges posed by the rise of non-market economies that compete by a different set of rules' – an apparent nod to China. 'Our supply chain dependencies are at times weaponised, as shown by Russia's energy blackmail,' she said. 'And the very interconnectors that bring us together, like undersea data cables, have become targets.' 'Global race to the bottom' The Commission president also noted global competition for access to 'raw materials, new technologies and global trade routes.' 'We will likely continue to see frequent use of economic tools, such as sanctions, export controls, and tariffs, that are intended to safeguard economic and national security,' von der Leyen said. 'But it is important that we balance the imperative to safeguard our security against our opportunity to innovate and enhance our prosperity,' she added. 'In this spirit, we will need to work together to avoid a global race to the bottom.'	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWc3VBrWu5eMleFaURNNx2lZ	2025-01-21T15:52:54-08:00	
European Rights Court Refuses To Halt Annulment Of Romanian Elect...	By Marian Chiriac The European Court of Human Rights, ECHR in Strasbourg on Tuesday ruled against Romanian presidential candidate Calin Georgescu’s request for it to suspend the Romanian Constitutional Court’s decision to annul November’s presidential elections and order a rerun. The ECHR said it had rejected Georgescu’s request for an urgent ruling because the matter 'fell outside of the scope' of the court’s competence. The decision means the annulment remains in effect while Georgescu’s case is considered in full by the ECHR. Georgescu, a populist politician known for his anti-NATO and pro-Russia stance, won the first round of presidential polls on November 24. His victory signalled that EU-member Romania risked joining the region’s growing trend toward far-right populism. Had he won the presidency – which has oversight of foreign policy and defence – it would have thrown into doubt Romania’s continued support for Ukraine in its war against Russia and marked a shift in the country’s geopolitical trajectory. Georgescu’s surprise win led Romania’s top court on December 3 to order a complete re-run of the election, citing alleged manipulation of public opinion by a 'foreign state', likely referring to Russia. The Constitutional Court said it annulled 'the entire electoral process concerning the election of the president of Romania', as the procedures for a free vote had not been upheld. In his complaint to the ECHR, Georgescu sought to compel Romania’s authorities to organise a second round of voting against pro-Western rival Elena Lasconi, claiming violations of his right to free elections and a fair trial due to the annulment process Prior to the ECHR’s decision, Georgescu’s appeals to Romanian courts were unsuccessful. Early this month, the centrist and centre-left parties in Romania’s ruling coalition agreed to hold the presidential election on May 4, with a potential run-off scheduled for two weeks later. Georgescu has announced he will run again and currently leads in the polls, although the credibility of these surveys has been questioned following his unexpected victory last time.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWc3VBrWu5eMld8EkQdQV3vM	2025-01-21T15:51:16-08:00	
Trump Says Putin ‘Destroying’ Russia By Failing To Seek Ukraine P...	U.S. President Donald Trump said Kremlin leader Vladimir Putin is 'destroying' Russia by refusing to make a deal to end the Ukraine war, adding that he could speak to Putin soon, without stating a time frame. 'He should make a deal. I think he's destroying Russia by not making a deal,' Trump told reporters on January 20 upon his arrival at the White House following his inauguration. 'I think Russia's going to be in big trouble.' 'Most people thought that war would have been over in one week,' Trump said in what appears to be his most critical public remarks about Putin's war. 'I think he’d be very well off to end that war.' Russia has burned through hundreds of billions of dollars on the war, suffered an estimated 700,000 casualties, and frightened its neighbors, while also sacrificing the lucrative European gas market and access to Western financial markets as the ruble has tumbled in value. The Kremlin is spending about 40 percent of its budget on the military and is struggling to contain inflation even with interest rates above 20 percent. In return, it has seized territory in Ukraine that lays in waste. Trump said he would at some point speak with Putin -- for whom he has often expressed admiration -- without specifying a time. Western leaders with the exception of right-wing figures like Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban, a Trump ally, have shunned meetings and --in most cases -- calls with Putin in an attempt to isolate him politically. 'I got along with [Putin] great. I would hope he wants to make a deal,' Trump said about a possible meeting. The U.S. president also said Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy had told him he wanted a peace agreement to end the war. During the presidential campaign, Trump vowed to end the Ukraine war within 24 hours after taking office. He has backed off those comments in recent weeks but has still pledged to end the war quickly. Many analysts say it will be difficult to end the war in the near term because Putin believes he is winning and has no incentive to stop the fighting, even as Russia suffers devastating losses in men and equipment. 'When the Trump team starts engaging in these kinds of discussions, they will find that getting Putin to abandon his goal of subjugating all of Ukraine will be the hardest thing in this process,' Mikhail Alexseev, a political science professor at San Diego State University who focuses on Russia and Ukraine, told RFE/RL on January 15 Alexseev said Trump will need to continue aid to Ukraine if he is serious about getting Putin to end the fighting. Russian is gaining territory in eastern Ukraine at the fastest clip since the start of the war amid a Ukrainian manpower shortage. Supporters of Ukraine have expressed concerns that Trump, who has criticized the amount of aid provided by the Biden administration, could pressure Kyiv to make concessions that it has so far rejected, such as surrendering territory currently occupied by Russian forces. However, some experts doubt that Trump will abandon Ukraine, saying a Russian victory could hurt his image as much as the Taliban's seizure of Kabul in August 2021 damaged the Biden administration's reputation. Prior to its full-scale invasion of February 2022, Russia initially invaded and illegally annexed Ukraine's Crimean Peninsula in 2014 and launched its support of separatists in eastern Ukraine, capturing and eventually claiming large portions of eastern Ukraine. Alexseev said Trump may seek to change Putin's calculus on Ukraine by countering the Kremlin's interests in other regions like the Arctic, Middle East, and Africa, or targeting his allies like Iran and North Korea. 'What we may see from Trump is a broadening of the bargaining game, taking it to other areas to send more and more messages to Putin,' he said. Trump’s latest remarks came hours after French President Emmanuel Macron cautioned that the war will not end 'tomorrow or the day after' and that it was crucial to leave Kyiv in a position of strength ahead of any potential peace talks. 'Let us not delude ourselves,' Macron said in an address to the French military in northwestern France. 'This conflict will not be resolved tomorrow or the day after.'

North Korea Grants Party Membership To Its Fallen Soldiers In Ukr...	By Ahn Chang Gyu North Korea is posthumously granting membership in the Korean Workers' Party to its soldiers killed in action in Russia’s war with Ukraine -- a perk that will benefit their surviving families, residents in the country told Radio Free Asia. Party membership is a special privilege in North Korea that improves the social status of families related to the member, giving them access to better education, jobs, housing and food rations. It may also give them the right to live in the capital Pyongyang, which has a far better standard of living than the rest of the country. But some parents who are notified that their sons have died in battle did not even know they had been sent to Russia, a resident in the northeastern province of North Hamgyong told RFA Korean on condition of anonymity for security reasons. The Pentagon and South Korean intelligence estimate that around 12,000 North Korean troops have been deployed to Russia since October. According to South Korean intelligence, at least 300 of these have been killed and 2,700 injured. Neither Moscow nor Pyongyang has acknowledged North Korea’s participation in the conflict. The North Korean people have not been informed, either, but many seem to have heard about it through word of mouth, the resident said. 'In early January, a couple living in Myonggan county, relatives of my close friend, were told to go to Pyongyang without knowing the reason,' the resident said. A senior local official -- the county secretary -- took them to the station in his car and and provided train tickets and lunch boxes to eat on the train -- a rarity in North Korea, where most people cannot freely travel, especially not at government expense. Once in Pyongyang, the couple was given a certificate informing them of their son’s death and a party membership card -- but were told nothing about the nature of his mission or where he died, the resident said. Authorities urged them to keep quiet. 'They did not even allow the bereaved families to cry out loud,' he said. 'They repeatedly urged them not to share information with other relatives or anyone around them.' Special treatment Upon their return, the special treatment for the couple continued. The county secretary picked them up and delivered them to their home, and ordered the factory where the man works to give him a special 10-day vacation, the resident said. But even though the family is already getting the perks, they would rather have their son alive, he said. 'According to my friend, his relative believes his son was killed while deployed to fight in the war with Ukraine,' he said. 'The couple spends each day in tears, mourning the loss of their only son.' Posthumous membership in the party is usually only given in combat situations, not to soldiers who die while performing their usual peacetime duties. Promised homes Another resident of the same province said that the authorities have promised to allow the family members of the soldiers killed in the war with Ukraine to live in Pyongyang as soon as there are available homes for them. Since 2021, the country’s leader Kim Jong Un has been pushing his pet development project -- to build 10,000 homes per year and 50,000 by the end of 2025 -- in the capital. According to the second resident, his wife’s relatives traveled to Pyongyang and received their dead son’s party membership card and death certificate at a ceremony where an official informed them that they would be able to live in the new homes. 'The party has decided that when Hwasong Street, which is currently under construction, is completed, the bereaved families will be called to Pyongyang and live there as Pyongyang citizens,' he said. In previous reports about the housing project, Pyongyang residents told RFA that their homes were being demolished to build the new apartments. Although they were promised the right to live there once the homes were completed, they were concerned that there would not be enough new apartments to accommodate everyone. The second resident said that the authorities asked all the bereaved families to not reveal too much information to the outside world, regarding why they are allowed to move to Pyongyang. 'Among the family members from my wife’s side, there are some who envy the relatives who will be living in Pyongyang in the future,' he said. 'But the parents who lost their son are expressing their anger, saying, ‘What good is it when we lost our son? He was only 21 years old.'	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWc3VBrWu5eMleKXxmZTctP_	2025-01-21T15:45:53-08:00	
Saudi Arabia’s FM Announces Landmark Visit To Lebanon	By Daniel Fountain Prince Faisal bin Farhan said on Tuesday in Davos he would visit Lebanon later this week, the first such trip by a Saudi foreign minister in more than a decade. He made the announcement during a panel on diplomacy at the World Economic Forum’s annual meeting in the Swiss resort town. The one-day trip on Thursday will mark the first visit by a high-ranking Saudi official to Lebanon since 2015, after years of strained relations due to Lebanon’s perceived alignment with Iran, its role in drug smuggling to Gulf countries, and ongoing instability. Prince Faisal described the recent election of a president in Lebanon, following a prolonged political vacuum, as a highly positive development. He said the Kingdom welcomed the potential formation of a government but emphasized the need for real reforms and a forward-looking approach to ensure sustainable progress. He reiterated that the future of Lebanon rested in the hands of its people, urging them to make decisions that steer the country in a new direction. 'We will need to see real action, real reform and we will need to see a commitment to a Lebanon that is looking to the future, not to the past,' said Prince Faisal. 'And based on what I hear there and what we see, I think that will inform the Kingdom’s approach, but I have to say what I’ve seen so far and the conversations that we’ve been hearing in Lebanon, all allow me to be very much optimistic. 'We’ve always said, it’s really up to the Lebanese to decide and to make the choices to take Lebanon in a different direction.' Prince Faisal also said he is 'cautiously optimistic' about Syria’s future, citing encouraging signs from the new administration in Damascus and the resilience of the Syrian people. He emphasized the need for patience and engagement from both the regional and international communities to help rebuild the country’s broken institutions and create a better future for Syrians. 'I would certainly say I’m cautiously optimistic. I may even lean further because you have, first of all, an administration that is saying the right things in private and in public, doing a lot of the right things, but also you have a Syrian people that are incredibly capable and incredibly resourceful,' he said. He urged collaboration to build on recent positive developments, underlining the collective responsibility to aid Syria’s recovery, especially considering the willingness of the new administration in Damascus to engage constructively with regional and global partners. 'The reality is that they have inherited a broken country with no real institutions and they are having to build all of that from scratch, and that’s not an easy thing,' he said. 'So it’s up to us, I feel in the region first but certainly the international community, to engage, to come and build on this positive development and help Syria and the Syrian people see a much better future.' Prince Faisal highlighted the importance of lifting the heavy burden of sanctions imposed due to actions of the previous regime, noting some progress with waivers from the US and Europe. Prince Faisal was also positive about the region as a whole, including the Kingdom. 'We are certainly in a region that is abundant with risk factors, but we are also in a region that has huge potential,' he told the panel. 'I would say that even with the very difficult year behind us, we have shown that we can be resilient as a region and we can actually look to the future, whether it’s the Kingdom, or the GCC countries, and their ability to stay on track with their economic agendas,' he added. He stressed the importance of avoiding conflict, particularly in light of tensions between Iran and Israel, and expressed optimism regarding the new US administration under President Donald Trump. 'I don’t see the incoming US administration as contributory to the risk of war. On the contrary, I think President Trump has been quite clear that he does not favor conflict,' he said. 'I hope that the approach will also be met on the Iranian side by the addressing of the nuclear program, by being willing to engage with the incoming administration in a way that can help us stay on track with this positive momentum.' Also on the panel was Mohammed bin Abdulrahman bin Jassim Al-Thani, prime minister and foreign minister of Qatar, who expressed hope that the ceasefire in Gaza between Israel and Hamas would bring much needed relief to the Palestinian people. 'Let’s be hopeful (about the ceasefire). It’s still a long way to go with what happened throughout the last 15 months negotiating this very difficult conflict,' he said. 'It showed us that everything can be resolved through talks and through engagement, through negotiations, and we started this week with good news. 'We have seen the humanitarian aid coming in, we have seen hostages going back and we hope that this will be a fair system toward stability now.'	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWc3VBrWu5eMlVku2CsMlKP_	2025-01-21T15:43:31-08:00	
Grab Greenland? Go On Trump, Expose Fraud Of US Protection And Se...	Incoming U.S. President Donald Trump has boasted about annexing Greenland from Denmark – by military force if needs be. Veteran journalist Ron Ridenour says, ironically, go ahead Trump, grab Greenland, take all of it. It’s not that Ridenour is a fan of the new president or endorses U.S. imperialism. Far from it, Ron Ridenour has been an outspoken critic of American imperialism for over 60 years as a journalist and author. However, he sees value in the Greenland grab in that it exposes the fraud of the U.S. posing as a protector of NATO allies. Ridenour has written extensively on what he calls Denmark’s abject servility to U.S. imperialism and NATO’s aggression. He points out that Denmark has been a loyal lackey in promoting the NATO proxy war in Ukraine against Russia. Now, the U.S. 'leader' (master) is snubbing Denmark’s so-called sovereignty over Greenland. The high-handed contempt of Trump towards Denmark is welcomed by Ridenour because it fatally corrodes the NATO alliance. Ridenour says Denmark has no legitimate authority to rule Greenland, which Copenhagen has treated for centuries with racist colonial arrogance. Trump’s ambition to annex Greenland for U.S. national security interests is an object lesson to NATO allies that they are ultimately dispensable. If Trump goes ahead with the Arctic land grab, then the impact on NATO will shatter the illusions of the U.S.-led North Atlantic Treaty Organization.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWc3VBrWu5eMleoS0YcuoUPp	2025-01-21T15:40:54-08:00	
Rubio Meets Quad Ministers On First Day As US Secretary Of State,...	By Nike Ching Secretary of State Marco Rubio arrived at the State Department on Tuesday to warm applause, marking his first visit since being sworn in as the United States’ top diplomat. Addressing hundreds gathered at the department's formal entrance, Rubio emphasized his commitment to a foreign policy centered on U.S. national interests. 'Anything that makes us stronger, or safer or more prosperous' will be our mission, Rubio said, adding that the U.S. will strive to avoid conflicts, while never compromising national security or sacrificing core values. Rubio acknowledged that changes are inevitable but assured the crowd that 'there will be changes, but the changes are not meant to be destructive. They're not meant to be punitive.' The new secretary of state expressed gratitude to the American foreign service workforce and his desire to do something special in his new role. 'I want to thank you – all those who are serving overseas and abroad, some in places that are strong and stable, and others that are more tenuous and dangerous. ... I want to also thank the locally employed staff, the nationals of those countries who work with us,' Rubio said. Following his debut at the State Department, Rubio was scheduled to meet with foreign ministers from the Indo-Pacific Quad on Tuesday afternoon, including Indian External Affairs Minister Dr. Subrahmanyam Jaishankar, Australian Foreign Minister Penny Wong and Japanese Foreign Minister Iwaya Takeshi. The foreign ministers of Japan, Australia and India were in Washington to attend President Donald Trump’s inauguration. Rubio was unanimously confirmed as secretary of state on Monday, becoming the first member of Trump's Cabinet in his second administration. During his confirmation hearing last Wednesday, Rubio outlined key foreign policy challenges, including threats from the Chinese Communist Party, along with mass migration, fentanyl and violent criminals in the Western Hemisphere. He also warned of dictators in Moscow, Tehran and Pyongyang spreading instability, while aligning with and funding radical terror groups.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWc3VBrWu5eMlVEdSd4og-sX	2025-01-21T15:36:08-08:00	
Philippines: Religious Groups Stage Opposing Rallies Ahead Of 202...	By Camille Elemia Different religious denominations in the Philippines usually stage political rallies in the run-up to national polls, but such demonstrations this year are gathering steam ahead of mid-term elections amid a now-open public feud between the country’s top two leaders. Religious groups from Catholic and Christian persuasions have been flexing their political muscles ahead of the May 12 polls through holding opposing rallies, including one rally that drew 1 million people earlier this month. However, analysts interviewed by BenarNews questioned whether faith-based rallies could sway voters, given recent elections where endorsements of religious groups had limited impact. These demonstrations show the complex interplay between religion and politics in the Philippines, where Christian denominations vie for influence in this predominantly Catholic nation. Already this year indigenous churches Iglesia ni Cristo (INC) and Kingdom of Jesus Christ (KOJC) held separate rallies for Vice President Sara Duterte, who is facing impeachment complaints over her use of confidential funds and her alleged threat of assassination against President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. Meanwhile, the Catholic Church, joined by evangelical and civil society groups, is set to hold a rally against both Duterte and Marcos next week. Analysts differ on whether the focus by church groups on secular government through a series of rallies can bring the religious outcomes they seek. 'These rallies are a show of force,' political analyst Jean Franco from the University of the Philippines told BenarNews. 'This is especially true for the INC, which was implicated in the drug war of formerPresident Rodrigo Duterte during House hearings.' The mobilization of INC is an 'obvious statement of position that they are still supporting the vice president for the 2028 [presidential] elections,' said Erron Medina, a development studies instructor focusing on religion at Ateneo de Manila University. INC spokesperson Edwil Zabala spoke to reporters about a rally that drew about 1 million people on Jan. 13. 'I understand that some would think this is political but it’s not. As far as we’re concerned, it’s not. It’s something moral,' Zabala said in an interview. The INC is the country’s second largest Christian denomination, trailing the Catholic Church whose members total about 80% of the nation’s 115 million people. The KOJC is headed by Duterte family friend Pastor Apollo Quiboloy, who was arrested in southern Davao city in September 2024 on sexual abuse charges in the U.S. and the Philippines. The rift between the Marcos and Duterte families began during the second half of 2024 as the government faced growing pressure to allow an international investigation into former President Duterte’s drug war, which left thousands dead. The House of Representatives then opened an investigation into the alleged budgetary misuse by Sara Duterte’s office in her roles as vice president and education secretary – a cabinet post she held under Marcos until she quit in June. ‘This will start the tipping point’ Next week, 12 Catholic and three Evangelical bishops are to be joined by 230 priests and 54 civil society groups at an 'indignation rally' against Duterte and Marcos, particularly focusing on the administration’s $108.2 billion national budget. Earlier, 10 Catholic priests celebrated Mass at the historic EDSA Shrine to launch a movement to impeach Sara Duterte. The challenge for the inter-faith rally on Jan. 31 is to 'seriously distinguish its agenda' from that of the INC, Medina said. 'Credible religious positioning in politics should be balanced with their original task – to engage in discussions of public morals while calling out political wrongdoing and not actually taking part in the political game,' Medina said in a text message Tuesday. Melba Maggay, a social anthropologist and president of the Manila-based Institute for Studies in Asian Church and Culture, said the rally would be the first time that faith-based and civil society groups come together to protest. 'Churches are usually allergic to direct political involvement, but this is something new. I feel this will start the tipping point,' Maggay, who plans to join the rally, told BenarNews on Tuesday. 'The masses are getting angry at the injustices and corruption in government.' The rallies are taking place ahead of the May 12 elections when Filipinos will vote for all House and half the Senate seats along with local offices. Will it be effective? The once influential Catholic Church has failed to convince voters to choose Church-endorsed candidates. In the 2022 general election, more than 1,200 Catholic clergy endorsed then-Vice President Leni Robredo and running mate Francis Pangilinan for president and vice president, but it had little to no impact on the vote as Marcos and Duterte overwhelmingly won. Noel Asiones, an academic researcher from a Catholic university in Manila, said the results of the 2016 and 2022 presidential elections had shown that the Catholic Church could not sway polls. 'I am now very convinced that the church has zero influence on how Catholic voters choose their candidates. Unlike the INC, there is no Catholic vote in the country. The elections of Duterte and Marcos and their minions blew a big hole in whatever illusion there was for a Catholic vote to become a reality,' Asiones told BenarNews in an email. Analyst Franco, meanwhile, said even though the INC was known for its bloc voting, its power could be an illusion. 'The INC vote can be crucial in tight local races. But in the national elections, not so much. They are only around 1.5% or 2% of the total population,' Franco said. Many evangelical groups have become active in politics and some are more assertive than the traditionally influential Catholic Church. Some of these evangelical groups have members in the Senate and House of Representatives who oppose policies including proposals ondivorce and gender equality. Among those are Sen. Joel Villanueva and his father, Brother Eddie Villanueva, a member of the House who founded Jesus is Lord Church Worldwide. In addition, Rep. Benny Abante, who represents a House district in Manila, is a Baptist minister. For Maggay, the religious scholar and anthropologist, these evangelical groups 'were made in the image of the American Bible Belt,' when missionaries constructed schools in the Philippines during the U.S. colonization of the Philippines. These groups are similar, she said, to the religious right which supports Donald Trump, the newly installed American president. 'These beliefs were exported from America to the Philippines, including the entry into politics and fundamentalism,' she said. 'But the church’s political role is not primarily to put Christians into office or even to insert its own interests into political space as a power bloc.'	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWc3VBrWu5eMlfaHCNgGrPX3	2025-01-21T15:32:54-08:00	
As World Economic Forum Annual Meeting 2025 Opens, Leaders Call F...	Addressing a gathering of global leaders, Klaus Schwab, World Economic Forum Founder and Chairman of the Board of Trustees, officially opened the 55th Annual Meeting, setting the tone for the week by highlighting the meeting's theme: Collaboration for the Intelligent Age. 'This transition from the Industrial to the Intelligent Age is occurring at an exponential pace, carrying unprecedented risks for humanity as we strive to prepare and adapt for its complexities, he said. 'Yet, it also offers significant opportunities to transcend our current challenges and spark a new renaissance – one defined by advancements in knowledge, health, culture and societal welfare.' Schwab called on the global community to rise to the moment with 'constructive optimism', urging stakeholders from all sectors – government, business, civil society and academia – to unite in crafting solutions to shared challenges. 'By embracing constructive optimism and believing in our collective capacity and commitment to improving the state of the world, we can shape the Intelligent Age as an age where every human being can realize their full potential.' Speaking at what he described as 'one of the most uncertain geopolitical and geoeconomic moments in generations,' Børge Brende, President and CEO, World Economic Forum, stressed that the world is at a critical inflection point and that 2025 will be a year of enormous consequence. 'The longstanding international order that existed for the last three decades has receded. We need to find more effective ways to work together. It is the only way forward.' In these turbulent times, democratic and liberal values serve as a critical signpost for stability and progress, said Karin Keller-Sutter, President of the Swiss Confederation 2025; Federal Councillor; Head of the Federal Department of Finance of Switzerland, Federal Department of Finance of Switzerland, adding that open markets, fair and transparent rules and fiscal discipline are the cornerstones of sustained prosperity. 'Only a state with stable institutions can create a sound environment where everyone can realize their potential, and a state must protect this freedom with rules.' Also reflecting on the changing world order, Ursula von der Leyen, President of the European Commission, outlined Europe's plan to adapt to a new era of 'harsh geostrategic competition' by increasing its competitiveness, strengthening global partnerships and maintaining its commitment to sustainable development. 'To sustain our growth in the next quarter of the century, Europe must shift gears,' she said. 'We should not take anything for granted. We must look for new opportunities wherever they arise. This is the moment to engage beyond blocs and taboos. And Europe is ready for change.' German Chancellor Olaf Scholz called for renewed commitments to security and prosperity in the face of global challenges, emphasizing that partnerships serve as the 'engine for successful economic development.' He highlighted plans to reform German public debt regulations to strengthen domestic growth and emphasized Europe's need to strengthen its defence capabilities and industrial base. His remarks acknowledged geopolitical challenges and uncertainties related to the new administration in Washington, but highlighted optimism about opportunities in emerging technologies. As the war in Ukraine nears its third year, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, President of Ukraine, urged Europe to solidify its position as a leading global power. Highlighting the need for unity and strategic investment, he emphasized that the continent must prioritize alliances, technological advancements, and a cohesive security and defence policy. He pointed to existing models of cooperation in Ukraine's defence as examples of how collective action can strengthen Europe as a whole. 'Europe needs to compete for the top spot in priorities, alliances and technological development,' Zelenskyy stated. 'We need a united European security and defence policy, and all European countries must be willing to spend as much on security as is truly needed.' Amid rising geopolitical tensions, Ding Xuexiang, Vice-Premier of the People's Republic of China, warned against the growing fragmentation of the global economic system and rising protectionism, emphasizing that 'trade war has no winners'. He advocated for a universally beneficial globalization process, reaffirming China's commitment to a UN-centred multilateral order and calling for greater cooperation in scientific and technological innovation to ensure equitable advancements for all nations. Ding also addressed global challenges such as climate change and economic inequality, urging nations to pursue green transitions and foster sustainable development through inclusive dialogue and partnership. Highlighting China's economic resilience, progress in green energy and ongoing reforms, he asserted that China's growth contributes to global stability and prosperity. 'China's door of opening up will not be closed and will only open even wider, and our business environment will only get better,' Ding said. Pham Minh Chinh, Prime Minister of Viet Nam, reaffirmed the country's commitment to leveraging artificial intelligence (AI). 'We aim to prioritize the establishment of research and development centres, particularly in high-technology sectors. These efforts will not only advance technological innovation, but also position Viet Nam as a hub for high-tech manufacturing and development in the region,' he added. With South Africa recently assuming the G20 Presidency, Cyril Ramaphosa, President of South Africa, outlined Africa's objectives for the G20 Summit, set to take place in Johannesburg in November 2025, the first to be hosted in Africa. He said South Africa will focus its G20 Presidency on three themes: solidarity, equality and sustainable development. 'As we confront the challenges of the 21st century – from climate change to pandemics, from poverty to terrorism, from migration to AI – we are again called upon to harness that most powerful, and that most enduring, of human attributes: mutually beneficial cooperation and collaboration,' he said. Navigating the ongoing challenges of regional instability, Isaac Herzog, President of Israel, welcomed the recent ceasefire and release of three hostages, but cautioned against unwarranted optimism. 'I want to be lucid and cautious...there are opportunities, but still risks. We must ensure this never happens again,' he said.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWc3VBrWu5eMlfC_11oXfwJ_	2025-01-21T15:30:27-08:00	
The Kumbh Mela: A Timeless Confluence Of Faith, Culture, And Spir...	The Maha Kumbh Mela is celebrated as the world's largest spiritual gathering, bringing together millions of devotees, ascetics, and visitors to a sanctified confluence of rivers every 12 years. Rooted in ancient Hindu mythology, this event takes place at four sacred locations: Prayagraj (at the confluence of the Ganga, Yamuna, and the mythical Saraswati), Haridwar (on the Ganga), Ujjain (on the Shipra), and Nashik (on the Godavari). The Maha Kumbh Mela not only embodies the religious fervour of its participants but also serves as a testament to India's enduring cultural and spiritual heritage. History and Mythological Origins The origins of the Maha Kumbh Mela are deeply entwined with Hindu mythology, particularly the story of the Samudra Manthan, or the churning of the ocean by gods (Devas) and demons (Asuras) to retrieve the nectar of immortality (Amrita). As the celestial pot of nectar emerged, a divine tussle ensued, resulting in drops spilling at four locations on Earth, sanctifying them for eternity. These places became the venues for the Kumbh Mela. Historically, the festival is documented as far back as the 7th century CE during the reign of Emperor Harshavardhana. Over the centuries, the mela has evolved into a global phenomenon that draws millions of participants from across the globe. Significance For Hindus, the Maha Kumbh Mela represents their greatest spiritual desires and is of great significance. During the festival, bathing in the sacred rivers is thought to purify one's karma, free one's soul from sin, and grant moksha, or freedom from the cycle of birth and death. Beyond personal spirituality, the mela is a cultural melting pot that unites people from different places, languages, and customs in a common act of devotion. The mela's main goals are to revive traditional cultural customs, provide a forum for spiritual enlightenment, and encourage religious dialogue among devotees, sages, and academics. Additionally, it provides a chance to raise awareness of environmental issues, with a current emphasis on sustainable practices and river conservation. Traditions and Celebrations The lively customs and intricate ceremonies of the Maha Kumbh Mela are well known. On fortunate times chosen by astrological alignments, millions of sadhus and devotees bathe in the sacred rivers at the Shahi Snan (Royal Bath), the most important of these. It is thought that taking a bath confers spiritual virtue and liberty. The spectacular processions of various akharas (religious groups), particularly the Naga Sadhus—ascetics who forgo worldly goods and wear little or no clothing—are a highlight of the mela. Chants, conch sounds, and music accompany their entrance, which is a display of their devotion and spiritual discipline. The mela also includes yajnas (fire rites), prayer gatherings, and talks by well-known spiritual gurus. The cultural dimension of the festival includes traditional music, dance, and art exhibitions, offering a glimpse into India’s diverse heritage. Stalls selling religious items, handicrafts, and traditional foods add a festive touch to the spiritual atmosphere. Maha Kumbh Mela 2025: Current Highlights Prayagraj, Uttar Pradesh, is hosting the Maha Kumbh Mela 2025 from January 13 to February 26, 2025. Over 400 million devotees are expected to participate over the course of the event, which has already seen large crowds. Nearly 35 million individuals took a sacred bath at the Triveni Sangam on January 14, the auspicious day of Makar Sankranti, illustrating the depth of devotion and faith. The Uttar Pradesh government has built a vast temporary city with all the amenities needed to handle the flood of pilgrims, including thousands of tents, kitchens, bathrooms, and medical facilities. For crowd control and safety, 50,000 personnel and more than 2,500 surveillance cameras have been deployed as part of the security measures. The Shahi Snans on occasions like Paush Purnima (January 13), Mauni Amavasya (January 29), Basant Panchami (February 3), and Maha Shivratri (February 26). Purpose and Modern Relevance The Maha Kumbh Mela, beyond its deep religious significance, plays a pivotal role in preserving and promoting India’s rich cultural heritage. It serves as a living repository of ancient traditions, rituals, and spiritual practices that have been passed down through generations. The mela becomes a vibrant confluence of communities from diverse regions, languages, and cultural backgrounds, offering a unique platform for the exchange of ideas and customs. Through its rituals, processions, and spiritual discourses, the festival fosters a sense of unity and shared identity among its participants, reaffirming the cultural fabric of the nation. Economically, the Maha Kumbh Mela contributes significantly to local livelihoods by generating opportunities for a wide range of stakeholders, including vendors, artisans, and service providers. Temporary marketplaces spring up during the event, showcasing traditional handicrafts, religious artifacts, and regional cuisines, thus supporting local economies and preserving artisanal crafts. Hospitality services, transportation providers, and small businesses also witness a substantial surge in activity, underscoring the festival’s role as a driver of economic growth in host regions. In recent years, the mela has embraced modern relevance by integrating environmental consciousness into its framework. With growing awareness of ecological issues, the festival has become a platform to advocate for sustainable practices and river conservation. Initiatives promoting the use of eco-friendly materials, waste management, and water preservation are now integral to the event’s planning and execution. The massive gathering is leveraged to spread awareness about environmental challenges and inspire collective responsibility among millions of participants. By merging its timeless spiritual essence with contemporary concerns, the Maha Kumbh Mela exemplifies how ancient traditions can adapt to address modern-day challenges, making it not only a celebration of faith but also a convergence point for cultural preservation, economic growth, and ecological stewardship. Conclusion The Maha Kumbh Mela is a celebration of India's age-old customs, cultural variety, and humanity's shared spiritual search. It is much more than just a religious occasion. Prayagraj's 2025 version is a prime example of how traditional customs still have resonance in the contemporary world, encouraging millions of people to pursue inner harmony and serenity. The Maha Kumbh Mela, which combines spirituality, culture, and environmental consciousness, is a tribute to India's long history of religion and solidarity. As the festival progresses, it continues to have an impact on the lives of innumerable attendees, leaving a legacy that cuts over space and time.

Why You Should (Not) Get A Dog: The Pros And Cons Of Dog Ownershi...	Are dogs really the key to better health and a happier life? In this new study, dog owners were invited to describe the biggest benefits and challenges of dog ownership. The commitments and responsibilities of having a dog were found to be both a joy and a burden, highlighting the importance of making a conscious adoption choice. The pet dog population has been growing worldwide. Often benefiting from good press in mainstream media, dog ownership is generally assumed to improve human lives, providing companionship and boosting well-being. While bringing a dog into the family does come with many benefits for a lot of people, the costs of dog ownership should not be overlooked. In fact, previous studies conducted on larger, representative samples of the population could not conclude on a generalisable 'pet effect': Caring for a dog can be costly in time and money, but also emotionally. For instance, having a dog with behavioural problems or a long-term medical condition may elicit worry, sadness, and guilt. In the long run, these negative feelings might turn into chronic stress or depression. The more people know about dogs, the more prepared they are for the reality of having one at home. Informing about the positive, but also the negative facets of dog ownership, may help prospective owners to engage in the adoption process more consciously. Yet, comprehensive overviews of the many costs and benefits of sharing life with a dog remain scarce. Which facets of dog ownership are considered the most costly, and which the most beneficial? How do dog owners perceive and describe the positive and negative aspects of their experience? To find out, researchers at the Department of Ethology at Eötvös Loránd University (ELTE) first asked dog owners to rate a list of 33 neutrally-phrased statements related to pet dogs (such as 'Dogs need to be trained and educated', 'Dogs can bring mess and dirt into the house', 'Dogs can keep children company') on a scale from -3 (big disadvantage) to +3 (big advantage). Participants in the study were then invited to describe in their own words what were, for them, the biggest cost and the biggest benefit of having a dog. The belief that dogs brighten people’s lives was found to be the most positively rated item from the list (2.78 on average), while the short lifespan of dogs was rated the most negatively (-1.67 on average). Adding up all ratings together, the authors noted that positive statements were, on average, rated much higher (2.06) than negative statements (-0.66), tipping the cost/benefit scales in favour of the positive side of the dog ownership experience. 'We were also interested to see if all of these facets of dog ownership could group together into bigger components' said Laura Gillet, PhD student at the Department of Ethology and lead author of the study. 'In the end, we found three of them. The first one encompassed the emotional, physical, and social benefits of having a dog. The second one was more on the negative side, referring to the negative emotions and practical challenges arising because of the dog. The third and last component comprised aspects related to the commitment and responsibilities coming with dog ownership in the long term, including, for instance, the time that has to be dedicated to the dog’s daily care and training, as well as the influence of the dog on its owner’s routine and quality of sleep.' This last component divided dog owners the most: while it was positive for some, others saw it as a more neutral, or even as a negative aspect of dog ownership. 'We also analysed open-ended responses because they offer an even better understanding of the costs and benefits' explains Eniko Kubinyi, head of the Department of Ethology at ELTE and principal investigator of the MTA-ELTE ‘Momentum’ Companion Animal Research Group. Dogs were often described as honest, devoted and supportive social partners, showing unconditional, selfless love to their human family.' Daily life benefits were the second most frequently cited theme (31%), with owners mentioning that having a dog improved their lifestyle by encouraging physical exercise and outdoors activities, and brought stability and structure in their life. For 15% of respondents, another major advantage of sharing life with a dog was the opportunity to bond with a member of another species, whose intrinsic qualities were deemed numerous. As for the biggest cost, dog owners were almost unanimous: caring for a dog costs money. Veterinary costs, feeding and other expenses were cited by 95% of the respondents. In comparison, emotional and practical costs were rarely mentioned, only by 4-5% of owners. In summary, the results of this study show that the dog ownership experience is multifaceted and cannot be described in terms of universal costs and benefits that would apply to all owners. Most importantly, the researchers found that, depending on the owner, the commitment and responsibilities coming with dog ownership can be perceived just as much as beneficial as they can be perceived as an emotional and practical burden. Although a ratio in favour of the positive side of dog ownership was to be expected, especially in a sample of dog enthusiasts, it is also possible that some owners struggled with their dogs without being able to talk about it for fear of being judged and labelled as a 'bad owner'. Therefore, the authors’ findings highlight the importance of publicly addressing not only the positive effects of pet dogs, but also the many challenges coming with dog ownership, to reduce the gap between expectations and reality and improve the lives of both humans and dogs.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWc3VBrWu5eMlRWSpE5FfLrj	2025-01-21T15:26:34-08:00	
Global Health In Flux: What A Potential US Exit From The WHO Mean...	By Lakshmy Ramakrishnan The United States (US), under President Donald Trump, is expected to formally withdraw from the World Health Organisation (WHO) upon reoccupying the White House, paving the way for extraordinary consequences for global health. While it comes as no surprise that the US role in global health leadership comes under the scanner once again, the global health community must take notice of what this signifies, take cognisance of what global health needs, and develop steps to address the altered landscape. Not-so-hidden biases In 2020, Trump initiated steps to withdraw from WHO, citing the organisation’s biases towards China by not placing accountability over the country’s handling of COVID-19. The international community criticised WHO for failing to timely declare COVID-19 as a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC). This arose when WHO was already under scrutiny for its inaction during the 2013 MERS-CoV outbreak and its delayed declaration during the 2014 Ebola outbreak. During COVID-19, China’s influence over WHO was brought to light when the country was reluctant to share data with the agency and failed to expeditiously declare the human-to-human transmission of the virus. In December last year, the WHO spokesperson, Maria van Kerkhove urged China to provide it with samples from the pandemic emphasising a ‘moral and scientific imperative’ but China remains insistent that it has provided the agency with all of its samples. The US’ likely withdrawal from WHO comes at a juncture when the origins of COVID-19 continue to be politicised. The Republican-led Select Subcommittee on the Coronavirus Pandemic concluded that ‘COVID-19 most likely emerged from a laboratory in Wuhan, China, ’ citing that gain-of-function research in a laboratory with inadequate biosafety levels was the primary cause of the lab leak. It attributed the pandemic to failures in overseeing ‘potentially dangerous research’ by the US National Institutes of Health (NIH) and WHO in succumbing to political pressure from the Chinese Community Party (CCP) to cover the lab leak that allegedly occurred at the Wuhan Institute of Virology (WIV). Unanswered origins While the House Democrats refuted the Select Subcommittee’s report, citing it as having ‘fuelled extreme narratives’ over the pandemic, the true origin of COVID-19 may never be revealed. Reports advocating a naturally occurring viral spillover event are inconclusive; they have failed to demonstrate that animals in the Wuhan Wet Market were infected with SARS-CoV2 and were the source of animal-human transmission. Interestingly, the US Department of Energy ruled, with ‘low confidence,’ that a lab leak was the likely origin, moving away from their previously held neutral stance. While the National Intelligence Council is firm on a viral spillover event as the cause of the outbreak, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) maintains that a laboratory incident may be the cause. The continued politicisation of the origins of COVID-19 and the lack of concrete scientific evidence pointing to either a zoonotic outbreak or a laboratory incident dispel any notion that the true origin will ever be revealed. Global health and national interests at loggerheads It comes as no surprise that the Trump administration would question the role of the US in global health efforts. The US has dominated global health leadership by diverting enormous funds to countering infectious diseases, notably linking the security and economic development of the developed world with that of the Global South. However, COVID-19 demonstrated that despite these efforts, the US was ill-prepared. In essence, a US foreign policy that incorporated global health failed to protect its national interests from COVID-19. The US faced the biggest economic contraction since the Great Depression and there were 1.2 million deaths in the US attributed to COVID-19. The Biden administration attempted to restore the US leadership in global health by reversing Trump’s 2020 withdrawal from WHO. However, polarised domestic politics and geopolitics aroused questions over what US engagement with global health meant. For instance, Biden continued Operation Warpspeed (OWS)—a legacy of Trump 1.0—where COVID-19 vaccines were manufactured in record time. Vaccine nationalism and inequities stemming from COVAX (COVID-19 Vaccines Global Access), however, stymied these efforts, while vaccine diplomacy efforts by Russia and China further altered the health landscape. Thus, global health failed to demonstrate its value in American foreign policy. Brace for impact As the world braces for the unpredictability of the new Trump presidency, it is necessary to examine the implications of a US withdrawal from WHO. Such a decision will send shockwaves as the US is one of WHO’s largest contributors, funding nearly US$1.28 billion in 2022-2023. This withdrawal will impactinternational surveillance and responsiveness to health threats, disrupt the collaboration efforts between various US organisations and WHO for research and development and reduce experienced technical and administrative manpower. Funds to the US Agency for International Development (USAID), the National Institutes of Health’s Fogarty International Center and programmes devoted to HIV/AIDS, malaria, and tuberculosis will likely be slashed. Contributions to the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) and the President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR), which focus on reproductive health and HIV prevention, respectively, are likely to be affected. A ‘global gag rule,’ or a funding blockade to foreign organisations that aid in providing access to abortions may be reimposed, while the recently revived initiative on cancer therapies—Cancer Moonshot—is likely to be terminated. Trump sceptics brace for an administration that is apathetic to health but nuances indicate that we may be witnessing a recast of how the US incorporates health into its foreign policy. Notably, OWS demonstrated that American biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries were capable of swiftly producing innovative countermeasures to address a novel threat, cementing these industries as core vital interests. Innovations for pandemics and climate change-related health issues will be driven through incentives such as intellectual property (IP) rights and geopolitical competition. The agenda also includes steps to address domestic drug prices, promote harmonisation of the regulatory aspects of the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) with global counterparts, and subject vaccines to increased scrutiny over safety. Biden’s biosecurity and biosafety agenda may be echoed; increased oversight of biosecurity practices is reported to occur through structural reforms of the NIH, whose collaboration with the EcoHealth Allianceand WIV, came under the scanner for its alleged role in the pandemic. Sitting ducks? The US is clear in its need to realign the role of global health in its foreign policy, and the Global South needs to formulate steps to address this altered landscape. From a security perspective, no country can afford to look away from health. Thus, there exists the possibility that the US may not leave WHO and instead may slash its contributions. A US funding vacuum will likely be filled by China, which has already begun altering the healthcare landscape through its Health Silk Road. Europe is another contender, but with the United Kingdom (UK) lowering its overseas development assistance (ODA) to health from 16.7 percent in 2020 to 7.6 percent in 2023, activities will rely on the European Union (EU). A considerable amount of resources was diverted away from global health to the ongoing conflicts in Russia-Ukraine and West Asia indicating that the lacuna will be filled by philanthropies like BMGF, but it remains to be seen to what extent these gaps can be filled. This power shift, where global health objectives are significantly less steered by ‘traditional strongholds in the Global North’ can be construed as an opportunity for the Global South to address its critical health needs. The current discourse is an impetus for the Global South to persuade WHO for urgently needed reforms including increased transparency and accountability, and address several contentious issues that negotiations over the Pandemic Treaty have brought about. The pathogen access benefit sharing (PABS) mechanism—a system to ensure the sharing of genetic resources—is unlikely to bring about the equity and fairness it claims, indicating that alternatives to this mechanism are needed. Further, BRICS can address health through a bottom-up approach and through localisation, where foreign aid is channelled through local organisations. Finally, taking into consideration the adverse outcomes that resulted from the politicisation and securitisation of COVID-19 and the rampant disinformation and misinformation campaigns that ensued, the Global South can endeavour to ensure that science is communicated responsibly and countries like India take concrete steps in incorporating biosecurity into national security frameworks to be on par with global counterparts. The US is determined to alter the standing global health has on its foreign policy. COVID-19, polarised domestic politics, and geopolitical tensions have overshadowed any apparent benefit the US would gain from increased engagement on global health. While it is not prudent for the US to completely step away from global health efforts, this serves as an impetus for India and the rest of the Global South to rethink the global health landscape, which undoubtedly needs reform and address its needs.

China’s EV Success Faces A Battery Recycling Problem – Analysis	By Yifei Li China’s electric vehicle (EV) industry has experienced an unprecedented surge in production and global dominance. But a new challenge looms — the growing wave of decommissioned vehicles as EV batteries reach the end of their lifecycle. This emerging trend is spawning a burgeoning sub-market for recycling and repurposing used batteries. The critical question is whether China is prepared to extend its EV leadership into the post-consumer segment of the supply chain. When record-keeping began in 2012, China produced just 13,000 EVs. By 2018, that figure grew nearly tenfold to 115,000 and expanded another tenfold to 1.2 million in 2024. This meteoric rise is widely attributed to state-backed policies, including investments in research and development, tax rebates and infrastructural subsidies. As of October 2024, Chinese firms dominate 76 per cent of the global EV market, making China the undisputed leader in the sector. At first glance, China appears well-positioned to lead in battery recycling. Yet the very factors that drove its rapid ascent in EV manufacturing — speed, scale, competitiveness and technological sophistication — are also introducing unique hurdles to its expansion into this market segment. The unprecedented speed of China’s EV development has outpaced the establishment of regulatory and informational frameworks. Unlike the European Union, where detailed legislationgoverns producer responsibilities, battery lifecycle tracing and supply chain due diligence, China’s regulatory infrastructure remains underdeveloped. This gap is particularly evident in the EV battery recycling sector, where success depends on a level playing field supported by clear and accountable regulations. The competitive nature of China’s EV market, which has spurred innovation across the supply chain, also complicates the landscape. The hyper-competitive industrial ecosystem is characterised by a multitude of market players, along with their subsidiaries and countless unofficial shadow affiliates. A substantial portion of the EV battery recycling supply chain operates in the shadows, beyond the reach of regulatory oversight. Between 2018 and 2023, China’s Ministry of Industry and Information Technology certified 156 firms to process decommissioned EV batteries, while over 40,000 companies hold business licenses for this activity. With fewer than four in 1,000 used EV batteries processed by certified recyclers, there is a clear need for more rigorous oversight. China’s technological prowess has been a cornerstone of its EV industry’s success, but it has outpaced the development of essential technical standards. The country, which holds 44 per centof the world’s EV-related patents, has made significant advancements in innovation. But key areas, such as estimating the remaining useful life of EV batteries and establishing reporting requirements for recycling, remain unstandardised. Although China has the ambitious goal to peak carbon emissions by 2030 and achieve carbon neutrality by 2060, the lack of a standardised framework for carbon accounting across the EV lifecycle leaves the environmental impact of EV batteries largely speculative. This gap undermines efforts to align the industry with its sustainability objectives. Despite these challenges, China has two unique advantages — the scale of its market and the potential for a nationally coherent regulatory framework. China’s massive market size is a critical asset. Recycling EV batteries requires significant upfront investment and is subject to market volatility, particularly in the pricing of critical minerals like lithium carbonate, which experienced a tenfold price swing between 2020 and 2022. China’s scale ensures that the market remains viable in the long term even with slim profit margins and hyper-competition. More importantly, the Chinese state has the potential to establish a unified market infrastructure. A robust framework would include mechanisms for enforcing producer responsibilities, tracking carbon footprints, standardising technical guidelines and ensuring transparency through reliable reporting, monitoring and verification systems. While progress has been made, the success of China’s EV battery recycling efforts will depend on the state’s ability to implement fair, accountable and transparent regulations. China’s extraordinary EV boom over the past decade has built a vast, innovative and globally dominant supply chain. As the industry expands into the post-consumer segment, the sustainability promise of this boom will depend on the industry’s capacity to responsibly manage post-consumer EV components. The robust development of the post-consumer segment serves as the true litmus test for the greenness of EVs, requiring concerted efforts to build the necessary legal, regulatory, technical and logistical infrastructure. With its scale and potential for regulatory cohesion, China can lead a global revolution in EV battery recycling. But whether it can seize this opportunity will depend on decisive state and industry action in the years to come.

For Inauguration Day, Open Federal Files And Give Truth A Chance ...	Federal agencies classify trillions of pages of documents each year—enough secrets to fill 20 million filing cabinets. Washington politicians and federal agencies routinely blindfold American citizens on the most important and most reckless decisions the government takes. As President Joe Biden told Special Counsel Robert Hur in late 2022, 'We over-classify everything…. And 99.9% of it has nothing to do with anything I couldn’t pick up and read out loud to the public.' The change in presidential administrations is the ideal chance for sweeping disclosures of pseudo-secrets that will provide a booster shot for American democracy. President-elect Donald Trump should follow the precedent set by President Barack Obama. In 2009, Obama speedily released many of the secret George W. Bush administration legal memos that asserted that a president could declare martial law in the US and ignore the Fourth Amendment and other constitutional safeguards. Those disclosures helped portray Obama as a champion of civil liberties, regardless of his novel prerogative that presidents were entitled to assassinate American citizens who were designated as terrorist suspects. Unfortunately, Trump in his first term failed to open the files to disclose Obama’s biggest unconstitutional power grabs. Federal secrecy is perhaps the most important bulwark of the Censorship Industrial Complex. Americans deserve to know how many blindfolds were slapped on Americans in recent years. The Supreme Court took a dive on the censorship issue last year by claiming that the victims did not have legal standing. It would be relatively simple to 'correct' that decision by disclosing a torrent of cases of 'Censors Gone Wild.' How many more humorous memes did the White House or federal agencies demand be suppressed? How many more internal emails or texts reveal White House appointees hellbent on muzzling critics regardless of the First Amendment? Americans deserve to know whether federal agencies secretly targeted them as terrorist suspects. A year ago, the House Judiciary Committee revealed that, according to federal agencies, anything you purchase can be used against you. And if you didn’t want to be categorized as a 'lone wolf' potential terrorist, you never should have bought that Bass Pro hat—one of the bizarre warning signs. If you bought a gun or ammo since 2021, federal bureaucrats may have automatically classified you as a 'potential active shooter.' The shocking details of that surveillance scheme need to be exposed as quickly as possible. At the same time, the feds cast absurdly broad nets of suspicion on average Americans, potentially incriminating details of Biden family dealings with China, Romania, Ukraine, and other nations were kept secret. DC is one paradox after another. The Founding Fathers recognized the perils of foreign entanglement but federal secrecy has shrouded the vast majority of details of recent US government blundering abroad. As I noted in an April 2023 Mises piece, practically the only candor regarding the Russia-Ukraine war occurred when secret documents leaked out revealing that the Ukrainian military was in far worse shape than the Biden administration claimed. The White House, State Department, and Pentagon were adamant that American citizens had no right to know how their tax dollars were being squandered in East Europe. Since those leaks in early 2023, the US government apparently pulled plenty of strings and may have paid plenty of money to deter a ceasefire in that war. White House and State Department officials bluntly opposed any cessation in hostilities in Eastern Europe. Opening files in the White House, Pentagon, State Department, and CIA could answer vital questions: Why was the US government seemingly doing everything possible to perpetuate the bloodbath? What steps, if any, did the White House take to prevent effective anti-fraud protections in the hundreds of billions of dollars in aid sent to Ukraine? Did Biden policymakers help perpetuate the Russia-Ukraine war to make Biden look tough or the world savior of democracy? The Pentagon Papers, leaked in 1971 by Daniel Ellsberg, helped vaccinate Americans against blindly trusting any president seeking to con them into a foreign conflict. Unfortunately, that vaccination faded as decades passed. Opening files on the US intervention in Ukraine could make it far more difficult for future presidents to drag the US into a foreign conflict. As WikiLeaks’s Julian Assange observed: 'If wars can be started by lies, they can be stopped by truth.' President Trump must make opening the files a top priority because otherwise damn little sunlight will disinfect Washington. The Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) has largely collapsed. Shortly before Trump’s first term, the House Committee on Government Oversight and Reform bluntly admitted: 'FOIA is broken.' Federal agencies have a backlog of hundreds of thousands of FOIA requests they haven’t answered and responses sometimes take years. Never forget that the Food and Drug Administration claimed it would need 75 years to disclose the Pfizer application for its covid vaccine that the FDA approved in 108 days. Unfortunately, such idiocy is practically Standard Operating Procedure inside the Beltway. Prior to the 2016 election, the State Department declared that it would require 75 years to comply with its FOIA request for emails from the top aides of Secretary of State Hillary Clinton (at a time when Hillary was running for president). Perhaps the only thing more absurd is the pretexts offered for refusing to disclose documents. The Drug Enforcement Administration denied a FOIA request by someone seeking 'information about his own kidnappers… because he did not have a signed waiver from the men who had held him hostage,' the Washington Examiner reported. A boot from the Trump White House will open far more filing cabinets than endless appeals to FOIA denials. The new president can reap the gratitude of millions of Americans for speedily shedding light on the biggest covid controversies. Why did the Centers for Disease Control in 2021 delay divulging the failure of covid vaccines to prevent infections and transmission? Are there other details waiting to be unearthed about how federal agencies bankrolled the reckless gain-of-function that escaped from the Wuhan Institute of Virology and killed seven million people around the globe? Sweeping disclosures of federal secrets and outrages are one of the best ways to break the dominance of Washington insiders. In a 2002 decision condemning the Bush administration’s mass secret arrests after 9/11, a federal appeals court declared, 'When government begins closing doors, it selectively controls information rightfully belonging to the people. Selective information is misinformation.' Washington’s pervasive secrecy vests vast power in any official who chooses to selectively leak documents to spin public perceptions. President Trump’s first administration was crippled by leaks—including former FBI chief James Comey’s personal memos that were delivered to the New York Times, leading to the unjustified appointment of Special Counsel Robert Mueller who roiled American politics for two years. Trump’s first impeachment was spurred by the 2019 leak of his phone call transcript with the Ukrainian president. Sweeping disclosures of unjustified secrets will undercut federal officials who might seek to undermine the new president with misleading selective leaks. Secrecy is not a technical glitch in administrative regimes. The whole point of secrecy is to prevent citizens from controlling the government. To expect bureaucracies to 'correct' excessive secrecy is like expecting kings to abdicate their thrones. There is no reason for citizens to trust secretive federal programs more than Washington trusts American citizens. Pervasive secrecy defines democracy: people merely select their Supreme Deceivers. If trillions of pages of new secrets a year is not a perversion of democracy, why not simply keep secret everything that the government does? Attorney General Ramsey Clark warned in 1967: 'Nothing so diminishes democracy as secrecy.' Yet Americans are still told that they are governing themselves because they are permitted to vote for presidents who appoint bureaucrats who drop an Iron Curtain around federal machinations. In his Farewell Address on Wednesday evening, President Biden warned: 'Americans are being buried under an avalanche of misinformation and disinformation enabling the abuse of power.' During the pandemic, the biggest misinformation of them all was Biden’s promise that anyone who got the covid vaccine would never be infected with covid. Biden also declared, 'The truth is smothered by lies told for power and for profit.' Secrecy and lying are two sides of the same political coin. If Biden is worried about 'lies told for power,' then he should not have perpetuated the secrecy regime that is an entitlement program for Washington liars. Even libertarians and pro-freedom zealots who oppose Trump should support exposing all the recent abuses committed by Washington politicians and bureaucrats. Shocking Americans by exposing federal crimes could provide an anti-Leviathan vaccination. That could be effective regardless of whether the Food and Drug Administration ever approves that vax.

The Competency Crisis Proliferating The West – OpEd	The essayist and military strategist, Aurelien, has written a paper entitled: The Strange Defeat (original in French). The ‘strange defeat’ being that of Europe’s ‘curious’ inability to understand Ukraine or its military mechanics. Aurelien highlights the strange lack of realism by which the West has approached the crisis — ' …and the almost pathological dissociation from the real world that it displays in its words and actions. Yet, even as the situation deteriorates, and the Russian forces advance everywhere, there is no sign that the West is becoming more reality-based in its understanding – and it is very likely that it will continue to live in its alternative construction of reality until it is forcibly expelled'. The writer continues in some detail (omitted here) to explain why NATO has no strategy for Ukraine and no real operational plan: 'It has only a series of ad hoc initiatives, linked together by vague aspirations that have no connection with real life plus the hope that ‘something [beneficial] will occur’. Our current Western political leaders have never had to develop such skills. Yet it is actually worse than that: not having developed these skills, not having advisers who have developed them, they cannot really understand what the Russians are doing, how and why they are doing it. Western leaders are like spectators who do not know the rules of chess or Go – and are trying to figure out who is winning'. 'What exactly was their goal? Now, responses such as ‘to send a message to Putin’, ‘complicate Russian logistics’, or ‘improve morale at home’ are no longer allowed. What I want to know is what is expected in concrete terms? What are the tangible results of their ‘messaging’? Can they guarantee that it will be understood? Have you anticipated the possible reactions of the Russians – and what will you do then?' The essential problem, Aurelien bluntly concludes, is that: 'our political classes and their parasites have no idea how to deal with such crises, or even how to understand them. The war in Ukraine involves forces that are orders of magnitude larger than any Western nation has deployed on operations since 1945 … Instead of real strategic objectives, they have only slogans and fanciful proposals'. Coldly put, the author explains that for complex reasons connected with the nature of western modernity, the liberal élites simply are not competent or professional in matters of security. And they do not understand its nature. U.S. cultural critic Walter Kirn makes rather similar claims in a very different, yet related, context: California Fires and America’s Competency Crisis – 'Los Angeles is in flames, yet California’s leaders seem helpless, unmasking a generation of public investment in non-essential services [that leaves the Authorities floundering amidst the predicted occurrence of the fires]'. On a Joe Rogan podcast earlier this month, a firefighter goes: 'It’s just going to be the right wind and fire’s going to start in the right place and it’s going to burn through LA all the way to the ocean, and there’s not a f***ing thing we can do about it'. Kirn observes: 'This isn’t the first fire or set of fires in Malibu. Just a few years ago, there were big fires. There always are. They’re inevitable. But having built this giant city in this place with this vulnerability, there are measures that can be taken to contain and to fend off the worst'. 'To fob it off on climate change, as I say, is a wonderful thing to tell yourself, but none of this started yesterday. My only point is this, has it done everything it can to prepare for an inevitable, unavoidable situation that perhaps in scale differs from the past, but certainly not in kind? Are its leaders up to the job? There’s not a lot of sign that they are. They haven’t been able to deal with things like homelessness without fires. So the question of whether all those things have been done, whether they’ve been done well, whether there was adequate water in fire hydrants, whether they were working at all, things like that, and whether the fire department was properly trained or properly staffed, all those questions are going to arise'. 'And as far as the competency crisis goes, I think that there will be ample material to portray this as aggravated by incompetence. California’s a state that’s become notorious for spending a lot of money on things that don’t work, on high-speed rail lines that never are constructed, on all sorts of construction projects and infrastructure projects that never come to pass. And in that context, I think this will be devastating to the power structure of California'. 'In a larger sense though, it’s going to remind people that a politics that has been for years now about language and philosophical constructs such as equity and so on, is going to be seen as having failed in the most essential way, to protect people. And that these people are powerful and influential and privileged is going to make that happen faster and in a more prominent fashion'. To which his colleague, journalist Matt Taibbi, responds: 'But pulling back in a broader sense, we do have a crisis of competency in this country. It has had a huge impact on American politics'. Kirn: '[Americans] They’re going to want less concern for the philosophical and/or even long-term political questions of equity and so on, I predict, and they’re going to want to lay in a minimum expectation of competence in natural disasters. In other words, this is a time when the priorities shift and I think that big change is coming, big, big change, because we look like we’ve been dealing with luxury problems, and we’ve certainly been dealing with other countries’ problems, Ukraine or whoever it might be, with massive funding. There are people in North Carolina right now still recovering from a flood and having a very difficult time as winter comes, which it doesn’t in LA in the same way, or as winter consolidates itself, I guess'; 'So looking forward, it’s not a question of blame, it’s what are people going to want? What are people going to value? What are they going to prize? Are their priorities going to shift? I think they will shift big time. Los Angeles will be a touchstone and it will be a touchstone for a new approach to government'. So we have this ‘divorce from reality’ and consequent ‘Competency Crisis’ – whether in California; Ukraine or Europe. Where lie the roots to this malaise? U.S. writer David Samuels believes this to be the answer: 'In his last days in office … President Barack Obama made the decision to set the country on a new course. On Dec. 23, 2016, he signed into law the Countering Foreign Propaganda and Disinformation Act, which used the language of defending the homeland to launch an open-ended, offensive information war, a war that fused the security infrastructure with the social media platforms – where the war supposedly was being fought'. However, collapse of the 20th-century media pyramid and its rapid replacement by monopoly social media platforms, had made it possible for the Obama White House to sell policy – and reconfigure social attitudes and prejudices – in entirely new ways. During the Trump years, Obama used these tools of the digital age to craft an entirely new type of power centre for himself – one that revolved around his unique position as the titular, though pointedly never-named, head of a Democratic Party which he succeeded in refashioning in his own image, Samuels writes. The ‘permission structure’ machine that Barack Obama and David Axelrod (a highly successful Chicago political consultant), built to replace the Democratic Party was in its essence a device for getting people to act against their beliefs by substituting new and ‘better’ beliefs through the top-down controlled and leveraged application of social pressure – effectively turning Axelrod’s construct into ‘an omnipotent thought-machine’, Samuels suggests: 'The term ‘echo chambers’ describes the process by which the White House and its wider penumbra of think tanks and NGOs deliberately created an entirely new class of experts who mutually credentialed each other on social media in order to advance assertions that would formerly have been seen as marginal or not credible'. The aim was for a platoon of aides, armed with laptops or smart phones, to ‘run’ with the latest inspired Party meme and to immediately repeat, and repeat it, across platforms, giving the appearance of an overwhelming tide of consensus filling the country. And thus giving people the ‘permission structure’ of apparent wide public assent to believe propositions that formerly they would never have supported. 'Where this analysis went wrong is the same place that the Obama team’s analysis of Trump went wrong: The wizards of the permission structure machine had become captives of the machinery that they built. The result was a fast-moving mirror world that could generate the velocity required to change the appearance of 'what people believe' overnight. The newly minted digital variant of 'public opinion' was rooted in the algorithms that determine how fads spread on social media, in which mass multiplied by speed equals momentum—speed being the key variable'. 'At every turn over the next four years, it was like a fever was spreading, and no one was immune. Spouses, children, colleagues, and supervisors at work began reciting, with the force of true believers, slogans they had only learned last week. It was the entirety of this apparatus, not just the ability to fashion clever or impactful tweets, that constituted the party’s new form of power'. 'In the end, however, the fever broke'. The credibility of Élites imploded. Samuels account amounts to a stark warning of the danger associated with distance opening up between an underlying reality and an invented reality that could be successfully messaged, and managed, from the White House. 'This possibility opened the door to a new potential for a large-scale disaster – like the war in Iraq', Samuels suggests. (Samuels does not specifically mention Ukraine, although this is implied throughout the argument). This – both the Obama tale, as told by David Samuels, and Walter Kirn’s story of California – augment Aurelien’s point about Ukraine and European military incompetence and lack of professionalism on the field: It is one of allowing a schism to open up between contrived narrative and reality – 'which', Samuels warns 'is to say that, with enough money, operatives could create and operationalize mutually reinforcing networks of activists and experts to validate a messaging arc that would short-circuit traditional methods of validation and analysis, and lead unwary actors and audience members alike to believe that things that they had never believed; or even heard of before: Were in fact not only plausible, but already widely accepted within their specific peer groups'. It constitutes the path to disaster – even risking nuclear disaster in the case of the Ukraine conflict. Will the ‘Competency Crisis’ reaching across such varied terrain trigger a re-think as Walter Kirn – a writer on cultural change – insists?

Trump Sentencing: Judicial System Again Defers To The Imperial Pr...	Republicans used to criticize courts for 'legislating from the bench,' and Chief Justice John Roberts claimed at his confirmation hearing that courts should just call balls and strikes. Yet the current U. S. Supreme Court, in recent rulings, has not only validated an imperial presidency that the Constitution’s framers would have found troubling but paved the way for a 'rogue presidency.' Even though the court voted to allow President Donald Trump’s video sentencing to proceed by a slim 5 to 4 vote, both those in the minority and majority and the New York justice officiating the case were deferential to an inflated conception of the American presidency. The four Supreme Court justices in the minority obviously thought that Trump–who committed the 34 felony counts before he became chief executive in 2017 and was convicted in 2024 after he left the office–should essentially escape scot-free from sentencing, even after a jury of his peers found him guilty as a private citizen. Because he had been elected president again despite his conviction and was in the long transition of two-and-a half-months before again taking office (other countries have much shorter transitions), the four justices held such an exalted view of the presidency that they thought somehow it might take away from his duties in an office he did not yet occupy. Those justices have clearly fallen victim to an extra-constitutionally strong American presidency. Yet even the majority of five Supreme Court justices—three appointed by Democrats and two by Republicans—and the New York justice overseeing the case seemed to be mesmerized by this grandiose conception of the American presidency. The Supreme Court majority ruling decreed that 'a brief virtual hearing' and New York Justice Juan Merchan’s 'unconditional discharge' sentence (free of any jail time, fine, probation, or community service), signaled in advance, imposed only a 'relatively insubstantial' burden of time on the president-elect. This Supreme Court result led one former New York judge, who had been in the courtroom, to declare that Merchan’s signaled non-sentence sentence to be a 'masterstroke.' And even Justice Merchan got on board with excessive deference to the presidency by invoking the supremacy clause of the Constitution that allows federal law to trump state law when they conflict. Merchan ruled that unconditional discharge was 'the only lawful sentence' that avoided 'encroaching on the highest office in the land.' Merchan also noted that he ruled as he did out of respect for the presidency, not for any occupant of the office. In fact, the American legal system, including judges at the federal and state level and the Justice Department, have more respect for the American presidency than the Constitution’s framers did. The Justice Department even has a rule that a sitting president cannot be prosecuted, which caused Special Counsel Jack Smith to give up prosecuting Trump. Of course, nothing in the Constitution prevents prosecution of a sitting president, but the Justice Department, with a blatant conflict of interest, just doesn’t want to be in the awkward position of prosecuting its boss. The Constitution’s framers–by placement of articles of the Constitution and the much greater number of enumerated powers given to the legislature than the president—clearly intended Congress to be the dominant branch of government, with an independent executive and judiciary designed to constrain the powerful legislative branch. Over the 236 years since the Constitution was ratified, and mostly during the 20th and 21st centuries, presidents have extra-constitutionally usurped congressional powers while Congress has willingly abdicated them and the judiciary has blessed it all. The Supreme Court recently has topped off this defilement of Madisonian constitutional checks and balances by giving the president 'presumptive immunity' from criminal prosecution as long as he is conducting official duties—intimating that he would be afraid to do his job properly if he didn’t have such a get-out-of-jail-free card. Historically, chief executives have never needed such immunity to stretch their powers beyond the bounds of the Constitution, so why would they need even more of an incentive to do so with immunity. Furthermore, if one of the president’s primary duties is to enforce the laws, why would he need immunity from prosecution for violating those same laws. In short, although he was an older first-time offender, Merchan could have justifiably sentenced Trump to a short stay in jail during the transition period for trying to intimidate prosecutors, witnesses, court employees, the jury, and even the justice during his trial.

Aristotle Predicted Trump’s Inauguration – OpEd	By James E. Jennings* The Athenian philosopher Aristotle predicted Donald Trump’s second inauguration on January 20, 2025 more than 2,300 years ago. How could he do that? It’s amazing but not very complicated. In Book V of Politics Aristotle wrote that democracies in their extreme form—a combination of oligarchy and unengaged citizenry—always end in tyranny. Demagogues take advantage of this situation to gain power and then act to make it absolute. He cited cases to show that has happened repeatedly in history to the detriment of the citizenry. Thomas Jefferson, who obviously had read Aristotle, agreed. 'Experience hath shewn, that even under the best forms of government those entrusted with power have, in time, and by slow operations, perverted it into tyranny.' Aristotle first studied human nature, then surveyed the politics of numerous poleis or city-states in the Greek World of the Aegean, Black Sea, and Eastern Mediterranean. 'Man is a political animal,' he famously wrote, from which we get the word politics. What he meant was simply that humans are animals that live in cities. Those Greek cities, every one independent, experienced elections, coup attempts, factionalism, and turmoil for hundreds of years. From his intense study of the history and politics of those units, he extracted certain principles that are rock-solid even today. Thus, anybody who was paying attention could have figured out that Trump—a genuine demagogue—would succeed in being elected. If Aristotle was right, Trump is not the problem—rather, he’s a symptom of an existing oligarchical system linked with multitudes of citizens having little commitment to or knowledge of the US constitution. Only 64% of eligible voters actually voted in 2024. Close to 90 million people didn’t vote. It’s true that a majority of those who voted, voted for Trump. Why is that not democracy in action? It is—but because of an underlying oligarchy and willy-nilly voters, we’ll have to wait to see whether or not Trump acts as a tyrant. But conditions are ripe for a tyranny. Changes in the US body politic over several decades show that our country has already ended its initial stage of being a Democratic Republic and become instead an oligarchy, ruled by the wealthy few. Witness the CEO salaries and the millionaires club that is the US Senate. Link that with a certain kind of uninvolved populism, and presto—you have a tyranny. Aristotle also nailed it in describing Trumps’ cabinet nominees Aristotle also nailed it in describing Trumps’ cabinet nominees as to whether they are worthy or not considering that several had the morals of alley cats or were otherwise unqualified. Tyrants surround themselves with bad men, Aristotle said, because they love flattery—and no one who has the least flame of freedom in his heart will lower himself in that way. Aristotle knew another thing about Trump—that he is fond of foreign autocrats and dictators like Russia’s Putin and China’s Xi Jinping: He predicted Trump’s tendency to favor such people by noting that tyrants would rather hang around with and have meals with other dictators than with his own countrymen. In Books VI and VII Aristotle brings politics down to where each of us lives. The preservation of a democracy, he said, depends on each one of us. George Washington likely read Aristotle too, because he praised civic virtue in almost the same words as Aristotle. Civic virtue, they agreed, depends on our individual virtue, ending in wise action. Each of us must therefore be devoted to virtue and wisdom, and translate that into action. James E.

Can Monetary And Fiscal Stimulus Counter Recessions? – OpEd	By Frank Shostak When signs of an economic weakness emerge, most 'experts' are quick to recommend fiscal and monetary stimulus. Economic activity is presented in terms of the circular flow of money—spending by one individual becomes part of the earnings of another individual, and spending by another individual becomes part of the first individual’s earnings. If, for some reason, individuals decide to reduce their spending, this would weaken the circular flow of money. Once an individual spends less, this worsens the situation of some other individual, who, in turn, also cuts spending. Following this logic, in order to prevent the effects of a recession, the government and the central bank should step in and raise government outlays and inflation, thereby filling the shortfall in the private sector spending. Allegedly, once the circular monetary flow is reestablished, things should go back to normal and sound economic growth is also reestablished. Can government grow an economy? The whole idea that government can grow an economy originates from the Keynesian multiplier. This asserts that an increase in government spending raises an economy’s output by a multiple of the initial government increase. For example, let us assume that, out of an additional dollar received, individuals spend $0.90 and save $0.10. Also, assume that the government increased its expenditure by $100 million. Individuals now have more money to spend because of increased government spending. Because of this, retailers’ revenue rises by $100 million. Retailers, in response to this increase in their income, consume 90 percent of the $100 million (i.e., they raise expenditure on goods and services by $90 million). The recipients of these $90 million, in turn, spend 90 percent of the $90 million (i.e., $81 million). Then, the recipients of the $81 million spend 90 percent of this sum ($72.9 million), and so on. The key in this model is that expenditure by one individual becomes the income of another individual. At each stage in the spending chain, individuals spend 90 percent of the additional income they receive. This process eventually ends, so it is held, with the total output higher by $1 billion (10*$100 million) than it was before the government had increased its initial expenditure by $100 million. The more that is spent from the additional income, the greater the multiplier is going to be and, therefore, the impact of the initial government spending on overall output is larger. For instance, if individuals change their habits and spend 95 percent from each dollar the multiplier is going to be 20. Conversely, if they decide to spend only 80 percent and save 20 percent then the multiplier will fall to 5. All this implies that the less is saved the larger the impact of an increase in government outlays on overall demand and on overall output. Assuming these things, it is not surprising that most economists today are of the view that fiscal and monetary stimulus can prevent the US economy falling into a recession. The popularizer of the magical power of the multiplier, John Maynard Keynes, wrote, If the Treasury were to fill old bottles with banknotes, bury them at suitable depths in disused coal mines which are then filled up to the surface with town rubbish, and leave it to private enterprise on well-tried principles of laissez-faire to dig the notes up again (the right to do so being obtained, of course by tendering for leases of the note-bearing territory), there need be no more unemployment and with the help of the repercussions, the real income of the community, and its capital wealth also, would probably become a good deal greater than it actually is. More Government Spending ≠ More Saving Let us examine the effect of an increase in the government’s demand on an economy’s process of saving formation. In an economy, which is comprised of a baker, a shoemaker and a tomato grower, another individual enters the scene. This individual is an enforcer who exercises his demand for goods by means of force. The baker, the shoemaker, and the farmer are forced to part with their products in exchange for nothing and this, in turn, weakens the flow of production of consumer goods. Similarly, not only does the increase in government demand—the increase in the enforcer’s demand—not raise the overall output by a positive multiple, but, on the contrary, this leads to the weakening of the process of saving in general. By means of taxation and borrowing, the government forces producers to part with their products for government services (i.e., for goods and services that are likely to be on a lower priority list of producers) and this, in turn, weakens the overall production of wealth. According to Mises, As against these popular fallacies there is need to emphasize the truism that a government can spend or invest only what it takes away from its citizens and that its additional spending and investment curtails the citizens’ spending and investment to the full extent of its quantity. What causes recessions? For most commentators, the occurrence of a recession is a result of unexpected events such as shocks that push the economy away from a trajectory of stable economic growth. Shocks weaken the economy (i.e., cause lower economic growth). In reality, as a rule, a recession emerges in response to a decline in the growth rate of money supply, after a prior prolonged period of inflation. A recession often follows a tighter monetary stance of the central bank, that is, when inflation of money and credit slows. Thus, various activities that sprang up during the previous inflationary period come under pressure. These activities cannot support themselves. They only survive because of the inflationary support that increases in money supply provided. The artificial increases in the money supply diverts production away from genuine wealth-generating activities. Consequently, this weakens such wealth-generating activities. Because monetary authorities cannot inflate endlessly (without destroying the monetary economy), they eventually tighten their monetary stance. As a result of the tighter stance and a consequent fall in the growth rate of the money supply, this undermines various non-wealth-generating activities and this is when a recession takes place. Given that, non-wealth-generating activities cannot continue to support themselves, since they cannot continue to be profitable once the growth rate of the money supply declines, these activities begin to deteriorate. Recession, then, is not about a weakening in economic activity as such, but about the liquidation of various non-wealth-generating activities that sprang up on the back of artificial increases in money supply. Obviously then, both aggressive fiscal and monetary policies, which are going to provide support to non-wealth-generating activities, are going to further distort the price and production structure, thereby weakening the prospects for a meaningful economic recovery. Hence, once an economy falls into a recession, the government and the central bank should restrain themselves and do nothing. Artificial fluctuations in the growth rate of the money supply always set in motion the phenomenon of boom-bust cycle. Increases in the money supply diverts production and saving from wealth-generators to non-wealth-generators. This causes artificial growth in these areas of production, made possibly by inflationary policies. Consequently, a decline in the money supply growth rate reveals these distortions and—because these companies must now decline or be liquidated—this leads to other economic issues (business failures, unemployment, etc.). Hence, it is the monetary and fiscal policies of the central bank that set in motion the boom-bust cycles. Whenever the central bank monetizes government outlays, this leads to the so-called economic 'boom,' that is, an artificial boom. Once the pace of government spending and monetization slows, there will be an economic bust. Conclusion During an economic crisis, governments and the central banks should do as little as possible. With less tampering, more prices and production can come into market alignment, the errors in the structure of production can be liquidated, more savings can be generated, and saving and capital investment can be directed toward true wealth-generators. This would lay the foundation for a durable economic growth. About the author: Frank Shostak is an Associated Scholar of the Mises Institute.

What RFK Jr. Should Do To Battle High-Fructose Corn Syrup – OpEd	By Benjamin Seevers A Department of Health & Human Services (HHS) run by Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. will likely go after crony interests in the health bureaucracy. If RFK Jr. wants to 'Make America Healthy Again,' then this would be a good start. However, not every change in the new administration is likely to be beneficial. For example, RFK Jr.—a lifelong progressive—will definitely not be afraid to use government intervention to achieve his policy objectives. That said, there is hope that he will at least be open to eliminating government interventions if they are found to foster negative health outcomes. The policies governing the market for high-fructose corn syrup offer a clear opportunity in this regard. RFK Jr. has called attention to corn syrup for causing childhood obesity before, so getting rid of this sugar substitute, which is commonly found in soft drinks, seems like something he wants to focus on. There are two ways that RFK Jr. can oppose corn syrup while also restoring the free market—by targeting corn subsidies and sugar import restrictions. Corn Subsidies First of all, corn subsidies can be decreased or abolished entirely. Corn growers earn about $2.2 billion in federal subsidies each year. Corn subsidies also consequently subsidize the production of high-fructose corn syrup, leading to an 'overconsumption.' If these subsidies were eliminated, then cane sugar would be relatively more affordable to use in soft drinks and many other products. There would doubtlessly be a transition away from corn syrup and back into cane sugar. Consistent defenders of the free market are enemies of all government subsidies, so this would be the perfect move for RFK Jr. and the Trump administration if they want to throw their libertarian-oriented supporters a bone. If they were to eliminate corn subsidies, they would not simply be encouraging the use of cane sugar over corn syrup; they would also be extending laissez-faire economic policy to the corn industry. Of course, corn growers will not support this. The corn lobby is very politically active, so the effort to eliminate corn subsidies will not go unchallenged. For instance, the Corn Refiners Association—the organization that represents those who refine corn into corn syrup—donated $600,000 in 2024 to federal-level politicians and PACs. The National Corn Growers Association donated $250,000. If the opposition by the corn lobby poses too much of a challenge, then RFK Jr. and the Trump administration can turn their sights on eliminating another policy: import restrictions on sugar. Sugar Tariffs and Quotas The United States has a long history of regulating sugar, and the various tariffs and quotas imposed today have their origin in policies that were put in place decades ago. In 1981, Ronald Reagan instituted import tariffs on sugar. He later instituted import quotas in 1983. This is all in light of the Agriculture and Food Act of 1981, which implemented price supports on sugar. Tariffs and quotas limit the foreign importation of sugar and have the indirect effect of incentivizing corn syrup production and consumption. Why? Taxing sugar imports leads to the price of sugar increasing because there is less access to cheaper, foreign-produced sugar. When the price of a good increases, the demand for its substitutes also increases as people seek alternative ways to satisfy their preferences at a lower price. Such substitutes, like corn syrup, consequently see higher consumption rates. Today, as a Cato report states: Any sugar imported beyond the quota amount, meanwhile, is subject to a tariff of 15.36 cents per pound for raw cane sugar and 16.21 cents per pound for refined sugar. To put this in context, the world price of refined sugar in 2017 generally fluctuated between 17 cents and 25 cents per pound. This may seem small, but it is actually quite significant. For example, Kraft Foods shut down plants in the US in order to avoid the burden of tariffs. A more relevant consequence is the response of Coca-Cola and Pepsi, who announced in 1984 that they would shift to corn syrup in response to the high sugar costs. It is clear that these policies should be abolished if we are to crack down on corn syrup and have a free market in sugar. Which Way, RFK? Eliminating or decreasing corn subsidies and sugar tariffs and quotas would be a good start for RFK Jr. and the Trump administration. Unfortunately, it may be politically impossible to accomplish these goals. The beneficiaries of the corn subsidies and sugar tariffs are large, highly organized companies that can afford to fight any political effort to overturn these policies. Those who are harmed—consumers—are dispersed and disorganized. It is much more costly to fight these measures; therefore, bad policies persist. Of course, if RFK Jr. is really reform-minded, then he could perhaps pick up some of the slack of dispersed costs. He could be a vocal and powerful antagonist to these industries that support policies that benefit themselves at the expense of others. However, even if change is politically impossible, we must understand the interventionist roots of the problems we face. If not, we are doomed to the vicious cycle wherein government intervention steps in to solve the problems caused by government interventions. As Ludwig von Mises states: Popular opinion ascribes all these evils to the capitalistic system. As a remedy for the undesirable effects of interventionism they ask for still more interventionism. They blame capitalism for the effects of the actions of governments which pursue an anti-capitalistic policy. All of this should be kept in mind over the next four years as the Trump administration attempts to make economic reforms. There are opportunities for rooting out interventionism, but this will not happen until we recognize government intervention as the cause of our economic problems rather than the solution. Neither RFK Jr. nor Trump has internalized this lesson, but let’s hope they can learn. Maybe then conservatives and their fellow travelers can hold fast to the oft-cited Reagan quote: In this present crisis, government is not the solution to our problem; government is the problem. From time to time we’ve been tempted to believe that society has become too complex to be managed by self-rule, that government by an elite group is superior to government for, by, and of the people. Well, if no one among us is capable of governing himself, then who among us has the capacity to govern someone else? About the author: Benjamin M.

European Parliament To Adopt Resolution On ‘Sham’ Election In Bel...	(RFE/RL) -- The European Parliament is set to vote on January 21 to adopt a resolution addressing the ongoing oppression and illegitimate elections under the authoritarian rule of Alyaksandr Lukashenka in Belarus. The draft resolution, obtained by RFE/RL, strongly denounces the planned presidential election in Belarus on January 26, labeling it a 'sham' due to the repressive environment and lack of democratic standards. Lukashenka, who has been president since 1994, is expected to win. The election campaign has been marked by voter intimidation, the suppression of independent media, and the barring of democratic candidates. U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said on January 17 that Belarus's 'repressive environment' prevents a free and fair presidential election. The draft European Parliament resolution reiterated its nonrecognition of Lukashenka's presidency and called for free and fair elections. The resolution also condemns systematic human rights violations in Belarus, the suppression of civil society, and the country's complicity in Russia's war against Ukraine, while reaffirming support for the Belarusian people in their pursuit of democracy and human rights. The draft resolution also highlights that over 1,250 political prisoners are being held in custody in Belarus, many of whom face torture, life-threatening conditions, and denial of medical care. The resolution stresses that civil society organizations, journalists, lawyers, religious leaders, and political activists continue to be persecuted in the country. Last week, Belarusian state broadcaster ONT aired a series of propaganda films called Svaboda Slova (Freedom of Speech), which featured interviews with jailed RFE/RL journalists. The draft European Parliament resolution urges EU member states to investigate human rights abuses in Belarus using universal jurisdiction, a legal principle that allows states or international organizations to claim criminal jurisdiction over an accused person regardless of where the crime was committed; support Lithuania's referral of Belarus to the International Criminal Court for crimes against humanity; and document and prosecute international crimes committed by the Lukashenka regime. The draft resolution praises the resilience of Belarusian democratic forces and civil society organizations. It calls for continued EU support, including visas, scholarships, and grants for exiled Belarusians; simplified visa processes for those fleeing persecution; and rehabilitation programs for political prisoners and their families. The draft resolution also reaffirms its support for Belarusian democratic forces, led by exiled opposition leader Svyatlana Tsikhanouskaya, and urges unity among pro-democracy movements.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWeLTMxFLBOUlzxQzcghq1AP	2025-01-20T16:06:32-08:00	
The State Of The Economy: What Is Donald Trump Inheriting? – Anal...	Voters prioritized the economy in the 2024 election, sending Donald Trump back to the White House. But what economic legacy is Joe Biden passing on to the new administration? 'It's the economy, stupid.' Coined by political strategist James Carville, these famous words have become synonymous with U.S. election success since 1992. Despite the growing influence of issues like immigration, climate change and foreign policy, many voters still prioritize economic factors when casting their ballots. President-elect Donald Trump claimed he made 'the greatest economy in U.S. history' during his first term and vows to do so again in 2025. But a lot depends on what a president inherits from his predecessors. Low unemployment rates and a soaring stock market built under former President Barack Obama’s administration following the 2008 financial crisis gave Trump a strong foundation the first time around. So, what economic legacy will Trump inherit from Biden? Simply put, high employment rates, strong GDP growth and low inflation often characterize a healthy economy. The country was still recovering from the COVID-19 pandemic when Biden was sworn in, but the last four years have proven resilient. Biden’s administration created almost 16 million new jobs in America — a key sign of positive economic growth. That good news was overshadowed for many Americans by inflation, which reached a 40-year high in 2022, with prices increasing by 9.1%. That impacted people’s purchasing power and made everyday items feel expensive. Annual inflation has now eased to around 3% but is still higher than the Federal Reserve’s 2% target, and prices for many items remain significantly higher than at the end of Trump’s first term. While real wages have since increased in America, workers may still feel the strain of stubbornly high grocery prices. This was a global issue linked to supply chain challenges and Russia’s war with Ukraine, and ordinary people paid the price. But massive deficit spending under Biden to head off the threat of a major recession also contributed. Biden has preferred to emphasize the promising picture of the jobs market he’s passing on, noting that the United States recorded its lowest unemployment rate in more than half a century during his term. About 2.7 million jobs were lost during Trump’s first term, partially due to the COVID-19 pandemic. So, he’ll face pressure to turn that legacy around. But Trump has already suggested mass layoffs across federal departments during his second term, which could increase unemployment rates if implemented. Another broad signal of a healthy economy is the increased value of goods and services, or GDP, which shows whether an economy is growing. The United States has long had the largest GDP in the world, surpassing nations such as India and China. GDP rose 7.6% during Trump’s first administration and increased by 11.8% under Biden, suggesting a strong post-pandemic recovery. Generally speaking, Biden's economic legacy is one of high employment, recovering GDP and declining inflation. But no president ever inherits a clean slate. The federal debt stands at $36.1 trillion, and public opinion about the economy is, at best, lukewarm. Some financial experts predict inflation may continue declining in 2025, but a broader context of geopolitical tensions, trade wars and climate change may also shape America’s financial future. Trump's task will be to sustain economic momentum while navigating the complexities of a rapidly evolving world.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWeLTMxFLBOUl-Fb4avN7oh8	2025-01-20T16:03:46-08:00	
Full Employment: One Last Time For The Road – OpEd	I’ve already given my Biden economy retrospective, but I want to come back and double down on the main point there, because I think it is incredibly important and largely overlooked. The one thing that Biden’s economic performance should clearly establish is the importance of running a full employment economy. There is no better way to give large benefits to tens of millions of people, especially groups facing discrimination in the labor market like Black workers and people with criminal records. Here’s the picture on unemployment over the last 75 years. Under Biden the unemployment rate fell sharply from 6.4 percent when he took office in January of 2021 to 3.9 percent in December. It stayed at 4.0 percent or lower until June of last year. That is the longest stretch of low unemployment in seventy years. The low of 3.4 percent, hit in April of 2023, was the lowest single month rate since the 1960s. This recovery was far faster than anyone had predicted, and the unemployment rate dipped lower than most economists thought possible. When Biden took office, The Congressional Budget Office had projected that we would end the year with 5.3 percent unemployment. It projected the rate would continue to decline slowly, hitting 4.2 percent in the last months of his term. In the Biden years, many pundits argued that unemployment doesn’t matter much because a one percentage point drop in the unemployment rate just means another 1.6 million people have jobs. That doesn’t seem like a very big deal in a workforce of 160 million. But this reasoning is badly confused. Full employment matters not just because it reduces the number of people who are unable to find jobs, but also because it improves the bargaining position of tens of millions of workers. The point is simple, but huge. In a normal month 5-6 million people lose or leave their job, with the vast majority looking for new ones. That translates into 60-70 million people over the course of the year coming into direct contact with the state of the labor market. For these people it matters enormously if there is a strong labor market near full employment or a sagging labor market where people struggle to find jobs. In a strong labor market these workers will be able to move to better jobs that pay more and offer better working conditions. It’s not an accident that we saw a recordlevel of workplace satisfaction in 2023 after we had record rates of job switches the prior year. The ability to leave for a better job also leaves workers better positioned to get pay raises at their current job, if they decide not to leave. This is especially true for workers at the lower end of the wage distribution. They have far more bargaining power than in a weak labor market. The graph below shows real wage growth (inflation-adjusted) since 1980 for workers at the 10th percentile, the 30th percentile, and the 50th percentile of the wage distribution. As can be seen, real wages at the 30th and 50th percentiles were essentially flat in the weak labor markets of the 1980s and the first half of the 1990s. Wages for workers at the 10th percentile actually fell by more than 10 percent over this period. As the labor market tightened in the second half of the 1990s, workers at all three points along the wage distribution saw substantial gains in real wages. (This was also helped by strong productivity growth.) The sharpest gains were for workers at the 10th percentile, whose pay closed some of the gap with slightly higher paid workers. Wages again plateaued in 2003 and then fall with the Great Recession. They begin rising again at all three points along the wage distribution as the labor market became reasonably tight in the second half of the decade. As in the strong labor market of the late 1990s, the fastest wage growth was at the 10th percentile. The data are somewhat skewed in 2020 because of the pandemic. The shutdowns caused tens of millions of workers to lose their jobs for at least part of the year. These workers were disproportionately concentrated in low-paying sectors like hotels and restaurants. With these workers out of jobs, the average pay of those still employed was higher, not because they got pay raises but because the lower paid workers are not included in the mix. To control for this composition effect, we can compare pay in 2023 with pay in 2019, before the pandemic. (We don’t have full data for 2024 yet, but it is virtually certain we will see further real wage gains at all points along the wage distribution.) The real wage of workers at the 50th percentile was 3.9 percent higher than in 2023 than in 2019. For workers at the 30th percentile, the rise was 2.9 percent, and for workers at the 10th percentile the gain was 13.2 percent. The gain for workers at the 10th percentile was extraordinary. It essentially reversed the gap in pay that developed in the 80s and the first half of the 1990s. The increases in pay for workers at the 30th and 50th percentile may not seem especially impressive. But it is worth noting that there were long periods where pay for workers at these points along the wage distribution was flat or falling, so by comparison, the increases in this four-year stretch are pretty respectable. The other point to keep in mind is that we were getting through a worldwide pandemic that disrupted economies everywhere. The United States was an outlier in seeing much more rapid growth than almost any other country in the recovery from the pandemic. And it was also an outlier in that workers actually had real wage gains. Again, the strong labor market we saw, with unemployment below 4.0 percent for most of this period, almost certainly played an important role. We also saw the predicted benefits of full unemployment in other areas. The unemployment rate for Black workers hit an all-time low of 4.8 percent in April of 2023. The unemployment rate for Black teens also hit an all-time low of 11.8 percent in May of 2023. And the unemployment rate for Hispanic workers tied its all-time low of 3.9 percent in September of 2022, matching the rate in September of 2019. These rates are all too high, and still indicate a substantial gap with white workers, but there was considerable progress in reducing the gap in the pandemic recovery. The Black-White wage gap was also reduced during this period. The 13 percent gap in 2023 is the lowest level on record. In short, there is considerable evidence that the quick move to full employment that we saw following the passage of the Biden recovery package had the predicted impact for the most disadvantaged groups in society. To be clear, this doesn’t mean that low wage workers or even workers at the median were doing great. They had to struggle with higher prices and rents. Those who did not own a home, but were hoping to buy one, got whacked with a one-two punch of higher house prices and a big jump in mortgage rates after the Fed started hiking in 2022. But there was substantial progress in this period by most measures, in spite of the pandemic, and full employment was a huge part of that picture. It is hard to envision a politically feasible social program that could provide anywhere near as much benefit to the bottom half of the wage distribution. This part of Biden’s legacy very much deserves to be applauded and remembered.

Beijing Sees Trump Presidency As ‘Critical’ Juncture For Sino-US ...	By Ray Chung and Qian Lang Beijing views the second presidency of Donald Trump as a 'critical' juncture that could improve ties with the United States, according to official commentaries in state media. 'The river of history is constantly flowing, and the critical points are often just a few steps,' the People’s Daily, official newspaper of the ruling Communist Party, said in an op-ed published on Monday, the Trump’s inauguration date. Describing the international situation as 'full of change and chaos,' the article said the bilateral relationship should be managed from a 'strategic and long-term perspective, which will bring more certainty to a turbulent world.' 'China-U.S. relations are the most important bilateral relations in the world ... affecting the future and destiny of mankind,' the commentary said, citing a need for more exchanges between the Chinese and American people. 'Both sides need to move towards each other,' it said. The official commentaries come amid multiple media reports that Trump plans to visit China within 100 days of taking office, and that a face-to-face meeting with Xi is on the cards. Chinese Vice President Han Zheng, who attended Trump’s inauguration ceremony on behalf of Xi Jinping, met with Vice President-elect J.D. Vance on Jan. 19 to discuss various bilateral issues including fentanyl, trade balance and regional stability. Han also met with Trump ally Elon Musk, telling him that American companies including Tesla are welcome to 'share the fruits' of China’s development. The nationalistic Global Times said the recent migration of TikTok users to China’s Xiaohongshu, or RedNote, social media platform and the exchanges seen on the platform between Chinese and Americans was a good example of positive 'people-to-people' exchanges. Trump-Xi phone call It also said Friday’s phone call between Trump and Xi was a 'compass' showing where the relationship is headed. 'This telephone conversation showcased interaction at the highest level, reflecting both sides' deep understanding of the importance of China-US relations and their positive attitude toward cooperation,' the paper said in a Jan. 20 op-ed. 'This call set the tone for the direction of China-U.S. relations in the coming period,' the article said, noting that demand for exchange-traded funds linked to Chinese stock indexes had spiked following the call. '[This] indirectly reflects how sensitive and hopeful the world is about the possibility of a good start to China-US relations,' it said. But it said the previous approach in Washington had led to 'negative assets' in the relationship and 'numerous problems that need solutions through dialogue.' It called on the new administration to 'move beyond the mindset of viewing China as a formidable enemy,' but it said China’s territorial claim on democratic Taiwan was 'a red line that China cannot allow to be challenged.' In Hong Kong, the Chinese-language Ming Pao newspaper said the Sino-U.S. relationship would likely get off to a 'relatively harmonious start under Trump 2.0,' citing the phone call and Xi’s invitation to the inauguration. 'However, the United States has always regarded China as the most important strategic competitor, and Trump’s high-ranking officials and staff have not changed their hawkish position,' the paper said in a Jan. 20 op-ed. 'There are still many variables when it comes to whether Sino-US relations can be stabilized and improved.' Current affairs commentator Wu Qiang said a more domestically focused approach to global cooperation is actually something that is shared by China and the Trump administration, and that the relationship would likely improve with more direct contact between Trump and Xi. 'At the very least, they can balance the relationship by strengthening the relationship between their individual leaders,' Wu said. 'This is the kind of strengthening that is welcomed by the leaders of China and also Russia.' He said such relationships would act as a 'parallel' axis of international cooperation, alongside the China-Russia alliance and the U.S. relationship with allies NATO, Europe and Southeast Asia. Russia, Trade Commentator Yuan Hongbing said Trump’s plan to visit China is likely part of a bid to get Beijing’s help with a ceasefire in Ukraine. 'The fundamental reason he is now showing goodwill towards Xi Jinping is that he wants to meet his diplomatic commitments,' Yuan said. 'Russia is already in a position of advantage on the battlefield.' But trade is also likely high on the agenda, according to Yuan and a veteran Chinese journalist who gave only the surname Kong for fear of reprisals. 'It’s part of the plan to make America great again,' Kong said, referencing Trump’s slogan. 'He believes that the trade deficit has had an impact on the U.S. economy.' 'But what kind of pressure he will bring to bear ... that will be a key focus of his trip to China.' Sun Kuo-hsiang, director of Taiwan’s Nanhua University, said Taiwan could see its defense concerns drop further down the list of U.S. priorities under Trump. 'During his first term, Trump put a strong emphasis on transactional diplomacy, and so he may use Taiwan as leverage, for example, reducing arms sales or limiting official contacts, in exchange for concessions from China on trade or international issues,' Sun told RFA Mandarin in a recent interview. He said that could undermine Taiwan’s ability to defend itself in the event of a Chinese invasion. 'If Sino-U.S. ties ease, then China may believe that the United States has softened on Taiwan, and step up its military and diplomatic activities,' Sun said. 'That will bring far more uncertainty to the situation in the Taiwan Strait.'	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWeLTMxFLBOUly6vLuj96nsM	2025-01-20T15:59:21-08:00	
Brazil Announces Nigeria As BRICS Partner	Currently holding the BRICS’ rotating presidency, Brazil has announced Nigeria as the group's newest partner. With this inclusion, the bloc now counts nine partner countries: Belarus, Bolivia, Kazakhstan, Cuba, Malaysia, Thailand, Uganda, Uzbekistan, and Nigeria, according to a statement from the Brazilian Ministry of Foreign Affairs issued last Friday (Jan. 17). The statement highlighted that 'Nigeria’s interests align with those of the other BRICS members, as it actively works to strengthen cooperation within the Global South and to advocate for reforms in global governance—issues that are priorities for Brazil’s current presidency.' Nigeria ranks among the top 30 countries by gross domestic product and boasts abundant natural resources, including oil and natural gas. Since the early 1970s, Nigeria has been a member of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), the cartel that sets the value of this commodity on the international market. BRICS The name BRICS derives from the acronym 'BRIC,' coined by British economist Jim O'Neill in 2001 to refer to the four leading emerging economies at the time: Brazil, Russia, India, and China. A decade later, South Africa joined the group, adding the 'S' to the original acronym. Alongside the five members, the group has included additional countries with the same status since August 2023: Saudi Arabia, Egypt, the United Arab Emirates, Ethiopia, and Iran. On January 6, Brazil announced that Indonesia would join BRICS as a full member. A meeting of BRICS members and partners is scheduled to take place in Rio de Janeiro in July.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWeLTMxFLBOUl9RB809r9qnu	2025-01-20T15:57:17-08:00	
Donald Trump: The Inagural Address – Transcript	THE PRESIDENT: Thank you. Thank you very much, everybody. (Applause.) Wow. Thank you very, very much. Vice President Vance, Speaker Johnson, Senator Thune, Chief Justice Roberts, justices of the Supreme Court of the United States, President Clinton, President Bush, President Obama, President Biden, Vice President Harris, and my fellow citizens, the golden age of America begins right now. (Applause.) From this day forward, our country will flourish and be respected again all over the world. We will be the envy of every nation, and we will not allow ourselves to be taken advantage of any longer. During every single day of the Trump administration, I will, very simply, put America first. (Applause.) Our sovereignty will be reclaimed. Our safety will be restored. The scales of justice will be rebalanced. The vicious, violent, and unfair weaponization of the Justice Department and our government will end. (Applause.) And our top priority will be to create a nation that is proud, prosperous, and free. (Applause.) America will soon be greater, stronger, and far more exceptional than ever before. (Applause.) I return to the presidency confident and optimistic that we are at the start of a thrilling new era of national success. A tide of change is sweeping the country, sunlight is pouring over the entire world, and America has the chance to seize this opportunity like never before. But first, we must be honest about the challenges we face. While they are plentiful, they will be annihilated by this great momentum that the world is now witnessing in the United States of America. As we gather today, our government confronts a crisis of trust. For many years, a radical and corrupt establishment has extracted power and wealth from our citizens while the pillars of our society lay broken and seemingly in complete disrepair. We now have a government that cannot manage even a simple crisis at home while, at the same time, stumbling into a continuing catalogue of catastrophic events abroad. It fails to protect our magnificent, law-abiding American citizens but provides sanctuary and protection for dangerous criminals, many from prisons and mental institutions, that have illegally entered our country from all over the world. We have a government that has given unlimited funding to the defense of foreign borders but refuses to defend American borders or, more importantly, its own people. Our country can no longer deliver basic services in times of emergency, as recently shown by the wonderful people of North Carolina — who have been treated so badly — (applause) — and other states who are still suffering from a hurricane that took place many months ago or, more recently, Los Angeles, where we are watching fires still tragically burn from weeks ago without even a token of defense. They’re raging through the houses and communities, even affecting some of the wealthiest and most powerful individuals in our country — some of whom are sitting here right now. They don’t have a home any longer. That’s interesting. But we can’t let this happen. Everyone is unable to do anything about it. That’s going to change. We have a public health system that does not deliver in times of disaster, yet more money is spent on it than any country anywhere in the world. And we have an education system that teaches our children to be ashamed of themselves — in many cases, to hate our country despite the love that we try so desperately to provide to them. All of this will change starting today, and it will change very quickly. (Applause.)My recent election is a mandate to completely and totally reverse a horrible betrayal and all of these many betrayals that have taken place and to give the people back their faith, their wealth, their democracy, and, indeed, their freedom. From this moment on, America’s decline is over. (Applause.)Our liberties and our nation’s glorious destiny will no longer be denied. And we will immediately restore the integrity, competency, and loyalty of America’s government. Over the past eight years, I have been tested and challenged more than any president in our 250-year history, and I’ve learned a lot along the way. The journey to reclaim our republic has not been an easy one — that, I can tell you. Those who wish to stop our cause have tried to take my freedom and, indeed, to take my life. Just a few months ago, in a beautiful Pennsylvania field, an assassin’s bullet ripped through my ear. But I felt then and believe even more so now that my life was saved for a reason. I was saved by God to make America great again. (Applause.)Thank you. Thank you. (Applause.) Thank you very much. (Applause.)That is why each day under our administration of American patriots, we will be working to meet every crisis with dignity and power and strength. We will move with purpose and speed to bring back hope, prosperity, safety, and peace for citizens of every race, religion, color, and creed. For American citizens, January 20th, 2025, is Liberation Day. (Applause.) It is my hope that our recent presidential election will be remembered as the greatest and most consequential election in the history of our country. As our victory showed, the entire nation is rapidly unifying behind our agenda with dramatic increases in support from virtually every element of our society: young and old, men and women, African Americans, Hispanic Americans, Asian Americans, urban, suburban, rural. And very importantly, we had a powerful win in all seven swing states — (applause) — and the popular vote, we won by millions of people. (Applause.) To the Black and Hispanic communities, I want to thank you for the tremendous outpouring of love and trust that you have shown me with your vote. We set records, and I will not forget it. I’ve heard your voices in the campaign, and I look forward to working with you in the years to come. Today is Martin Luther King Day. And his honor — this will be a great honor. But in his honor, we will strive together to make his dream a reality. We will make his dream come true. (Applause.)Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. (Applause.)National unity is now returning to America, and confidence and pride is soaring like never before. In everything we do, my administration will be inspired by a strong pursuit of excellence and unrelenting success. We will not forget our country, we will not forget our Constitution, and we will not forget our God. Can’t do that. (Applause.)Today, I will sign a series of historic executive orders. With these actions, we will begin the complete restoration of America and the revolution of common sense. It’s all about common sense. (Applause.)First, I will declare a national emergency at our southern border. (Applause.)All illegal entry will immediately be halted, and we will begin the process of returning millions and millions of criminal aliens back to the places from which they came. We will reinstate my Remain in Mexico policy. (Applause.)I will end the practice of catch and release. (Applause.)And I will send troops to the southern border to repel the disastrous invasion of our country. (Applause.)Under the orders I sign today, we will also be designating the cartels as foreign terrorist organizations. (Applause.)And by invoking the Alien Enemies Act of 1798, I will direct our government to use the full and immense power of federal and state law enforcement to eliminate the presence of all foreign gangs and criminal networks bringing devastating crime to U.S. soil, including our cities and inner cities. (Applause.) As commander in chief, I have no higher responsibility than to defend our country from threats and invasions, and that is exactly what I am going to do. We will do it at a level that nobody has ever seen before.Next, I will direct all members of my cabinet to marshal the vast powers at their disposal to defeat what was record inflation and rapidly bring down costs and prices. (Applause.) The inflation crisis was caused by massive overspending and escalating energy prices, and that is why today I will also declare a national energy emergency. We will drill, baby, drill. (Applause.)America will be a manufacturing nation once again, and we have something that no other manufacturing nation will ever have — the largest amount of oil and gas of any country on earth — and we are going to use it. We’ll use it. (Applause.)We will bring prices down, fill our strategic reserves up again right to the top, and export American energy all over the world. (Applause.) We will be a rich nation again, and it is that liquid gold under our feet that will help to do it. With my actions today, we will end the Green New Deal, and we will revoke the electric vehicle mandate, saving our auto industry and keeping my sacred pledge to our great American autoworkers. (Applause.)In other words, you’ll be able to buy the car of your choice.We will build automobiles in America again at a rate that nobody could have dreamt possible just a few years ago. And thank you to the autoworkers of our nation for your inspiring vote of confidence. We did tremendously with their vote. (Applause.) I will immediately begin the overhaul of our trade system to protect American workers and families. Instead of taxing our citizens to enrich other countries, we will tariff and tax foreign countries to enrich our citizens. (Applause.)For this purpose, we are establishing the External Revenue Service to collect all tariffs, duties, and revenues. It will be massive amounts of money pouring into our Treasury, coming from foreign sources. The American dream will soon be back and thriving like never before. To restore competence and effectiveness to our federal government, my administration will establish the brand-new Department of Government Efficiency. (Applause.)After years and years of illegal and unconstitutional federal efforts to restrict free expression, I also will sign an executive order to immediately stop all government censorship and bring back free speech to America. (Applause.)Never again will the immense power of the state be weaponized to persecute political opponents — something I know something about. (Laughter.) We will not allow that to happen. It will not happen again.Under my leadership, we will restore fair, equal, and impartial justice under the constitutional rule of law. (Applause.)And we are going to bring law and order back to our cities. (Applause.) This week, I will also end the government policy of trying to socially engineer race and gender into every aspect of public and private life. (Applause.) We will forge a society that is colorblind and merit-based. (Applause.) As of today, it will henceforth be the official policy of the United States government that there are only two genders: male and female. (Applause.)This week, I will reinstate any service members who were unjustly expelled from our military for objecting to the COVID vaccine mandate with full back pay. (Applause.)And I will sign an order to stop our warriors from being subjected to radical political theories and social experiments while on duty. It’s going to end immediately. (Applause.) Our armed forces will be freed to focus on their sole mission: defeating America’s enemies. (Applause.)Like in 2017, we will again build the strongest military the world has ever seen. We will measure our success not only by the battles we win but also by the wars that we end — and perhaps most importantly, the wars we never get into. (Applause.) My proudest legacy will be that of a peacemaker and unifier. That’s what I want to be: a peacemaker and a unifier.I’m pleased to say that as of yesterday, one day before I assumed office, the hostages in the Middle East are coming back home to their families. (Applause.)Thank you.America will reclaim its rightful place as the greatest, most powerful, most respected nation on earth, inspiring the awe and admiration of the entire world. A short time from now, we are going to be changing the name of the Gulf of Mexico to the Gulf of America — (applause) — and we will restore the name of a great president, William McKinley, to Mount McKinley, where it should be and where it belongs. (Applause.)President McKinley made our country very rich through tariffs and through talent — he was a natural businessman — and gave Teddy Roosevelt the money for many of the great things he did, including the Panama Canal, which has foolishly been given to the country of Panama after the United Spates — the United States — I mean, think of this — spent more money than ever spent on a project before and lost 38,000 lives in the building of the Panama Canal. We have been treated very badly from this foolish gift that should have never been made, and Panama’s promise to us has been broken. The purpose of our deal and the spirit of our treaty has been totally violated. American ships are being severely overcharged and not treated fairly in any way, shape, or form. And that includes the United States Navy.And above all, China is operating the Panama Canal. And we didn’t give it to China. We gave it to Panama, and we’re taking it back. (Applause.)Above all, my message to Americans today is that it is time for us to once again act with courage, vigor, and the vitality of history’s greatest civilization. So, as we liberate our nation, we will lead it to new heights of victory and success. We will not be deterred. Together, we will end the chronic disease epidemic and keep our children safe, healthy, and disease-free. The United States will once again consider itself a growing nation — one that increases our wealth, expands our territory, builds our cities, raises our expectations, and carries our flag into new and beautiful horizons. And we will pursue our manifest destiny into the stars, launching American astronauts to plant the Stars and Stripes on the planet Mars. (Applause.)Ambition is the lifeblood of a great nation, and, right now, our nation is more ambitious than any other. There’s no nation like our nation.Americans are explorers, builders, innovators, entrepreneurs, and pioneers. The spirit of the frontier is written into our hearts. The call of the next great adventure resounds from within our souls. Our American ancestors turned a small group of colonies on the edge of a vast continent into a mighty republic of the most extraordinary citizens on Earth. No one comes close.Americans pushed thousands of miles through a rugged land of untamed wilderness. They crossed deserts, scaled mountains, braved untold dangers, won the Wild West, ended slavery, rescued millions from tyranny, lifted billions from poverty, harnessed electricity, split the atom, launched mankind into the heavens, and put the universe of human knowledge into the palm of the human hand. If we work together, there is nothing we cannot do and no dream we cannot achieve. Many people thought it was impossible for me to stage such a historic political comeback. But as you see today, here I am. The American people have spoken. (Applause.)I stand before you now as proof that you should never believe that something is impossible to do. In America, the impossible is what we do best. (Applause.)From New York to Los Angeles, from Philadelphia to Phoenix, from Chicago to Miami, from Houston to right here in Washington, D.C., our country was forged and built by the generations of patriots who gave everything they had for our rights and for our freedom. They were farmers and soldiers, cowboys and factory workers, steelworkers and coal miners, police officers and pioneers who pushed onward, marched forward, and let no obstacle defeat their spirit or their pride. Together, they laid down the railroads, raised up the skyscrapers, built great highways, won two world wars, defeated fascism and communism, and triumphed over every single challenge that they faced. After all we have been through together, we stand on the verge of the four greatest years in American history. With your help, we will restore America promise and we will rebuild the nation that we love — and we love it so much. We are one people, one family, and one glorious nation under God. So, to every parent who dreams for their child and every child who dreams for their future, I am with you, I will fight for you, and I will win for you. We’re going to win like never before. (Applause.)Thank you. Thank you. (Applause.) Thank you. Thank you. (Applause.) In recent years, our nation has suffered greatly. But we are going to bring it back and make it great again, greater than ever before. We will be a nation like no other, full of compassion, courage, and exceptionalism. Our power will stop all wars and bring a new spirit of unity to a world that has been angry, violent, and totally unpredictable. America will be respected again and admired again, including by people of religion, faith, and goodwill. We will be prosperous, we will be proud, we will be strong, and we will win like never before. We will not be conquered, we will not be intimidated, we will not be broken, and we will not fail. From this day on, the United States of America will be a free, sovereign, and independent nation. We will stand bravely, we will live proudly, we will dream boldly, and nothing will stand in our way because we are Americans. The future is ours, and our golden age has just begun. Thank you. God bless America. Thank you all. Thank you. (Applause.) Thank you very much. Thank you very much. Thank you. (Applause.) Thank you. (Applause.)	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWeLTMxFLBOUl5udE0KpbDHJ	2025-01-20T15:56:03-08:00	
How The Gaza War Will Shape Israel’s Future – OpEd	A headline on The Times of Israel’s blog section said it all: 'For the first time, Israel just lost a war.' Regardless of the reasoning behind this statement, which the article published last week divided into 14 points, it suggests a shattering and unprecedented event in the 76-year history of the state of Israel. The consequences of this realization will have far-reaching effects on Israelis, impacting both this generation and the next. These repercussions will penetrate all sectors of Israeli society, from the political elite to the collective identity of ordinary Israelis. Interestingly, and tellingly, the article attributes Israel’s defeat solely to the outcome of the Gaza war, confined to the geographical area of the Gaza Strip. Not a single point addresses the ongoing crisis within Israel itself. Nor does it explore the psychological impact of what is being labeled as Israel’s first-ever defeat. Unlike previous military campaigns in Gaza — which were on a much smaller scale compared to this genocidal war — there is no significant strand of Israeli society claiming victory. The familiar rhetoric of 'mowing the grass,' which Israel often uses to describe its wars, is notably absent. Instead, there is a semi-consensus within Israel that the ceasefire deal was unequivocally bad, even disastrous for the country. The word 'bad' carries broad implications. For Israeli National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir, it represents a 'complete surrender.' For the equally extremist Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich, it is a 'dangerous deal' that compromises Israel’s 'national security.' Israeli President Isaac Herzog refrained from offering political specifics, but addressed the deal in equally strong terms: 'Let there be no illusions. This deal — when signed, approved and implemented — will bring with it deeply painful, challenging and harrowing moments.' Foreign Minister Gideon Sa’ar, along with other Israeli officials, tried to justify the deal by framing Israel’s ultimate goal as the freeing of captives. 'If we postpone the decision, we don’t know how many of them will survive,' he said. However, many in Israel, along with an increasing number of analysts, are now questioning the government’s narrative. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu had rejected similar ceasefire agreements last May and July, impeding any possibility of negotiations. In the time between those rejections and the eventual acceptance of the deal, tens of thousands of Palestinians were killed or wounded. While these tragedies have been entirely disregarded or dismissed in Israel, many Israeli captives were also killed, mostly in Israeli military strikes. Had Netanyahu accepted the deal earlier, many of these captives would likely still be alive. This fact will linger over whatever remains of Netanyahu’s political career, further defining his already controversial and corruption-riddled legacy. Ultimately, Netanyahu has failed on multiple fronts. Initially, he wanted to prevent his right-wing, extremist coalition from collapsing, even at the expense of most Israelis. As early as May last year, many prioritized the return of the captives over the continuation of the war. Netanyahu’s eventual concession was not driven by internal pressure, but by the stark realization that he could no longer win. The political crisis that had been brewing in Israel reached breaking point as Netanyahu’s administration scrambled to navigate the growing discontent. In an article published soon after the ceasefire announcement, Yedioth Ahronoth declared Netanyahu politically defeated, while army Chief of Staff Lt. Gen. Herzi Halevi was blamed for the military failure. In reality, Netanyahu has failed on both fronts. Military generals repeatedly urged him to end the war, believing Israel had achieved tactical victories in Gaza. During the war, Israel’s political and social crises deepened. But Netanyahu resorted to his old tactics. Instead of demonstrating true leadership, he engaged in political manipulation, lied when it suited him, threatened those who refused to follow his rules and deflected personal responsibility. Meanwhile, the Israeli public became increasingly disillusioned with the war’s direction and frustrated with Netanyahu and his coalition. In the end, the entire Kafkaesque structure of Israeli governance collapsed. The failure to manage both the political crisis and the military strategy left Israel’s leadership weakened and increasingly isolated from the public. Of course, Netanyahu will not give up easily. He is attempting to satisfy Ben-Gvir by insisting that Israel retains the right to return to war at any time. He will likely enable Smotrich to expand the illegal settlements in the West Bank and may try to redeem the military’s reputation by escalating operations there. These actions may buy Netanyahu some time, but they will not last. Most Israelis now want new elections. While previous elections have ignored Palestinians, the next vote will be almost entirely defined by the Gaza war and its aftermath. Israel is now facing the reality of a political and military failure on a scale previously unimaginable. Netanyahu’s handling of the situation will be remembered as a key moment in the country’s history and its consequences will continue to affect Israeli society for years to come. Netanyahu’s departure from the political stage seems inevitable — whether because of the war’s outcome, the next elections or simply due to illness and old age. However, the material and psychological impacts of the Gaza war on Israeli society will remain, and they are likely to have irreversible consequences. These effects could potentially threaten the survival of Israel itself.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWeLTMxFLBOUl3x9MCMotad2	2025-01-20T15:49:19-08:00	
EU Commission Doubles Down On Russian Asset Confiscation Despite ...	By Thomas Moller-Nielsen (EurActiv) -- The European Commission reiterated its refusal to rule out confiscating hundreds of billions of euros worth of frozen Russian assets on Monday, despite Belgium’s warnings that such a move could be illegal and jeopardise the financial stability of the eurozone. European Commissioner for Economy, Valdis Dombrovskis, said that while 'all economic and legal risks' associated with the seizure of Russian sovereign assets held in the EU should be 'duly considered,' the Kremlin must nevertheless be made to 'pay' for the harm inflicted on Ukraine during its nearly three-year-long war. Approximately €210 billion in Russian assets have been frozen in the EU since Moscow launched its full-scale invasion in February 2022. Around €180 billion are currently held in Euroclear, a Brussels-based clearinghouse. Dombrovskis’ remarks came just minutes after Belgium's Finance Minister, Vincent Van Peteghem, said that confiscating the assets poses serious 'legal' and 'economic risks' to the eurozone. The Flemish centrist also warned that confiscation could jeopardise member states' ability to finance a complex €48 billion G7 loan to Kyiv, which is backed by profits generated by the assets. 'The confiscation is a one-off measure, which is nothing compared to the continuous stream of resources that we obtain [from] the windfall profits,' Van Peteghem said. Dombrovskis, however, said that working out how the G7 loan would be refinanced if the assets were seized is an 'important, additional factor to consider' but ultimately not a decisive one. One EU diplomat said that Belgium is especially worried about the potential financial and reputational harm to Euroclear if the assets are unilaterally seized. Belgium 'wants legal certainty and assurances to avoid there being a risk either that third countries do not trust Euroclear with their money anymore, or that Russia sues the hell out of Euroclear,' they said. Meanwhile, the EU’s new top diplomat, Kaja Kallas, said that Ukraine has a 'legitimate claim' to Russia's sovereign assets. 'I will not use the word confiscation because it is really using the assets in a legal way,' she said during her parliamentary confirmation hearing in November. The Estonian's remarks were subsequently echoed by Dombrovskis, who told Bloomberg in December that Brussels should 'explore and work on all options' regarding the frozen assets. Many professional economists and other EU policymakers, however, have repeatedly warned about the risks associated with confiscation. European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde said last year that confiscating the assets risks 'breaking the international order... that you would want Russia to respect'. The head of Euroclear, Valerie Urbain, Euroclear CEO, similarly told Bloomberg last month that 'if there is a confiscation of assets, everything is up in the air'. Several other member states, including Germany, the Netherlands and Luxembourg, are also concerned about the legal and financial risks associated with confiscation, according to EU diplomats.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWeLTMxFLBOUl18i5kwdxT2n	2025-01-20T15:47:25-08:00	
Bangladesh: The Eye Of A Storm – Analysis	By Sanchita Bhattacharya 2024 was a watershed year for Bangladesh, as an elected Prime Minister, Sheikh Hasina, within seven months of taking oath for her fifth term (and fourth consecutive term) as Prime Minister, was forced not only to resign, but to flee Bangladesh, on August 5, 2024. Later, on August 8, an Interim Government led by Muhammad Yunus, was formed under the aegis of the Bangladesh Army and various Islamic radical elements. Before Sheikh Hasina's ouster, Bangladesh experienced violence and vandalism. The protests against the Quota System eventually became fierce in nature. The turmoil started after a High Court decision (June 5, 2024) reinstated a 30 per cent quota for family members of freedom fighters, who had fought during the Liberation movement of 1971. According to the High Court, the Government was free to reform the quota if it saw fit. However, on July 10, the Supreme Court suspended the High Court's order for a month, and was set to hear the Government's challenge on August 7. Nevertheless, commencing on July 14, the protests took a dark turn after a statement by Hasina on television in which she refused to accept any demands of the protestors, referred to them as razakars (members of an East Pakistan paramilitary force that opposed the freedom struggle of 1971 and collaborated with the Pakistan Army in its genocide). Violence intensified as the BTV building was torched on July 18; protestors attacked the former Mayor of Ghazipur, Jahangir Alam, and killed his bodyguard on July 19; and in Narsingdi District, protestors stormed a jail and freed hundreds of inmates before setting the building on fire. Under pressure, the Supreme Court preponed its verdict on July 21, curtailing the quota of Mukti Jodhha's families from 30 per cent to 5 per cent, with 93 per cent of positions now to be filled on merit. The remaining two per cent were assigned to people with disability, ethnic minorities, and transgender individuals. The Court also urged student protesters to return to their classes. Meanwhile, on July 31, Hasina government announced a ban on the Jamaat-e-Isami (JeI) and its student wing, Islami Chhatra Shibir (ICS). The Government claimed it had sufficient evidence that JeI and ICS were involved in killings, destructive and terrorist activities directly and through incitement. Following this ban, the situation became more tumultuous and countrywide protests, gradually led by Islamist radical elements, ultimately forced Hasina to flee Bangladesh and take refuge in India. Later, on September 4, the 13- member committee, formed by Health Ministry identified over 17,000 cases of fatalities and injuries at various hospitals across the country between July 17, 2024, and August 5, 2024. Also, the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) of the United Nations, in its report titled Preliminary Analysis of Recent Protests and Unrest in Bangladesh, published on August 16, 2024, observed that between 16 July and 11 August, more than 600 people were killed. Of these, nearly 400 deaths were reported from 16 July to 4 August, while around 250 people were reportedly killed following a new wave of protests between 5 and 6 August. However, apart from the Quota protest, according to partial data collated by South Asia Terrorism Portal (SATP) through 2024, there was not a single case of a fatality related to proscribed Islamist terrorist groups reported in the country, continuing with the trend established in the previous years, 2023, 2022 and 2021. 2024 recorded a total of 29 arrests of Islamist terrorists/radicals belonging to various groups, including 21 Ansar al-Islam/Ansarullah Bangla Team (ABT), four Jama'atul Ansar fil Hindal Sharqiya (JAFHS), three Hizb-ut-Tahrir (HuT), and one ICS cadre. However, at least 32 incidents of violence were reported in Rohingya refugee camps in Bangladesh in 2024. At least 38 persons (32 civilians, 1 SF trooper and 5 militants) were killed, and another 19 civilians were injured, in these incidents. The Rohingya crisis in Bangladesh, is aggravating due to armed conflict in the neighbouring Rakhine province of Myanmar. On December 23, Home Advisor Mohammad Jahangir Alam Chowdhury asserted that the government would not bring any change to its decision on preventing Rohingya entry to Bangladesh. On December 22, Touhid Hossain, Foreign Affairs Adviser added that, amid escalating conflict between the junta government and Arakan Army (AA) in Myanmar, a fresh 60,000 Rohingya had entered Bangladesh in the preceding two months. Local sources indicate that Rohingya are entering through 25-30 points along the Cox's Bazar and Bandarban borders, including Teknaf's Jadimora, Damdamia, Keruntali, and Ukhiya's Balukhali and Anjumanpara. Explaining the criminal activities of Rohingyas within Bangladesh, a report dated December 14, mentioned 11 militant groups operating out of Rohingya refugee camps in Bangladesh, which include the Rohingya Solidarity Organisation (RSO), Arakan Rohingya Salvation Army (ARSA), Arakan Rohingya Army (ARA). RSO is suspected to have partnerships with Al-Qaeda in Indian Sub-continent (AQIS) and JeI. These outfits have recruited young orphans (some as young as six years of age) from Rohingya camps in Bangladesh and are training them to fight when they turn teenagers. As reported on September 8, M. Gafuruddin Chowdhury, Chairman of the Ukhiya Panglakhali Union Parishad, noted that, since the fall of Sheikh Hasina's government, Rohingya infiltration had increased daily due to the lack of law enforcement, with brokers charging BDT 20,000 to BDT 30,000 per person to assist their entry into Bangladesh. The violence in Chittagong Hill Tracts (CHT) is also continuing. The CHT region, consisting of three hilly and forested southeastern Districts of Bandarban, Rangamati, and Khagracchari, witnessed increasing ethnic violence even after 26 years of the signing of the CHT Accord of 1997. According to partial data collated by SATP, in 2024, 25 fatalities were recorded in CHT, in comparison to 21 in 2023, 15 in 2022, and 10 through 2021. On October 6, the Interim Government imposed a travel ban on Districts of Rangamati, Khagrachhari, and Bandarban due to ethnic tensions between local minority communities and Bengali settlers. In a press statement issued on September 20, the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) reported on the clashes and escalating tensions in Khagrachhari and Rangamati, warning that the unrest could lead to severe riots across the three hill districts, and urged everyone to maintain peace and harmony. Since August 5, JeI has made a political comeback. On August 6, JeI opened its central office at Boro Moghbazar in Dhaka city, after 13 years. Later, on August 28, 2024, the Interim Government lifted the ban (imposed by Hasina's government on August 1) on JeI and ICS. The Home Ministry stated in its gazette that the government has rescinded the previous circular that banned JeI-ICS, citing the absence of specific evidence linking them to terrorist activities. The present Government believes that these organizations are not involved in such activities. ICS is also demonstrating its 'presence'. On October 29, ICS announced its Jahangirnagar University (JU) Committee, in a statement on its Facebook page. On October 28, a Facebook post by ICS revealed that it had 2,200 active members in the Islami University in Kushtia. On October 3, ICS's Dhaka University (DU) unit declared its full 14-member DU Committee. JeI-ICS are on a path to political resurrection, as their combined capacity was substantially diminished by the Hasina government. In 2009, Hasina established the International Crimes Tribunal (ICT) to try those accused of war crimes. The War Crimes (WC) Trials, which began on March 25, 2010, have so far indicted 50 members of JeI. Prominent leaders of the Jamaat were convicted and hanged, including JeI politician Abdul Quader Mollah (hanged in 2013), Ameer Matiur Rahman Nizami (hanged in 2016) and secretary general Ali Ahsan Mujaheed (hanged in 2015). Ghulam Azam was sentenced to 90 years in prison, while Delawar Hossain Sayedee's death sentence was commuted to life imprisonment. Both died while serving their jail terms. Since August, 2024, however, with increased political presence, the JeI-ICS combine is very much present on Bangladesh's political landscape. On December 15, Mia Golam Parwar, JeI 'secretary general' declared that JeI wants to establish an Islamic welfare state in Bangladesh: The Jamaat's associate brothers should spread out in the field to make the religion of Allah victorious. They should be by the side of the helpless people in their happiness and sorrow…They should win the hearts of the people with the ideals of Islam. Jamaat-e-Islami will gift the people of this country a developed Islamic welfare state free from hegemony, God willing. Ominously, after August 5, many radical and extremist operatives have been acquitted or released on bail. As reported on December 24, at least 144 militants belonging to ABT, Jama'atul Mujahideen Bangladesh (JMB), HuT and others, were released from jails, prominently including: on August 11, a top-listed ICS cadre, Nasir Uddin alias Shibir Nasir, was released from Chattagram Central Jail (Chittagong District) after 26 years; on August 26, ABT 'chief' Mufti Jashimuddin Rahmani was released on bail from Kashimpur High-Security Central Jail in Gazipur District of Dhaka Division; on October 22, 41 leaders of JeI-ICS were acquitted by a court after 11 years in a case filed under the Speedy Trial Act in Rangpur District; on October 24, a Narayanganj court acquitted Mamunul Haque, former 'joint secretary general' of Hefazat-e-Islam (HeI) and secretary general of Khelafat Majlish, in a rape case filed at the Sonargaon Police Station in 2021. Besides, religious minorities, have been going through harrowing times, as the Jihadi element within Bangladesh society now operate with absolute impunity. According to partial data collated by SATP, since August 5, 2024, there have been at least 27 instances of minority persecution in Bangladesh. Minorities have been subjected to lynching, arrest, robbery, desecration of their temples, land grabbing, etc. The affected Districts were Kishoreganj, Netrokona, Sunamganj, Moulvibazar in the east; Mymensingh, Rangpur, Kurigram, Dinajpur in the north; Khulna, Patuakhali and Lakshmipur in the south; Rajshahi in the west; and Rangamati in the CHT, among others. On August 13, the Bangladesh Jatiya Hindu Mahazot (BJHM), an alliance of 23 Hindu religious organisations, said that following the fall of the Hasina government, the Hindu community faced attacks and threats in 278 locations across 48 districts. Furthermore, there have been incidents of vandalism in Sufi shrines. On September 10, a mob attacked the Shah Paran shrine in Sylhet District; on September 13, the shrine of Fakir Charu Miji Shah in Laxminarayanpur of Noakhali District was vandalised; on November 26, an incident of vandalism, looting and arson took place at the shrine of Murshidpur Pir in the Lachmanpur area of Sherpur District. After the initial anti Awami League furor, which was the common point of convergence for all radical organisations, led by the JeI-BNP cohort, there are reports suggesting infightings between these groups. For instance, on December 21, 10 people were injured in a clash between JeI and BNP at Sagata Upazila (Sub-District) in Gaibandha District. Police said that the clash took place over the naming of a BNP leader in an Islamic meeting in Saghata Sardar Para village. On December 2, HeI condemned and protested a case filed against its prominent Islamic scholars and leaders, by a follower of the Maulana Saad faction of Tablighi Jamaat, with the Joint District Judge's Court in Dhaka District. In a statement sent to the media, HeI 'secretary general' Sajidur Rahman called for the immediate withdrawal of the case, terming it as an attempt to malign the country's respected Islamic scholars. Earlier, as reported on November 29, Amir Nurul Kabir of JeI's Mirsrai Upazila branch said that the convenor of the Mirsrai Municipality Jubo Dal (youth wing of BNP), Kamrul Hasan, attacked JeI leaders and workers. On October 10, Islami Andolan Bangladesh (IAB) 'district president' Mufti Maulana Habibur Rahman accused BNP members of collecting BDT 401.7 million in extortion since August 5 in the Kalapara and Rangabali Upazilas of Patuakhali District. Under the ongoing mayhem in the country, the caretaker government and its radical cohorts are trying to carve out their own areas of influence. With no declared date for future election, even after five months, the country is at the mercy of extremist elements. Their agenda of a totalitarian regime in the garb of a 'welfare Islamic state' will ultimately lead Bangladesh into an extremist darkness.

India: Unending Disruptions In Manipur – Analysis	By Priyanka Devi Kshetrimayum On January 14, 2025, suspected militants dropped two bombs from a drone hovering over the 5 Manipur Rifles camp under the Lamsang Police Station area in Imphal West District. The bombs exploded near a bunker in the camp, but no casualties were reported. On January 13, a United National Liberation Front-Koireng (UNLF-Koireng) statement claimed responsibility for the shooting of an alleged rapist, Khaidem Nongdam Khanganba (30), at an unidentified location in Manipur, for a rape incident that occurred on January 10. The outfit's 'secretary of publicity', M. Shak-Hen, claimed that the accused was punished after an 'in-depth investigation' as per the victim's complaint. Khanganba was injured in the shooting. These are the two violent incidents reported in 2025, thus far (data till January 19). According to partial data compiled by the South Asia Terrorism Portal (SATP), 87 persons, including 51 civilians, six Security Force (SF) personnel and 30 terrorists, were killed in insurgency-related incidents in 2024. During 2023, the number of such fatalities had stood at 157 (66 civilians, 17 SF personnel, 73 terrorists and one Not Specified, NS). There were seven fatalities (five civilians, one SF trooper and one terrorist) in 2022, 27 fatalities in 2021 (eight civilians, five SF troopers and 14 terrorists), seven fatalities in 2020 (one civilian, three SF troopers and three terrorists), nine fatalities in 2019 (four civilians and five terrorists), 23 in 2018 (seven civilians, seven SF trooper and nine terrorists), 55 in 2017 (23 civilians, nine SF personnel, 22 terrorists and one NS), 36 in 2016 (14 civilians, 13 SF personnel and nine terrorists) and 97 in 2015 (18 civilians, 24 SF personnel, 14 terrorists and three NS). Though overall fatalities in 2024 came down by 44.58 per cent as compared to 2023, the numbers were still very high for a state which had been well on the path of establishing near normalcy prior to 2023. As SAIR had noted earlier,the sudden spike commenced after the outbreak of ethnic clashes between the Kuki and Meitei communities, first in the Churachandpur District of the State on May 3, 2023. The clashes spread rapidly across the state and continue till date, though the intensity has come down. Moreover, the overall fatalities in 2024 fell as compared to 2023, substantially because of fall in terrorist fatalities by 58.9 per cent. The state also witnessed drastic changes in the activities of the militants and different implications of the ethnic strife which started in May 3, 2023. One such change was the increasing use of drones for targeted killings. Apart from the January 14, 2025, incident mentioned above, four drone incidents were reported in 2024. The first known drone bomb attack was on September 1, 2024, where two people were killed and nine were injured in a drone attack in the Koutruk, Kadangband and Singda areas of Imphal West District, contiguous to Kangpokpi District. The other three drone incidents included: September 2: Three people were injured in a bomb attack using drones in Senjam Chirang Maning Leikai in Imphal West District. September 2: Three sophisticated service weapons were looted by unidentified armed miscreants from Indian Reserve Battalion (IRB) personnel after launching an attack accompanied by mortar and drone bombings in Meikhang village under the jurisdiction of the Lamlai Police Station in Imphal East District. October 30: Kuki Militants launched an attack with drone bombings at Kadangband in Imphal West District. The bomb dropped by the drone struck the north side of the residence of Okram Hardash (35) from Kadangband Part-2, Mayai Leikai, under the Lamshang Police Station area in Imphal West District. However, there were no casualties. Eyewitnesses to the incident claimed to have sighted a drone shortly after the sound of the explosion. In the midst of the unresolved conflict between Meitei and the Kuki/Zo disrupting normal activities, the Meitei-dominated Valley districts witnessed a surge in abductions and extortion as well. Inputs from State Police sources indicate that most weapons looted from armouries during the conflict were being used by insurgent groups in the Valley to threaten traders and government employees for money. Meanwhile, on November 22, 2024, Manipur Security Advisor Kuldiep Singh said that 3,000 of around 6,000 looted weapons have been recovered. With rising disruption in the valley region, on November 14, 2024, the Union Ministry of Home Affairs (UMHA) re-imposed the Disturbed Areas Act and the Armed Forces Special Powers Act (AFSPA) in the jurisdiction of six Police Stations in the Valley areas of Manipur. The Disturbed Areas status, which was in place in all of Manipur, excluding19 Police Stations in the Meitei-dominated Valley, from where it had been withdrawn between April 2022 and April 2023, has now been extended to the jurisdictions of Sekmai and Lamsang Police Stations in Imphal West District, Lamlai in Imphal East District, Moirang in Bishnupur District, Leimakhong in Kangpokpi District and Jiribam Police Station in Jiribam District. In a security review meeting on January 4, 2025, with Manipur Governor Ajay Kumar Bhalla, an unnamed Government official stated that Yaingangpokpi (YKPI) in Imphal East, a buffer zone between the Valley and hills, has become the latest flashpoint of violence in Manipur. The area witnessed at least 50 incidents of firing since December 24, 2024. The camps of Kuki-Zo insurgent groups and United National Liberation Front (UNLF) are located on the periphery of YKPI. Meanwhile, the rivalry amongst different insurgent outfits, significantly between Zeliangrong United Front (ZUF) and the National Socialist Council of Nagaland-Isak-Muivah (NSCN-IM) continued. Some of the incidents involving ZUF, NSCN-IM and Kuki National Army-Burma (KNA-B) in 2024 are: December 1: A gunfight broke out between ZUF and NSCN-IM at Longsai (Nungsai) Chingkao Part I under the Khoupum Police Station in Noney District. No casualties were reported. November 28: A gunfight took place between cadres of ZUF and the NSCN-IM in the inter-village areas of Sangji and Dollang, under Khoupum Police Station in Noney District. No casualties were reported. June 15: A 'captain' of the NSCN-IM, R.S. Winson, was ambushed and killed by the KNA-B near the Indo-Myanmar border in Ango Ching, across the Tengnoupal District. April 11: A suspected ZUF cadre, Alur Chiru (48), was killed in captivity by suspected NSCN-IM cadres at Chuwangphu Nungang Village under the jurisdiction of the New Keithelmanbi Police Station in Kangpokpi District. Alur Chiru was ZUF's 'joint secretary'. March 11: An exchange of fire took place between cadres of NSCN-IM and ZUF near Zeikulong village in Churachandpur District. The clash resulted in minor injuries to two militants. Meanwhile, there have been co-ordinated efforts by the SFs to control the possible fallout of militant activities. According to partial data compiled by SATP, seven militants have been arrested in 2025 (data till January 19). 376 militants were arrested in 2024 in comparison to 191 militants in 2023. The arrested militants in 2024 belonged to Kangleipak Communist Party - People's War Group (KCP-PWG), 87; Kanglei Yawol Kanna Lup (KYKL), 48; People's Revolutionary Party of Kangleipak (PREPAK), 22; People's Liberation Army (PLA), 21; PREPAK-Progressive (PREPAK-Pro) and KCP-Nongdrenkhomba, 19 each; KCP-Taibanganba (KCP-T), 17; UNLF-Pambei, 14; UNLF and KCP-Noyon, 12 each; Socialist Revolution Party Kangleipak (SOREPA) and UNLF-Koireng, eight each; KCP-Military Council (KCP-MC) and KCP, six each; KCP-Apunba City Meitei (KCP-ACM) and United People's Party of Kangleipak (UPPK), five each; Zomi Revolutionary Army (ZRA) and Kuki National Front (KNF), four each; KCP-City Meitei, KCP-Lamyanba Khuman and KCP-Miyamgi Fingang Lanmi (KCP-MFL), three each; KCP-Military Council Progressive (KCP-MCP), PREPAK (Red Army), and National Revolutionary Front of Manipur (NRFM), two each; and one each from the Kuki Liberation Army (KLA), United Kuki Liberation Front (UKLF), Manipur Naga Revolutionary Front (MNRF), KNA, UNLF-Ningon Macha group and Kuki National Front-Military Council (KNF-MC). In one incident five militants affiliated with KYKL, PREPAK and NSCN-IM were arrested. The group identities of 33 militants were not available. Significantly, the National Investigation Agency (NIA) ramped up action to bring down militant activities in Manipur. Some of the steps taken up by NIA in 2024 were: November 29: NIA filed a charge sheet against Lunminsei Kipgen alias Langinmang alias Mang alias Levi (35), a Kuki militant from Mamong village in Churachandpur District, in connection with the killing of four civilians on January 18, 2024, by a group of Kuki militants, including Kipgen in Ningthoukhong. The NIA investigation revealed that Kipgen, who was previously a cadre of KNF-President (KNF-P), had joined another Kuki militant organisation, United Kuki National Army (UKNA), and was involved in the attack. He was subsequently arrested by Assam Police on March 20, 2024. October 28: NIA formally arrested a cadre of KNF-MC, identified as Thongminthang Haokip alias Thangboi Haokip alias Roger (38), in connection with the killing of two Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) jawans in Naranseina in Bishnupur District. Thongminthang was lodged in District Jail, Rohini, New Delhi. He was also in contact with KNF-B in Myanmar, seeking logistics support to escalate the volatility in Manipur and create terror. NIA investigations further revealed that Roger had meetings with leaders of the People's Defense Force (PDF)/KNF-B to procure arms, ammunition, and explosives for use in the ongoing violence in Manipur. April 12: NIA charge sheeted two accused, including the main conspirator identified as Seiminlun Gangte alias Minlun and another accused identified as Mohammad Noor Hussain alias Tomba alias Mohammad Nur Hasan, in the June 2023 Kwatka (Manipur) vehicle borne improvised explosive device (IED) blast case, in which three persons were injured and several public and private properties were damaged. March 13: NIA arrested three cadres of the UNLF-P, including the outfit's 'army chief' identified as Thokchom Thoiba alias Sidabamapu and 'chief intelligence in-charge' identified as Laimayum Ingba in Imphal West District. Despite the efforts from SFs and central intelligence agencies to control the security situation in Manipur, the trust between civilians and the armed forces has broken down. The recent attack on January 3, 2025, by Kuki protestors on the office of the Superintendent of Police (SP), Kangpokpi district over the demand for the withdrawal of SFs deployed at Saibol village (Uyok Ching) by the Committee on Tribal Unity (CoTU), was one case in point, among several. Manipur Governor Ajay Kumar Bhalla while assessing the state's overall security situation on January 4, 2025, directed the state's Director General of Police to put the safety and security of the population first, and called on the Army and paramilitary officers to fully assist the government in upholding law and order in the state. He also suggested that the State police use legal options such as the National Security Act (NSA), 1980, which provides detention for a year without trial, against miscreants and troublemakers in the state. The volatile situation of the state is the failure of the representatives of Meitei and Kuki/Zo to reach a negotiation point in addressing the crisis. 10 Members of Legislative Assembly (MLAs) from the Kuki/Zo have long been demanding the removal of Chief Minister N. Biren Singh, on the grounds that, on several occasions, the state government under Biren Singh had a one-sided approach favouring the Meitei community, while suppressing and curtailing the rights of the disadvantaged tribal community. On December 10, 2024, they submitted a memorandum to Prime Minister stating, Apart from the prolonged and chronic discrimination towards the hill districts in matters of development by the successive Meitei majoritarian state governments, it is sad to see the discrimination being worsened in this time of the conflict for the last 19 months. In response, Biren Singh claimed, on the occasion of Nupi Lal commemoration on December 12, 2024, 'the state and central governments have been putting all efforts to bring a permanent solution. However, bringing a solution would take time as the situation had become chronic and fragile.' SFs in Manipur are striving to curb militant activities that escalated significantly following the ethnic conflict that commenced on May 3, 2023. However, these efforts are hobbled by a sense of mistrust that has emerged among the public towards the government and SFs. There is an urgent need for actions by SFs to foster a conducive environment while engaging with the civilians. Meanwhile, the militants' disruptive actions through extortion, abduction, and acts of terrorism continue to instil fear and anxiety among the population. Both the state and central Government have failed to ensure accountability and to take effective action to resolve the current ethnic violence in Manipur.

As Trump Takes Power, Defense Pick’s ASEAN Fumble Raises Concerns	Southeast Asia is greeting Donald Trump’s return to the White House with a mix of hope and hesitation as he embarks on his second term as U.S. president. Trump took the oath of office on Monday inside the Capitol after the ceremony was moved indoors because of weather reports that a polar vortex would bring frigid temperatures to the nation’s capital. Even as regional leaders anticipate greater engagement with the United States, a controversial moment involving his defense secretary nominee, Pete Hegseth, has raised concerns about how the administration will treat relations with the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN). Hegseth, a former Army National Guard officer and television commentator, was unable to name ASEAN member states or identify the bloc’s size during his confirmation hearing last week, drawing criticism both in Washington and across Southeast Asia. 'He doesn’t understand that the Defense Department’s work in the South China Sea, where the U.S. plays a major role, involves many ASEAN countries,' Isa Gharti, a public policy researcher at Chiang Mai University in Thailand, told BenarNews. 'This lack of understanding could bring problems to ASEAN countries in the long term.' ASEAN has been central to Washington’s strategy in the Indo-Pacific. The bloc, which includes Indonesia, Malaysia, Vietnam and Singapore among its 10 members, represents more than 680 million people and collectively forms the world’s fifth-largest economy. The United States counts two other ASEAN nations, Thailand and the Philippines, as treaty allies and has sought to deepen ties with the group to counter China’s growing influence in the region. The U.S. military has access to nine Philippine bases. China has made significant inroads in Southeast Asia, investing in infrastructure projects and using its economic clout to build partnerships. The South China Sea, where Beijing’s territorial claims overlap with those of several ASEAN nations, remains a key flashpoint in the region. While Hegseth fumbled in responding to questions from Sen. Tammy Duckworth, who was born in Bangkok and injured in combat while serving in the U.S. military, regional leaders have expressed optimism about U.S. engagement under Trump’s leadership. Indonesian President Prabowo Subianto has congratulated Trump on his victory and expressed his desire for a personal meeting. Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim hailed Trump’s election a 'remarkable political comeback' and voiced optimism about the potential for a deeper partnership with the United States. Analysts react Raden Mokhamad Luthfi, a defense analyst at Universitas Al Azhar Indonesia, said he is skeptical about future defense relations between the United States and Indonesia, the world’s largest Muslim-majority country, citing what he described as Hegseth’s and Trump’s unfavorable views of Muslims. Cristina Palabay, secretary general of the Philippine rights group Karapatan, accused Washington of using allies including the Philippines to further its strategic goals. 'Trump’s hostility toward China certainly matches, if not surpasses, that of Biden,' Palabay said. In Bangkok, Phumtham Wechayachai, Thai deputy prime minister and defense minister, struck a cautious tone. 'After Trump’s inauguration as U.S. president, we need to see what adjustments may be needed,' Phumtham told reporters. 'Overall, the foundation of U.S.-Thai relations is already good. We will consider any proposals according to Thai principles and make any adjustments that benefit the nation.' Other analysts suggested that Hegseth’s misstep might not significantly impact U.S. engagement with the region. 'It would be folly to assume that just because the secretary of defense may not be familiar with ASEAN, that is tantamount to weaker U.S. engagement,' said Julio Amador, a geopolitical analyst based in Manila. 'The Pentagon is a huge bureaucracy and Hegseth’s deputies are well-versed in the geopolitics of the Indo-Pacific.' Muhammad Waffaa Kharisma, a researcher at the Centre for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) in Jakarta, argued that ASEAN is not strategically significant to the United States. 'Perhaps some ASEAN member states are, but ASEAN as an institution isn’t, especially in an era when enthusiasm for multilateral organizations has waned,' Waffaa told BenarNews. He added that Trump’s first term as president was 'not particularly enthusiastic' about ASEAN. 'They came up with initiatives which were seen as undermining ASEAN, including the Quad,' he said, referring to a security dialogue among the United States, Japan, India and Australia. ‘Limited awareness’ Asrul Hadi Abdullah Sani, a partner at ADA Southeast Asia, a regional consultancy firm, said Hegseth’s 'gaffe underscores the limited awareness of ASEAN in American political circles.' Still, concerns remain about the Trump administration’s long-term priorities. 'We will need to plan for a worst-case scenario in which Trump and Xi will reach a modus vivendi that sacrifices the Philippines’ national interests,' Rommel Jude Ong, a retired Philippine Navy rear admiral, told BenarNews while calling for stronger ties with other regional powers such as Japan and Australia. Xi is Xi Jinping, China's president. Meanwhile, a social media user in Southeast Asia questioned Hegseth’s comments. 'Not having heard of ASEAN doesn’t mean it doesn’t exist. All of us here in the ASEAN are cringing over what’s happening over there in the West,' a Filipina who goes by the username @tessgarcia wrote on X, formerly Twitter. 'Geography-challenged people like Hegseth are probably the reason the U.S. lost in Vietnam (an ASEAN country).' Jason Gutierrez and Gerard Carreon in Manila, Jon Preechawong in Bangkok, Iman Muttaqin Yusof and Iskandar Zulkarnain in Kuala Lumpur, Pizaro Gozali Idrus and Tria Dianti in Jakarta contributed to this report.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWeLTMxFLBOUl-bfkhDygXIg	2025-01-20T15:43:08-08:00	
What Donald Trump’s Return To The White House Means For The Middl...	By Jonathan Gornall On Monday, the 47th president of the US was sworn in at a ceremony at the US Capitol in Washington D.C., marking perhaps the greatest political comeback in American history. For the Middle East, the second inauguration of Donald Trump is expected to usher in a new era of US engagement, overseen by an instinctively disruptive president who is as hard to read as he is transactional. If any evidence was needed that the incoming administration is eager to wield its influence in the region, it came on January 15, when the outgoing president announced the long-awaited Israel-Hamas ceasefire-for-hostages deal had finally been agreed. For the now former president, Joe Biden, announcing the breakthrough 'after eight months of nonstop negotiation by my administration,' it should have been a triumphant, legacy-defining moment. Instead, he was blindsided by the first question hurled at him by the media. 'Who will the history books credit for this, Mr. President?' a reporter called out. 'You or Trump?' Biden, clearly shocked, paused before replying: 'Is that a joke?' But it wasn’t a joke. The only thing that had changed about the ceasefire deal that his administration had been pushing for since May last year was that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu had finally agreed to it. And the only thing that had changed for Netanyahu was that the man he sees as his friend and most important ally was about to return to office. For Netanyahu, this seemed the right moment to present Trump with a gift — vindication of the new president’s boast that he would end the war as soon as he took office. Trump even dispatched Steve Witkoff, his newly appointed envoy to the Middle East, to join Biden’s man, Brett McGurk, for the last 96 hours of talks in Doha, to ensure that the incoming US administration had its mark on the deal. The appointment of Witkoff came as a surprise to many, as he does not have a diplomatic background. Witkoff does, however, have a reputation as a formidable dealmaker, which fits with Trump’s fondness for transactional foreign policy. But quite what deal Witkoff might have offered Netanyahu on Trump’s behalf remains to be seen. 'The ceasefire in Gaza is something Trump has claimed credit for, which is unclear. But we shouldn’t think his arrival is good news,' said Kelly Petillo, MENA program manager for the European Council on Foreign Relations. 'We have no idea what Trump has in mind for day-after plans in Gaza. And we don’t know what Trump and his Middle East envoy have promised to Netanyahu in return for him accepting to move forward with the ceasefire. 'We don’t even know if the ceasefire will hold until the next, second phase. The ceasefire does not involve the release of all the hostages and Trump has declared he will ‘unleash hell’ if not all of them are released.' Unlike Biden, said Ahron Bregman, a former Israeli soldier and senior teaching fellow in the Department of War Studies at King’s College London, 'Trump is not someone Netanyahu can easily ignore. 'Even before Trump assumed office, he pressed Netanyahu to strike a deal with Hamas. As a result, Netanyahu surprisingly showed a willingness to concede assets — such as the Philadelphi route — which he had previously deemed critical to Israeli security.' When the ceasefire deal was announced, Trump wasted no time taking to Truth Social to tell his 8.5 million followers: 'This EPIC ceasefire agreement could have only happened as a result of our Historic Victory in November, as it signaled to the entire World that my Administration would seek Peace and negotiate deals to ensure the safety of all Americans, and our Allies.' Itamar Rabinovich, a former Israeli ambassador to the US, anticipates a gear change in US relations with the region. 'I expect greater involvement in the Middle East by the Trump administration,' said Rabinovich, professor emeritus of Middle Eastern history at Tel Aviv University. 'In the Arab-Israeli context (there will be a) continuation of the effort to end the war in Gaza and possibly to move on to a more ambitious effort to resolve the larger Israeli-Palestinian conflict.' However, Trump’s natural affinity with Israel, expressed most keenly through the Abraham Accords, to which he is expected to return with renewed energy, does not bode well for the Palestinian cause. Neither do some of the appointments to Trump’s top team. His appointment of former Arkansas governor Mike Huckabee as ambassador to Israel indicates that any 'resolution' of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict favored by the incoming US administration will favor Israel, at Palestine’s expense. Huckabee, an evangelical Christian with deep, biblically inspired connections to Israel, a country he has visited more than 100 times since 1973, is an open opponent of Palestinian sovereignty. He is an ardent supporter of settlements, stating during a 2017 visit to Israel that 'there’s no such thing as a settlement — they’re communities, they’re neighborhoods, they’re cities. There’s no such thing as an occupation.' He has also said 'there’s really no such thing as a Palestinian.' Trump’s new Secretary of State, Marco Rubio, is another staunch ally of Israel who has called for a clampdown on pro-Palestinian protesters in the US and condemned 'the poison' of the boycott, divestment, and sanctions movement. He has also said there should be no ceasefire in Gaza until Israel has destroyed 'every element' of Hamas. The nomination of pro-Israel Congresswoman Elise Stefanik as ambassador to the UN bodes ill for attempts to pursue Palestinian sovereignty through the UN General Assembly. Last May, on one of many trips she has made to Israel, she addressed members of the Knesset, 'in your eternal capital, the holy city of Jerusalem,' declaring herself 'a lifelong admirer, supporter, and true friend of Israel and the Jewish people.' In the wake of Trump’s scene-stealing intervention in the Gaza ceasefire deal, all eyes in the region will be on his wider agenda for the Middle East. At the top of that agenda is Iran. How that plays out could have serious repercussions for Tehran’s neighbors. Around that, said Petillo, 'there is huge unpredictability. Trump is highly unpredictable and likes to remain that way. But we also know that much of what he will do depends on who whispers in his ear at the right time before he is making a decision. 'There are different people in his administration that might push him to go either in the most destructive direction — for instance seeking other maximum pressure style policies to support Israel and address their security concerns vis-a-vis Iran — and others who want to end US involvement in the region and are in favor of deals.' But any chance that the Iran nuclear deal will be reinstated surely evaporated with Trump’s re-election. It was, after all, Trump who unilaterally withdrew America from the deal in 2018, instituting new sanctions. He has signalled his intention to return to a policy of 'maximum pressure.' 'More widely on Israel-Palestine, Trump will likely pick up where he left off — the Abraham Accords, which he deems a success and which have largely held so far despite rifts caused by the war in Gaza,' said Petillo. 'The big prize of course is a Saudi deal — and I think this will impact whether he will do another round of maximum pressure on Iran as he said he would.' Saudi Arabia has made clear that any move toward normalization of relations with Israel would be dependent on clear steps towards Palestinian sovereignty. In September, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman said the Kingdom 'will not stop its tireless work towards the establishment of an independent Palestinian state with East Jerusalem as its capital, and we affirm that the Kingdom will not establish diplomatic relations with Israel without that.' Shortly after, Saudi Foreign Minister Prince Faisal bin Farhan Al-Saud announced the formation of a global alliance to push for a two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Implementing the two-state solution, he said, was 'the best solution to break the cycle of conflict and suffering, and enforce a new reality in which the entire region, including Israel, enjoys security and coexistence.' But according to Petillo: 'Trump’s arrival is not good news for the chances of a two-state solution. Trump and his new administration simply don’t care about Palestinian rights, annexation is likely to be used as a threat and settlements are likely to expand, and the whole issue risks becoming a big real-estate project, with huge consequences for Palestinian security, but I think also for that of ordinary Israelis.' In November, Bader Mousa Al-Saif, an associate fellow on the MENA program at Chatham House and a historian at Georgetown University, wrote that Trump would find the Gulf region much changed since he last engaged with it. Since then, 'the Arab Gulf states have made strides in the intervening years by taking matters into their own hands — reconciling intra-Gulf discord, freezing the Yemen conflict, and making overtures to regional neighbours like Iran, Syria, and Turkiye.' Moreover, he added, 'the Saudis have banked on a clear precondition for normalization — the end of Israeli occupation and establishment of a Palestinian state.' However, according to Ibrahim Al-Marashi, associate professor in the Department of History at California State University San Marcos, a different kind of deal could break the deadlock. 'Trump’s repudiation of the Iran nuclear deal served as the primary causal factor in intensifying tensions, escalating into direct violence,' he said. 'This violence played out primarily on Iraqi soil, albeit with a brief period of clashes in Syria. 'Trump wants a nuclear deal on his terms that he can claim credit for. If he gets that and sanctions are lifted on Iran, then tensions might finally subside.' Burcu Ozcelik, a senior research fellow on Middle East security at the Royal United Services Institute, believes 'the Trump administration will be unlikely to backtrack on, or jeopardize, the progress that has been made to weaken Iran’s status in the Middle East. 'The region is transforming in ways unimaginable 15 months ago, with new political futures possible in Lebanon and Syria,' he said. 'The weakening of both Iran and Russia in the Middle East represents a success story, and Trump will want this dynamic to continue — and to take credit for it.' And to be recognized for it, as a main plank of his legacy. 'Trump’s desire for a Nobel Prize might push him toward pursuing a peace deal or normalization between Israel and Saudi Arabia,' said Bregman. 'Achieving this would require Netanyahu to make some progress toward a Palestinian state, a prerequisite for advancing Israeli-Saudi relations. This won’t be easy. But Netanyahu’s wariness of Trump might compel him to act.'	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWeLTMxFLBOUl0MqhbXSisRU	2025-01-20T15:41:48-08:00	
Domestic Politics Not Security Or Economics Sabotage US Steel’s J...	By Anthony P D’Costa Both outgoing President Joe Biden and President-elect Donald Trump have vowed to prevent Nippon Steel’s purchase of US Steel to protect jobs, support local economies and maintain national security. These may be worthy goals. But Nippon Steel’s offer of technology transfer, investment funds for facility upgrades and US-government veto power over any would-be capacity reduction of US Steel mean that these goals could still be met. Nippon Steel has also pulled out of its partnership with Chinese company Baoshan Steel. While this decision was motivated by Nippon’s business logic, in the game of geopolitics, the move further cements Japan’s relationship with the United States. The rift between the US and Japan over the proposed purchase of US Steel is emblematic of the long history of politics of the American steel industry and the evolution of global industrial production. Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania in the 19th and early 20th centuries was the epicentre of global steel production. It housed US Steel, the world’s first billion-dollar company, established in 1901. At one point it controlled over 60 per cent of the American market. 75 years later, the American steel industry, along with auto and other heavy manufacturing industries, was in a deep crisis. The process of ‘deindustrialisation’ had begun. The United States phased out nearly 46 million metric tons (mt) of steel capacity between 1978 and 1988, with Pittsburgh bearing a third of these losses. By the 1980s, Nippon Steel had displaced US Steel as the largest steel producer outside the Soviet Union. In 2023, China’s Baowu Group leads global production with 131 million mt, followed by Arcelor-Mittal at 69 million mt. Nippon Steel ranks 4th with 44 million mt, while US Steel is ranked at 23 with 16 million mt. National steel production had its moment of glory in an earlier economic structure when heavy manufacturing was the bedrock of economic growth, jobs, regional development and innovation. There was also an ideological convergence between mill owners and workers when the competition got rough, despite the historically antagonistic labour–management relations in the industry. That convergence is harder to maintain under globalisation, though geopolitics and anti-foreign provincialism periodically unite the two contending parties. China has become the manufacturing workshop of the world, while the US still holds its technological and services sector advantage in high tech. The relative importance of steel to the economy is no longer what it was. High tech, big tech, bio tech, electric vehicles, e-commerce, information technology, semiconductors, rockets and satellites are the new drivers of economies. Not bulk steel. While steel is relevant to national security, particularly during conflict, large global capacity and multiple producers reduce supply risks. It is the politics of swing states in America like Pennsylvania that compel the need to hold onto the last few high-wage blue-collar industrial jobs and maintain a semblance of social harmony. These same sentiments were on display, although more keenly during the Jimmy Carter and Ronald Reagan years, when deindustrialisation was in full swing. The 1968 Voluntary Restraint Agreements — which saw quantitative limits placed on steel imports — sought to counter alleged unfair trading practices from Japanese and Western European producers. With the collapse in the US steel market and the subsequent financial distress of several companies, the Carter administration introduced the Trigger Price Mechanism. This policy established a minimum floor price for imports to protect domestic steel producers against so called Japanese ‘dumping’. These protectionist policies turned out to be stop-gap measures. Mill closures continued to lead to job losses, while supply shortages hit the automotive industry and raised domestic prices, compelling consumers to seek cheaper steel from abroad and foreign producers strategically shipping higher-grade steel to America. The industry lost 300,000 jobs after 1980 due to restructuring despite these attempts to protect it. While foreign ownership raises legitimate concerns about the rationalisation of global production and net losses in output and employment, Nippon Steel already has operations in the United States. Many Japanese and domestic auto companies in the United States rely on US-based Japanese steel producers, highlighting the intersectoral links between producers and business consumers. Unlike small developing countries, the United States also maintains significant leverage over multinational corporations. The US government under eminent domain could always resume direct control of US Steel should there be a national security scare. Besides, the US$15 billion transaction is no mean offer for US Steel, given its share price, which is considerably lower than Nippon Steel’s. Given that it was the US with its ‘free trade, free market’ slogan that ushered in globalisation, playing the victim now is bad for optics. In the end, it is all politics, and that is not all bad if the public is to be served well. But the distinction between friend and foe and between short- and long-term outcomes must be clear. Japan is a reliable ally and the US has been a beneficiary of Japanese manufacturing and innovations, just as Japan has gained from US technological, cultural and services sectors. A temporary reprieve by not selling US Steel is no panacea for saving American steel production. If history is any guide, it was US Steel that diversified its assets to Marathon Oil because its business was not to make steel but profits. A more thoughtful industrial policy focused on investments in plant and equipment, worker training, skill development and research and development would better serve long-term industrial competitiveness. Achieving these goals requires open markets, strategic collaboration with allies like Japan and competitive capacity, not just national ownership.

Myanmar Military Regime Enters Year 5 In Terminal Decline – Analy...	By Zachary Abuza Myanmar’s military approaches the fourth anniversary of the coup d’etat that put them in power in terminal decline. The economy continues to atrophy, with even more pronounced energy shortages, less foreign exchange, and an even larger share of the budget allocated to the military. The battlefield losses are staggering, as the opposition has withstood Chinese pressure to stop their offensives, and continues to hand the over-stretched military defeat after defeat. Opposition forces now control two of the 14 military regional commands. According to the National Unity Government (NUG) Ministry of Defense, the opposition is in full control of 95 of 330 townships, while the State Administrative Council (SAC), as the junta calls itself, had full control over 107 townships. By the junta’s own admission, they are only able to conduct a census and safely organize elections in 161 of Myanmar’s 330 townships. Losses on all battlefronts Having taken 15 of 17 townships in Rakhine state, the Arakan Army is now in almost total control of the key western state. They’ve surrounded the Rakhine capital of Sittwe and come up to the border of Kyaukphyu where China’s special economic zone and port are located. Although the capture of Buthidaung and Ann were neither quick nor easy, the AA was able to sustain sieges of over a month at each, and in the case of the former, tunneled beneath the last military outpost in a stunning display of grit. Having captured the southern city of Gwa, the Arakan Army has now crossed into Ayeyarwaddy, taking the fight into the Bamar ethnic majority heartland. In the north, the Kachin Independence Army (KIA) has shrugged off extensive Chinese pressure, and taken the strategic junction town of Mansi, which will make the overland resupply of the besieged city of Bhamo from Mandalay very hard for the junta. Fighting is ongoing in Bhamo, Kachin’s second largest city. The KIA is now in control of well over half of Kachin, including most of the resource rich regions. Although they are known for fractiousness, Chin opposition forces are now in almost full control of that state that borders India and Bangladesh, holding five of nine townships, roughly 85% of the territory. In Shan state, the Myanmar National Democratic Alliance Army (MNDAA) and the Ta’ang National Liberation Army (TNLA) temporarily succumbed to Chinese pressure to stop their offensive in November, but they’ve neither surrendered Lashio nor ceded territory, despite airstrikes. Citing a new military offensive in Naungcho township, the TNLA, which controls nine townships, announced an end to the ceasefire on Jan. 9. In eastern Myanmar, Karenni resistance have continued to battle, despite concerted military regime efforts and airstrikes, and their acknowledged ammunition shortages. The Karenni National Defense Force and allied People’s Defense Forces (PDFs) militias claim to control 80% of Kayah state. Further south, the Karen National Liberation Army and allied people’s defense forces (PDFs) are slowly taking pro-junta border guard posts along the frontier with Thailand. In Tanintharyi, local PDFs have increased their coordination and are pushing west from the Thai border towards the Andaman Sea coast, diminishing the scope of the military-controlled patchwork of terrain in Myanmar’s southernmost state. Some of the most intense fighting of late has been in the Bamar heartland, including Sagaing, Magway, and Mandalay. The military has stepped up their bombings, artillery strikes, and arson, intentionally targeting civilians for their support of the opposition forces. A number of PDFs have expanded their operations into the dry zone. Mounting troubles The Myanmar military regime faces severe headwinds as the fourth anniversary of the Feb. 1, 2021 coup approaches. Prisoners of war from multiple fronts have recounted that the military’s ability to resupply and reinforce troops in the field has all but broken down. They have a limited number of heavy lift helicopters, including three new Mi-17s that entered service in December. But even those are vulnerable: Some six Mi-17s and two other helicopters have been lost since the coup. In some cases, the military has tried to parachute in supplies, but those often fall into the hands of the opposition forces. Nothing demoralizes troops more than the feeling that the headquarters has abandoned them. The military has always treated Myanmar as a country under occupation, with thousands of remote outposts scattered throughout the country. The NUG claims that opposition forces have captured 741 of these through 2024, and they continue to fall. The military is increasingly short of manpower. Over a thousand POWs have been taken in recent months, more have surrendered and others have deserted. The military has now taken in nine tranches of conscripts, amounting to roughly 45,000 troops, and is increasingly dragooning men. But they are deployed almost immediately and are untrained and poorly motivated, in sharp contrast with ethnic resistance organizations (EROs) and PDFs. That loss of manpower includes senior officers. The NUG claims that in 2024, 53 senior officers, ranked colonel to major general, were killed, captured or injured. The military is so broke that they recently announced that they would no longer pay death benefits to conscripts. At the same time, the military is often labeling their dead as 'MIA', rather than 'KIA', to avoid paying benefits. While the junta fumbles, the degree of tactical battlefield coordination between the legacy ethnic armies and the new PDFs is unprecedented. Every major offensive outside of Rakhine, entails cooperation between them, and even there, the AA was assisted by Chin PDFs who blocked the military’s resupply from Magway. The increased PDF operations have been made possible by increased assistance from EROs. The AA and Chin PDFs are pushing in from the west and assisting local PDFs in the Bamar heartland. The AA’s foray into Ayeyarwaddy was done in concert with local PDFs. The United Wa State Army appears to be defying China by arming and equipping the Mandalay PDF and others that are operating in Mandalay, Magway, and Sagaing. In its favor, the military has finally caught up to the opposition and effectively employed unmanned aerial systems down to the tactical level. These include drones that can drop munitions, kamikaze drones, and those for intelligence gathering or for more accurate targeting of artillery. This has proven costly for the opposition and impeded some of their offensives. Nonetheless, their deployment of drones has been too little too late, and will not fundamentally alter the battlefield dynamics. The military continues to use air power. Indeed, they put their fifth and sixth SU-30 imported from Russia and three more FTC-2000Gs imported from China into service in December. It’s the economy But air power is primarily used as a punitive weapon against unarmed civilian targets, not in support of ground forces. For example, the Jan. 9 bombing in Rakhine’s Yanbye township that killed 52, wounded over 40 and destroyed 500 homes, had no military utility. Finally, the state of the economy is even more precarious given the loss of almost all border crossings. Although the SAC technically still controls Muse and Myawaddy, which links them to China and Thailand, respectively, opposition forces control much of the surrounding territory. While Karen forces have not made a bid to take Myawaddy, the main border crossing, they are pinching in along Asia Highway 1 to Yangon. On Jan. 11, some 500 reinforcements in 30 armored personnel carriers were deployed from Hpa-An to Kawkareik in Kayan state near the Thai border to keep the last main overland trade artery open. To sum it up, the junta is entering the fifth year of military rule with its power rapidly slipping away. Although they still control one-third of the country – land that holds two-thirds of the population – their mismanagement of the economy has left the military regime broke. Spread too thin across too many fronts simultaneously, it’s hard to see the SAC doing anything to arrest their terminal decline in 2025.

Argentina: Democracy In A Bain-Marie – OpEd	By Matías Bianchi and María Esperanza Casullo It has been one year since Javier Milei took office in Argentina. As he warned during his campaign, his administration has been plagued by authoritarian practices, verbal and institutional violence, and policies that openly curtail citizens’ rights. Argentina currently possesses significant democratic capital. We must now ask how long this capital will last in resisting the libertarian wave. During the 2023 election campaign, the Argentinian think tank Asuntos del Sur published a study assessing the levels of authoritarianism among presidential candidates. The analysis was grounded in the theoretical framework developed by Steven Levitsky and Daniel Ziblatt in their book How Democracies Die, which explores a disturbing paradox: nowadays, democracies are eroded not ‘from the outside,’ but rather, from within, by democratically elected leaderships. In Asuntos del Sur’s study, Milei’s candidacy sounded alarm bells across every dimension put forward by the authors. In its 2024 issue, Asuntos del Sur picked up the research by assessing what had happened in the first year of government. If there is one thing that Javier Milei cannot be accused of, it is failing to keep his promises. The study, Democratic Alert: Critical Markers of Authoritarian Risk in Javier Milei’s First Year in Office, analyzed the president’s speeches, social media images, and policies. What it found is a vision of Argentine and global politics as a Manichean and moralizing conflict, without nuance, between a figure with messianic characteristics and a series of supposedly immoral and evil adversaries. Milei characterizes entire social sectors as communists, socialists, collectivists, criminals, parasites, or indoctrinators of youth. This Manichean antagonism is central to the denial of the legitimacy of his political opponents, one of the criteria for authoritarian risk identified by Levitsky and Ziblatt. This worldview is directly reflected by his governance. His anti-political and anti-statist discourse is the basis for a very real war against the state: not to improve processes or achieve greater efficiency, but rather, to shrink the state, because everything public is bad. Yet, it is not a matter of shrinking the whole state: some areas, such as internal policing, were strengthened. The goal is to reduce as much as possible—if not eliminate—all areas of the state that provide rights protections outside of the market: protection against illness, old age, gender violence, and poverty. A risk we must monitor closely is whether these violent discourses and policies translate into unplanned social violence by his supporters against those targeted as enemies: scientists, educators, the LGBTQ+ community, and people stigmatized as poor or racialized. We have already seen attacks on lesbians and CONICET teams (the National Scientific and Technical Research Council. These are isolated cases, but it is a new and worrying phenomenon in a political culture that has been peaceful since 1983. The erosion of political practices is real. Nevertheless, no changes or suspensions of constitutional rules have been proposed, nor has the functioning of Congress been altered. However, the recurrent use of Necessity and Urgency Decree should be noted. The risks, for now, are moderate. The reality is that democracy still holds. Milei is a leader elected by popular vote and with ongoing legitimacy. Congress functions, and the president skillfully uses political tactics to advance his agenda by negotiating with governors and opposition party leaders. The judiciary, even with its problematic biases, is behaving no differently from other presidential terms. In other words, we are not talking about a dictatorship, nor an authoritarian regime. Still, the alarms identified previously are worrying because they are slowly diminishing the democratic capital Argentina has worked so hard to build, bathing it in a bain-marie. The degradation of peaceful political discussion, the growing questioning of rights across different sectors of society, the intolerance of dissidence and social protest, and the undermining of the rights acquired by citizens are eroding our society’s democratic contract. Let us not be like the frog in the boiling pot, who recognizes the danger only when it is too late to escape. We know from Levitsky and Ziblatt that governments wanting to advance against democracy depend on the inaction of political parties, the judiciary, and thought leaders, to succeed. Now is the time to return to building coalitions of democratic forces, to endorsing pacts of respect for public debate, dissent, and the principles of citizens’ rights. We must remember that while delegitimization and discursive violence may seem bearable as long as they target others if left unchecked, they inevitably end up forming a tide that covers everyone. Perhaps in this, we will be able to regain ground in the cultural battle for the reconstruction of a social contract that promotes the recovery and expansion of democracy.

The Mercosur-EU Agreement As A Model For Open Decarbonisation – A...	By Gonzalo Escribano Pending its ratification and implementation, the closing of the Mercosur-EU trade agreement offers great economic opportunities. Its potential extends to the energy sphere, including the opening up of the raw materials’ markets, necessary for energy transition, and biofuels. The EU-Mercosur agreement can also yield greater bi-regional integration of renewable energies and decarbonised industrial value chains. The agreement incorporates strict socio-environmental sustainability criteria and considers the Paris Agreement an essential element. At the same time, the Mercosur countries obtain a rebalancing mechanism that protects them from measures such as the EU’s Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM). In addition, the EU will support Argentina, Brazil, Uruguay and Paraguay’s green and digital transitions with €1.8 billion via the Global Gateway. Overall, the agreement provides an open competitive decarbonisation model that tends to balance the climate, energy and industrial values and interests of the parties. Starting with raw materials, the Mercosur countries have significant transition-mineral resources. Brazil and Argentina are already key EU suppliers of lithium, copper, platinum, nickel, manganese and other materials, and can help the EU diversify away from the Chinese and Russian critical mineral imports. According to the European Commission, the agreement with Mercosur will help ensure an ‘efficient, safe and sustainable’ flow of transition minerals by reducing or eliminating export taxes, restrictions and monopolies. Specifically, there will be no taxes on Brazilian exports to the EU of nickel, copper, aluminium, steel, germanium and gallium. Were Brazil to decide to impose them, exports to the EU should benefit from a minimum 50% tariff preference. Argentina will not apply taxes to its raw materials’ exports in exchange for additional export allowances for certain agricultural products. Regarding the access of Mercosur biofuels to the European market, previous negotiations contemplated a total ethanol import quota of 650,000 tonnes: 450,000 tonnes tariff-free for use in the chemical industry; and a tariff quota of 200,000 tonnes for other uses, basically fuels, subject to a reduced tariff (one third of that of the most favoured nation-MFN). It is not clear whether these quotas and tariffs will change in the new agreement but, if they remain in place, their impacts would be limited and gradual. Key products are expected to remain subject to tariff quotas with elimination periods of up to 15 years. Brazil would have the largest participation in the assigned quotas, and Argentina and Paraguay would have smaller quotas. Overall, the degree of liberalisation is relatively modest and slow, which has not prevented opposition from the European sector and environmental groups. From an energy perspective, perhaps the greatest strategic opportunity of the agreement lies in facilitating the bi-regional integration of the industrial sectors involved in the energy transition. This element is important because the resistance of Member States such as France not only refers to the agricultural sector, but also to the competitiveness of the industrial sector given Mercosur’s comparative advantages in the decarbonisation process. Uruguay and Paraguay both have an almost fully renewable electricity mix, while more than 80% of the Brazilian electricity mix is decarbonised; Argentina is further behind, with a third of its electricity generation decarbonised, but it has great wind and solar potential. The greatest bi-regional strategic energy opportunities lie in taking advantage of these comparative advantages to improve the sustainable competitiveness of decarbonised industries across the Mercosur and the EU. Along with nearshoring and friendshoring, powershoring has been advocated for Latin America: an industrial relocation process towards countries in the region endowed with abundant and cheap renewable energy. Greenshoring goes a step further to an open competitive decarbonisation pathway adding other key elements for socio-environmental sustainability and the fight against climate change to the cost and decarbonisation criteria: advanced policies, dedicated institutions and high standards. The CBAM would be its practical embodiment by the EU, since it penalises the carbon footprint of imports. Greenshoring has been proposed as a script for Spanish and EU foreign action, especially applicable to Mercosur since its members are present in many decarbonised industrial chains, have a diversified portfolio of all renewable energies, and some of them tend to converge with the EU’s climate and sustainability preferences. The combination of mineral and renewable resources offers the Mercosur countries opportunities for socially and environmentally sustainable decarbonisation in green mining and refining, green fertilisers and green steel, among other energy-intensive sectors that can replace fossil sources with renewables. Much of the renewable deployment in Mercosur has been carried out by European companies, which have contributed to developing local renewable industries to a greater extent than their Chinese or US competitors. The agreement guarantees tariff preferences for renewable technologies that will help developers boost their penetration, especially considering the currently high level of Mercosur tariffs on equipment (20%) and intermediate goods (18%), and the modest pace of tariff reductions achieved. For instance, the agreement includes faster reductions in Mercosur high tariffs on automobiles (35%) for electric and hybrid vehicles, with an immediate reduction of the tariff to 25% upon its entry into force. It will also simplify import and export processes and is expected to attract new European investments into its energy sector and the modernisation of the industrial sector. All these liberalising measures will favour renewable deployment and climate change mitigation, but also building safer, more resilient, competitive and sustainable value chains. These integration patterns are more promising than the mere export of critical raw materials or uncertain exports of green hydrogen to the EU. For the latter, even if exports of green ammonia (produced from renewable hydrogen) are more realistic, it seems preferable to use these local renewable resources in the decarbonisation of Mercosur’s own fertiliser industry. Its members are agricultural powers greatly affected by the crisis of fertilisers caused by the war in Ukraine. These powers want to develop their own industry to gain strategic autonomy and food security and this should promote a more symmetrical economic and industrial integration pattern regarding value added, and thus better connected with the economic, social and human development needs of the Mercosur countries. The same argument can be applied to the decarbonisation of mining and processing, to transport (including maritime and aviation), to the replacement of hydrogen with CO2 emissions by green hydrogen in the refining and steel sectors, and to the electric vehicle value chain. The agreement incorporates robust sustainability criteria, with chapters and annexes devoted to Trade and Sustainable Development and respect for the Paris Agreement. One of the new texts is titled ‘the Paris Agreement as an essential element’, and not by chance. The new climate text states that parties to the EU-Mercosur Agreement shall remain a Party to the Paris Agreement ‘in good faith’ and fulfil their obligations under the climate accord. Another novelty allows the trade agreement to be suspended, partially or totally, if one of the parties determines that another party has violated essential obligations for the Paris Agreement. This could limit Argentina’s appetite for withdrawing from the climate accord, even after pulling its negotiating team from COP29 and ahead of COP30 in Brazil. On the part of Mercosur there were two previous concerns: the application of the CBAM; and the European regulations against imported deforestation (EUDR), which allow the restriction of imports of products grown on deforested lands. Both are part of what critics of these measures describe as new green protectionism. Precisely another of the biggest novelties of the agreement is a ‘rebalancing mechanism’ that allows compensation if one of the parties determines that new measures nullify or harm the benefits of the agreement itself. Although it is not clear how this mechanism could be used against the CBAM or the EUDR, its inclusion has been considered a victory for Mercosur. From an energy and climate perspective, the new agreement is quite balanced and comprehensive, satisfying the minimum strategic needs of the parties on almost all key issues. The EU improves its access to transition minerals and Mercosur to the European biofuel market. Mercosur achieves a rebalancing mechanism to prevent or alleviate the potential negative impacts of CBAM and EUDR, and the EU introduces the Paris Agreement as an essential element of the agreement. Perhaps more importantly, it favours a new pattern of bi-regional commercial and energy interdependence that incorporates socio-environmental sustainability criteria and fighting climate change. Based on these values, Mercosur and the EU enjoy clear complementarities to gain shared competitiveness through the integration of their decarbonised and renewable energies’ industrial chains. Were the agreement to be ratified it could provide an open and sustainable competitiveness model for future negotiations with other trading partners.

Iran: Senior Judges Linked To Mass Executions And Human Rights Ab...	Two senior judges infamous for their roles in Iran’s history of systemic human rights abuses, Ali Razini and Mohammad Moghiseh, were killed in their offices in Tehran early Saturday morning. According to official reports, an infiltrator within the judiciary carried out the attack, fatally shooting the judges before taking his own life as security forces closed in. The deaths of Razini and Moghiseh have sparked renewed scrutiny of their controversial legacies. Both judges were prominent figures in Iran’s judiciary and notorious for their involvement in the mass execution of political prisoners during the 1988 massacre. The massacre, which claimed the lives of over 30,000 political prisoners, remains one of the most harrowing episodes in Iran’s modern history. Ali Razini, head of Branch 41 of the Supreme Court, was widely recognized as one of the key enforcers of the Iranian regime’s brutal campaign against dissent. As a member of the 'Death Committees,' Razini played a direct role in sentencing thousands of political prisoners to execution based on their political affiliations. The Death Committees were assembled under the orders of regime supreme leader Ruhollah Khomeini in 1988 and were tasked with purging Iran’s prisons of all dissidents, especially those with ties to the People’s Mujahedin Organization of Iran (PMOI). The trials of the prisoners lasted no more than a few minutes and they were immediately sent to their deaths if they did not denounce their support for the PMOI. In a 2016 interview, Razini unapologetically defended his actions, admitting to personally interrogating prisoners and ensuring their execution or prolonged imprisonment. His notorious rulings included sentencing dozens of university students to death in Bojnourd, a decision he claimed was intended to instill fear and crush opposition. Mohammad Moghiseh, known by his alias 'Naserian,' presided over numerous politically motivated trials, frequently issuing death sentences and overseeing torture. As a member of the Death Committee at Gohardasht Prison during the 1988 massacre, Moghiseh expedited the execution of countless prisoners, including those with disabilities. Moghiseh’s record extends beyond the 1988 massacre. In 2019, he sentenced Abdullah Ghasempour to death and imprisoned three of his relatives for alleged ties to opposition groups. Survivors recount harrowing instances of Moghiseh mocking prisoners before their executions and facilitating the torture of detainees. The legacies of Razini and Moghiseh have drawn widespread international condemnation over the years. Human rights organizations have long called for accountability for their involvement in atrocities, labeling their actions as crimes against humanity. Both men were sanctioned by the European Union, the United Kingdom, and the United States for their roles in the 1988 massacre and other human rights abuses.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWc_Uzhx5yRGuFHkdhQaoqJq	2025-01-18T16:21:21-08:00	
Trump Bends The Arc Of History In West Asia (Part I) – OpEd	My one-week visit to Tehran to observe the presidential election last June came as an eye-opener. I could sense beyond doubt that Iran was on the cusp of profound changes. The country, which I had known professionally for decades ever since the Islamic Revolution in 1979, was heaving with high expectations of a radical change of course. The surest sign of it was the tacit encouragement from Supreme Leader Ayatollah Khamenei for the reformist candidacy of Masoud Pezeshkian. One of the colossal failures of the Western policy toward Iran has been all along its stereo-typed notions about Iran which is most evident in the reluctance to appreciate Khamenei’s role. Khamenei realises that the country is crying out for change. The point is, Iran is on the one hand all but in the league of big powers in its indigenously developed military technology testifying to its mastery in technology, research and innovation and industrial scale production capability but with an economy, on the other hand, in dire straits and ordinary people facing steady decline in their purchasing power and quality of life. Khamenei deduced that time has come for a peaceful orderly transition within the Islamic system, which required national unity. In Pezeshkian, Khamenei saw a politician with an unblemished record of probity in public life and of strong convictions. Hailing from an Azeri-Kurdish family, Pezeshkian’s understanding of the alchemy that is needed in governance to create unity in diversity in a plural society like Iran is unrivalled. Above all, he is a deeply religious man, a teacher of the Quran, and a reciter of the Nahj al-balagha, a key text for Shia Muslims, who is committed to the Islamic system of Velayat-e faqih, based on the principle of guardianship of Islamic jurists. Khamenei saw in him a rare politician who can bridge the political divide between the reformist and conservative factions and therefore as the best hope for energising the Islamic system and renewing its support base. (See my column titled Reading tea leaves in Iran’s election, Deccan Herald, June 26, 2024) Late night chat shows on television are hugely popular in Iran and particularly so through an animated election campaign, as they brought out the plurality of political opinion surfacing — to which I was invited to participate every day. The main streams of thinking in front runner Pezeshkian’s electoral platform could be summarised as follows: The topmost priority is to improve the economy, which is best achieved through the lifting of western sanctions. A prerequisite in such a direction requires the resolution of the nuclear issue through negotiations with the US, which is feasible now that Iran is a 'threshold nuclear power' with a formidable missile capability that already acts as deterrent against foreign aggression. Ensuing from the above, Iran needs to engage with the West by recalibrating the foreign policy directions and national strategy to enhance mutual confidence. A Donald Trump presidency would be the 'X' factor but, nonetheless, his priorities could be different this time around, and at any rate Iran should be open to negotiations with the US. The nation desires social reforms and controversies such as mandatory hijab are best avoided, since they created tensions and divides in society that opened the door to foreign interference, through tolerance and patience in the fulness of time while intrusive state control to impose social norms is unwise. Economic revival requires switch to market economy and for fostering trade and encouraging foreign investment, an overall opening up is needed in such areas as the Internet, visa system, etc. Late president Ebrahim Raisi’s accent on the Persian Gulf countries being Iran’s First Circle in foreign policies was a fundamentally forward-looking move and needs to be followed through — in particular, the criticality of consolidating the impetus from the rapprochement with Saudi Arabia that also happens to be in sync with the historic shift in the Saudi regional strategies encapsulated in the so-called Vision 2030 anchored on a thriving economy, turning its back on using extremist jihadi groups as geopolitical tool in West Asia and undertaking social reforms of a historic nature to modernise the Kingdom. The last point is hugely important in the present context, as Tehran is committed to the rapprochement with Saudi Arabia which was brokered by China. It has not only reduced the bilateral tensions and erased the conflict of interests, the latest examples being Tehran’s acquiescence with the changes in the power structure in Syria and Lebanon where a palpable Sunni ascendancy is under way — but also encourages Saudis to diversify foreign policies and step out of the US orbit. In strategic terms, Iran is gaining insofar as the locus of Saudi regional policies has shifted and decades-old US-Israeli strategy to isolate Tehran is no longer working. The Persian Gulf states have sought to reassure Iran of their neutrality in any conflict with Israel. Again, Iran’s normalisation with Egypt testifies to its growing acceptability as a regional partner by major Sunni states. (here and here) The regional amity in the Persian Gulf and the growing difficulty to rally the Sunni Arab states against Iran has no doubt unnerved the Biden Administration and Netanyahu. On January 2, Axios broke the sensational story that the outgoing White House National Security advisor Jake Sullivan recently presented President Joe Biden at a secret meeting with options for potential American strikes on Iranian nuclear sites before the inauguration of Donald Trump later this month. The Axios cited sources admitting that 'the meeting was not sparked by new intelligence' and Biden was yet to make a 'final decision'. Axios’ source called the meeting as part of 'prudent scenario planning.' That is to say, there was no intelligence input or emergent situation to justify an attack on Iran and Biden was testing the waters — as he often did on such crucial issues after green lighting the policy shift, such as, for example, giving Ukraine F-16 fighter jets or ATACMS missiles or approval for hitting Russian territory. In this case, there is no daylight between Biden and his team which is packed with arch neocons — especially, Sullivan and Secretary of State Antony Blinken, the two super hawks responsible for giving full-throttle American support to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in the pursuit of his horrific West Asian war stretching from Gaza, Lebanon, Syria to Yemen. Netanyahu has been dreaming for a very long time about an attack on Iran to destroy that country’s rise as a regional power, but that remains a pipe dream without direct US involvement. It is entirely conceivable that Sullivan who eats out of Netanyahu’s hands acted on the latter’s behest and Biden was likely aware of that. At any rate, in another follow-up report on January 6, Axios revisited the topic to hype up that a military option against Iran has become 'a real possibility'. Curiously, the report claimed that after a meeting with Trump in November, Israeli Minister of Strategic Affairs Ron Dermer, a close confidante of Netanyahu, the latter 'came away thinking there was a high likelihood Trump would either support an Israeli military strike against Iran’s nuclear facilities — something the Israelis are seriously considering — or even order a US strike.' Israelis are great hustlers and such an attribution to Trump was factually unwarranted, given his known aversion to wars. Plainly put, it was a white lie and crude 'psywar' aimed at creating misconceptions. In fact, Axios noted as a corrective in its report that there is a 'flip side', as 'others close to Trump expect that he’ll seek a deal before considering a strike' (against Iran).

Not Our Democracy, But Our Constitution – OpEd	American democracy, we are told, is threatened by Donald Trump’s victory. A headline from Vox.com, for example, averred, 'Donald Trump has won—and American democracy is now in grave danger.' Common Cause lamented that a second term for Trump is a 'threat to the core principles of our democracy.' A quick internet search reveals dozens of similar statements. These mourners seldom recognize that the United States is not a democracy but a constitutional republic. By 'our democracy' they likely mean our omnipotent Administrative State—the rule of experts in the federal bureaucracy. And the Administrative State (a/k/a the Deep State) is a target of the incoming presidential administration. Anti-Trumpers don’t fret about 'our Constitution' because they would rather not call attention to the republic’s governing document. If they did, the people might actually read it and see that democracy is not in peril—constitutional government is. Our elites—both Right and Left—have treated the Constitution as a list of suggestions rather than fundamental law. The Administrative State is a perfect example. The Constitution does not provide for this fourth branch of government. Yet most rules that govern our lives are crafted by bureaucrats in the alphabet-soup federal agencies such as the EPA, SEC, and FTC. Moreover, these agencies exercise quasi-legislative, quasi-executive, and quasi-judicial power all under one roof. The agencies promulgate laws, send officials out to enforce them, and deal with challenges to the enforcement in front of agency hearing officers or administrative law judges. In Federalist No. 47 James Madison averred that the accretion of powers 'in the same hands, whether of one, a few, or many, and whether hereditary, self-appointed, or elective, may justly be pronounced the very definition of tyranny.' The Administrative State is just part of the story of the constitutional tragedy. Let’s consider the president’s powers. Just a few days ago President Biden ordered air strikes on more than 75 locations in Syria. Under the Constitution, Congress is the branch authorized to declare war, raise armies, and call out troops to repel invasions. While the president is commander-in-chief of the armed forces, this title simply establishes civilian leadership over the military. It is not a license to assume Congress’s powers and drag the United States into a war. Congress has its own problems with the Constitution, which provides an enumeration of congressional powers in Article I, Section 8. James Madison described in Federalist No. 45 the listed powers as 'few and defined,' whereas those left to the states were 'numerous and indefinite.' Congress ignores constitutional limits through untenably broad interpretations. For example, it has the power to regulate commerce, which the Framers understood as trade or traffic in goods. The purpose of this power was twofold: (1) retaliation if European trading partners restricted American exports, and (2) the creation of a free-trade zone among the 13 states. Today Congress uses its commerce power to regulate anything, in the aggregate, that it believes could affect the national economy. Using such reasoning Congress has enacted a general federal criminal code even though the Constitution limits its criminal jurisdiction to counterfeiting, piracy, and a few other areas. Under the substantial effects doctrine, it tells farmers how much wheat they can grow, regulates labor relations, and polices the environment. Congress knows few bounds to its powers. The Supreme Court is also outside its constitutional bounds. The Framers created the Court as a coequal branch with the power to review the acts of the other branches as part of a case or controversy. Today the Court claims superiority and insists that it has the final say on what the Constitution means. While it surely must interpret the Constitution in performing its work, judicial supremacy elevates judges to the status of Platonic Guardians. A republic cannot endure with such power in the hands of unelected and unaccountable officials. The crowd caterwauling about the dangers to 'our democracy' (whatever that is) should be lamenting the state of our Constitution. Republicans and Democrats in Washington, D.C., have ignored basic constitutional limits on the federal government. Americans should be concerned, but not because Donald Trump poses some threat. They should be concerned because our two parties have rendered the Constitution a two-bit player in our governmental drama.

Don’t Put Coal On Ice – OpEd	Let’s say it plainly: The United States needs its fleet of coal-fired power plants. Consider, for starters, the rising demands for electricity driven by the expansion of data centers, electrification, and industrial growth. A year ago, public utilities and grid operators nearly doubled their forecasts of the additional electricity needed to power the U.S. economy over the next five years. That unanticipated increase threatens to overwhelm the nation’s already strained power supplies. The elephant in the room is the remarkable growth of artificial intelligence and the data centers needed to support it. The newest and largest data centers, such as the Quantum Loophole project in Frederick County, Maryland; the Citadel in Reno, Nevada; the Bumblehive project south of Salt Lake City; and the Microsoft Data Center in West Des Moines, Iowa, are so massive that their power demands are equivalent to those of a city the size of Seattle. Dozens of such facilities are under construction or on the drawing board. Despite the rapidly increasing demand for power, many regions of the country are losing existing power-generating capacity faster than it can be replaced. The troubling situation can be attributed to state-level energy mandates and a barrage of Environmental Protection Agency regulations issued during the Biden administration to force the decommissioning of coal-fired power plants and make it nearly impossible to construct new natural gas plants to take their place. The Biden administration miscalculated colossally, believing it could offset its regulatory blitzkrieg with a massive, subsidy-driven expansion of wind and solar power, along with the transmission infrastructure needed to move such 'renewable' energy around the country. What we got instead were renewable energy mandates and only a fraction of the promised new transmission capacity. In short, an electricity crisis. Just how poorly has President Joe Biden’s green dream played out? Consider high-voltage transmission, which renewable energy proponents claim is the key to unlocking a wind- and solar-powered future. Nationally, we’re supposed to build thousands of miles of high-voltage transmission lines yearly to move solar and wind power from where it’s produced, mostly offshore and on wind and solar 'farms' in the middle of nowhere, to urban and industrial centers where it’s needed. In 2023, just 55 miles of new high-voltage lines were completed, and that number improved only slightly last year. Building and connecting new renewable projects to regional grids is not progressing any faster. The situation facing the Midcontinent System Operator, which runs the grid for much of the Midwest, illustrates that point. Dealing with numerous financial, supply chain, and permitting challenges, renewable projects that were expected to come online simply are not doing so. In February 2024, the MISO warned that if its member utilities do not postpone plans to retire coal power plants or expedite the addition of more generation resources, a possible 2.7-gigawatt shortfall in the 2025 power supply could balloon to 14 gigawatts by 2029, enough to power 10 million homes. The MISO isn’t the only grid operator that sees a troubling imbalance between the power we need and what will be available. The North American Electricity Regulatory Corporation, which oversees the nation’s power supply, already is warning of possible blackouts affecting most of the country within the next decade. Many regions could face them even sooner. Objectively, avoiding an energy Armageddon shouldn’t be hard. But meeting the growing electricity demand requires using every tool at our disposal. On Day One in office, the Trump administration should put the wheels in motion to reverse Biden’s renewable energy mandates and return sanity to the nation’s energy policy. We need to build more coal, gas, and nuclear baseload power plants to meet soaring demand, and we should also work to ensure that today’s existing plants stay online as long as needed. The nation’s fleet of coal-fueled power plants is a vital asset that can help maintain grid reliability, address rising power demands, and guide us toward our energy future. Protecting it should be a top priority for the new administration.

‘Wokeism’ Fading As America Turns New Page – OpEd	By Dalia Al-Aqidi Social movements are strong drivers of change, occurring when people join together to fight unfair systems, call for equality and push for improvements. These movements often grow out of long-standing problems in society and play a significant role in shaping culture and politics. They are powerful expressions of collective action born from the desire to address challenges and they have the potential to drive profound cultural and political change. However, these movements can also spark controversy, division or consequences.While many movements are celebrated for their transformative impact, not all social movements are inherently positive. Some may advance divisive ideologies or fail to achieve their intended goals, highlighting the complexity of collective activism.The US has long been a cradle for such movements, serving as a focal point for both inspirational and contentious causes. Among the many movements that have emerged from the US, Black Lives Matter and Me Too illustrate this dual nature.The global impact of American social movements can be attributed to the US’ cultural dominance, technological influence and tradition of activism. Social movements from the US often gain international traction because the issues they address can also be applied to other Western societies.Sometimes, movements can polarize societies, misrepresent nuanced issues or even be co-opted for agendas that deviate from their original intent. Black Lives Matter, initially established to combat systemic racism and police brutality in the US, has not been without its controversies. While it brought crucial attention to issues of racial injustice, some factions within the movement have been criticized for promoting divisive rhetoric or exacerbating tensions during protests. Additionally, allegations of fraud and financial mismanagement among its leadership have raised questions about the movement’s transparency and accountability, leading to concerns about whether its actions align with its stated mission.'Wokeism' is a cultural and social movement that focuses on raising awareness about social injustices, especially those connected to race, gender and inequality. Over the past decade, particularly after the nationwide protests sparked by George Floyd’s death in 2020, ideas of diversity, equity and inclusion, known as DEI, have gained significant traction across America. These principles have become central to many progressive and far-left movements, often serving as tools for political and electoral gain. DEI advocates aimed to create fair and inclusive environments, not only in workplaces but also in educational institutions and public spaces. These policies encourage the active participation of people from diverse backgrounds, including genders, races, abilities, sexual orientations and other identity markers. Many organizations have adopted measures to bring DEI principles to life. These include bias awareness training, mentorship programs for underrepresented groups and transparent hiring or promotion practices designed to create equal opportunities.While these efforts have sparked progress, they have also generated debate about their effectiveness and whether they always achieve their intended outcomes. These policies have not stood the test of time in the US. Despite their rapid spread, the nation is now seeing a growing backlash, with many people questioning their effectiveness and questioning their impact on society.Since the Supreme Court’s landmark decision on affirmative action in 2023, which declared race-based admissions in colleges and universities unconstitutional, there has been a sharp increase in lawsuits challenging DEI programs. This ruling sent shockwaves across various sectors, prompting a broader reevaluation of such initiatives.Many DEI programs have failed because they prioritize identity over qualifications, often resulting in mismatched roles and underperformance. A striking critique came from Harvard itself, a prominent advocate of these policies. Last year, the Harvard Business Review published a revealing article stating that DEI training is largely ineffective. The article questioned the value of these programs, suggesting that they do little to create meaningful change or improve workplace dynamics. The inefficiency of DEI programs is costly, with US companies spending billions annually on initiatives that lack impact. This raises serious concerns about wasted resources and calls for a closer look at how these policies are implemented and their effectiveness.The decline of DEI initiatives and identity politics is becoming increasingly evident. Companies are stepping back from practices once seen as central to promoting diversity. Meta, for example, recently ended its fact-checking program, which had silenced conservative voices on its platforms for years. This move reflects a broader shift away from 'woke' policies, with a growing list of corporations scaling back such efforts.Over the past two years, large companies have responded to public and shareholder pressure by cutting back on DEI programs. This trend began in 2024 and gained momentum in the new year. As more organizations move away from these practices, the era of censorship and identity-based policies seems to be fading, giving rise to new approaches prioritizing merit and inclusivity without controversy.American 'wokeism' has reached a tipping point, fading both socially and politically. The once-dominant ideology has lost its grip, with even Democrats now pointing to their party’s 'woke' wing as a key factor in their political setbacks. The 2024 election, in which swing voters decisively chose Donald Trump over Kamala Harris, highlighted the growing rejection of identity politics and divisive narratives.This shift carries lessons for the rest of the Western world. Europe, in particular, should take note of the consequences of embracing similar ideologies, which risk alienating broad swaths of the electorate. As the US turns away from 'woke' policies, it paves the way for a renewed focus on unity, merit and commonsense solutions to shared challenges. The decline of 'wokeism' marks the dawn of a more balanced and inclusive future, offering hope for healthier political and social discourse. Dalia Al-Aqidi is executive director at the American Center for Counter Extremism.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWc_Uzhx5yRGuECse_68KKIy	2025-01-18T16:09:31-08:00	
Geopolitical Implications Of China-Sri Lanka Joint Communique – A...	The joint communique issued at the end of Sri Lankan President Anura Kumara Dissanayake's State Visit to China, will be read carefully in both New Delhi and Washington. The four-day State Visit of Sri Lankan President Anura Kumara Dissanayake to China from January 14 to 17 has resulted in a number of mutual commitments which could have significant geopolitical implications. These commitments were stated clearly in the joint communique issued after talks between President Dissanayake on the one hand, and President Xi Jinping, Premier Li Qiang and Zhao Leji, Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, on the other. Independent Foreign Policy The Chinese side reiterated that it would continue to firmly support Sri Lanka in 'safeguarding its national independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity, and respect and support Sri Lanka in independently choosing a development path suited to its national conditions.' On its part, Sri Lanka reiterated its commitment to follow 'an independent non-aligned foreign policy.' This is an important commitment on Sri Lanka's part in the context of China's persistent complaint that Sri Lanka tends to bow to pressure from regional power India to do this or avoid that vis-à-vis China. It should be noted here that the Dissanayake government had already said before coming to power that its decisions on foreign funded projects would be based on unbiased and rational grounds rather than on political and other grounds that might smack of mala fide dealings. China was aggrieved that a wind power project in North Sri Lanka, that was originally awarded to it was taken back and given to India. India had insisted that Chinese presence in that part of North Sri Lanka that is in close proximity to the South Indian shore, would be a national security threat to it. Likewise, when Chinese 'research' vessels docked in Sri Lankan ports, India objected saying that these were actually 'spy' vessels targeting India and Indian interests in the Western Indian Ocean. But China's case was that the research vessels had a tie up with Sri Lanka's National Aquatic Resources Research and Development Agency (NARA). It was also argued that no other country could infringe on another country's sovereign rights and deny access to a global common ground like the ocean. Caught in a cleft stick between two big powers, the earlier Sri Lankan government had imposed a one-year moratorium on visits by all foreign research vessels. That blanket moratorium ended in late 2024. But the Dissanayake government neither called off the moratorium nor extended it. The matter was raised by India in the December 2024 talks with the visiting Sri Lankan President Dissanayake. However, Disanayake managed to buy time with the plea that his government had to consider certain issues before taking a decision. Continuing Maritime Cooperation However, the Sino-Lankan joint communique of January 16 said that the two sides shared a desire to continue maritime cooperation 'on the basis of equality, mutual trust, openness and mutual benefit, and hold regular bilateral consultations on maritime affairs.' This could be taken as a hint of Chinese vessels being allowed entry again. Be than as it may, the communique laid a firm foundation for maritime cooperation. It said: 'The two sides are ready to deepen cooperation in such fields as conservation and restoration of the marine environment and ecosystems, maritime domain awareness, maritime rescue and disaster relief, and maritime personnel training and capacity building, and pool their strength to build a maritime community with a shared future. The two sides agreed to sign Memorandum of Understanding on Ocean Cooperation towards a Blue Partnership' Part of Belt and Road Initiative Given China's interest in pushing its global Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), Sri Lanka said that it 'appreciates the important role of Belt and Road cooperation in its economic and social development and the livelihood of its people.' The communique added that 'the two sides were pleased to sign a Belt and Road cooperation plan to upgrade China-Sri Lanka high-quality Belt and Road cooperation and jointly open up new space for win-win development of higher standard, stronger resilience and greater sustainability.' Elaborating, the communique said that the two sides agreed to advance all major signature projects including the Colombo Port City and Hambantota Port integrated development, as part of the BRI. With these declarations, Sri Lanka became a firm partner in China's BRI infrastructure-based global network. But the BRI is seen by India and its Western partners as creating 'debt traps' injurious to developing countries and also as an arm of China's expansionist geo-political agenda. New Delhi is therefore unlikely to see Dissanayake government's joining the BRI in a favourable light. Dissanayake had also reaffirmed Sri Lanka's commitment to supporting and actively participating in China's Global Development Initiative (GDI), the Global Security Initiative (GSI) and the Global Civilization Initiative (GCI). But these initiatives too are viewed with suspicion by China's rivals. In their eyes, these are but part of China's inter-continental power projection aimed at weakening the influence of its rivals. In the region and elsewhere. Financial Support Pledged The joint communique said that Sri Lanka expressed its 'high appreciation for the valuable support it has received from China in times of financial difficulties, including the vital assistance in restructuring China-related debts.' Sri Lanka has thus forgiven China for not rushing to its assistance with financial inputs when the country defaulted on repayment of loans amounting to billions of dollars. It was India which rescued Sri Lanka from the abyss at that time with a US$ 4.5 billion package. Of course, later, China did make amends by helping Sri Lanka in other ways such as helping it secure debt restructuring and get an IMF bailout package of US$ 2.9 billion. 'China will continue to play a positive role in the International Monetary Fund and maintain friendly communication with other creditors to help Sri Lanka ease its financial difficulties and achieve debt sustainability. The Central Bank of Sri Lanka and the People's Bank of China have renewed their currency swap agreement and will continue to carry out financial cooperation,' the communique noted. On its part, Sri Lanka hoped that China would soon implement the agreed debt restructuring plan together with Chinese financial institutions. Trade: Silence on FTA On trade China expressed its readiness to continue supporting Sri Lankan enterprises in the tea, gem and other industries in establishing ties with relevant Chinese associations of importers and exporters. On the ticklish issue of signing a Free Trade Agreement (FTA) the joint decision was to continue discussions. Sri Lanka has been reluctant to sign an FTA with China as China has been using FTAs to increase its exports and not enable the trading partner to sell more to China. However, China has promised to strive for an FTA package 'in line with the principles of equality, mutual benefit and win-win outcomes.' On its part, Sri Lanka expressed a wish to play host to 'more business investment from China' and promised to 'provide a conducive investment and business environment for this purpose.' And China said that it will 'continue to encourage Chinese enterprises in investing in Sri Lanka.' Aid to Key Sectors The two sides agreed to expand cooperation in such fields as logistics, green development, and digital economy to propel their high-quality and mutually beneficial practical cooperation. On agriculture where Sri Lanka is still lagging behind and importing essentials, China conveyed its readiness to carry out training and demonstration programs with Sri Lanka in areas including bio-technologies for tropical crops, plant breeding and cultivation, and aquaculture.' The idea is to help Sri Lanka to further expand its export of distinctive products to China, including tea, fruits, cinnamon, and aquatic products. The two sides shared the readiness to expand exchanges and cooperation with a sharper focus on poverty reduction and rural revitalization. China expressed its readiness to help Sri Lanka strengthen the capacity of personnel in related fields. Education and Skills Development The joint communique said that China would encourage more 'committed' students from Sri Lanka to pursue further studies in China, and was ready to continue to support them with government scholarships and set up vocational and technical training for Sri Lankans. China would promote Chinese language education in Sri Lanka and continue to develop the China-Sri Lanka Joint Centre for Education and Research under the Chinese Academy of Sciences, to strengthen scientific and technological exchanges and cooperation and education in the universities and research institutes of the two countries.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWc_Uzhx5yRGuAgkVw95P3bl	2025-01-18T16:07:15-08:00	
India Takes Yet Another Step Toward Sending Humans To The Moon – ...	By Devinder Kumar The Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO)—which has been working on key technologies to realise its vision of setting up a space station by 2035 and sending humans to the Moon by 2040—on January 16 morning successfully demonstrated space docking, or the joining of two fast-moving satellites in space. Two small 220-kg satellites were brought within a distance of three metres from each other in orbit, their extended ring was joined with each other, retracted, and locked in space. ISRO also demonstrated giving commands to the two satellites as one composite object. The successful docking makes India the fourth country in the world—after the United States, Russia, and China—to have this capability. This capability is necessary not only for carrying out missions that require heavy spacecraft that a single launch vehicle may not be capable of lifting off with, but also for carrying crew and supplies to it. United States NASA’s Gemini VIII became the first spacecraft in 1966 to dock with the target vehicle Agena. Gemini VIII was a crewed mission orbiting the Earth, commanded by Neil Armstrong, who in 1969 became the first human to set foot on the Moon. While the US mission had astronauts on board to steer the spacecraft, the Soviet Union in 1967 demonstrated the first uncrewed, automated docking of the Kosmos 186 and Kosmos 188 spacecraft. China demonstrated its docking capability in 2011, when the unmanned Shenzhou 8 spacecraft docked with the Tiangong 1 space laboratory. A year later, China demonstrated its first crewed space docking, when the astronauts manually joined its Shenzhou 9 spacecraft to the same space laboratory. India’s science minister Dr Jitendra Singh posted: 'Spadex has accomplished the unbelievable … and it is all (using the) indigenous Bharatiya Docking System. This paves the way for smooth conduct of ambitious future missions including the Bharatiya Antriksha Station, Chandrayaan 4 and Gaganyaan.' The first launch will have four of the five modules—the propulsion module will carry the spacecraft from Earth orbit to the Moon orbit, from where the lander and ascender modules will go to the lunar surface and collect the samples. The ascender module will then hop up with the samples, and dock with the transfer module in the lunar orbit. This transfer module will carry back the samples to the Earth orbit where it will dock with a re-entry module that will be launched separately. The module will be designed to withstand the heat of entering the Earth’s atmosphere. In preparation for this mission, ISRO carried out a 'hop experiment' towards the end of the Chandrayaan-3 mission. A human mission to the Moon is likely to follow a similar plan. Giving command to the satellites as a single composite object ISRO carried out a series of manoeuvres to progressively bring the SDX01 or 'Chaser' satellite close to SDX02, or the 'Target' satellite. The satellites were allowed to drift close, and then their positions were held at around 5 km, 1.5 km, 500 m, 225 m, 15 m, and 3 m, before finally being joined together. India’s space agency has demonstrated giving command to the satellites as a single composite object. In the coming days, it will demonstrate sharing of electrical power between the two satellites. Once that is complete, ISRO will demonstrate 'undocking', during which the satellites will separate and drift away to carry out their respective experiments over the two years of the mission’s life. The docking experiment was initially slated for January 7, but was postponed after identifying an abort scenario. More simulations were carried out on the ground to improve the accuracy of docking. The docking could not take place on January 9 either, with the satellites drifting more than anticipated during a manoeuvre to reduce the distance to 225 metres on the previous day. After this, the satellites drifted nearly 5 km apart, and manoeuvres to bring them closer were restarted. Early on January 12 morning, the satellites were brought closer together, and this time they reached the hold point of 3 metres before being moved away to a safe distance. ISRO said that the data were being analysed before the actual docking could be conducted. *This report is based on an article in the Indian Express, written by Anonna Dutt.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWc_Uzhx5yRGuAGw1tYKtDyr	2025-01-18T16:03:40-08:00	
Meet The Conservative German Trio That Could Rule Europe – Analys...	By Nick Alipour (EurActiv) -- For a glimpse of Europe’s future, look no further than the retreat of the centre-right European People’s Party (EPP) in Berlin. Friedrich Merz, Germany’s likely next chancellor, has assembled Europe’s conservative party family to marshal his troops for the upcoming battle. Nine national leaders, the European Commission president, and the head of the European Parliament's most powerful group – the EPP – have heeded the call. The stakes are high: If Merz's Christian Democrats (CDU/CSU) win the German election in February, his office success will depend on his ability to bend the EU to his will. Luckily, he has two compatriots and fellow party members by his side to control the EU’s trifecta of Commission, Parliament, and European Council in Brussels In the CDU's ideal scenario, Merz will call the shots as primus inter pares among leaders in the Council; Ursula von der Leyen (CDU) will bring what the party considers to be the Berlaymont's regulation fanatics into line; and Manfred Weber (CSU), the EPP’s parliamentary leader, will fix the majorities. But there is a lot that could go wrong. Merz is driven by fear that the far right could rise to power in Germany and Europe if the Christian Democratic trio fails to beef up the EU’s competitiveness and security by the end of its term in 2029. Unfortunately for Merz, progress will likely be slow and cooperation tedious, as conversations with 10 people familiar with the matter suggest. 'Merz, Weber, and von der Leyen are experienced enough to overcome differences in their personalities for the cause,' one source said. 'But they also represent the interests of three different institutions.' Just the three of us On one thing, everyone agrees: Merz, who started his political career as an MEP in the 1980s, is obsessively focused on the EU and coordination with allies such as France and Poland. 'We need someone like that as chancellor again,' one source said in a dig at Chancellor Olaf Scholz’s passive European performance. Gushy folk tales about Merz’s affection for Europe circulate within the CDU, especially about his Brussels trip in October. He is praised for navigating the European quarter without Google Maps, mastering the alphabet soup of EU abbreviations, and for diligent note-taking when interacting with EPP lawmakers.He has reason to care. Brussels is key to implementing much of his competitiveness and security agenda. This includes slashing the red tape paralysing German businesses, 60% of which is connected to the EU, and reducing migration. Merz wants to change EU asylum law and cooperate with first-line countries. While some in the business-friendly CDU see von der Leyen’s first-term Green Deal as the root of all regulatory evil, the Commission president, Merz, and Weber now, surprisingly, pull in the same direction on policy. The 'perma-smiling' president and the grimacing CDU chief 'first had to find a way of working together,' said one source. 'Unlike Angela Merkel and von der Leyen, who understood each other blindly as long-time companions,' they added. However, do not expect Merz and von der Leyen’s relationship to be as warm, as the source said it is difficult to replicate. But the three-way relationship, that includes Weber is now 'very trusting', a source familiar with Weber's thinking said. Accordingly, policy coordination frequently occurs at all levels between Berlin and Brussels. In Berlin, EPP leaders are supposed to sign off on the results with a joint paper that underlines their commitment to dismantling EU regulation. A Bermuda triangle? As is common in Brussels, Merz’s wishlist will likely get bogged down in the Bermuda triangle between the three major EU institutions, where legislation tends to lose its original shape. A source told Euractiv that the CDU/CSU’s ambitious European policies will not be easy to implement in Brussels, especially when it comes to cutting red tape and and putting pressure on the Commission. There are concerns in Berlin that not all of the Commission’s 32,000 employees have received the memo on competitiveness and deregulation, particularly within the regulatory-friendly DG Climate Action. Von der Leyen’s flagship omnibus legislation, due to slash businesses’ reporting obligations, is seen as insufficient. Von der Leyen must also accommodate the social democratic Commissioners, who are less keen on tougher migration policies and reversing green regulations. Other party families also complicate Weber’s mission to engineer parliamentary majorities, wielding influence through non-cooperation and powerful rapporteur positions. 'There is zero willingness from the Socialists and the Greens to reduce the [bureaucratic] burden,' one source said. Weber has thus turned to his right to build majorities in cooperation with 'pro-Ukraine, pro-rule-of-law, and pro-European' forces – and tacitly tolerated that those even further right vote alongside the EPP. That is not to everyone's liking, as Merz has become one of the most evangelical disciples of the cordon sanitaire. 'The CDU/CSU wants to make policy in the political centre,' one source said tersely. Clash à trois In the face of legislative limitations, some worry that Merz will take out the crowbar at first and address Brussels top-down. 'I would understand if the CDU were impatient and came to Brussels with the self-confidence that the EPP will follow its position,' one source said. Recent history offers a preview. Last year, after confirming his run for chancellor, Merz announced emphatically that he would travel to Brussels to 'meet the Commission president and propose several topics that we believe are important.' His priority? Das Auto. An EU plan to effectively ban the sale of new cars powered by combustion engines was 'wrong,' he said. Somewhat tellingly, von der Leyen was not waiting to hear Merz’s grand plans, travelling instead to the US and Switzerland. Merz is also prepared to draw on the EPP majority of 11 national leaders in the European Council to increase the pressure on other institutions, people familiar with his thinking say. In Berlin, he will be looking to close the ranks behind him. 'Merz, von der Leyen, and Weber agree 99.9% of the time,' one source said. With the far right snapping at their heels, that remaining 0.1% could make all the difference for Europe’s future.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWc_Uzhx5yRGuJqd8920Ww5m	2025-01-18T15:59:38-08:00	
Armenia, US Launch Nuclear Cooperation Talks	Armenia and the United States have officially announced the start of negotiations on the 123 nuclear cooperation agreement. This marks a key milestone in the bilateral relationship as the U.S. has approved Armenia's 2024 request to join the agreement. The timeline for signing the agreement depends on Armenia’s position and actions by the new U.S. administration. Former Deputy Minister of Energy Hakob Vardanyan noted that the agreement would enable U.S. nuclear companies to collaborate with Armenia in operating the existing plant, exploring other applications, or constructing new reactors. Without the agreement, U.S. entities are restricted from sharing nuclear technologies or expertise with non-signatory countries. Negotiations were announced during a briefing on the Armenia-U.S. Strategic Partnership Charter. Armenian Foreign Minister Ararat Mirzoyan emphasized the agreement would ensure peaceful use of nuclear energy, while U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken added it would open new avenues for collaboration in nuclear energy, science, and technology. Armenia is preparing to build a new nuclear plant, likely featuring small modular reactors, which are more efficient but subject to cost, fuel logistics, and other factors. Former Deputy Minister Vardanyan noted that realistic proposals have come from U.S., Russian, and South Korean companies, but detailed evaluation of U.S. technologies hinges on signing the 123 agreement. The Metsamor Nuclear Power Plant, after its latest upgrades, will operate until 2036. Armenia has allocated funds in its 2025 budget for the design, study, and evaluation of a new nuclear plant.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWc_Uzhx5yRGuPD1rvQEurDO	2025-01-18T15:57:52-08:00	
Brain Dance And That Southern California Rain Song – Essay	This morning, while driving to my regular lectures, the brain cells inside my head were running around, doing their usual Chinese ribbon dance with the dendrites, making connections, coloring perception, and then sending the signals to the part where perceptions are created. Next, they were making more connections, destroying Time and Space in the process, excavating memories and reconstructing remembrances of things past, and so on and so forth... an endless cybernetic process, as if my mind, brain, and consciousness were one huge cauldron of an LLM or language learning model that hallucinates. A song, as always, started to play. Yes, my brain is lyrical and compositional. Albert Hammond's 'It Never Rains in Southern California' began playing, and as the tune continued, none was erased... as the poet Omar Khayyam would say. Memories of my early dorm life started coming in, recalling when I was thirteen back in Kuantan, Pahang, in Malaysia. In between the words and music of this Albert Hammond piece, images flashed back and forth of the Los Angeles fires and how much has already been lost. Rich and famous, poor and unknown lost their homes. Theories abound how the fire started and perspectives were deployed to offer explanations - scientific, cultural, religious, conspiratorial, and commonsensical. My mind posed this theme of inquiry: from Hollywood comes Firewood. How might the industry of escapism from harsh realism—of creating movies to craft and invent realities and to drown the depressed in fantasies—end its existence? Hollywood, through the LA fires, is having its own apocalypse. This time it is real. More real than a reality TV show or starring-Jim Carrey-1998-Scifi Comedy The Truman Show. As real as what Armageddon looks like. Then I started thinking, as always, about truth, belief systems, the nature of religion, and why people continue to argue, fight, and even kill, or worse, engage in genocidal acts in the name of advancing this or that 'Truth' conceived as universalizing. But if Truth is Universal, as claimed, and each religion claims truth-ness in its advancement and colonization of the mind, what about this: what must Martians, if they exist, believe in? What will be the preferred religion of the Martians? How might the preachers, prophets, sages, and messengers of the 'Truth' reach them? What language will be used? Or what means of communication must the messenger use? I did not get any answers from the conversationalists in my brain, as I would expect them to come up with after this ride, letting them play and fight with ideas. No answers. Only the song fading away as I took the exit from highway I-80 ...	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWc_Uzhx5yRGuMw3SOG_ZyYT	2025-01-18T15:55:41-08:00	
Bitter Harvests: The Gaza Ceasefire – OpEd	Twinning the terms 'ceasefire' and 'Gaza' seems not only incongruous but an obscene joke. This is largely because the ceasefire announced on January 15 between Israel and Hamas could have been reached so much earlier by all the concerned parties. But will was lacking in Washington to force Israel’s hand, and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was repeatedly of the belief that Hamas had to be unconditionally defeated, if not extirpated altogether, for any such arrangements to be reached. A general outline of the ceasefire terms was released by Qatar, a vital broker in the talks between Hamas and Israel. According to its Ministry of Foreign Affairs release, there are to be three phases in the agreement. The first phase will involve the release of 33 Israeli detainees in exchange for a number of Palestinian prisoners held by Israel. The second and third phase 'will be finalized during the implementation of the first phase.' The first stage will last for six weeks and see, should things pan out, the withdrawal of Israeli troops from all populated areas of Gaza and the return of Palestinians to their neighbourhoods. (To say homes, in this regard, would be monstrously distasteful, seeing that many would have been flattened.) Humanitarian aid deliveries will also be increased and distributed 'on a large scale' through the Strip, while hospitals, health centres, and bakeries will be rehabilitated. Supplies of fuel for civilian use and shelter for displaced persons deprived of their homes will also be facilitated. The second stage envisages a conclusion to the war, a full withdrawal of Israeli soldiers from the Strip and the return of all remaining living hostages in return for another allotment of Palestinian prisoners. The third entails reconstructing Gaza and the return of any remaining bodies of the hostages. Despite his habitual impotence in the face of Netanyahu, US President Joe Biden saw the agreement as a masterstroke. Oddly enough, he insisted that the plan resembled almost to the letter a plan he had advanced in May 2024. 'I laid out the precise contours of this plan on May 31, 2024, after which it was endorsed unanimously by the UN Security Council.' He omitted to mention the US vetoing of no fewer than five ceasefire resolutions proposed at that same body, not to mention those foggy 'red lines' he insisted Netanyahu never cross when waging war against Hamas and the Palestinian populace. Such gestures as delaying the shipment of 2,000-pound bombs for fear that they might be used by the IDF in such areas as Rafah were purely symbolic in nature. As Netanyahu had no interest in being bound by any such lines of engagement, Biden’s national security advisor, Jake Sullivan, could only crankily remark to reporters that it was all a media obsession. 'The whole issue of the red line, as you define it, is something that you guys like; it’s almost become a bit of a national parlour game.' While Biden clawed and scraped for credit, it was incoming US President Donald Trump claiming the lion’s share. And why not? With his inauguration on January 20, the timing of the ceasefire, with Israel finally relenting, was no coincidence. 'This EPIC ceasefire agreement,' Trump stated in a roaring post on his Truth Social platform, 'could only have happened as result of our Historic Victory in November, as it signalled to the entire World that my Administration would seek Peace and negotiate deals to ensure the safety of all Americans, and our Allies.' While Biden and his officials fumed at this claim, it was clear that Trump had a sharp point. His incoming Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff has had a busy January interposing in the negotiation process, spending time in Doha as part of the discussions on the Israeli hostages, then meeting Netanyahu in a January 11 encounter that was reported to be 'tense'. According to the Times of Israel, Witkoff was most insistent that the Israeli PM accept essential compromises. Two nights after their meeting, the negotiating teams of both Israel and Hamas notified the mediators that they had accepted the deal on hostages in principle. In the view of two Arab officials cited in the paper, Trump’s envoy had done 'more to sway the premier in a single sit-down than outgoing President Joe Biden did all year'. Whoever claims credit for these latest developments hardly lessens the bitterness of the harvest. The prevarications, delays and obstructions have permitted massive destruction and loss of life to take place. Cowardice and bad faith have been the hallmarks of the process. It remains unclear how all the relevant parties will behave. Netanyahu will remain bitter that his goals of eliminating Hamas have not been achieved. It’s a point that his cabinet colleagues on the far right, Bezalel Smotrich and Itamar Ben-Gvir, are all too readily reminding him of. The question of who controls Gaza after the phases conclude remains a thick encumbrance. Then comes that big issue after Trump’s inauguration. How far will his involvement be constructive in achieving a lasting peace, or merely default to the exclusive security goals and interests of Israel? If history is a reliable guide on this point, the omens are not good.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWc_Uzhx5yRGuEYVi4BPQWGz	2025-01-18T15:53:29-08:00	
Robert Reich: The LA Fire And The Common Good – OpEd	Trump has spent much of the past week complaining — and lying — about California’s water policies, falsely claiming that Los Angeles doesn’t have enough water to deal with the fires. (The actual problem is that hydrants haven’t had enough water pressure to deal with the huge, sudden demand.) Trump is now blaming the fires on migrants. He posted a claim this week that taxpayer 'funds are diverted to illegal immigrants,' and then 'an illegal immigrant comes and sets your house on fire and the fire department doesn’t have the resources to put it out.' When he was on the campaign trail, Trump repeatedly threatened to withhold disaster aid from California. 'We’re going to take care of your water situation, and we’ll force it down his throat,' Trump said during a rally in Coachella, California, referring to California’s Democratic Governor Gavin Newsom. 'And we’ll say: Gavin, if you don’t do it, we’re not giving you any of that fire money that we send you all the time for all the fire, forest fires that you have.' Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson and other congressional Republicans sayfederal help for Los Angeles should have strings attached. They’re criticizing California’s 'liberal policies' and its management of water and natural resources. But conditioning federal aid on policy changes would mark a major change in how America responds to disasters. After all, recent hurricane funding for mostly GOP-led states passed Congress without any strings attached. Which raises a fundamental question about America — especially the one we are moving toward under Trump II: Are all of us in this together, or are we on our own? In September 1718, Boston organized the 'Boston Fire Society,' the nation’s first mutual aid firefighting organization. But it was an on-your-own system. It protected only its members — who pledged to fight fires at each other’s homes, rescue each other’s property, and guard each other against looting. By contrast, Philadelphia’s Union Fire Company, organized by Benjamin Franklin in 1736, was devoted to protecting the city as a whole. Its we’re-all-in-this-together model was replicated around America as cities and towns gained senses of civic responsibility. Public fire departments also proved cheaper, on the whole, than reliance on private firefighting associations that protected only their members. In Los Angeles this past week, some wealthy property owners harkened back to the on-your-own model by hiring their own private firefighters to protect their own estates and businesses. Private firefighting came sharply into public view in 2018, after it was reported that Kim Kardashian and Kanye West hired private firefighters to protect their Los Angeles mansion from the Woolsey Fire that year. Demand for private firefighters has grown across America as wildfires have increased in ferocity and frequency. About 45 percent of all firefighters working in the United States today are employed privately, according to the National Wildfire Suppression Association, which represents more than 300 private firefighting groups. The same fundamental question — are we all in this together or on our own? — is behind federal disaster relief. If lawmakers from Florida put conditions on federal disaster aid for California, why wouldn’t lawmakers from California reciprocate by putting conditions on federal aid to Florida after the next hurricane? And so on. In many ways, a nation is really a giant mutual-insurance system. We pool our resources for the common good — whether that be disaster relief or highways or public schools or national defense. We’re all in this together. But what happens if we lose our sense of common good? What happens if wealthy individuals not only hire their own firefighters, but reject public schools and send their kids to private ones, stop walking in public parks and opt for private green spaces, and stop relying on public police officers in favor of private security guards? That sounds a lot like the current trend. And what happens if America’s red and blue states decide they don’t want to come to each other’s aid? As it is, taxpayers in blue states now subsidize taxpayers in red states, but what if we don’t want to do this anymore? What if all of us begin to lose the understanding that we’re all in this together? Is that where Trump is taking us?

Before Donald Trump Became A Free Speech Hero Regarding TiKTok, H...	Luckily for free speech and free press in America, Donald Trump, who is set to be sworn in as president on Monday, seems determined to ensure that the many millions of American TikTok users will be able to continue posting and watching videos at the popular social media platform. Hooray for Trump taking this stand. But, previously, Trump was a free speech and free press villain in regard to TikTok. Indeed, if Trump had stood up for First Amendment rights from the beginning instead of taking action against TikTok, the whole United State government effort to ban the social media platform may have been avoided. The US Supreme Court’s Friday decision in TikTok v. Garland that upholds the US government effort to ban TikTok provides details on Trump’s early history of villainy and the course of action against TikTok that followed. The decision of the court stated: In August 2020, President Trump issued an Executive Order finding that 'the spread in the United States of mobile applications developed and owned by companies in [China] continues to threaten the national security, foreign policy, and economy of the United States.' Exec. Order No. 13942, 3 CFR 412 (2021). President Trump determined that TikTok raised particular concerns, noting that the platform 'automatically captures vast swaths of information from its users' and is susceptible to being used to further the interests of the Chinese Government. Ibid. The President invoked his authority under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA), 50 U. S. C. §1701 et seq., and the National Emergencies Act, 50 U. S. C. §1601 et seq., to prohibit certain 'transactions' involving ByteDance Ltd. or its subsidiaries, as identified by the Secretary of Commerce. 3 CFR 413. The Secretary published a list of prohibited transactions in September 2020. See 85 Fed. Reg. 60061 (2020). But federal courts enjoined the prohibitions before they took effect, finding that they exceeded the Executive Branch’s authority under IEEPA. See generally TikTok Inc. v. Trump, 507 F. Supp. 3d 92 (DC 2020); Marland v. Trump, 498 F. Supp. 3d 624 (ED Pa. 2020).Just days after issuing his initial Executive Order, President Trump ordered ByteDance Ltd. to divest all interests and rights in any property 'used to enable or support ByteDance’s operation of the TikTok application in the United States,' along with 'any data obtained or derived from' U. S. TikTok users. 85 Fed. Reg. 51297. ByteDance Ltd. and TikTok Inc. filed suit in the D. C. Circuit, challenging the constitutionality of the order. In February 2021, the D. C. Circuit placed the case in abeyance to permit the Biden administration to review the matter and to enable the parties to negotiate a non-divestiture remedy that would address the Government’s national security concerns. See Order in TikTok Inc. v. Committee on Foreign Investment, No. 20–1444 (CADC, Feb. 19, 2021). Throughout 2021 and 2022, ByteDance Ltd. negotiated with Executive Branch officials to develop a national security agreement that would resolve those concerns. Executive Branch officials ultimately determined, however, that ByteDance Ltd.’s proposed agreement did not adequately 'mitigate the risks posed to U. S. national security interests.' 2 App. 686. Negotiations stalled, and the parties never finalized an agreement.Against this backdrop, Congress enacted the Protecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act. Pub. L. 118–50, div. H, 138 Stat. 955. The Act makes it unlawful for any entity to provide certain services to 'distribute, maintain, or update' a 'foreign adversary controlled application' in the United States. §2(a)(1). Entities that violate this prohibition are subject to civil enforcement actions and hefty monetary penalties. See §§2(d)(1)(A), (d)(2)(B). In his first presidential term, Trump started the effort to shut down free speech and free press at TikTok. His executive orders set the course for the succeeding Joe Biden administration to act against TikTok and ultimately for a new law to be enacted that could accomplish banning TikTok and imposing harsh new controls over electronic communication more broadly. In his impending second presidential term, Trump should be able to quickly defend the ability of TikTok to operate and of Americans to use the social media platform, especially given that the outgoing Biden administration has announced it will not impose a ban in its last days. But, how much credit should we give someone for cleaning up a mess that he played a big role in creating? And what about the further threats to free speech from the Protecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act that arose from Trump’s stirring up trouble against TikTok? Will Trump lead a successful effort to repeal that law as well?

Beyond Money And Education: The New Class War In America – OpEd	In recent years, the United States has witnessed a profound transformation in its political landscape, challenging traditional notions of class and voting behavior. The 2024 presidential election, marked by Donald Trump's victory over Kamala Harris, underscored this shift, as money and education—once reliable predictors of voting patterns—no longer hold the same sway. A closer look at the evolving dynamics of American politics shows how issues like economic nationalism, social policies, demographic changes, and the role of religious groups are redefining the electoral map. The Traditional Paradigm: Socioeconomic Status and Voting Historically, socioeconomic status, including income and education level, was a strong indicator of political affiliation in the United States. Voters from lower-income backgrounds or without a college degree often leaned Democratic, while those with higher incomes and educational attainment tended to vote Republican. However, this paradigm has begun to erode, particularly over the past decade. The 2024 election highlighted a significant departure from this trend. Exit polls revealed that working-class voters, defined as those without a college degree, favored Trump over Harris by a margin of 56% to 42%. This outcome was not solely driven by economic factors but was influenced by a broader set of issues, including immigration and cultural identity. The Rise of Economic Nationalism One of the key factors contributing to this shift is the rise of economic nationalism. The 2024 campaign saw both parties grappling with issues of inflation and immigration, which resonated deeply with voters facing economic pressures. Trump's campaign capitalized on these concerns, framing his policies as a defense against perceived economic threats and cultural changes. This narrative appealed to a broad coalition of voters, including many who traditionally identified as Democrats. Economic nationalism has become a powerful force in American politics, transcending traditional class divisions. It speaks to a sense of economic insecurity and cultural dislocation felt by many Americans, regardless of their socioeconomic status. This sentiment is not unique to the U.S.; similar movements are evident in Europe and other parts of the world, reflecting a global trend towards more insular economic policies. Education: A New Divide While education was once seen as a pathway to economic mobility and a predictor of political leanings, it now serves as a more nuanced indicator. The divide between college-educated and non-college-educated voters has grown, with the former increasingly favoring Democratic candidates. However, this trend is not uniform across all demographics. Among white voters and men, the gap is particularly pronounced, with Trump leading significantly among non-college-educated groups. This educational divide reflects broader societal changes, including the perception that higher education institutions are bastions of liberal ideology. This perception has contributed to a political polarization where education level is seen as a marker of cultural identity rather than purely economic status. Demographic Shifts and Voting Patterns Demographic changes are also reshaping the electoral landscape. The youth vote, for instance, is characterized by remarkable diversity, with nearly 45% of eligible voters aged 18 to 27 identifying as people of color. Economic concerns, such as student debt and housing affordability, are paramount for young voters, influencing their political priorities. Despite these economic pressures, young voters remain a crucial demographic for Democrats, with Harris enjoying substantial support among this group. Among racial and ethnic minorities, voting patterns are complex and influenced by a range of factors beyond socioeconomic status. Black voters, for example, continued to support Democratic candidates overwhelmingly, regardless of educational background. Hispanic voters also showed a consistent preference for Democrats, though Trump made significant gains in this demographic compared to 2020. The Role of Religious Groups: Muslims in the 2024 Election The 2024 election marked a significant shift in the voting patterns of Muslim Americans, a demographic that has historically supported Democratic candidates. However, in 2024, Muslim voters split their support between Green Party candidate Jill Stein and Donald Trump, reflecting a growing dissatisfaction with the Democratic Party's stance on international issues, particularly the conflict in Gaza. The Muslim vote is significant not only because of its growing size—estimated at between 2.5 to 3.5 million voters—but also because many Muslim Americans reside in crucial swing states like Michigan and Pennsylvania. This concentration of voters in key battlegrounds gives Muslim Americans considerable influence over election outcomes. Impact of Muslim Voters on the Election The split in the Muslim vote had profound implications for the 2024 election. Trump's ability to secure support from some Muslim leaders and voters in Michigan, a critical swing state, contributed to his victory. The shift away from the Democratic Party reflects broader dissatisfaction with U.S. foreign policy and a desire for political alternatives that better address Muslim American concerns. This trend highlights the evolving role of religious groups in American politics. Muslim Americans, like other religious communities, are no longer bound by traditional party affiliations but are instead seeking candidates who align with their values and policy priorities. The Role of Other Religious Groups Beyond Muslim Americans, other religious groups continue to play a significant role in shaping American politics. Christian voters, particularly practicing Christians, remain a strong base for conservative political movements. The rise of Christian nationalism has further intensified the political engagement of this group, making them a crucial demographic in elections. Evangelical voters have historically supported Republican candidates, and this trend continued in 2024. However, there are signs of division within the evangelical community, with some groups challenging Trump's influence. Social Policies and Voting Decisions Social policies have become increasingly important in shaping voting decisions. Issues like abortion rights, immigration reform, and healthcare access are no longer secondary to economic concerns but are now central to political discourse. The overturning of Roe v. Wade, for instance, galvanized voters who prioritize reproductive rights, with many supporting Harris as a result. Working-class voters, often portrayed as conservative on social issues, hold nuanced views. They may oppose abortion personally but reject outright bans, favor secure borders but oppose immigration bans, and support government-guaranteed healthcare while being skeptical of welfare state expansion. This complexity challenges the simplistic categorization of voters based on socioeconomic status alone. Political Realignment The 2024 election marked a significant moment in a broader political realignment. Voting behavior is no longer driven primarily by class but by education and cultural identity. This shift reflects a deeper transformation in American society, where traditional markers of status and affiliation are being reevaluated. The realignment is also driven by generational changes. Younger voters, particularly those influenced by social media and online discourse, are increasingly polarized along educational and cultural lines. This trend is not unique to the U.S.; similar patterns are emerging in other developed democracies, where political divisions are becoming more pronounced along educational and generational fault lines. As the country navigates this new political terrain, understanding these shifts is crucial for political strategists and policymakers. The future of American politics will be shaped by how effectively parties can address the complex concerns of a diverse electorate, moving beyond simplistic categorizations based on socioeconomic status. In this context, the notion of a 'new class war' is not about traditional economic divisions but about the cultural and ideological fault lines that now define American politics.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWc_Uzhx5yRGuL2kt_BOm3bj	2025-01-18T15:45:33-08:00	
An Optimistic View Of Pre-Messianic Developments – OpEd	Human society changed more rapidly, violently and fundamentally in the last century of the second millennium than ever before in history. Doctors saved the lives of millions. Dictators sacrificed the lives of millions. Populations exploded and birthrates declined. Technology produced both worldwide prosperity and pollution at the same time. Knowing all this, should we look upon the first century of the third millennium with optimistic hope or with fatalistic trepidation? Are the world and our society heading towards a wonder-filled new age, or toward a doomsday; or are both occurring concurrently because breakdown is always a prelude to breakthrough? Many who believe in the Biblical vision of a Messianic Age use the insights of the Prophets of Israel to provide guidance in understanding the social, economic, scientific and cultural upheavals sweeping society. Usually it is the dramatic dangers of the pre-Messianic tribulation that are emphasized. I will focus on the positive signs developing throughout the world that accord with the Messianic vision of the Biblical Prophets. In most religious traditions, redemption is defined only in terms of individual enlightenment or personal salvation. However, the Biblical Prophets of Israel conceived redemption as a transformation of human society that would occur through the catalyst of the transformation of the Jewish community. This transformation, which will take place in this world at some future time, is called the Messianic Age. The transition to the Messianic Age is called the birth pangs of the Messiah. The birth of a redeemed Messianic world may be the result of an easy or difficult labor. If everyone would simply live according to the moral teachings of his or her religious tradition, we would ourselves bring about the Messianic Age. But, if we will not do it voluntarily, it will come through social and political upheavals, worldwide conflicts and generation gaps. The Messiah refers to an agent of God who helps bring about this transformation. The Jewish tradition teaches that this agent of God (and there may be two or three such agents) will be a human being, a descendant of King David, with great leadership qualities similar to Moses or Mohammed. The arrival of the Messianic Age is what's really important, not the personality of the agents who bring it about, since they are simply the instruments of God, who ultimately is the real Redeemer. The Messianic Age is usually seen as the solution to all of humanity's basic problems. This may be true in the long run but the vast changes the transition to the Messianic Age entails will provide challenges to society for many generations to come. For example, the Prophet Isaiah, 2700 years ago, predicted that someday there would be a radically new world in which Jerusalem would be fulfilled with joy for 'no more shall there be in it an infant that lives only a few days.' (65:20) Before the mid 19th century the annual death rate for humans fluctuated from year to year but always remained high, between 30 and over 50 deaths per 1,000 individuals. Those elevated, unstable rates were primarily caused by infectious and parasitic diseases. The toll from disease among the young was especially high. Almost 1/3 of the children born in any year died before their first birthday; in some subgroups, half died. Because childbirth was hazardous, mortality among pregnant women was also high. Even in our generation, high death rates for children was the norm in Africa, In Malawi, the mortality rate for children under 5 fell to 10% per 1,000 births in 2008, down from 22.5% in 1990 and 33.6% in 1970. A century ago, the infant mortality rate in Jerusalem (as in most of the world) was 25-30%. Now it is less than 1%. For thousands of years almost every family in the world suffered the loss of at least one or two infants; now it happens to less than one out of a hundred babies. If this radical improvement had occurred over a few years, it would have greatly impressed people. But since it occurred gradually over several generations, people take it for granted. Also, it seems to be part of human nature that most people focus on complaining about the less than 1% that still die (an individual family tragedy heightened by the fact that it is unexpected because it is so rare) rather than be grateful that the infant mortality rate has been reduced by over 95%. In another generation or two, populations will be declining throughout the world, but since that will occur in the future and since we are suffering the negative consequences of over population now, very few people see the whole transformation as a Messianic one in spite of the fact that it is a fulfillment of Isaiah's prophecy. The amazing rescue of 15,000 Ethiopian Jews in an airlift lasting less than 48 hours stirred and inspired people for a few weeks. Subsequently, the difficult problems the newcomers faced (similar to those of the 900,000 recent Soviet immigrants) occupied the Jewish media. Now both are taken for granted. The miracle has become routine. But if you had told the Jews of Ethiopia two generations ago that they would someday all fly to Israel in a giant silver bird, they could only conceive of this as a Messianic miracle. If you had told Soviet Jews a generation ago that the Communist regime would collapse, the Soviet Empire disintegrate, and hundreds of thousands of Soviet Jews would emigrate to Israel, they would have conceived it only as a Messianic dream. In our own generation therefore we have seen the dramatic fulfillment of Isaiah's prophecy: 'I will bring your offspring from the (Middle) East and gather you from the (European) West. To the North (Russia) I will say 'give them up' and to the South (Ethiopia) 'do not hold them'. Bring my sons from far away, my daughters from the end of the earth.' (43:5-6) Isn't it amazing how people adjust to living in a radically new world and forget the past. Indeed, the Prophet Isaiah himself said, 'Behold, I create a new Heaven and a new Earth, and former things shall not be remembered.' (65:17) Where does the Messiah fit in with all of this? He will still have lots to do when he arrives. Most Orthodox Jews would not commit themselves to any individual as a Messiah unless he successfully rebuilds the ancient Temple in Jerusalem, fulfilling the prophecy of Zachariah, 'He shall build the Temple of the Lord, and he shall bear the glory, he shall sit on the throne and rule, there shall be a priest before the throne, and peaceful counsel will exist between both of them.' (6:13) Now that a large part of the Jewish people have returned to the Land of Israel, and resurrected a Jewish State, one might think that rebuilding a temple of the site where Solomon originally built one almost 3,000 years ago, would be relatively simple. But there is vacant land on the Temple Mount, and a 3D digital broadcast Jewish house of worship could be rebuilt as a virtual replica like those made by the Factum Foundation, a Madrid-based nonprofit that creates high-resolution digital replicas of the world's cultural heritage; could be built about 600 feet north of the Al-Aqsa, near the Dome of the Rock, provided the Muslims would cooperate. This would fulfill Prophet Isaiah's statement that in the early part of the Messianic Age: 'Torah will be broadcast from Zion, and the word of the LORD from Jerusalem.' (Isaiah 2:3) Most observers agree that anyone who could arrange such Jewish-Muslim cooperation would really be the Messianic Ruler of Peace (Isaiah 9:5). Christian support for such a cooperative venture would also be very important. Anyone who can bring Jews, Christians, and Muslims together in mutual respect and cooperation would surely fulfill the greatest of all Messianic predictions: 'They shall beat their swords into plowshares and their spears into pruning knives; nation shall not take up sword against nation, they shall never again teach warfare.' (Isaiah 2:4) Most observers agree that anyone who could arrange such Jewish-Muslim cooperation would really be the Messianic Ruler of Peace (Isaiah 9:5) Christian support for such a cooperative venture would also be important, and anyone who can bring Jews, Christians and Muslims together in mutual respect and cooperation would surely fulfill the greatest of all Messianic predictions: 'They shall beat their swords into plowshares and their spears into pruning knives; nation shall not take up sword against nation, they shall never again teach war.' (Isaiah 2:4) Indeed, such Jewish/Christian/Muslim cooperation would not be possible without great spiritual leadership in all three communities. Thus, each community could consider its leadership to be the Messiah and this would fulfill the culminating verses of Isaiah's Messianic prophecy as enlarged upon by Micah (4:3-5), 'They shall beat their swords into plowshares and their spears into pruning knives. Nation shall not take up against nation, they shall never again teach war, but every man shall sit under his grapevine or fig tree with no one to disturb him, for it is the Lord of Hosts who spoke. Though all peoples walk each in the name of its God, we will walk in the name of the Lord our God for ever and ever.' If each religious community truly follows the best of its own religious teachings; the Messiah will surely have arrived, and God's Kingdom will be established.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWc_Uzhx5yRGuGsrqf-fXwMp	2025-01-18T15:43:16-08:00	
How The Israel-Hamas War Reshaped The Middle East – Analysis	By Ray Furlong and Abubakar Siddique (RFE/RL) -- The 15-month conflict in the Middle East has caused a dramatic shift in the regional balance of power. Iran and Russia have been severely weakened as Israel has pounded Tehran’s proxies in the region, leading also to the collapse of the Bashar al-Assad regime in Syria. Israel has emerged strengthened, but countries such as Turkey, Egypt, and Qatar have also gained influence. Iran’s decline is perhaps the most striking. Its much-vaunted 'axis of resistance' was based primarily on Hamas and Hezbollah, both listed as terrorist organizations by Israel, the United States, and other countries. Dramatic Changes The war began after Hamas launched its attack on Israel on October 7, 2023. In a dramatic escalation of decades of conflict, Hamas raids into Israel killed over 1,200 people, and the militant group seized over 200 hostages. The Israeli bombing and ground campaign that followed has killed the top figures in the Hamas leadership and an estimated 18,000 Hamas fighters. But it also reduced Gaza to rubble, killing some 46,000 people in total, according to Gaza health authorities. 'Weakening Hamas’s core leadership and destroying Gaza is going to fuel other types of militancy,' said Fatima Ayub, a Washington-based political analyst and researcher on the Middle East and South Asia. On January 14, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Washington estimates that Hamas has recruited as many fighters as it lost during the war. 'That is a recipe for an enduring insurgency and perpetual war,' he told an audience in Washington. Iran's Debacle The war was a disaster for Iran. During the past four decades, Tehran has spent billions on building a network of militant proxies across the region in Lebanon, Syria, Iraq, Gaza, and Yemen. Today, that lies in tatters. Since September 2024, Israel has dealt severe blows to Hezbollah in Lebanon by killing its long-standing leader, Hassan Nasrallah, and his key associates. The Israeli onslaught strongly diminished Hezbollah, which was previously the most powerful political force in Lebanon. Beirut now has a new president and prime minister. Both are seen as moderate and reformist figures free from Tehran’s influence. In Syria there was an even more profound impact. Hezbollah was no longer able to help President Bashar al-Assad maintain his grip on power. Nor were Russian forces, distracted and diluted by their much bigger war in Ukraine. 'Israel set in motion a chain of events that ultimately led to the collapse of the Assad regime,' said Hugh Lovatt, a Middle East expert at London’s European Council on Foreign Relations think tank. Tehran was forced to withdraw from Syria in the wake of Assad’s collapse. 'In Iran, even among hard-liners and the proponents of the axis of resistance, they accept that they have been defeated,' said Alex Vatanka, director of the Iran Program at the Middle East Institute in Washington. He said that it is too early to tell whether this will be a turning point for Tehran’s regional ambitions as it weighs giving up on Islamist militant groups in the Arab states. 'The costs are exceeding the benefits,' Vatanka said. 'And if they make that decision, we will face a different reality of the Iranian regional agenda going forward.' He said Iran’s influence over the Huthi rebels in Yemen is more tenuous. The United States, Israel, and Britain have attacked power and port infrastructure controlled by the group in northern Yemen after it fired missiles and drones at Israel and attacked maritime traffic in the Red Sea. 'The Huthis have far more independence and an agenda of their own in terms of the Palestinians,' he said. '[They are] not so dependent on what Iran decides to do.' Moscow's Exit Assad’s flight to exile in Moscow means that Russia has lost its military foothold in the Middle East. Russian forces were filmed evacuating, reportedly to eastern Libya. The Kremlin has lost an ally that dates back to the Cold War. 'It has suffered a huge strategic blow,' Lovatt said. 'I don't see any imminent openings for Russia to reassert itself in the Middle East.' However, other nations in the Middle East have gained influence at the expense of Tehran, Moscow, and their allies. Turkey will now have plenty of opportunities to shape Syria's future. Ankara-backed Islamist group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) now leads the interim government in Damascus after toppling Assad's government in a lightning offensive. Israel now finds itself in a much stronger military position, having dealt powerful blows to many enemies. Egypt and Qatar have scored diplomatic gains by brokering the elusive truce between Hamas and Israel. However, Saudi Arabia, the oil-rich Sunni monarchy, has not gained much from the war. 'They put all their money on the Abraham Accords and were close to normalizing with Israel formally before October 7,' said Ayub, the analyst in Washington. 'But they had no meaningful sway on regional developments since then.' The United Arab Emirates and Bahrain, key allies of Riyadh, recognized Israel under the Abraham Accords in September 2020. The prewar hopes for Saudi Arabia to follow suit may be a casualty of the conflict, given the scale of death and destruction in Gaza. This factor has also turned much public opinion in the region against the United States, which has called on Israel to show restraint while also providing the weapons it needed to wage war. Both the outgoing and incoming U.S. administrations have claimed credit for the peace deal, but it will be for President-elect Donald Trump to deal with the aftermath. It’s expected he will adopt a policy of maximum pressure toward Iran. His rhetoric has been firmly pro-Israel. The coming days will show if the peace deal holds -- and how Trump’s arrival reshuffles the cards once again.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWc_Uzhx5yRGuIKa8YyffAzq	2025-01-18T15:40:55-08:00	
Blurring Conventional–Nuclear Boundaries: Nordic Developments, Gl...	By Dr Wilfred Wan and Dr Gitte du Plessis In July 2024 Norway’s Kongsberg Defence & Aerospace signed a contract with the Norwegian Defence Materiel Agency (NDMA) for the development of a next-generation ‘supersonic strike missile’, as part of a collaborative project between Norway and Germany first announced in November 2023. The plan is for the new manoeuvrable naval strike missile, dubbed the Tyrfing, to be operational in 2035. This is just one of several recent high-profile efforts involving Nordic states that aim to enhance European conventional capabilities in order to deter aggression and maintain strategic stability. Others include Finland’s announcement, in May 2024, that it is acquiring Joint Air-to-Surface Standoff Missile-Extended Range (JASSM-ER) weapons from the United States, which comes on top of its 2021 order of US F-35 combat aircraft. Around the same time, Sweden announced that it would provide Ukraine with early warning and control aircraft equipped with its Erieye radar system. This is expected to represent a ‘big force multiplier’ for Ukraine’s F-16 combat aircraft. These moves in the Nordic region reflect broader European trends in the development and deployment of advanced conventional precision-strike capabilities. Investments in longer-range, manoeuvrable missiles and delivery systems—including the Tyrfing and the planned deployment on German soil of US hypersonic systems and ground-launched missiles that would have been prohibited under the now-defunct Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty (INF Treaty)—contribute to the spectre of a ‘new missile crisis’ in Europe. Planned upgrades to European global navigation satellite systems (GNSS) will further bolster the ability of these weapon systems to rapidly locate, target and ultimately destroy targets. For the Nordic states, and especially for new NATO members Finland and Sweden, Russia’s war in Ukraine has provided clear justification for such developments. They are seeking both to demonstrate solidarity with other NATO members and to strengthen the alliance’s conventional capabilities in order to complement the extended US nuclear deterrent. But these decisions have many implications—and come with risks—that European policymakers may not have fully considered. Advanced conventional capabilities as a source of instability Conventional precision-strike weapon systems were first employed in significant numbers by the USA during the 1990–91 Gulf War. They have matured significantly since then, enabled by a combination of improved guidance, advances in warhead technology, and vastly better intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance capabilities. Furthermore, whereas the USA possessed the vast majority of these weapons at the end of the cold war, many states now have or are planning to acquire them in large numbers. Although precision-strike systems have numerous functions in conventional warfare, they can also impact strategic stability and nuclear deterrence dynamics. This is because they can threaten nuclear-related targets such as hardened missile silos and command-and-control nodes to a much greater extent than their predecessors. Some states have already started leveraging this fact. For example, South Korea has, since 2012, employed a deterrence strategy that targets North Korean nuclear forces with a large arsenal of air-, land- and sea-based precision-strike conventional weapons. In response, North Korea is ‘designing around’ South Korea’s deterrence strategy by developing a large number of nuclear-capable short-range missiles and other delivery systems. While having a small nuclear arsenal—an estimated 50 warheads—features prominently in North Korea’s strategic calculus, the case gives some indication of how other nuclear-armed states may react to conventional developments. The potential risks fall into two main categories. First, the development and deployment of advanced conventional precision-strike capabilities may accelerate arms racing. All nuclear-armed states will increasingly take their adversaries’ conventional capabilities into consideration when developing their force structures and postures—a function of technological realities. This is especially pertinent with the potential deployment of NATO precision-strike capabilities in Finland and Sweden, near key Russian nuclear sites such as the ballistic missile submarine facilities on the Kola Peninsula or the strategic bombers located at Olenya airbase (just 150 kilometres from the Finnish border, and reportedly the target of a Ukrainian attack in July 2024). Even if they do not intend to target them at Russian nuclear sites, Nordic states need to consider how conventional weapons and capabilities they are developing might affect the strategic calculus of Russia and its allies. For example, following the 2024 announcement that the USA plans to deploy longer-range and hypersonic missiles in Germany, President Vladimir Putin promised ‘mirror measures’ and Russia has since used its Oreshnik intermediate-range ballistic missile system in Ukraine, with Russian officials noting the lack of treaty restrictions on its deployment. Second, increased precision-strike capabilities could have negative effects on crisis stability. For instance, during a crisis a nuclear-armed state may mistakenly believe that a conventional attack with precision-strike weapons is targeted at its nuclear forces, creating pressure to use them rather than risk losing them. In addition, the steps that states take to bolster the survivability of their nuclear forces in the face of growing conventional threats, such as raising alert levels, may increase the potential for escalation. These risks are likely to be more pronounced in crises involving states with small and potentially vulnerable nuclear arsenals, such as North Korea. However, NATO member states cannot ignore them even in relation to Russia. Reconsidering strategic stability in arms control The constellation of past bilateral nuclear arms control agreements between the Soviet Union/Russia and the USA was founded on notions of ‘strategic stability’—a fragile balance based on a shared need to maintain the assurance of nuclear retaliation. Advanced conventional systems increasingly threaten these retaliatory capabilities and, accordingly, the adversaries’ confidence that the strategic relationship is stable. The ramifications of this already seem to be affecting the prospects for arms control dialogue. Notably, Russia refuses to discuss resuming the New Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (New START), which has been suspended since 2023, expressing a strong preference for considering ‘other elements of strategic security’ in negotiations, as well as involving other European states. The development and deployment of advanced conventional capabilities could complicate future efforts to rebuild the nuclear arms control architecture more broadly. Any future arms control framework will likely have to reconsider what capabilities are strategic, and potentially incorporate the conventional capabilities of non-nuclear-armed states. In 2021—months before Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine—Russia and the USA established a working group on ‘capabilities and actions with strategic effects’ as part of their now-paused strategic stability dialogue. This suggested mutual recognition of the strategic importance of certain conventional weapon systems. The recent update of Russian nuclear doctrine to include possible nuclear use in response to aggression from non-nuclear-armed states involving or supported by a nuclear-armed state reinforces the blurring of boundaries between conventional and nuclear capabilities. Perhaps the fundamental issue is that strategic stability, already elusive during the cold war, appears even more difficult to achieve in a multipolar world. The different ways in which nuclear forces are being made vulnerable, including by precision-strike weapons but also through the development of and technological advances in cyber and counterspace capabilities, means that the incentives for first use of nuclear weapons may be increasing, especially in conflict or crisis situations. The blurring of the conventional–nuclear distinction may not only be removing the unique status of nuclear weapons but also have as yet unexplored consequences for the nuclear taboo, as suggested by Putin’s nuclear sabre-rattling in response to the activities of non-nuclear-armed states. Understanding and ensuring intended deterrent effects All of this calls into question the assumptions on which decisions by Nordic states are seemingly being made. Even if advanced conventional capabilities form—alongside political unity—‘the most significant source of NATO’s deterrent power’, the continued maturation and proliferation of those capabilities have far-reaching consequences, including for nuclear strategies, nuclear force structures and even nuclear use. To avoid worst-case scenarios, three interrelated points should be considered by Nordic, as well as other European, states before they make further investments in such capabilities. First, these states should continually and carefully assess the potential consequences of the development and deployment of advanced conventional capabilities. This process should start with systematic consideration of how they alter the conventional balance, but it should also encompass how these activities align with underlying threat perceptions, including those of Russia and its allies, and the potential impacts on nuclear deterrence dynamics. The process should also involve ensuring that any signalling—of resolve, restraint or readiness—that the deployment of new conventional capabilities is meant to do is coherent internally (including among allies) and clear externally. Even if this does not change the deployment decisions, it can at least reduce the risk of unintended consequences. Second, these states should also account in their security strategies for the nature and impact of blurring boundaries between conventional and nuclear capabilities. This necessitates careful analysis of how others perceive ‘strategic’ effects—technologically, materially and militarily, as well as politically. For instance, both China and Russia have rejected US diplomatic efforts to compartmentalize nuclear arms control from the broader strategic context. Challenging the traditional boundaries of concepts such as ‘strategic effect’ and moving beyond cold war-era frames of reference may enable greater understanding among Nordic and other European states of the wider consequences of their national-level decisions in the conventional realm, while facilitating innovative and less risky policy solutions, including arms control. Finally, Nordic and other European states should revisit their fundamental assumptions around nuclear deterrence. This includes critically examining the claims often presented by nuclear-armed states as to what nuclear capabilities successfully deter. This is especially pertinent given the discourse about deterrence in Europe connected to the war in Ukraine. The list of behaviours that nuclear weapons have historically been said to have deterred is long, and is an important factor in justifying nuclear modernization plans. As Nordic states take steps to strengthen NATO’s nuclear deterrence, they could consider engaging in discussions in venues that more openly acknowledge the complexities and explore the risks related to the deterrence paradigm. These include the recent findings of expert networks, or the ongoing work by states parties to the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons to research ‘risks and assumptions that are inherent in nuclear deterrence’. Dispelling myths and specifying exactly when and how deterrence works can pave the way for more effective means to pursue national security objectives, including through non-military solutions, while minimizing the risk of further destabilization and potential escalation.

The Shadow Fleet: Navigating The Nexus Of Ecological Peril And Ge...	In the labyrinthine world of global shipping, a silent menace operates in the shadows, one that threatens ecological balance, undermines international law, and fuels geopolitical tensions. This 'shadow fleet,' an unofficial armada of outdated and opaque oil tankers, primarily serve Russia, as well as Iran, North Korea, and Venezuela, circumventing sanctions and safety standards. Yet its unchecked operations represent more than a threat to economic integrity; they are a ticking ecological and geopolitical catastrophe. A recent incident near the German coast starkly illustrates these dangers. In January 2025, the Eventin, a 274-meter-long tanker carrying approximately 99,000 tonnes of Russian oil, lost power and steering in the Baltic Sea near the island of Rügen. German maritime authorities deployed tugboats to secure the vessel, narrowly averting an environmental disaster in one of Europe’s most sensitive marine ecosystems. This near-catastrophe, which required urgent action to stabilize the aging tanker, underscores the profound risks posed by the shadow fleet's growing reliance on outdated and unregulated vessels. The Baltic Sea, where around 50% of shadow fleet oil exports pass through, already classified as a 'Particularly Sensitive Sea Area' by the International Maritime Organization (IMO), is uniquely vulnerable. Its semi-enclosed geography limits water exchange, compounding the environmental and economic consequences of pollution. In the event of an oil spill, the impact would be catastrophic, destroying marine habitats and crippling local economies reliant on fisheries and tourism. This risk is not theoretical: an accident in this region could destroy fragile marine ecosystems, paralyze regional economies, and create lasting geopolitical friction. The Eventin incident brings into sharp relief the reckless operational standards of the shadow fleet, where vessels are often over 20 years old, inadequately maintained, and obscured by opaque ownership structures. The lack of proper maintenance and credible insurance magnifies their risk profile. Should a disaster occur, determining accountability would be nearly impossible, leaving affected ecosystems and communities to bear the consequences. Historical precedents amplify these concerns. The Prestige oil spill off the coast of Spain in 2002, caused by a 26-year-old structurally compromised tanker, resulted in over 60,000 tonnes of oil being discharged into the Atlantic Ocean. The disaster devastated marine ecosystems, disrupted livelihoods, and cost billions in cleanup efforts. However, while the Prestige tragedy involved a vessel operating within the framework of international law, the shadow fleet operates in a legal and regulatory void, making accountability and enforcement nearly impossible. A more recent incident underscores the growing risks of this unchecked system. In May 2023, the Pablo, a 1997-built uninsured tanker operating under a Gabonese flag, exploded off the coast of Malaysia, in one of the busiest shipping channels in the world, after unloading its cargo in China. Thanks to its nearly empty state, a catastrophic spill was narrowly avoided, but the explosion resulted in several fatalities and released toxic fumes into the atmosphere. Pablo’s obscure ownership and poor maintenance mirrored the systemic failings of the shadow fleet, highlighting the convergence of environmental, human, and operational risks associated with these vessels. But the shadow fleet is already signaling a global environmental crisis in slow motion. According to analysts, the shadow fleet spills over 4.5 million barrels of oil annually (equivalent to a medium-scale oil spill every month) due to substandard maintenance and unregulated operations, significantly degrading the marine environment worldwide. The shadow fleet’s danger is not confined to oil spills alone but a suspected instrument of the Russian hybrid warfare targeting critical infrastructure in the Baltic and beyond. Recent investigations have revealed that some shadow fleet vessels are linked to sabotage and undersea infrastructure damage. Finnish authorities detained the crew of the Eagle S in connection with damage to the Estlink-2 undersea cable between Finland and Estonia in late 2024. Similarly, the Baltic Connector gas pipeline rupture in October 2023 was to have involved a Russian-affiliated Chinese vessel. These incidents expose the shadow fleet’s capacity to heighten geopolitical tensions in already volatile regions. One of the shadow fleet’s most concerning practices is the routine deactivation of Automatic Identification Systems (AIS). This maneuver renders vessels invisible to tracking systems, facilitating sanctions evasion and increasing collision risks in congested shipping lanes. The deliberate concealment of these ships’ movements endangers not only other vessels but also regional security. From the start of the Russian invasion of Ukraine in February 2024 to April 2024, analysts at Vortexa and Windward documented over 1,300 such 'dark vessels' as well as over 1,000 flag-hopping 'gray vessels' in critical maritime corridors such as the Strait of Hormuz, the English Channel, and the Danish Straits with their top three destinations of India (+1.8M Barrels per Day), China (+1.5M Barrels per Day), and Turkey (+670K Barrels per Day) since March 2023. And the fleet kept growing rapidly. Despite the IMO’s 2023 resolution urging member states to crack down on fraudulent ship registrations and enhance inspections, enforcement remains inconsistent. Given the IMO’s limited enforcement powers, especially the European Union (EU), should take a more active role in implementing stringent monitoring and enforcement protocols. Germany’s swift response to the Eventin incident demonstrates how local leadership can mitigate risks in high-stakes situations, but such responses must be scaled to address the systemic nature of the shadow fleet threat. Germany’s swift response to the Eventin incident exemplifies the proactive role coastal nations can play in mitigating risks. However, stronger international cooperation and alignment of enforcement strategies are urgently needed. Many observers have long pointed out that Denmark, with its strategic position overseeing the maritime chokepoint between the North and Baltic Seas, has the potential to play a leading role in tightening controls. Enhanced inspections, greater regional coordination with Baltic Sea stakeholders, and the establishment of joint enforcement mechanisms could significantly curb the shadow fleet's operations. The geopolitical ramifications are equally stark. The shadow fleet enables sanctioned nations to sustain oil exports, undermining international efforts to curb malign activities. Russia, for example, uses these ships to bypass the G7-imposed $60-per-barrel price cap, generating billions in oil revenue to sustain its aggression in Ukraine. Similarly, Iran has relied on the shadow fleet to ship oil to China, circumventing U.S. sanctions and funding regional proxy conflicts. This undermines the unity of sanctions regimes and creates economic distortions, as law-abiding companies face unfair competition from unscrupulous operators. The result is a parallel system of unregulated oil trade that diverts global oil trade into opaque channels that fuel corruption and destabilization, further eroding the rule of law and destabilizing global markets. Tackling this issue requires a multifaceted approach. First, international organizations with enforcement and regulatory capabilities, such as the EU, must take the lead in implementing stringent monitoring protocols, supported by the IMO in enhancing governance frameworks and technical standards. This includes mandating full transparency in vessel ownership, insurance coverage, and operational compliance. Ships operating without credible insurance or registered under opaque 'flags of convenience' must face immediate interdiction. Regional coalitions like the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) can play a vital role by fostering collaboration among member states to enhance monitoring and coordination in the region's critical maritime corridors. Second, technological solutions, such as satellite-based vessel monitoring systems or AI-driven solutions like Nordic Warden, should be deployed to track and intercept tankers engaging in AIS deactivation. Governments must also invest in robust inspection regimes at ports and establish regional coalitions to coordinate responses to shadow fleet activities. Third, and most critically, the ecological risks posed by these vessels demand immediate attention. The Baltic Sea, the Mediterranean, and other vulnerable marine environments are ill-equipped to handle the scale of disaster that could result from a shadow fleet spill. The Eventin incident serves as a stark warning: the world is unprepared for the environmental and economic fallout of such a crisis. To mitigate these risks, nations must establish rapid-response frameworks and enhance capacity for dealing with large-scale spills, drawing on lessons from past disasters like Prestige and Pablo. The shadow fleet is not merely a logistical workaround for sanctioned regimes; it is a symptom of systemic failures in global governance and environmental stewardship. Its unchecked proliferation represents a breakdown in international cooperation, as well as an urgent test of the global community’s ability to balance sustainability with security. Addressing its risks requires a paradigm shift in how the international community integrates environmental stewardship with collective geopolitical strategy. As the world grapples with the dual challenges of ecological crises and geopolitical instability, the shadow fleet reminds us that sustainability and security are inseparable. Strong leadership is essential; nations and international organizations must prioritize long-term stability over short-term economic interests. The specter of an ecological calamity is no longer a question of 'if,' but 'when.' The time for decisive action is now before the next disaster forces us to confront the cost of inaction.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWcqmplb-haarV8i5kwdxT2n	2025-01-17T16:25:49-08:00	
The Impact And Complexity Of Saudi Funding On Dissemination Of Wa...	By A’an Suryana Saudi Arabia has undergone significant social and political transformations under the new de facto ruler, Muhammad bin Salman, who started governing the country in 2017. Under his rule, the country has been much more open socially and culturally. For example, in 2018, he lifted the 35-year ban on cinemas. In 2019, tourists were welcome as part of the 'white-oil' drive, and he took further steps to loosen men’s total authority over women by allowing women to travel without a male 'guardian'.[1] These policies marked a shift in the country’s conservative outlook, signalling its embrace of a more 'moderate' form of Islam. The overall policy on religious moderation is part of Muhammad bin Salman’s efforts to promote Saudi Arabia’s Vision 2030 initiative. Realising that the country can no longer rely solely on oil profit to sustain its social and economic development, the Vision 2030 initiative aims to open Saudi Arabia to foreign investment and tourism, which may prospectively be key drivers of growth in the post-oil era. One of the social aspects that needs scrutiny in this seismic shift in Saudi Arabia’s policies is the government’s funding programmes and its Wahhabisation project. Saudi funding in this article refers to the money the Saudi government and its people have spent in spreading Wahhabism and Salafism across the world. Salafism is a religious ideology that advocates returning to the practices of Islam as performed by the Prophet Muhammad and Muslims who lived two generations after him. Wahhabism, on the other hand, is an increasingly entrenched global religious movement initiated by Abdul Wahhab in the 18th century to spread his version of Salafi ideology. It is crucial that Saudi funding be examined since the estimated amount of funds disbursed by the country for promoting both Wahhabism and Salafism has been enormous. James M. Dorsey and James Chin have estimated that the amount of funding disbursed for this purpose is somewhere between US$70 and US$100 billion.[2] While they did not spell out in detail the breakdown of the funding, it is clear that a large sum of money has been set aside to spread Wahhabism and Salafism across the world. Between 1982 and 2005, an official record shows that the Saudi regime under King Fahd spent over US$1 billion 'on mosques, schools, preachers and teachers’ salaries, scholarships, and textbooks, which went toward at least 1,500 mosques, 200 Islamic centres, 200 colleges, and 2,000 schools or madrasas' worldwide.[3] Some US$10 million of the total US$1 billion was used to build mosques across the United States. The US$1 billion was provided by the government and does not account for contributions from private funders with similar aims. Salafism is controversial due to its promotion of an uncompromising form of Islam, such as its penchant for eschewing and even attacking the practice of mysticism or the worship of saints, which Salafis consider to be religious innovations (bid’ah) which have no basis in Islamic teachings. Western and Asian scholars and media have often accused the Saudi government of exporting a radical version of Islam through its funding.[4] Some of the money allegedly even went into funding terrorist activities. For example, the United Nations recommended that assets belonging to a Saudi charity, Al-Haramain Islamic Foundation (AHIF), be frozen between 2004 and 2010 due to alleged links to the terrorist organisation Al-Qaeda.[5] A substantial number of journal articles, institutional and media reports have been written on the importance of Saudi funding in promoting both Wahhabism and Salafism.[6] While existing literature emphasises the role of ideology in driving Saudi funding, this article argues that the motives behind it are far more complex. As illustrated by an Indonesian case study, the distribution of Saudi funding has not only aimed to promote Wahhabism and Salafism, but has also been influenced by other factors such as geopolitical considerations and domestic political dynamics. THE IMPACT OF SAUDI FUNDING The original motivation for the Saudis funding the export of Wahhabism was geopolitics. The first wave began in 1960 when King Fahd introduced policies to modernise Saudi education. He sought to challenge the influence of Al-Azhar University in Cairo, which was regarded as a key intellectual reference for the Islamic world. As a result, he established more universities, schools and other educational and social institutions to promote, among other things, Wahhabism and Salafism. Windfall profits from oil industries that began to fill its pockets gave more leeway for Saudi Arabia to expand their sphere of religious influence through education and other means, such as diplomacy. This occurred in various forms, such as through financial aid for victims of natural disasters. More intense efforts were made in the 1980s, with many scholars pointing to the Iranian revolution as a key catalyst for Saudi Arabia’s increased efforts to export Wahhabi ideas.[7] Fearing that the influence of the revolution would sideline them, the Saudi government embarked on an offensive mode in spreading Wahhabi ideology globally, including in Indonesia. However, the urgency was not solely driven by the Iranian revolution. Domestic turmoil also contributed to Saudi Arabia’s decision to boost its influence.[8] This was caused by the 1979 Grand Mosque takeover in Mecca, when a group of heavily-armed Islamists led by Juhayman Al-Otaibi, who was frustrated by what he saw as the Saudi regime’s increasing consumerism and declining religiosity in the post oil-boom in the 1970s,[9] took over the mosque for two weeks. The takeover shocked the Saudi regime, and it swiftly crushed the siege. To prevent further fallout from the revolt and the Iranian revolution, the regime appeased the conservatives by giving them more power to restore conservatism in the country. Domestically, this shift was reflected in a tripling of the budget disbursed to the Committee for Prevention of Vice and Promotion of Virtue, a cleric-led body responsible for enforcing conservative religious practices. The budget increase was also intended to 'Islamise' the curricula in all Saudi universities.[10] The conservatives, especially the Wahhabi clerics and descendants of Muhammad Abdul Wahhab, also experienced a growth in influence in their roles abroad as the regime expanded the global dissemination of Wahhabism. In their new roles in educational positions held abroad, their teachings contributed to the growing popularity of Wahhabism.[11] THE CASE OF INDONESIA One of the countries that has been on the receiving end of Saudi funding is Indonesia. In 2017, the Saudi regime funded, among others, 'scholarly exchanges, a flagship free school in Jakarta, and the construction of masjids (places of worship) and madrassahs and Islamic boarding schools (pesantren) throughout Indonesia'.[12] They also provided 'the reviewed and the audited Arabic language textbooks' and taught courses on Shariah.[13] One of the foremost and influential institutions funded by the Saudis is the Islamic and Arabic College of Indonesia (LIPIA). Established in 1980 in Jakarta, the college is an extension of King Saud University. Apart from improving Indonesians’ command of Arabic, which is seen as a religious language, it also offers classes on both Wahhabi and Salafi ideas.[14] A substantial number of its graduates went on to become religious, social and political leaders. Some became popular religious figures who disseminated Wahhabi and Salafi ideas as taught by their former teachers at LIPIA, such as Syafiq Riza Basalamah, Yazid bin Abdul Qadir Jawas and Ja’far Umar Thalib, while others chose different paths; these latter joined established organisations that promote different ideas of Islam, such as the tarbiyah movement (an education movement inspired by the Muslim Brotherhood). Some even joined the Prosperous Justice Party (PKS), a local organisation inspired by the Muslim Brotherhood. These included figures such as Anis Matta, former PKS chairman who is now Deputy Minister for Foreign Affairs, and Ahmad Heryawan, former West Java Governor. Despite the variety of ideas propagated by its alumni, the institution has been successful in producing graduates who follow and promote both Wahhabism and Salafism. As a result, at least 100 Salafi boarding schools have been established throughout Indonesia. Furthermore, LIPIA has expanded to include campuses in Medan (2007), Aceh (2007) and Makassar (2017), along with an increase in student capacity from 2,500 to 10,000 across all four campuses.[15] This is testament to Saudi Arabia’s success in exporting those teachings. Through such funding, Saudi Arabia has been successful in sidelining Iranian influence and in challenging Al-Azhar’s long-standing influence. Indeed, many Indonesians were attracted to Shi’ism following the 1979 Iranian revolution; Shi’as, however, are still considered a minority and Shi’a teachings are barely seen online and offline, in contrast to the strong presence of Wahhabi and Salafi teachings propagated by clerics in both spheres. In addition, there were only 100 Indonesians studying in Iran in 2022,[16] whereas the corresponding number at the Islamic University of Madinah, Saudi Arabia in 2024 was 1,482.[17] THE COMPLEXITY OF SAUDI FUNDING As mentioned earlier, some literature, especially those published in Western academia, have portrayed Saudi funding as primarily aimed at disseminating religious conservatism in the form of Wahhabism and Salafism. While the impact of such funding has been significant—as the case of Indonesia has shown—the reality on the ground has been such that not all funding has been aimed at spreading conservative ideologies. The funding has been used for a variety of purposes, including for diplomatic and economic purposes. The diplomatic purposes, which are aimed at boosting Saudi Arabia-Indonesia ties, include social aid to overcome the impact of natural disasters and to boost 'food security'.[18] On 4 April 2023, for example, the Saudi government donated to Indonesia 100 tons of dates 'as gifts from King of Saudi Arabia Salman bin Abdulaziz Al Saud that will be distributed to people in need'.[19] The Saudi government also donated US$50 million to the Indonesian government to support West Sumatra’s social and economic recovery efforts following a major earthquake in the area in 2009, which killed more than 1,100 people.[20] These are just a few examples of Saudi funding disbursed to strengthen bilateral ties between the two countries. Given that the distribution of the funding often lacks accountability, it is unclear how much has been disbursed for ideological reasons. Furthermore, not all funding comes from the Saudi government; a substantial amount also comes from individual Saudi citizens whether nobleman or commoner. In some cases, the funding is disbursed with strings attached, including the promotion of both Wahhabism and Salafism, such as the distribution of funding to both Wahhabi and Salafi boarding schools. In other cases, funds were disbursed by private individuals without government knowledge of the ideological reasons behind the funding. For example, a Saudi donor made available a sum amounting to Rp 120 million for the construction of Masjid Madinahtul Umidiah in Tangerang regency, Banten province. He gave this money to the mosque construction committee through an Indonesian representative, H. Omin.[21] Being a small-scale fund from a private donor, no accountability has been demanded from the donor, and no approval has been required from the Saudi government. This is in contrast to bigger funds disbursed by large government-backed charity organisations such as the East Jakarta-based Makkah Al Mukarramah Foundation. Between 2004 and 2015, the foundation helped build 800 mosques and 3,400 showers and toilets across Indonesia with financial support from the Saudi government.[22] Much of the financial assistance materialised due to requests by Indonesian institutions and individuals, but others were initiatives by both the Saudi government and their private citizens, such as those in support of Indonesian victims of natural disasters.[23] SAUDI FUNDING IN THE ERA OF MUHAMMAD BIN SALMAN The relation between Muhammad bin Salman and Saudi funding needs to be put in the context of a social and political pact made between his ancestor (King Muhammad ibn Saud) and influential Muslim cleric Muhammad Abdul Wahhab in the 17th century. Muhammad ibn Saud (1727–1765), who controlled Al-Diriya area on the outskirts of Riyadh, the capital city, socially and politically protected Muhammad Abdul Wahab, while the latter provided religious legitimacy for Muhammad ibn Saud’s rule and policies in return.[24] The pact contributed to the expansion of Muhammad ibn Saud’s rule beyond the Al-Diriya area which resulted in their control over modern-day Saudi Arabia. While certain aspects of the pact have continued till this day, others have changed. The long-time pact was put to the test when King Faisal (1964–75) introduced modernisation in Saudi Arabia during his rule, such as through the launch of the first television broadcast and the promotion of girls’ education.[25] The conservatives were unhappy with these developments, and King Faisal was assassinated in 1975 by an extended relative. His successor King Khalid rolled back some of the reforms. For example, women were excluded from public life, and more funds were injected into the Committee for the Promotion of Virtue and Prevention of Vice, whose task was to monitor the lives of ordinary Saudis.[26] Subsequent kings of Saudi Arabia kept the pact intact, and no major reforms were introduced. However, Muhammad bin Salman, who took over the reins of state in 2017, again introduced reforms. Most significantly, he sought to promote 'moderate Islam', and aimed for a more pragmatic approach, rather than solely focusing on a moderate Islamic theology. He balanced these changes with continued support for Saudi Arabia’s promotion of Wahhabism and Salafism. The policy has been quite effective as narratives being used by the religious establishment in support of his 'moderate Islam' project appear more and more mainstream. 'Moderate Islam' is merely a label to make the country more acceptable to international audiences and governments; through this innovation, Muhammad bin Salman’s post-oil vision (Vision 2030) has been attained. So far, he has faced little significant resistance to his changes.[27] To be sure, any signals of dissent have been met with repressive actions by Muhammad bin Salman. Following the 2001 terror attacks in New York, Saudi Arabia imposed strict control on its financial resources to ensure that no funds would be used for terrorism. Muhammad bin Salman continued this policy. To reduce Western suspicion that the Saudi government was involved in funding terrorist activities, Saudi Arabia under Muhammad bin Salman promoted peace and development in Muslim communities abroad more vigorously, including in promoting a more moderate form of Islam. In the context of Indonesia, before the reforms introduced by Muhammad bin Salman, Saudi Arabia mainly channelled funds to modernist groups such as Muhammadiyah,[28] whose ideology is more aligned with Wahhabism, for example, in their fight against religious innovation. However, with Saudi Arabia’s recent efforts at becoming more moderate, they have begun to provide financial support to Nadhlatul Ulama, specifically for the organisation of Religion 20 (R20), an event held on the sidelines of the G20 summit organised in Indonesia in 2023. At the same time, the country has continued distributing funds for the propagation of Wahhabism and Salafism. As mentioned earlier, the Saudi government officiated the expansion of LIPIA into three more locations in Indonesia, adding to its Jakarta campus, and allowing it to increase its capacity for student enrolment. This complexity is part of Muhammad bin Salman’s efforts to sustain and expand Saudi’s economy while at the same time upholding the longstanding pact between Muhammad Ibn Saud and Muhammad Abdul Wahhab. CONCLUSION This article has discussed how Saudi funding has been instrumental in popularising Wahhabism and Salafism in Indonesia, as exemplified by the many graduates from LIPIA who became educators and who promoted the ideology among the masses. A good number of graduates also assumed important positions in society, including as policymakers and politicians. The spread of this uncompromising ideology remains concerning as it has contributed to polarisation within the nation, dividing both Wahabi and Salafi followers from adherents of other streams of Islam such as traditionalists and modernists. This poses a challenge to Indonesia’s nation-building efforts. Above all, while Muhammad bin Salman has been trying to portray Saudi Arabia as a moderate country, the country has continued to fund the promotion of Wahhabism and Salafism, suggesting a sense of pragmatism in balancing the need to attract tourism and businesses, with respect for history and the religious establishment.

Russia’s Role In A Post-Assad Syria – Analysis	By Rajoli Siddharth Jayaprakash Former Syrian ruler Bashar al-Assad was Russia’s crucial ally in West Asia, with Russia taking an active role in regional geopolitics since the Syrian civil war began in 2011. In 2015, when Assad’s forces were on the brink of collapse, Moscow intervened and provided critical air support to Syrian and Iranian-backed forces, re-consolidating Assad’s hold over the country. This was also Russia’s first military intervention abroad. However, since 2020, Assad’s reluctance to engage with other factions inside Syria fighting against his regime, coupled with the weakening of the Syrian economy post-COVID, and a devastating earthquake in northern Syria in the summer of 2024, has led to growing discontent. This was exacerbated with Russia being focused on its Ukrainian campaign since 2022, and Hezbollah directing its attention towards countering Israel since last year, which further impacted the morale within the regime’s forces. All these factors resulted in Assad’s hold on power weakening, leading to the Türkiye-backed Hay’at Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) making considerable territorial gains, capturing Aleppo, Hama, and Homs. By 7 December, rebel forces had encircled Damascus. On 8 December, Assad fled to Moscow, marking the end of his 24-year-long rule. Russia’s approach to these recent developments has been pragmatic, with Moscow reaching out to the HTS in hopes of retaining its interests in the region. Engagement with the transitional government Russia’s commitment to the Assad regime remained until its last days, with Russian forces in Khmeimim working with regime forces to thwart the terrorist advance. However, Moscow’s stance shifted following 8 December. The Syrian embassy in Moscow opened under a new flag, and Russian state media began referring to the rebels as 'armed opposition' rather than a 'terrorist group'. Further, Russian officials were in contact with the HTS, which guaranteed the security of Russian military bases and diplomatic missions in the country. According to the Emirati newspaper The National, talks between Russia and the new Syrian administration are in their early stages, and the Russian military has good relations with the new administration, with no provocations reported or demands for the extradition of Assad. Following Assad’s ouster, Moscow’s operations in Syria have been marked by a shift. Russian President Vladimir Putin, in his annual direct line, stated that the Russian air base in Khmeimim, which was formerly used to strike rebel positions, could be used to deliver humanitarian aid. Putin further stated that the regime’s collapse was not a defeat for the Kremlin, as Russia’s participation in the Syrian civil war was to prevent the creation of a terrorist enclave in Syria. Further, he condemned the Israeli seizure of Syrian territory. Since 8 December, the Kremlin’s stance on Syria has become more flexible, with Russia reaching out to all groups that control the situation in the country. The new transitional government in Syria needs Russia as the HTS needs more partners, and Moscow's backing of the new regime could grant them international legitimacy. In HTS’ calculus, Moscow is more important vis-a-vis Washington, as the latter backs Kurdish rebels and tribal groups in northern Syria. Further, the possible removal of the HTS from Russia’s terrorist list gives the new government legitimacy for a more formal interaction. Recently, Russia’s upper house, the Federation Council, approved a mechanism that suspends a ban on the activities of a terrorist organisation. The amended legislation stipulates the suspension of a ban by court decision and is instead initiated by the decision of the prosecutor general of the Russian Federation or his deputy. The Kremlin has specified that this was to ensure a mechanism for legal interaction between the Taliban and Russia, with no mention of the HTS. However, judging from how Moscow has reacted to the new transitional government in Syria, as well as Ramzan Kadyrov, the head of the Republic of Chechnya in Russia, urging the HTS’s removal from the terror list, it is likely that if HTS were to uphold required criteria, it would be removed from Russia’s terrorist list. A pivotal external balancer in West Asia At the request of Assad, Moscow in 2015 intervened in the Syrian civil war to thwart the Islamic State and opposition forces to the Ba’ath party. Moscow provided air support to Syrian and Iran-backed ground forces, which changed the course of the civil war, shifting in the favour of Assad. Moscow’s first intervention since the collapse of the erstwhile Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR) resulted in Russia not only gaining a foot in the door and becoming an important external balancer in the region but also succeeding in the fight against international terror. In 2017, Russia and Syria signed an agreement that allowed Russia to extend Moscow’s lease on the Tartus naval facility for 49 years, and they signed another deal leasing the Khmeimim airbase for the same period. These bases were a crucial logistics hub and were used to project Russia’s influence in the eastern Mediterranean region, as Syria was Moscow’s stepping stone into Africa. Moscow gained influence in the Middle East, with its increasing political contacts with the Gulf nations. Russia also gained leverage in negotiations with Türkiye and Iran. The former began normalising relations with Assad in return for a seat in the Astana process, which aimed to bring an end to the conflict in Syria and create a buffer zone in Turkey's Southern border. Post-Ukraine developments in West Asia However, since the war in Ukraine began, Russia’s leverage over Syria began to reduce, with Moscow’s dependence on Türkiye increasing for the re-routing of trade. With the Ukraine gas transit deal expiring in January 2025, and the Turkstream pipeline being the only viable mechanism for the transhipment of Russian pipeline gas to Europe, Ankara is in a better position to negotiate terms that give Turkiye the upper hand. Further, as the Russian troop presence was reduced in Syria and redirected to Ukraine, in addition to the Iran-backed Hezbollah tackling Israel since last October meant that rebel factions were strengthened. With Assad’s ouster, Türkiye and Israel’s influence has increased in regional geopolitics, as Moscow’s influence is on a relative decline. Moscow’s relationship with Türkiye and Israel will likely go back to the pre-2015 calculations. What’s next? Despite Russia managing to salvage some of its interests in the country, Assad’s ouster reflects Moscow’s relative power decline in the Middle East. Thus, it is likely that in the short term, Russia will not be able to play a proactive role as it did in the past. Thus, it is expected that Russia will become flexible in its approach to Syria, dealing with the new HTS government and other non-state actors like Moscow dealt with the Taliban, including their possible removal from the terrorist list, and working on post-conflict resolution mechanisms that would help rebuild Syria’s economy. Ultimately, however, Russia’s Middle East strategy in the long term will depend on how the domestic situation in Syria evolves.

Myanmar: ‘Scorched Earth’ Tactics Intensify, HRW Says	Myanmar’s military junta ramped-up its 'scorched earth' tactics against opposition areas amid a growing armed resistance and territorial losses during 2024, Human Rights Watch said in its World Report 2025. The military committed unlawful attacks against civilians and civilian infrastructure, including indiscriminate airstrikes, killings, rape, torture, and arson amounting to war crimes and crimes against humanity. For the 546-page world report, in its 35th edition, Human Rights Watch reviewed human rights practices in more than 100 countries. In much of the world, Executive Director Tirana Hassan writes in her introductory essay, governments cracked down and wrongfully arrested and imprisoned political opponents, activists, and journalists. Armed groups and government forces unlawfully killed civilians, drove many from their homes, and blocked access to humanitarian aid. In many of the more than 70 national elections in 2024, authoritarian leaders gained ground with their discriminatory rhetoric and policies. 'The Myanmar military has increasingly committed grave crimes against civilians and civilian infrastructure in response to heightened resistance from armed anti-junta groups and ethnic minority armies,' said Bryony Lau, deputy Asia director at Human Rights Watch. 'The suffering of villagers has been made all the worse by the junta’s determination to block humanitarian aid from reaching those in need.' Myanmar’s military has increasingly carried out aerial and artillery attacks using explosive weapons in populated areas, increasing the risk of resulting indiscriminate attacks. Myanmar is one of only four countries using banned cluster munitions and landmines. The junta has further tightened restrictions on humanitarian aid and telecommunications services as a method of collective punishment. Aid blockages and economic collapse have left millions of people at risk of starvation and half the population in poverty. More than three million people have been internally displaced. After the enactment of a conscription law in February, military authorities forcibly recruited young adults and children through abductions and detention of family members. Conscripts have been used as human shields and porters on the front lines. Junta forces and the ethnic Arakan Army have committed mass killings, arson, and unlawful recruitment against Rohingya civilians in Rakhine State. The United Nations Security Council should pass a resolution instituting a global arms embargo on Myanmar, imposing targeted sanctions on junta leadership and military-owned companies, and referring the country situation to the International Criminal Court (ICC), Human Rights Watch said. To better support people in need, donors should channel aid through civil society groups and cross-border efforts, support independent organizations, and allow the transfer of funds to these groups outside Myanmar’s formal banking system.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWcqmplb-haarUMqhbXSisRU	2025-01-17T16:20:05-08:00	
Stock Market As Crucial Indicator Of China’s Policy Effectiveness...	By Yang Xite At the start of 2025, China's stock market remains highly volatile. Geopolitical tensions and a sluggish domestic economy have combined to erode investor confidence in the market's outlook. According to a Bloomberg report on January 12, the CSI 300 Index dropped more than 5% in the first seven trading days of the year, marking its worst start since 2016. At the same time, the MSCI China Index has fallen by 20% since its peak last October, potentially entering bear market territory. A Bloomberg survey of 15 Chinese fund managers and strategists revealed that more than two-thirds favor Chinese government bonds and U.S. dollar assets over domestic stocks. Despite a strong rally on January 14, with all three major A-share indices rising, the market still faces significant uncertainty. In fact, China's stock market was already highly volatile in 2024, with a sharp drop in the first part of the year followed by a rebound in the fall, which saw gains of 30% to 40%. This rebound was triggered by the Chinese government's announcement to cut reserve requirement ratio and interest rates, injecting large amounts of liquidity into the market and sparking investor enthusiasm. However, the effect was short-lived, and the market quickly corrected after a brief surge, leaving many investors 'trapped' or forced to sell at a loss. In December, the Central Economic Work Conference adjusted monetary policy again, shifting from the 'prudent and flexible' approach of the past 14 years to a 'moderately loose' stance, with an emphasis on stimulating domestic consumption as the key driver for economic growth. But compared to the brief market boost priorly in early 2024, this latest policy's 'honeymoon period' was much shorter. Just two days later, on December 13, all three A-share indices closed lower, each falling by more than 2%. In the current complex economic environment, it is clear that there is a disconnect between government policies and market reactions in China. Although short-term stimulus measures continue to be introduced, the market's expectations and confidence in these policies have not been fundamentally restored. As a result, the public's expectations of government policies may not have been effectively addressed. Yet, how do ordinary Chinese assess the effectiveness of these policies? This depends not only on whether the government has addressed the most urgent needs of the public, but more importantly, on whether the government can genuinely reflect people's sense of gain in the process of policy implementation. Researchers at ANBOUND believe that while basic life needs and household essentials are important, they represent only the most essential survival needs. With the continued growth of China's economy and the expansion of the middle class, the public's demands are gradually shifting toward higher-level development and investment needs. Therefore, the government needs to adapt to the times, shifting from merely satisfying basic needs to focusing more on promoting the long-term development and wealth accumulation of the public. Especially during this critical period of economic transformation, responding to and meeting the public's diverse needs in areas such as quality of life, social security, and investment opportunities have become a key measure of policy effectiveness. For the government, addressing the complex economic landscape and social development requires both strategic foresight and practical execution. It must balance long-term planning with the flexibility to tackle immediate challenges. In policy selection and implementation, the focus should be on precision and clarity, as well as avoiding generic approaches. The government will also need to prioritize areas that can deliver swift results, energize the market, and restore public confidence, creating a powerful leveraging effect for its policies. Researchers at ANBOUND believe that the capital market is increasingly intertwined with the daily lives and wealth management of ordinary people. How to effectively reform and build the capital market is directly related to the public's investment needs and the potential for future economic development. As such, whether the government can effectively promote the stable growth of the stock market has become a key indicator of its performance. In fact, the sustained stability of the stock market not only reflects the fundamentals of the economy but also directly affects the public's sense of wealth security and investment confidence, serving as an important manifestation of the government's policy effectiveness. For a long time, China's stock market has remained stagnant at low levels, a performance that clearly doesn't align with the country's long-term macroeconomic and capital market development goals. Regardless of changes in GDP data, Chinee stock market has consistently been in a state of 'detachment from the macroeconomy', remaining sluggish. On the surface, the stock market seems disconnected from China's comprehensive national strength and development potential, failing to effectively reflect the true state of the economy. Theoretically, under relatively stable macroeconomic conditions, maintaining stock market stability and fostering steady growth should be much easier than driving the development of physical industries like semiconductors. Moreover, the Chinese capital market currently faces a shortage of investment targets, with a lack of sufficient high-quality investment options. In this context, even if certain industries are struggling or economic growth is slowing, the stock market can still show some performance. This is because, for most of the general public, the stock market represents a potential investment channel and a hope for the appreciation of their capital. If the stock market can be kept stable and driven upward through sound policies and market mechanisms, it would undoubtedly provide the public with a hopeful investment platform. In the current economic environment, maintaining 'hope' is crucial because expectations themselves are a powerful driver of economic vitality. People's investment expectations not only influence their investment decisions but also directly affect their willingness to consume and their future consumption behaviors. If these expectations are properly guided, they can become an invisible force driving economic growth. Against this backdrop, many macroeconomic policies focus on stimulating consumption and expanding demand, aiming to boost economic growth by encouraging public enthusiasm for consumption. At the same time, social security policies are promoting the shift of savings toward commercial pension insurance, aiming to alleviate the immense deficit pressure on the social security system. However, the current policies are mostly 'persuasive' in nature, and their impact tends to be limited. If they do not accurately address the real needs of the public, they are unlikely to generate a meaningful response. Especially when people's confidence and expectations have not been fundamentally restored, relying solely on administrative persuasion and incentives will not tap into their deeper motivations for investment and consumption. The real challenge for policy, then, is to truly understand and meet the public's needs, rather than just offering surface-level encouragement and advocacy. Understanding the public's development and investment needs is key to current economic policy. China's economy has entered a new phase, with GDP surpassing RMB 120 trillion, demonstrating the potential and strength to support greater investment opportunities. As a result, China should be capable of providing a broader development platform for the stock market. While the government has set many ambitious goals for revitalization, whether these goals can ultimately be realized depends on their alignment with the growing real needs of the public, especially the need for wealth growth and investment returns. Only when policies are organically connected to the needs of the people can they truly enhance their sense of gain. In this context, promoting the healthy development of the stock market has become a crucial task. The stock market is not only a direct investment platform but also an important tool for the government to leverage and stimulate economic growth. Therefore, ensuring the long-term, healthy development of the stock market should become one of the core directions of government economic policy and occupy a more prominent position in future policy-making. Achieving the healthy development of the stock market is a critical issue that policymakers must address. Researchers at ANBOUND emphasize several key principles from a macro-policy perspective that deserve focused attention. First, policy design must take into account the actual needs of the market and the long-term development of the stock market. In China, the stock market's performance is closely linked to government policies, so it is essential to establish a policy framework that supports sustainable market growth, rather than relying solely on short-term stimulus measures or surface fixes. Second, the healthy development of the stock market depends on a stable policy environment. Once a solid market system is in place, policies should aim for consistency, minimizing frequent interventions, and avoiding the 'composition fallacy', i.e., the over-implementation of policies that, while seemingly effective on their own, may disrupt market balance and long-term sustainability. Finally, stock market regulation should evolve into a service-oriented, development-focused, and protective model, with a particular focus on safeguarding the interests of small and medium-sized investors. While regulatory bodies should take a firm stance against violations, the overarching goal should be to foster the market's healthy development, rather than resorting to abrupt, campaign-style regulatory actions. Final analysis conclusion: 2025 is a crucial year for China's development, marking both the final year of the 14th Five-Year Plan and the beginning of the 15th Five-Year Plan. In the context of focusing on stabilizing the economy, China needs to prioritize policies in areas with high leverage and strong catalytic effects, addressing the public's development and investment needs. ANBOUND believes that maintaining and ensuring the continued stability and growth of the domestic stock market will be an important focus. This will also serve as a key measure by which the public evaluates the effectiveness of government policies.

The Kurds In Syria’s Future – OpEd	What is to become of the Kurds, by far Syria’s largest minority at some two million people? The Syrian civil war, starting in 2011, brought the Kurds to the forefront of the region’s politics. In face of the all-conquering military advance of Islamic State (ISIS), Syrian government forces abandoned many Kurdish occupied areas in the north-east of the country, leaving the Kurds to administer them. A US-led coalition, bent on defeating ISIS, allied itself with the Iraqi Kurdish Peshmerga militia, which proved remarkably successful. It look less than two years to reconquer ISIS-held territory, and in the process the Kurdish occupied area of north-east Syria, known as Rojava, gained de facto autonomy. The capture by Kurdish forces of the township of Manbij from ISIS on 12 August 2016 produced along Turkey’s southern border a swath of territory largely controlled by the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) – an alliance of Arab and Kurdish militias. This area was closely adjacent to Iraq’s Kurdistan Region, the Kurdish populated area granted autonomy in Iraq’s 2005 constitution. So, much to the distaste of Turkey’s President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, the possibility of a united autonomous Kurdistan stretching across the northern reaches of Syria and Iraq seemed to be emerging. Erdogan has consistently viewed the People's Protection Units (YPG), the dominant force in the SDF, as an extension of the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), a group widely designated as a terrorist organization. Accordingly in 2016 Erdogan instituted Operation Euphrates Shield, capturing an area in north Syria from Jarabulus to Al-Bab. He followed this two years later with Operation Olive Branch during which he overran Afrin. In 2019, after the US announced its withdrawal from parts of northern Syria, he launched Operation Peace Spring, establishing a so-called 'safe zone' on the Syrian side of the Turkish-Syrian border. He aimed to use it to resettle Syrian refugees currently in Turkey. Erdogan has more or less annexed all the areas he has overrun. They are now governed by Turkey-backed local councils, use the Turkish lira as currency, and are heavily influenced by Turkish infrastructure projects, including schools, hospitals, and post offices. Turkey, a long-time supporter of the rebel movement that overthrew the dictatorial regime of Bashar al-Assad – the HTS (Hayat Tahrir al-Sham) – now has strong political influence with its leader, Ahmed al-Sharaa. Erdogan no doubt hopes to use it to control his perennial Kurdish problem by continuing to occupy the swaths of Syria that he has overrun. But despite his dominant political position in post-Assad Syria, it is far from certain that he will be able to do so. Al-Sharaa’s intentions regarding minorities in general, and the Kurds in particular, are still very unclear. Ever since the fall of the Assad regime al-Sharaa has presented a moderate face to the world, consistently declaring that he intends to be as inclusive as possible in establishing Syria’s new governance. In short, he may not endorse the continued occupation by Turkey of large areas of sovereign Syria. Moreover he has said several times that Kurds are 'part of the Syrian homeland' while assuring the nation that 'there will be no injustice'. If any ethnic group deserves justice, it is the Kurds. Once upon a time, many thousands of years ago, a proud and independent nation lived and thrived in its own land in the heart of the Middle East. Subject to many foreign invasions, this ethnically distinct people refused to be integrated with their various conquerors, but retained their individual culture. At the start of the First World War, their country was a small part of the Ottoman empire. In shaping the future Middle East after the war the Allied powers, especially Britain, promised to act as guarantors of this people’s freedom. That promise was subsequently broken. Similar though this sounds to the story of the Jewish people, it is in fact the broad outline of the long, convoluted and unresolved history of the Kurds. The Kurds – nearly 35 million strong – are the largest stateless nation in the world. Historically they inhabited a distinct geographical area flanked by mountain ranges, once referred to as Kurdistan. No such location is depicted on current maps, for the old Kurdistan now falls within the sovereign space of four separate states: Turkey, Iraq, Iran and Syria. Most Kurds – some 25 million – live within Turkey’s borders, there are 2 million in Syria, while within Iraq the 5 million Kurds have developed a near autonomous state. Nearly 7 million Kurds are trapped inside Iran’s extremist Shi’ite regime. The Treaty of Sèvres, marking the fall of the Ottoman Empire after the First World War, stipulated a referendum to decide the issue of the Kurdistan homeland. That referendum never took place, and the Sèvres treaty itself was rendered null and void in 1922 by the establishment of the Turkish Republic under Kemal Ataturk. What followed was a new treaty, the Treaty of Lausanne, which gave control of the then Kurdistan homeland to the new republic. With a stroke of the colonial pen over 20 million Kurds were declared Turkish. Kurdish autonomy achieved its greatest recognition in the 2005 Iraqi constitution, which established the Kurdistan Region as a federal entity within Iraq, with its own local government and legal framework. The Kurds in Syria will be well aware of that. Nor will they forget that something akin to it was actually offered to them by the Assad regime. In March 2015 the then Syrian information minister announced that the government was considering recognizing Kurdish autonomy 'within the law and constitution.' Later, in September 2017, Syria's then foreign minister stated that Damascus would consider granting Kurds greater autonomy once ISIS was defeated. Events overtook these aspirations, and nothing of the sort materialized. But they might provide al-Sharaa with a template for a future accommodation with the Kurds within the constitution of a unified and restored Syrian state. Much though Erdogan might deplore the effect on Turkey’s domestic political scene, he may yet see an autonomous Kurdish region recognized within a new Syrian constitution, and even, eventually, some form of alliance between that and the Kurdistan Region of Iraq.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWcqmplb-haareJoQqQNI1GC	2025-01-17T16:16:23-08:00	
Achieving Peace In A Warmonger’s World – OpEd	By George Ford Smith Peace on earth is a wish that gets extra emphasis this time of year. We’re told to pray for it, wish for it, keep it forever in our minds. So why don’t we have it? The short answer is money. War is profitable to some. It’s profitable enough that profiteers in private industries influence government, which stays home and orders others to do the fighting. War costs money. Where does the government get it? Visible taxes (income, corporate, and payroll) cover about two-thirds of government revenue. The rest comes from borrowing and inflation. In the US, the central banking cartel known as the Fed stands ready to fund almost anything the government wants, especially wars. The Fed does this by creating money from nothing and buys government debt instruments, the accounting name for which is 'assets.' The destruction of the dollar is the residue from the 'asset'-buying sprees of the Fed’s Federal Open Market Committee, an operation which its members and most of the economics profession insist is necessary for a prosperous economy—and to keep the bad guys at bay in obscure places on the planet. Government can’t supply bombs to proxy warlords using tax money alone. Outlays in the hundreds of billions must be stolen surreptitiously, which is why government created a central bank and a bought-and-paid-for economics profession. No matter the propaganda spewed by its lapdog media, taxpayers will eventually make the connection between war and a cheaper dollar. History and theory prove we don’t need a committee cranking up the money supply to make the price of money more appealing, that on a free market increases in the money supply come about from the usual profit and loss forces. A miner brings money to the market as a hat maker brings hats, neither one violating anyone’s property rights. But a committee such as the FOMC doesn’t go mining à la the Seven Dwarfs to bring something people want to the market. That’s way too restrictive. Far better to create the money as a child would while playing make believe. The Fed—as the federally-certified monopoly counterfeiter—performs the child’s magic. In doing so, it steals wealth. Nothing is exchanged for something. Surely, I must be wrong To suggest the economics profession supports a monopoly counterfeiting operation to run the economy is too ludicrous to accept. It would mean the government works against our interests. It would mean government is our enemy. There must be more to the story. There has to be. Allow me to quote directly from a primary source, in this case one of the most controversial federal reserve chairmen in recent history. Ben Bernanke, chairman from 2006 to 2014, summa cum laude at Harvard, PhD at MIT, Time Person of the Year in 2009, awarded the Nobel Prize in Economic Science in 2022, and now serving as an economist for the Brookings Institution and advisor for the financial services firm Citadel—made this speech before the National Economists Club in Washington, DC on November 21, 2002, which he entitled Making Sure 'It' Doesn’t Happen Here. You might want to read this passage twice, as it’s so off-the-wall your inner economist might find it impossible to digest: [T]he US government has a technology, called a printing press (or, today, its electronic equivalent), that allows it to produce as many U.S. dollars as it wishes at essentially no cost. By increasing the number of US dollars in circulation, or even by credibly threatening to do so, the US government can also reduce the value of a dollar in terms of goods and services, which is equivalent to raising the prices in dollars of those goods and services. We conclude that, under a paper-money system, a determined government can always generate higher spending and hence positive inflation. 'Of course,' he continues, 'the US government is not going to print money and distribute it willy-nilly...' He’s right. The government—or the Fed as its assigned counterfeiter—ensures that 'Willy' doesn’t get the newly-printed money until much later, after it’s circulated through the economy and put upward pressure on prices and downward pressure on Willy’s real wages, sucking the purchasing power from his wallet. The first ones to get the new money benefit because it arrives immediately, too soon to affect price levels. Call them 'the favored few.' Call them 'connected.' Call it the government. Call this the Cantillon Effect, and see Jonathan Newman’s graphical expression of the subterfuge in four charts. The 'It' in Bernanke’s title refers to 'the danger of deflation, or falling prices.' Since deflation increases the purchasing power of the monetary unit, it’s puzzling that an economist of Bernanke’s stature would find that objectionable. Moore’s Law has been a deflationary phenomenon since it was first identified in 1965—thirty-seven years before Bernanke’s speech—and has led to the proliferation of tech throughout the economy. Among other things, it has meant businesses and individuals can buy more for less—certainly a key indicator of prosperity. And he regards this as a danger? But he later expands his definition of deflation to mean 'a general decline in prices, with emphasis on the word ‘general.’' Using his general understanding he says: The sources of deflation are not a mystery. Deflation is in almost all cases a side effect of a collapse of aggregate demand—a drop in spending so severe that producers must cut prices on an ongoing basis in order to find buyers. The economy-wide aggregates Bernanke describes are an instance of 'credit expansion and its tampering with the free-market rate of interest,' Rothbard explains. Projects thought to be profitable turn out not to match consumer demands. Thus, we see firms slashing prices to save themselves. The cure is not deficit spending, but to let the free market breathe, 'to make most efficient use of the existing stock of capital.' Since an inflation-driven economy benefits debtors at the expense of creditors, but debtors will sleep better knowing Bernanke and his subsequent replacements are certified fiat-money inflationists making sure 'It' never, ever happens here. For details, see the BLS inflation calculator. Conclusion Because deflation is considered a monetary failure, we get perpetual inflation instead, which is just what a belligerent government needs. Deflation in an economy using sound money is a natural result of competition and improved methods of production. The latter part of the 19th century, even with a government-controlled gold standard, blossomed in blessed deflation. While no era of US history was free of conflicts, the period following Reconstruction—when the income tax and the Fed were yet to intrude on our lives, thus limiting government revenue—was one of the most peaceful ever. We should never feed an institution that thrives on war. End the Fed. End the income tax. Starve the beast.

West Must Take Five Steps Now To Encourage Members Of Russian Eli...	Between 1953 and 1990, more than 1200 members of the Soviet elite fled abroad, individual actions that Western governments supported because they calculated that this would weaken the communist regime in Moscow, Aaron Lea and Borukh Taskin say. But under Putin, almost no members of the elite have fled. While most of the reasons for that are to be found inside Russia and the special relationship its elites have with the regime, at least some reflect a change in attitude in Western countries which no longer encourage such cases of flight even though that would weaken Putin and thus serve their interests (themoscowtimes.com/2025/01/14/why-arent-russias-elites-fleeing-putin-a87612). The two international experts on Russian elites suggest that Western countries should take five steps now in order to lead more members of the elites in Russia to conclude that they would be welcome in the West and could continue their careers there while waiting for regime change in Moscow. Those five steps include: • First of all, 'the West must construct policies that support the freedom of Russians to seek sanctuary in the West rather than continuing to exist in criminal Russia.' That will require political will as 'the world changes too quickly to wait for the bureaucracy. • Second, they suggest, 'mechanisms should be created to integrate Russian elites who have left for the West into the daily agenda of the coalition countries,' including ensuring that they will be able to keep part of any capital they bring out with them. • Third, 'a large number of NGOs, charitable foundations, think tanks, mass media and high-tech startups where Russian emigres can find employment as board members, sponsors, supervisory board members, consultants, etc., should be created.' • Fourth, 'we should consider involving carefully selected high-class managers and investors from Russia in the formation of at least investments, crypto-asset circulation and fiat cross-border payments betwwoeldgeeen the countries they have chosen to live in.' • And fifth, 'a NATO-monitored integration service should be created for the departed sisloviki and others with sensitive knowledge.' 'We believe there is a significant potential for splitting Putin's elites, creating conditions for their flight from Russia and integration into Western civilization and subsequent return to a future democratic Russia. This window of opportunity will not always exist and the mechanisms supporting such a split must be discussed at the highest levels and created now,' Lea and Taskin say. Moreover, they argue in conclusion, 'if this is not done immediately, Russia’s elites, driven behind the new Iron Curtain on both sides, will continue to support Putin's power from within. Proposals aimed at dividing and fragmenting the Russian establishment … will not have the desired effect.'	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWcqmplb-haarccdm6MKbHbC	2025-01-17T16:13:17-08:00	
Zuckerberg Is Removing Fact-Checkers: Did He Just Have A Change O...	By Peter Jacobsen Meta, Facebook and Instagram’s parent company, recently made a big announcement: the platforms are going to stop fact-checking user posts. Instead, Meta will be moving to a community-driven system (similar to X’s 'community notes'). The move represents an about-face for Zuckerberg. In early 2018, Zuckerberg voluntarily testified before Congress to apologetically discuss Facebook’s role in spreading Russian disinformation. It was around this time that Facebook rolled out fact-checks. Meta’s fact-checking was subject to scrutiny within months of its implementation. Much of the scrutiny has stemmed from Meta getting fact-checks wrong on several major issues over the last few years, including the Covid-19 lab-leak theory and the Hunter Biden laptop scandal. In his testimony, he went so far as to say, 'The most important thing I care about right now is making sure no one interferes in the various 2018 elections around the world.' When asked whether he would support new regulations, he said he would if they were 'the right regulations.' In 2020, Zuckerberg donated over $400 million to election nonprofits such as the Center for Tech and Civic Life to ensure 'election integrity.' So why the change? Why is Meta changing from a fact-checking hall monitor to a hands-off bystander? Rent Extraction, Regulatory Capture, and Fact-Checking After the 2016 election, Trump’s victory was considered an aberration. His narrow victory and the now-debunked Russian collusion narrative dominated major outlets. Many Democrats blamed Facebook for the loss. They argued that voters had been swayed by Russian-funded propaganda spread on Facebook. Clinton herself took to The Rachel Maddow Showto scold Facebook for its role in spreading 'disinformation.' As the 2018 midterms approached, the mainstream media took aim at Facebook for being the cause of Trump’s 2016 win. One article from the New York Times used a meme of Jesus and the Devil arm-wrestling as their top example of Russian-paid disinformation. Was the meme paid for by Russians trying to sow discontent? It seems like it. Did a meme of Jesus and the Devil arm-wrestling cost Clinton the election? I’ll let you answer that. Regardless, Zuckerberg was clearly feeling the heat and began trying to work with Democrats to stop the apparent misinformation problem on Facebook. Why would Zuckerberg go from ridiculing the disinformation charges to spending millions to ensure election integrity? One possibility is that he changed his mind, but I think there’s a more likely answer. Zuckerberg was concerned that Democrats’ rhetoric against him would turn into retaliatory regulation, so he gave money and lip service to Democratic efforts. When politicians use their power to threaten companies into doing things that benefit them or their party, economists call their actions rent extraction. There’s a second force at play here. If Zuckerberg agreed to cooperate with regulators, there is a chance he, or his team, could be involved in writing the regulations. Politicians aren’t exactly tech-savvy, which means they need to rely on experts to help create regulations. Oftentimes, the best experts are industry insiders like Zuckerberg and his employees. When industry leaders can write regulations for their own businesses—inevitably in ways that favor those businesses—economists call this regulatory capture. So, by pivoting toward concern about disinformation, Zuckerberg was able to avoid retaliatory regulation and position himself to write new regulations. Rent extraction and regulatory capture explain the pivot. By 2021, Zuckerberg had gone from election-theft-enabler to savior of the 2020 election. All it cost was incorrectly fact-checking user claims and hundreds of millions of dollars. Tech and the Triumph of Trump Trump’s 2024 win struck a different chord. Unlike 2016, Trump got more of the popular vote than the Democrats, and there’s been very little talk of Russian campaigns to upend the election. One tech giant, Elon Musk, bet big on Trump and won. Elon’s support of Trump was a risky move that certainly would’ve come back to bite him if Trump lost. Tech CEOs have noticed the changing tides, and are responding. Apple, Meta, Amazon, and OpenAI have donated $1 million each to Trump’s inauguration. To be blunt, it looks like a new sheriff’s in town. Trump’s relationship with Musk, his new friendly view of TikTok (which he credits his son Barron for), and his support of H-1B visas (a major supply of tech-industry labor) highlight his friendly relationship with the industry. It’s unsurprising that Zuckerberg is trying to jump on the same bandwagon. The community notes system, although not immune to error, is not viewed as censorship in the same way Meta’s fact-checking system was. Zuckerberg maintains that the timing of these changes is coincidental in a recent Joe Rogan interview, but there are two problems with taking this at face value. One, talk is cheap. Making ideological changes for cynical reasons tends not to sit well with people. Secondarily, it’s possible that Zuckerberg is the type of person who acts in accordance with beneficial trends without even realizing it himself. Being business-savvy as a second nature may mean Zuckerberg can make otherwise calculated decisions using heuristics which themselves are more complicated than he realizes. With Democrats firmly out of the halls of power, Zuckerberg no longer feels the heat of rent extraction, and it makes more sense to saddle up with the GOP if he wants to be on the ground floor of tech regulations. As a result, Meta is killing its fact-checking. It’s also important to note how other factors may be influencing this decision. For example, international controversies (such as the war in Gaza) likely make the system more expensive as more sites with variable languages need to be assessed. Overall, supporters of free speech can be happy about this, but they should be careful to recognize that Meta’s decision (and perhaps Zuckerberg’s libertarian turn in general) is probably the result of cold political calculations rather than changed minds and hearts.

United States In 2025: Social Problems Denied Via Rhetorics Of Re...	Societies survive and grow when they successfully navigate their contradictions. Eventually, however, accumulating contradictions overwhelm existing means of navigating them. Then social problems arise that persist or worsen inside such societies because they are unsuccessfully navigated or go unattended. Sometimes, the dominant conscious reaction to such social problems is denial, a refusal to see them. Denial of internal social problems displaces navigating the contradictions that cause them. The resulting social decline, like the set of internal contradictions it reflects, is denied and ignored. Instead, narratives or rhetorics can arise that position such societies as victims of abuse by foreigners. The United States in 2025 illustrates this process: its rhetorics of refusal aim to end its victimization. In today's United States, one such rhetoric refuses to allow continued abuse by foreigners 'threatening our national security.' This rhetoric blames bad U.S. political leadership for its failure to put America first and thereby make it great again. Another rhetoric demands that 'we' refuse to allow 'our democracy' to be destroyed by foreign enemies (and their domestic equivalents): people who are said to hate, not understand, or undervalue 'our democracy.' Still another rhetoric of refusal sees foreigners 'cheating' the United States in trade and migration processes. Most Americans embrace one or more of such rhetorics. Yet, as we propose to show here, such rhetorics are ever less effective. One reactionary rhetoric, Trump's, gestures toward former greatness by literally renewing American imperialism. He threatens to retake the Panama Canal, change Canada into the 51st of the United States, conquer Greenland from Denmark, and possibly invade Mexico. All those foreigners are said to threaten national security or else 'cheat' the United States. Trump's typical bloviating aside, this is remarkable expansionism. Such repeated colonialist gestures feed broader notions of making America greater again. Colonialism repeatedly helped European capitalism navigate its internal contradictions (temporarily escaping the social problems it caused). Eventually, however, it could no longer do so. After World War II, anti-colonialism limited that escape. The subsequent European neo-colonialisms and the informal colonialism of the American empire had shorter life spans. China and the rest of the BRICS countries are now everywhere closing that escape. Hence the frustrated rage of Trump's insistence on refusing that ending by deliberately reopening the idea of an escape hatch of colonial expansions. It resembles Netanyahu's idea (if not yet his violence) in trying to reopen that hatch for Israel by driving Palestinians out of Gaza. United States support for Netanyahu likewise associates the U.S. with colonialist violence in a world overwhelmingly committed to end colonialism and its unwanted legacy. The United States boasts the world's strongest military establishment. The dominant rhetoric in the United States casts everything it does as self-defense necessitated by foreign enemies. That justifies the government spending much more on defense than on the few internal social problems that rhetoric even recognizes. Yet the United States lost the wars in Vietnam, Afghanistan, Iraq, and now Ukraine, and these countries' military establishments were far from the world's strongest. It turns out that the proliferation of nuclear weapons and technical competition among nuclear powers have changed military balances around the world. The United States' gross underestimates of Russia's warfare capacities in 2022 illustrate the change very dramatically. They also illustrate that a rhetoric stressing a refusal to be victimized by foreign militaries undercut or displaced sober analyses of a militarily changed world. Now the world observes not only changed global military configurations but also the costly denials of them by U.S. leaders. Political and economic leaders everywhere else are now rethinking their strategies accordingly. Rhetorics of refusal to be victimized can become self-destructive. Another reason those leaders are redesigning their growth plans follows from the intertwined declines of the U.S. empire and the U.S. capitalist system. What U.S. leaders deny, many foreign leaders have incentives to see, evaluate, and take advantage of. The BRICS members (9) and partners (9), as of January 2025, account for nearly half the world's population and 41 percent of the world's GDP (in purchasing power parity terms). Four other nations have been invited and are likely to join in 2025: Vietnam, Turkey, Algeria, and Nigeria. Indonesia just joined as a full BRICS partner adding its roughly 280 million population. In contrast, the G7—the world's second-largest economic bloc—accounts for about 10 percent of the world's population and 30 percent of its GDP (also in purchasing power parity terms). Moreover, as data from the International Monetary Fund documents, recent years show a widening gap between the annual GDP growth rates of the G7-leading United States and the BRICS-leading China and India. Across the history of capitalism from its earlier times in England through the American empire's peak early in the 21st century, most nations focused chiefly on the G7 in strategizing economic growth, debt, trade, investments, currency exchange rates, and balances of payments. Large- and medium-sized enterprises did likewise. Yet over the last 15–20 years, countries and enterprises have faced an altogether new, different global situation. China, India, and the rest of the BRICS countries offer an alternative possible focus. Everyone can now play the two blocs off against one another. Moreover, in this play, the BRICS now hold better, richer cards than the G7. Rhetorics of refusal spin these changes in the world economy as the evil intentions of foreign others—who likely hate democracy. The United States should righteously refuse and thereby frustrate those intentions, they argue. In contrast, far less attention is paid to how internal U.S. social problems both shape and are shaped by a changing global economy. The changing world economy and the relative decline of the G7 within it have turned U.S. capitalism away from neoliberal globalization toward economic nationalism. Tariffs, trade wars, and 'America first' ideological pronouncements are concurrent forms of such turning inward. Another form is the call to bring parts of the outside of the United States inside: Trump's unsubtle imperialistic threats directed at Canada, Mexico, Denmark, and Panama. Yet another form is the advisory many major U.S. colleges and universities are sending to enrolled students from other countries (over a million last year). It suggests they consider the likelihood of great visa difficulties in completing their degrees amid increasing U.S. government hostility toward foreigners. A reduced foreign student presence will undercut U.S. influence abroad for years to come (much as it fostered that influence in the past). U.S. higher education institutions, already facing serious financial difficulties, will find them deepening as paying foreign students choose other nations for their degrees. 'America first' rhetoric risks the self-destruction of the United States' global position. Politically, the U.S. strategy since World War II was to contain perceived foreign threats by a combination of 'hard' and 'soft' power. They would enable the United States to eliminate communism, socialism, and, after the Soviet implosion of 1989, terrorism, wherever possible, overtly or covertly. Hard power would be deployed by the U.S. military via hundreds of foreign military bases surrounding nations perceived to be threatening and via invasions if, when, and where deemed necessary. Hard power also took the form of implicit threats of nuclear warfare (made credible by the U.S. atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki) and by total U.S. arms race expenditures on nuclear and non-nuclear weapons that no other countries, alone or in groups, could match. 'Soft power' would serve globally to project particular definitions of democracy, civil liberties, higher education, scientific achievement, and popular culture. These definitions were presented as best and most exemplified by what actually existed in the United States. In this way, the United States could be exalted as the global peak of civilized human achievement: a kind of partner discourse to other discourses that denied internal social problems. Enemies could then readily be demonized as inferior. U.S. soft power was and remains a kind of political advertising. The usual commercial advertiser promotes only everything positive (real or plausible) about his client's product. Typically, everything negative (real or plausible) is associated by that same advertiser only with his client's competitor's product. One might call this 'advertising communication.' In the 20th century's Cold War, U.S. soft power entailed an application of advertising communication where the United States and its supporters, public and private, functioned as both client and advertiser. The United States advertised itself as 'democracy' and the USSR as its negative opposite or 'dictatorship.' Cold War advertising communication continues today in the slightly changed form of 'democracy' versus 'authoritarianism.' But like advertising, after too many repetitions its influence lessens. Unfortunately for the United States, economic problems now besetting its capitalist system—both those caused by accumulated internal contradictions and those caused by its declining position within the world economy—directly undercut its soft power projections. Brandishing tariffs and repeatedly threatening to increase them reflect the need for governmental protection for decreasingly competitive U.S.-based firms. U.S. rhetorics that instead blame foreigners for 'cheating' sound increasingly hollow. Deporting millions of immigrants signals an economy no longer strong and growing enough to absorb them productively (what once 'made America great' and showed that greatness to the world). U.S. rhetorics denouncing 'foreign invasions' of immigrants encounter growing skepticism and even ridicule inside as well as outside the United States. The gross inequality of wealth and income in the United States and the global exposure of billionaires' power over government (Musk over Trump, CEOs donating millions of dollars to Trump's inauguration celebration) replace perceptions of the United States as exceptional in its vast middle class. The record levels of government, corporate, and household debt alongside abundant signs that such indebtedness is worsening do not help project the United States as an economic model. The year 2024's experience with a dominant U.S. strategy denying social problems while rhetorically stressing the dangers of evil foreign forces suggests it may be approaching exhaustion. The year 2025 may then provide conditions for a profound challenge to that strategy matching the challenges confronting the global position of U.S. capitalism. About the author: Richard D.

Required Reading: Hillbilly Elegy – OpEd	I doubt that many progressives in the United States have read J.D. Vance’s Hillbilly Elegy. Being based in the Philippines, a country located on the outer fringes of the empire, I certainly was unaware of the book even when it began to rise on the bestsellers’ lists at the beginning of the first Trump administration. But since the author is likely to become president if something happens to Donald Trump, I figured I would choose for my airport reading the book that made his name and skip the reviews that have revisited it ever since he was nominated to be Trump’s running mate last August. I was not prepared for how well-written it was. And as a sociologist, I really appreciated how Vance articulates the contradictions of the white working class in the Rust Belt Midwest and Appalachian region as he personally experienced them. This is an 'us' versus 'them' narrative by someone who finally got to become one of 'them.' He vividly recounts his hurdling the many visible (being poor) and invisible (cultural) barriers that separate the working class from the upper and upper-middle classes. They really are worlds apart, in Vance’s view, and he attributes his being able to finally cross class lines to four things: luck, a grandmother that forced him to develop the grit to rise above his surroundings, his stint in the Marine Corps, and an upper-middle-class wife, who initiated him into what was an alien, stable, upper-middle-class family life. The excruciating combination of poverty, drugs, violence, and disorganized family life represented by a mother who’s an addict and floats from one man to the next are, he claims, common elements of a working-class culture that prevents the vast majority of his proletarian peers from leaving their milieu. When Vance enters law school at Yale, despite his having graduated summa cum laude at Ohio State, he is completely at sea in an alien culture. The way people act is different, the way they speak is different, they are completely confident, not suffering the psychological injuries of working-class life. To him, there is really no such thing as meritocracy for the rich or nearly rich. While working class folks have to fill out forms that allow those in institutions to which they apply to see if they are 'qualified,' the kids at Yale, Harvard, and other Ivy League haunts rely on their parents’ networks to get them into college and a good career that serves as a channel to the summits of business and government. The two tracks begin at birth and they increasingly diverge and go separate ways as people pass through life, one leading to permanent working-class misery, the other to upper-class nirvana. Interestingly, Barack Obama, the president when Vance was writing the book, becomes the representative of 'them,' and here it is worth quoting Vance: Obama, he writes, 'feels like an alien to many Middletonians for reasons that have nothing to do with skin color [a dubious proposition]. Recall that none of my high school classmates attended an Ivy League school. Barack Obama attended two of them and excelled at both. He is brilliant, wealthy, and speaks like a constitutional law professor…Nothing about him bears any resemblance to the people I admired growing up. His accent—clean, perfect, neutral—is foreign; his credentials are so impressive that they’re frightening; he made his life in Chicago, a dense American metropolis; and he conducts himself with a confidence that comes from knowing that the modern American meritocracy was built for him.' The problem, Vance writes, was that Obama’s coming across as so completely alien to the white working class became fodder for conspiracy theorists like Donald Trump (not named as one such theorist in the book) to depict him as a genuine alien. Although the mainstream press (even Fox News, he claims) always said Obama was a red-blooded American, this was of little relevance since most of the white working class feels that the media is in the pocket of the rich and increasingly rely on far-right echo chambers on the Internet. Vance did not vote for Trump in the 2016 elections, but 'despite all the reservations about Donald Trump…there were parts of his candidacy that really spoke to me: from his disdain for the ‘elites’ and criticism of foreign policy blunders in Iraq and Afghanistan to his recognition that the Republican Party had done too little for its increasingly working- and middle-class base. Vance eventually became part of the MAGA movement that captured the Republican Party and drove traditional Republicans like former vice president Dick Cheney from the fold. His move from being a discontented young Republican to MAGA chieftain exemplifies a trend that Thomas Piketty captures in hard numbers in his book Capital and Ideology: that both the highly paid and wealthy 'merchant right' traditionally represented in the Republican Party and the highly educated and economically well compensated 'Brahmin left' that affiliated with the Democratic Party are seen from below as one 'elite' with interests radically different from theirs. After capturing the Republican Party, Trump, Vance, and MAGA overwhelmed the other wing of the elite, the Democrats, in the 2024 elections. Vance has, of course, evolved since he wrote the book into a firebreathing, fearmongering Trumpista. But sometimes Vance, the thoughtful author of Hillbilly Elegy, emerges, as when he and Tim Walz engaged in relatively respectful exchange during the vice presidential debate. For a friend who read Hillbilly Elegy when it first came out, it was hard to reconcile the early Vance that she claims wrote 'honestly' about his troubled family history and the later demagogical Vance. I think there is no Chinese wall between the early Vance and the current Vance. The way I read it, three contradictions run through Hillbilly Elegy. One is love for the solidarity of the working-class family and community and fear and anger at the multiple dysfunctions that pockmark them. The second is visceral suspicion and disdain for elite culture with a grudging recognition that 'they' live much better lives and 'are beating us in our own damned game.' The third is a yearning for the patriotism of the Saving Private Ryan type (Vance admits he 'tears up' every time he sees the movie) and a realization that there is little in a contemporary America that is falling apart that can foster that nationalistic fire. These were troubling contradictions that were seeking both a personal and a political resolution, and although he was initially dismissive of Trump, the latter eventually provided for him, as for many, that resolution—one that was, of course, facilitated by a not small dose of political opportunism on the part of an ambitious, up-and-coming politico. But it is important not to see it, as many liberals do, as simply as a case of opportunism. At the risk of oversimplifying, I think what makes MAGA so appealing to many in the white working class is that, however flawed some of its premises are, it promises to bring about a 'reinvigorated' and 'renewed' America free of these contradictions. And it is a movement that thrives not only on resentment but on hope, no matter how misplaced that hope may be when it comes to who is seen to represent it. Reading the wrenching personal experiences Vance relates in Hillbilly Elegy gave me a sense that MAGA is more than a far-right political movement. It is one of those millenarian movements that anthropologists talk about that tie individual redemption to collective salvation. I would say that under the principle that one must know thine enemy, Hillbilly Elegy must be required reading for American progressives, for it provides important insights for the massive task of reconstructing the broad left after the 2024 catastrophe.

It Wasn’t Just Flawed Forecasts, Dishonesty Has Also Hurt Economi...	Ben Casselman has an interesting piece in the New York Times about how economists have lost standing with both politicians and the public at large. While he attributes the profession’s problem to flawed forecasts and arcane language, I would argue the problems go much deeper. There has been a significant lack of honesty in important areas that have had a huge impact on people’s lives. The two areas I would highlight are trade and the bailouts in the financial crisis. The Trade Coverup The story with trade runs deep. As Casselman tells us, economists all like to claim that they are proponents of 'free trade.' But there are two points here that economists tend to give short-shrift or no shrift. The first is that trade has losers. That is not left-wing jargon, that is basic economic theory. Paul Samuelson, arguably the country’s most influential economist ever, co-authored a famous piece on trade theory making this point more than eighty years ago. In this piece, Samuelson made the case that in a country with a large amount of skilled labor (e.g. college-educated) relative to the rest of the world, and a small amount of less-skilled labor (non-college educated), less-skilled workers would be hurt by an opening of trade with developing countries. In other words, the loss of jobs and the downward pressure on the wages of manufacturing workers was not an unfortunate side-effect of recent trade deals, it was the point. While economists will occasionally acknowledge the fact that there are losers, they usually imply that this group is a small number of people who can easily be made whole with a limited amount of adjustment assistance. In reality, we are talking about millions of workers who actually lost their jobs and tens of millions more who saw lower wages. There are two simple graphs that display this handwaving by economists beautifully. The first is a graph showing the share of manufacturing workers in total employment. As can be seen there is a downward trend in the whole period from 1970, nothing special to see as the trade deficit exploded in the first decade of this century. The second graph shows a slightly different picture. It’s total manufacturing employment since 1970. In this graph we see cyclical ups and downs but relatively little change from 1970 to 1998. Then from the middle of 1998 to December of 2007 the economy lost almost 4 million manufacturing jobs, more than 20 percent of total employment. This is the period where the trade deficit exploded reaching a peak of almost 6 percent of GDP in 2006. (Note this is before the Great Recession.) Economists are less anxious to talk about this graph. When they do, they will generally say that the job loss was due to productivity growth and not trade. This line should get anyone fighting mad. They want us to believe that productivity growth cost us large numbers of jobs, coincidentally just when the trade deficit was exploding, but not in the decades before or the decades after? It’s fair to acknowledge that there have been benefits from trade. We can buy all sorts of goods at much lower prices because we import them from China and other developing countries, but it is just dishonest to try to deny there has been a huge cost to millions of workers. (Note: this effect is not reversible, contrary to what you hear from some prominent politicians.) That may sound bad, but it actually gets much worse. While the line is 'free trade,' the reality is quite different. Our doctors get paid more than twice as much on average as doctors in other rich countries, pocketing more than $350 thousand a year. If we got our doctors’ pay down to the average in places like France and Germany it would save us more than $100 billion a year in medical expenses ($1000 per family per year). This gap in pay persists because our 'free traders' apparently had little interest in promoting free trade in physicians’ services or the services of other highly paid professionals. The agenda was selective free trade. Free trade in manufactured goods, which had the predicted and actual effect of driving down the pay of manufacturing workers and non-college educated workers more generally, but preserving the protectionists barriers that sustained the high pay of highly educated workers. But wait, it gets worse. A major part of all the trade deals negotiated in the last four decades was longer and stronger patent and copyright protections, both for the United States and our trading partners. Patents and copyrights are government-granted monopolies, the complete opposite of free trade. How are these restrictions included in 'free trade' agreements? And there is a huge amount of money at stake. We will pay more than $650 billion this year for prescription drugs and other pharmaceutical products. We would likely pay around $150 billion if these items were sold in a free market without patent monopolies. The difference of $500 billion comes to around $4,000 per family per year. If we add in the cost of patent and copyright monopolies in other areas it is almost certainly well over $1 trillion a year. These monopolies also make some people very rich. Bill Gates has agreed to be the poster child for this point. Needless to say, most of the beneficiaries are not among the less-educated. To be clear, patents and copyrights, like all forms of protectionism, serve a purpose. They provide an incentive for innovation and creative work. But they are clearly not free trade and in any case, there are arguable better and cheaper ways to provide these incentives. But when we bless these monopolies as free trade, it is hard to even discuss alternatives. The Second Great Depression Myth and the Bank Bailouts After the collapse of the housing bubble the country faced its largest financial crisis since the Great Depression. Most of the country’s major banks were looking at bankruptcy. At this point, rather than letting the free market work its magic, the vast majority of the country’s leading economists were insisting that the government needed to bail out the banks. The alternative would be a Second Great Depression. This was a lie. There is little doubt that the recession would have been worse if we allowed the chain of bank collapses to continue, but how would this condemn us to a Second Great Depression, a decade of double-digit unemployment? Having dealt with the first Great Depression, we now know the secret for getting out of a depression: spend money. If the chain of bank collapses had continued the vast majority of people would have the vast majority of their bank accounts kept whole by the FDIC, taking care of the immediate problem of paying their bills. To reboot the economy, we just would need a large-scale stimulus package, think three or four 2009 Obama stimulus packages. This could take any form. We could spend more on things like health care, climate, and infrastructure or we could just send everyone $5,000 checks. To make Republicans happy, we could even put Donald Trump’s name on the checks. It is reasonable to argue that there would have been political obstacles to this sort of massive stimulus program. That is certainly possible, but that is a very different argument than saying the economics of a major bank collapse condemned us to a Second Great Depression. Rather this would be a case of economists making predictions about politics. It is also worth noting the large potential gains from a collapse of our major banks. We would have instantly downsized our incredibly bloated financial system, eliminating a huge amount of waste. This financial system is also the source of many of the country’s great fortunes. Again, economists were being dishonest in a way that benefited the rich. The Economists’ Missed Calls I won’t go into great lengths on the big misses of the last two decades. Failing to see the housing bubble and the wreckage that it would cause is to my mind a disastrous failure. We had an unprecedented run-up in nationwide housing prices at a time when rents were moving roughly in step with overall inflation. And the flood of dubious loans was hardly a secret, the industry was bragging about it. It also should not have been hard to recognize the bubble was driving the economy. Residential construction is ordinarily around 3.5 percent of GDP. It peaked at almost 6.0 percent in 2005. What would replace 2.5 percent of GDP in annual demand ($700 billion in today’s economy) if the bubble burst. And the bubble was also driving consumption as people were borrowing against their bubble generated home equity. In short, missing the bubble and the consequences of its collapse was a pretty huge mess-up. And of course, almost no economists faced any career consequences for this mistake. Everyone got a collective 'who could have known?' amnesty. The other big miss was failing to recognize how persistent the pandemic inflation would be. I am more sympathetic to this error, probably in part because I was a card-carrying member of Team Transitory. There is no doubt that inflation was more persistent than I and many others expected, but there were two major non-economic events that I at least did not anticipate. I was expecting that the pandemic would quickly be brought under control as most of this country and the world got vaccinated. I did not anticipate that there would be two further major waves (the delta strain and the omicron strain) which would lead to large-scale shutdowns both in the United States and elsewhere in the world. I also didn’t anticipate Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and the economic disruptions that followed. Would inflation have been more persistent than I originally expected in the absence of these events? Perhaps, but I don’t think it’s unreasonable to get at least a partial amnesty for not having foreseen these disasters. When It Comes to Economists, the Angry Masses Have a Case I realize and share the frustration of many economists when the public fails to understand simple economic principles. For example, I think a carbon tax, with a rebate for low and moderate-income households, is a great idea, but I recognize the politics are totally toxic. The understanding of a progressive marginal income tax is incredibly weak. Many people cannot conceptualize that raising Elon Musk’s taxes does not mean raising their taxes. But economists have seriously failed the public in important areas over the last three decades. And these failures played a role in fostering the upward redistribution of income over the last four decades. People have a right to be angry.

How Human Experience Makes Science Possible – Analysis	The striking paradox is that science tells us both that we're peripheral in the cosmic scheme of things and central to the reality we uncover. Unless we understand how this paradox arises and what it means, we will never be able to understand science as a human activity, and we will keep defaulting to the view that nature is something to gain mastery over. At the heart of science lies something we do not see that makes science possible, just as the blind spot lies at the heart of our visual field and makes seeing possible. In the visual blind spot sits the optic nerve; in the scientific blind spot sits direct experience—by which anything appears, shows up, or becomes available to us. It is a precondition of observation, investigation, exploration, measurement, and justification. Things appear and become available thanks to our bodies and their feeling and perceiving capacities. Direct experience is a bodily experience. 'The body is the vehicle of being in the world,' said French philosopher Maurice Merleau-Ponty, but as we will see, firsthand bodily experience lies hidden in the blind spot. Uncovering the blind spot can help to repair this rift and the larger split between science and lived experience. But beyond uncovering the blind spot, we also need to plumb the depths of the experiences it hides. The Fire This Time The blind spot worldview is like the air—invisible but all around us. We're given simple versions of it in high school science classes, and we see it as an unspoken background assumption in science documentaries. If you pursue a career in science, it often manifests like an invisible map marking your journey through introductory classes in physics, chemistry, and biology. Although sophisticated philosophical articulations of the ideas that make up what we call the 'blind spot worldview' have been made, the idea is so pervasive that it doesn't seem like philosophy at all to most people, including most scientists. Rather, people think it's just 'what science says.' Although the blind spot arises from and expresses a particular philosophical viewpoint, it isn't a theory. Instead, it's a broad perspective that encompasses many different problematic theories and ideas. These include opposed positions on various scientific and philosophical issues, so the ideas and theories it embraces don't always have to be consistent with each other. The blind spot worldview has a great impact as a social force that constrains people to think in certain prescribed ways about how science works, how human life fits into the biosphere of our planet Earth, and how the human mind relates to the cosmos. Furthermore, the development and deployment of science and its offspring technologies over the past four centuries have been inseparable from enhancing economic and military power, whether in capitalist or socialist countries. For these reasons, it's important to remember that the blind spot is like the air we breathe: it's a culturally ubiquitous mindset and not a constellation of abstruse philosophical ideas. Life in the Blind Spot Science has made extraordinary progress in understanding the molecular basis of life through the discoveries of DNA, RNA, and protein synthesis. Much of that progress has been based on applying the method of microreduction (analyzing a whole in terms of the properties of its parts). As a result, the blind spot perspective on life leans heavily on the metaphysics of reductionism (the idea that the properties of complex systems are determined exclusively by the properties of their parts). For reductionist metaphysics, life is nothing more than molecular machinery. This way of thinking is a case of surreptitious substitution, replacing a sometimes useful method with metaphysics. Life-as-machine metaphysics, however, is deeply flawed. The machine metaphor works only for parts abstracted from their context but not for self-producing and self-sustaining wholes. Organisms, as organized whole systems, produce themselves, repair themselves, and generally maintain themselves. 'Biological autonomy' is the name for this kind of systemic organization. A living system constantly constructs itself, thereby making itself distinct from its environment while altering it in ways that are conducive to its continuation. In other words, a living system possesses autonomy and agency: it produces, maintains, and regenerates the parts and processes that constitute its functioning as an integrated, self-governing whole (autonomy) while also promoting environmental conditions favorable to its existence and actively avoiding conditions that threaten it (agency). Autonomy and agency are what we need to investigate to understand how life differs from dissipative structures. Living Is Sensemaking in Precarious Conditions Autonomy and agency imply sensemaking. Organisms are sensemaking beings. They create worlds of relevance. They engage with environments that are structured by their actions and by what is relevant to their viability. Living beings partition their environments into things that have positive or negative value, or that are neutral, or have no significance at all, falling outside the sphere of significance. In (Francisco) Varela's words, 'living is sensemaking.' It's Complicated The 20th century gave birth to a new scientific project, the transdisciplinary science of the mind called cognitive science, which combines anthropology, artificial intelligence (AI), linguistics, neuroscience, philosophy, and psychology. Its relationship to the blind spot is complicated. On the one hand, cognitive science expands the blind spot into the field of the mind; on the other hand, it offers a unique opportunity to reveal and try to move beyond the blind spot. The history of cognitive science, particularly the central role AI has played in it, makes this ambiguity evident. One way we try to get around this problem is by reshaping our environment to make its structure as definite and well-defined as possible so that technologies like self-driving cars can fit into it accordingly. We may think we're making artificial systems that have genuine autonomy, but we're actually remaking our environment to fit the limitations of our nonautonomous devices, such as allowing self-driving cars to operate only in geo-fenced areas (geographical areas defined by a virtual boundary) with extensive supporting infrastructure. Our inability to see that we have been refashioning our lifeworld to support our devices rather than creating genuinely cognitive systems is a case of the blind spot. Another instance is our assumption that the everyday world consists of definite states that need to be computationally represented inside the head. From this perspective, the significance of research on unsupervised neural networks helps explain how cognition as sensemaking works in mobile and adaptive autonomous agents in a nonstationary and unexpected world (in contrast to a stationary and controlled world.) This perspective can help to uncover the blind spot by calling attention to how our concepts, classifications, and categories are not ready-made structures mirroring or found in a preexisting world, apart from our experience. Instead, they are enacted; they are brought forth by our perceptions, actions, and social practices. Tracing how this happens via the brain and the rest of the body is a central task of enactive cognitive science. Thus, on one hand, the enactive cognitive science offers ways to help move us beyond the blind spot, particularly in its computational form. On the other hand, when we turn away from this perspective, as seen in AI and machine learning, we fall back into the computational blind spot, confusing the map with the territory. A bird needs wings to fly, but flight isn't part of the wings. Flying is a relation between the whole animal and its environment. We need brains to perceive, but perceiving isn't contained in our brains. Perceiving is a relation between us and the world. Once we collapse the distinction between us and our brains, we create a false image of being trapped inside our heads, as if in a windowless room, having to guess what's going on outside and working only with the discrepancies between what we guess and the sounds we hear coming from the other side of the wall. But we're not inside our heads. We're not reducible to our brains. The brain is an organ of perception, not the perceiver. The perceiver is the whole person or animal geared into its world. The Blind Spot on a Planetary Scale Beginning in the early 20th century, a new scientific vision of the planet was slowly and painstakingly assembled. That vision saw Earth as more than a spherical rock harboring a thin and unimportant scruff of life on its outer edges. Instead, a suite of new conceptual tools created a perspective that saw the planet as a set of strongly coupled systems. One of these systems was the totality of life (the biosphere), which, in this new perspective, emerged as an essential player in planetary evolution. Earth was no longer the inert background stage that allowed the drama of life to unfold; life itself fed back into geological and atmospheric cycles, generating an ever-changing, mutually contingent, and complex interacting dynamic state. In short, planetary changes lead to life changes, and life changes lead to planetary changes, amplifying the autonomy and agency of living systems to planetary scales. The Anthropocene is a massive manifestation of the blind spot. It's the result of one particular and very recent version of the human civilization project: the originally modern European and now transnational scientific project of objectifying the world through scientific materialism. Ironically, the Anthropocene is also the starting point for a new scientific perspective on Earth that can help us move beyond the blind spot. Scientists now understand that the planet should be considered an integrated whole—a coupled set of systems constituting the atmosphere, hydrosphere (oceans), cryosphere (ice), lithosphere (rock), and biosphere. The inclusion of the biosphere represents a critical transition in scientific thinking. Life is understood as a key player in the entire evolutionary history of Earth. Science tells us that we human beings are peripheral in the cosmic scheme of things but also that we're central to the reality we uncover. We're a tiny contingent presence in a vast universe, yet our experience is ubiquitous in scientific knowledge. Instead of trying to avoid this paradox, we can and should embrace it. We're the authors of the scientific narrative and are characters within it. As authors, we create science. As characters in the narrative, we're a minuscule part of the immense cosmos. This is how we need to portray ourselves based on what we've discovered in cosmology and biology. Still, we should not forget that we are also the authors of the narrative. There are many ways in which the philosophical commitments of the blind spot are sold to the public as 'what science says.' It may take the form of science documentaries telling people they are nothing more than their so-called genetic programming (genes aren't programs, and they require the existence of whole organisms embedded in their ecosystems to be expressed). It may be science news articles that claim future generations will upload themselves to computers (your selfhood or personhood isn't a computational data structure). It may be public lectures or op-eds that claim physics has now answered the question of why there is something rather than nothing (this is not the kind of question science can answer). Such stories express a form of scientific triumphalism based on the blind spot. Indeed, the scientific triumphalism based on the blind spot is not a harmless exaggeration but a harmful overreach. It feeds the stereotype of the scientist as cold, emotionless, and not trustworthy (as a 2023 poll found). When blind spot ideas are presented to the public as facts that only the naive and uneducated would dispute, it is likely to exacerbate opposition to science in public policy debates (for example, climate change mitigation or vaccination). Instead of saying that science is a means for rising above the great, strange mystery of being human in the vast world, a better story is that science takes us deeper into that mystery, revealing new ways to experience it, delight in it, and, most of all, value it. By leaving behind the blind spot, we can properly understand the importance of objectivity as a means of public knowledge without transforming it into a dubious ontology.

Action Could Have Prevented The Deadly Blaze In Los Angeles – OpE...	John Goodman, Billy Crystal, Anthony Hopkins, and Jeff Bridges lost homes in the Los Angeles fires, and as Malibu resident Mel Gibson told reporters, 'I have never seen a place so perfectly burned. You could put it in an urn.' As all fire victims recently learned, '[H]omes, businesses, churches, schools and other structures that have been destroyed by the recent fires are exempt from Coastal Act permitting requirements.' That is the ruling of the California Coastal Commission (CCC), a powerful state agency with a curious history in regard to celebrities, property owners, and fires alike. The CCC traces its origin to the 1969 oil spill off Santa Barbara, but an event in September 1970 had more lasting significance. As the New York Times reported, '[A] massive brush fire, fanned by strong winds off the Mojave Desert, spread out of control northwest of Los Angeles today, driving men and animals before it.' The flames were 'swept along with almost explosive speed by the extremely dry northeast wind that Californians call a ‘Santa Ana,' in the region’s worst fire since 1961. The blaze forced evacuations in Topanga Canyon and threatened the Mullholland Canyon residence of Gov. Ronald Reagan, who declared a state of emergency. The blaze jumped the coast highway and 'the flames burned to the Pacific Ocean.' The 'Wright Fire' in Malibu Canyon killed ten people, destroyed 103 homes, and consumed 28,000 acres. Despite the death and destruction, state politicians continued to focus on the oil spill. Environmentalist Peter Douglas co-wrote Proposition 20, a 1972 ballot measure to create a temporary commission and authored the Coastal Act of 1976, which made the Commission permanent. The next year, Douglas became deputy director and in 1985 executive director of the agency he conceived. With this regulatory zealot at the helm, the unelected Commission rode roughshod over the property rights of coastal residents, who were not responsible for the oil spill. The CCC holds jurisdiction in an area extending up to five miles inland, 'and including coastal mountains.' The commission can require 'restoration of sites to native habitat' and opposes 'removal of major vegetation.' Residents of the coastal zone were not free to clear brush in times of fire, but regulations were not the commission’s only imposition. Assembly Speaker Willie Brown appointed Mark Nathanson, a wealthy businessman who had raised money for Brown’s campaign. Commissioner Nathanson set about extorting money from coastal residents seeking permits to remodel their beachfront homes. Nathanson pedaled permits for up to $734,000 and demanded $1.34 million more from applicants who refused to pay. They included Sylvester Stallone (Rocky, First Blood), who helped the FBI investigate the case. Nathan pleaded guilty to racketeering and drew a sentence of five years in prison. This scandal prompted no effort to scale back or eliminate the CCC, and the coastal fires continued. According to the Malibu Times, the area has averaged two fires every decade since 1929. The 1993 'Old Topanga Fire' caused three deaths and destroyed 369 homes. The 2007 'Canyon Fire' consumed 4,565 acres, destroyed six homes, and forced the evacuation of 2,100 residents. The pattern continued into the current decade. Last December, Dick Van Dyke, Cher, and Barbra Streisand joined thousands of Malibu residents fleeing a raging brush fire. That blaze failed to serve as a warning, even as Santa Ana winds kicked up. In the central valley on Jan. 6, 2025, Gov. Gavin Newsom attended a track-laying ceremony for California’s vaunted bullet train, according to UCLA economist Lee Ohanian a fantasy from the beginning that has no path to completion. On Jan. 4, 2025, with meteorologists warning that fire could spread to Los Angeles, Mayor Karen Bass flew to Ghana to attend an inauguration. The fires raged on claiming countless houses and killing, at this writing, 24 people. As high winds continue that count is sure to rise, but the LA fires are not the most deadly in recent history. That claim belongs to the 2023 Lahaina fire in Hawaii, with at least 102 people killed, 2,207 structures damaged or destroyed—86 percent residential—and property damage approaching $6 billion. Firebreaks had been left covered with dense and dry grasses, and overgrown vegetation made the whole area a tinderbox. Consistent action to reduce fire risk could have prevented the deadly blaze, but the lessons seem lost on California politicians and bureaucrats. For Jeff Bridges, Billy Crystal, Mel Gibson, and countless others, 2025 turned out to be The Year of Living Dangerously beyond all others.

The Possibility Of A War Against Iran – OpEd	In early January, most of the major military forces of Iran participated in a large military exercise called Payambar-e Azam (Great Prophet), which started as an annual exercise 19 years ago. These forces included the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) and the Basij Resistance Force, and took place in the air, on land, and in the sea. The exercises began in Iran’s western Kermanshah province, with the Mirza Kuchak Khan Brigade in the lead. Mirza Kuchak Khan (1880-1921) successfully led the Jangal (forest) Uprising in northern Iran in 1918 against the British and counter-revolutionary Tsarist forces. Then, after a triumph, he created the short-lived Socialist Republic of Gilan in June 1920 (which was eventually overthrown by the Shah’s forces in September 1921). That a brigade of forces in the Islamic Republic is named after this socialist warrior is interesting by itself, but not germane to the fact that these Special Forces are now playing a leading role in what appears to be military exercises for the defense of the Iranian state against a possible attack. The military exercises began on January 3, 2025, which is the fifth-year anniversary of the assassination by the United States of General Qasem Soleimani, the leader of the IRGC’s Quds Force. The Quds Force is responsible for Iranian military operations outside the boundaries of the country, including building what is called the ‘Axis of Resistance.’ The latter includes various pro-Iranian governments and non-governmental military forces (such as Hezbollah in Lebanon). Soleimani’s assassination was the start of a determined new political and military campaign by the United States, Israel, and their European allies to undermine Iran’s role in West Asia. Punctual strikes by Israel and the United States on Iranian logistical bases in Syria and Iraq weakened Iran’s force posture. Israel’s regular assassinations of IRGC military officers both in Syria and in Iran itself have also had an impact on the leadership of the Iranian military forces. Israel’s assassination of the Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah on September 27, 2024, and the Israeli and U.S.-assisted overthrow of the government of Bashar al-Assad in Syria on December 8, 2024, dented Iran’s strength across the Levant region (from the Turkish border to the Occupied Palestinian Territory) as well as along the plains from southern Syria to the Iranian border. Hezbollah’s new Secretary-General Naim Qassem admitted, 'Hezbollah has lost its military supply route through Syria.' In an interview published in the Financial Times on January 3, 2025, U.S. secretary of state Antony Blinken said that 'Iran is not in much of a position to pick a fight with anyone' given the strategic setbacks that it has faced in both Lebanon and Syria. The grand scale of Payambar-e Azam this year is intended to both lift the morale of the Iranian military forces and to send a message to Tel Aviv and Washington that Iran can and will defend itself from any direct attack on Iranian soil. Israel’s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu made a statement on December 14, 2024, that shows how Israel sees the situation regarding Iran: 'A year ago, I said we would change the face of the Mideast, and we’re indeed doing so. Syria is not the same Syria. Lebanon is not the same Lebanon. Gaza is not the same Gaza. And the head of the axis, Iran, is not the same Iran; it has also felt the might of our arm.' Netanyahu did not mention Yemen, whose government—led by Ansar Allah—continues to fire missiles at Israel and has shut down Israel’s only Red Sea port at Eilat. Israel and the United States have fired barrages of missiles at Yemen, but—like the Saudis before them—they are finding that the Yemenis are simply not backing down. Netanyahu also did not mention Iraq, where many of the forces close to the Assad government fled, and where the Iraqi militia groups remain intact. On January 5, at the commemoration of the assassination of both Soleimani and Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis, who was one of the leaders of Iraq’s Popular Mobilisation forces, Iraq’s Prime Minister Shia’ al-Sudani said that Iraq was prepared to respond to any 'potential aggression.' In other words, despite many setbacks to Iran (such as in Lebanon and Syria), the forces against the Western ideas for West Asia (such as in Yemen and Iraq) remain engaged. Israel continues to bombard the military bases of the Syrian army and of military units close to the Iran IRGC in Syria. Initially, these attacks and the Israeli invasion of Syria beyond the Golan Heights had been welcomed by the new government of Ahmed al-Sharaa (formerly the al-Qaeda leader Abu Mohammed al-Golani), since these attacks weakened Syria’s government of Bashar al-Assad. Now, the contradictions have begun to set in. Al-Sharaa, however much he is a Western, Turkish, and Israeli creation, is nonetheless forced to respond to these continued violations of Syrian sovereignty, which he started to do in a muted manner. He has asked Israel to stop attacking Syria but has also said that Syrian soil will not be used to attack Israel. In October 2024, Israeli military aircraft violated Iranian airspace and struck two Iranian weapons facilities, one in Parchin and the other in Khojir, both less than an hour’s drive from Tehran. Both facilities are known to be part of Iran’s missile development program. Hitting these hard, as far as Israel is concerned, was a way to damage Iran’s ability to make medium-range and long-range missiles. Israel claimed, as it was expected to, that these were nuclear weapons facilities, but Iran’s foreign minister Abbas Araghchi said in response, 'Iran is not after nuclear weapons, period.' On November 11, 2024, Israel’s defense minister Israel Katz had a meeting with his military’s General Staff. After the meeting, he said on X, 'Iran is more exposed than ever to strikes on its nuclear facilities. We have the opportunity to achieve our most important goal—to thwart and eliminate the existential threat to the State of Israel.' What Katz has announced publicly is that Israel is ready more aggressively to attack Iran, including launching a barrage of missiles at what it claims are nuclear weapons production sites, but which are, from Iran’s perspective, its research unit for nuclear power, its ballistic missile production lines, and its other weapon production units. This aggressive behavior from Katz comes because of what Israel sees as the weakness of Hamas and Hezbollah, and the lack of any credible forward deterrent from Iran (Israel has been striking Yemen hard to diminish the ability of Ansar Allah to fire its rockets at Israeli targets). The moment Israel feels that Iran has no way to retaliate against Israel, Tel Aviv—either with the United States directly or with U.S. backing—will launch a massive military attack on Iran. This is not a theoretical possibility as far as Iran is concerned, but an existential reality. At the Payambar-e Azam exercises, Iranian brigadier general Kioumars Heydari said something that is revelatory and true: 'Our country’s armed forces, especially the Army’s Ground Forces, will prevent whatever type of encroachment against our Islamic nation’s soil, by relying on national will and integrity.' Heydari’s statement, like that of other military leaders from Iran in recent weeks, suggests that they are anticipating a massive Israeli attack. His statement shows how the Iranian military is building a national consensus to defend their country if the strikes are followed by an attempt to change the government by force. There is a certainty that most of the Iranian population will rally against any infringement of their sovereignty. Even if 'Iran is not in a position to pick a fight with anyone,' as U.S. Secretary of State Blinken put it, Iran will not collapse before the combined might of the United States and Israel. Pride in Iranian independence and defiance against a repeat of the coup of 1953 are cemented into the Iranian consciousness. That is the meaning of Heydari’s statement. Iran, meanwhile, has announced that it is ready for peace talks (almost unreported in the Western press). The Western capitals have not responded.

Trump Already Concentrates Minds On Defense – Analysis	By Luke Coffey NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte addressed the European Parliament last week with a clear message: Europe isn’t spending enough on defense and the new US president will not like it. With Donald Trump’s return to the Oval Office, the issue of defense spending will once again become one of the top issues Europe must grapple with. In his first term, Trump emphasized the lack of defense spending by NATO’s European members and often criticized them for freeloading on the US. He even suggested, incorrectly, that European countries owed the US back payments, threatened to pull out of the alliance if they did not increase spending and even suggested that the US would not protect countries that did not meet spending targets. While Trump was not the first US president to raise concerns about European defense spending, he was certainly the most vocal and direct. NATO members are expected to allocate 2 percent of their annual gross domestic product to defense, a target set in 2006 during George W. Bush’s administration. In subsequent years, this benchmark was largely ignored. By 2014, when Russia invaded Crimea, only three alliance members met the target: the US, the UK, and Greece. That year, NATO reaffirmed its commitment to the 2 percent goal by 2024. A combination of Trump's rhetoric during his first term and Russia's increasingly aggressive behavior, culminating in the invasion of Ukraine in 2022, convinced Europeans to step up. At last year’s NATO summit, 23 out of 32 members met the benchmark. While some countries still fall short, significant progress cannot be denied. The failure of many European countries to meet the target is made worse because the definition of what can be counted toward the target is so broad. For example, members can include the amount spent on pensions for the military in the total: clearly this does not contribute to their military capabilities. A second Trump administration is likely to focus on China and security in the Pacific, expecting Europe to shoulder more of its regional security burden to enable the US to redirect its resources. This has reignited the defense spending debate across the continent: Rutte proposed raising the defense spending benchmark to 3 percent of GDP. Meanwhile Trump has suggested an even higher target of 5 percent. Whether this reflects a genuine goal or a negotiating tactic to aim high and settle somewhere in the middle remains unclear. Achieving it won’t be easy, even for the US. Among Trump's political base, a small but vocal movement opposes increased defense spending. This isolationist faction argues that if the US reduces its global involvement, a smaller defense budget would suffice. Currently, the US spends about 3.4 percent of GDP on defense, around $960 billion. Increasing this to 5 percent would amount to a defense budget of $1.4 trillion, a figure that seems unrealistic given the current political and economic climate in the US. While 5 percent may be impractical, it is clear that 2 percent is insufficient. Europeans are now scrambling to justify higher defense spending and new NATO targets, but skepticism persists. Why were calls for a 3 percent benchmark absent in 2022, after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine sparked Europe’s largest security crisis since the Second World War? It makes one believe that they are considering a higher spending benchmark only because Trump is back in office. In reality, defense spending should already have increased years ago. To give credit where it is due, countries bordering Russia have recognized the stakes and risen to the challenge. Latvia, Lithuania, Estonia, and Poland already spend more than 3 percent of GDP on defense. In Poland, there is a serious drive to increase it to 5 percent. Its defense minster said last week that Poland could be 'the transatlantic link between this challenge set by President Trump and its implementation in Europe.' The countries in the east need to help the Trump administration to persuade nations further from Russia, including major economies such as Spain, Germany, France, and Italy, to increase their defense investments. This will not be easy. Every US president grapples with the dilemma of European defense spending. If Europeans resist spending more, what can the US realistically do? The American and European economies are deeply intertwined. Together, North America and Europe account for half of the world’s economy. Europe is America’s largest export market, with 48 out of 50 US states exporting more to Europe than to China. This economic relationship relies on the stability and security provided by NATO, primarily provided by the US. Should America reduce its commitment to Europe, it could jeopardize the security of its largest export market, with eventual economic repercussions at home. This is an important, if inconvenient, point that the White House must consider when threatening to leave NATO. How the Trump administration addresses this matter will be relevant to other regions beyond Europe as well. Whether in the Middle East or East Asia, America’s partners should watch how the new administration engages with NATO allies. After all, these are some of the closest allies for the US in the world. If the US expects more burden-sharing and greater defense spending from them, there is no reason to suspect that other American allies around the globe will be let off the hook. It is time for America’s allies and partners around the world to start asking what more they can do for their own regional security. In his second and final term in office, Trump is unlikely to turn a blind eye. Luke Coffey is a senior fellow at the Hudson Institute.

How Archaeologists Can Solve The Earth’s ‘Wicked Problems’ – OpEd	We used to have 'balloon' debates in school: The hot-air balloon is losing height and, to avoid disaster, people must be jettisoned. To avoid this fate, everybody must justify why they should remain on board and their classmates then vote them 'on' or 'off.' In reality, the result was determined entirely by one's popularity. But perhaps this is always the case. In seeking to avoid funding cuts, for example, museums or cultural services are often considered easy targets, since archaeologists and heritage professionals are far less useful than doctors, engineers, or mathematicians. Beyond archaeology itself, cultural heritage has few friends, one might argue. But I present the argument that far from being the irrelevant or outdated subject some politicians, career advisers, and university leaders might consider it to be, archaeology is essential to the future of humanity and planetary health. This is for three main reasons. First, archaeologists have the capacity to think about and to understand humanity of the past, and to project that insight into the future. Second, archaeologists are uniquely placed to comprehend the many and complex ways in which humans, over time, have related to their environment and environmental and other processes, such as the changing climate, migration, or pandemics. And third, archaeology provides opportunities for everyone to benefit, whether in terms of physical (by undertaking surveys or excavations) or mental health (through social interaction or artifact handling, to address loneliness or anxiety, for example). York Archaeology's Archaeology on Prescription project is one example of this: The program enables adults facing various conditions to gain a detailed understanding of life in a specific area of York, and in the process to improve their health and well-being, on top of volunteerism's generally positive health effects, as demonstrated by a 2024 article. In my new book, Wicked Problems for Archaeologists, I examine a few creative ways that we can use archaeology to help directly address some of the global challenges that threaten both human and planetary health. The book's main argument is that as archaeologists we need to stop thinking only about the past and also think about the future. We also need to engage more with policymakers to help them address their challenges and opportunities. Wicked Problems Wicked problems emerged from research in the late 1960s to devise ways of using outcomes from the United States' NASA-funded space program to help resolve urban problems such as crime and poverty. The definition of wicked problems as those that are 'complex, intractable, open-ended, and unpredictable' captures both the scale of these problems and the difficulties they entail. We also now have 'super-wicked problems' that introduce the additional dimension of time (or the lack of time to be precise). Super-wicked problems are in addition to the original 10 characteristics of wicked problems, defined by Horst W.J. Rittel and Melvin M. Webber: Time is running out; There is no central authority, or only a weak authority, to manage the problem; and The same actors causing the problem are required to help solve it. Both climate change and environmental pollution are examples of super-wicked problems in which archaeologists have recently become involved, including my own work in the Galápagos and the wider South Pacific region. Social injustice, crime, and conflict are widely used as examples of wicked problems. Small Wins I suggest that the only realistic way to achieve success with wicked and super-wicked problems, and ultimately to make a difference, is by adopting a small-wins framework. These small wins (also referred to as small gains or nudges) align well with what universities in the UK refer to as impact, which, for the purposes of the UK's Research Excellence Framework is defined as, 'an effect on, change or benefit to the economy, society, culture, public policy or services, health, the environment or quality of life, beyond academia.' Small wins have been defined by theorist Karl Weick as, 'a series of concrete, complete outcomes of moderate importance [that] builds a pattern that attracts allies and deters opponents.' The strategy of small wins incorporates sound psychology and is sensitive to the pragmatics of policymaking. Examples of small wins include the plastic pollution work in the Galápagos and neighboring coastal South America, and the Archaeology on Prescription project, referred to previously. But even with small wins, we need to be careful. Wicked problems are deeply entangled with one another, meaning that any solution to one problem may exacerbate other problems elsewhere. Climate change and social injustice are a well-known example of this entanglement. Promoting Success Once small wins have been achieved, as archaeologists, we need to tell influential people about the outcomes so that our museums and galleries, local services, and archaeology departments are not threatened with closure by people who fail to understand the significance (or the potential) of the work we do. For this conversation to happen, we need spokespeople who are good at communicating and have access to data and projects that deserve to be talked about. Archaeology needs influencers, or policy entrepreneurs as they are sometimes referred to. As archaeologists, we have not always been very good at this. It is probably why climate scientists on the IPCC don't take much notice of us. Preparing Archaeologists for a Wicked Future We also need to think about how we manage people, resources, and priorities within our profession and how we prepare students for wicked futures. Management leadership scholar Keith Grint has explained how, across disciplines, academics need to be collaborative and passionate leaders inspiring an even more collaborative and passionate next generation. These, he thinks, are essential qualities for creating structures conducive to successfully addressing wicked problems. We should also be looking to create (and teach our students to prepare for) some entirely new business models that provide the foundations for success: for example, new board structures that provide opportunities for younger people. Often advisory boards and boards of trustees are composed of older people with more experience. Younger idealists are often not welcome because they lack real-world experience. But for a world of wicked problems, we need to be much more creative. The old ways have not worked, so we need to try some new ones. The Council for British Archaeology's Youth Advisory Board is an excellent example of what can be done easily and immediately. And as archaeologists, we must continue to teach students how to find, research, interpret, and conserve the places and the materials from which we create an understanding of the past and its relevance in the present. These skills are fundamental to archaeology. But we need to go further. To ensure that the relevance of archaeology is widely felt, students also need to learn how to communicate with non-specialists. To engage with wicked problems they must also learn about global challenges, and activism, and think more about the future. We need to produce what Paul Handstedt calls 'wicked students.'

Brazil: Supreme Court Denies Bolsonaro His Passport Again	After Supreme Court Justice Alexandre de Moraes’ refusal last Thursday (Jan. 16), former President Jair Bolsonaro’s defense filed an appeal against the ruling that prevented him from traveling to the US for President Donald Trump’s inauguration. Justice Moraes once again responded in the negative. 'I uphold the decision to reject the requests made by Jair Messias Bolsonaro on its own grounds,' the justice said in his decision, released Friday (17). In the appeal, the ex-president’s lawyers request the return of his passport, seized in February 2024, claiming that the travel request is a one-off, and not a request to revoke the decision that withheld the document. But the Supreme Court justice’s position on the case remained unchanged. Justice Moraes had already considered, in the Thursday (16) decision, that the former president’s recent behavior indicates the possibility of an attempt to flee Brazil to avoid possible punishment. Bolsonaro wanted to travel to the US from January 17 to 22. He and his son, federal representative Eduardo Bolsonaro, claim there was a formal invitation to the former president, sent by email. But the email, according to Moraes, was to an 'unidentified address' and without any timetable or schedule of the event to be held. Even without proof of an official invitation, the justice examined the request for the return of the passport and denied it. The onetime president’s document has been seized since February 2024.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWcqmplb-haaraKA5KIhHLWI	2025-01-17T15:48:45-08:00	
Spain: Former Catalan President Threatens To Topple Sánchez’s Gov...	By Fernando Heller (EurActiv) -- Former Catalan president Carles Puigdemont warned Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez on Friday that his government could face collapse if he fails to deliver on promises made to Catalan separatist forces. Speaking from self-imposed exile in Waterloo, near Brussels, leader of the right-wing JxCat party Puigdemont announced his decision to suspend the meetings his separatist formation has been holding with Sánchez's Socialist party (PSOE) since 2023. The meetings are intended to follow up on the agreement signed between both sides in November of that year. Along with freezing bilateral relations, he threatened Sánchez with withdrawing the support of JxCat's seven MPs in the Spanish parliament, essential to guarantee the stability of the government until 2027, saying there is 'a real risk of rupture.' He has recently demanded that Sánchez face a vote of no confidence in parliament, though a parliamentary committee in Madrid has temporarily delayed a decision on whether to admit his motion, RTVE reported. Puigdemont's political frustration is directly related to his failure to benefit from a controversial amnesty law – pushed through by Sánchez in exchange for JxCat's support – to return to Spain without fear of arrest for his direct responsibility in the 2017 secessionist attempt in Catalonia. Seeking to restore trust, Puigdemont urged the PSOE to meet again in Switzerland, where members of the Socialist Party and JxCat have been negotiating in recent months. Puigdemont's main demands include, in addition to applying the amnesty law in his case, the transfer of full powers from the central state to Catalonia in migration policy, and making Catalan an official language in the EU.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWcqmplb-haarZoDu3lKMwSE	2025-01-17T15:46:23-08:00	
Syria’s Transition Under Ahmed Al-Sharaa: Diplomacy And Realpolit...	By Kabir Taneja With only a few days left of Joe Biden’s administration in the White House, and as Donald Trump once again prepares to take over the American presidency, the Middle East will greet the new government as a region both in turmoil and rapid transition. While a political and military ceasefire between Israel and Hamas continues to be chased, the fall of Bashar al-Assad’s three-decade-long rule in Syria, and the rise of Hay’at Tahrir al-Sham’s (HTS) Ahmed al-Sharaa (also known by his nom de guerre Abu Mohammed al-Jolani) has thrown a spanner into the region’s proverbial cogwheel of diplomacy and realpolitik. Al-Sharaa is what some are calling a lapsed jihadist. He has blamed the naivete of youth for his dalliances with Islamist groups. Having previously been involved with both the so-called Islamic State (also known as ISIS or Daesh in Arabic) and al-Qaeda alike, the former rebel chief has exchanged his Islamist credentials and camo fatigues for mainstream politics and diplomacy as he works to concretise his control over Damascus. A stream of diplomats from across the region and the West, including the United States (US), have met al-Sharaa, who appears in public in Western-style clothing, with a cabinet-like transitional government structure by his side. This includes his former commanders in core positions. General Murhaf Abu Qasra (nom de guerre under the HTS Abu Hassan al-Hamawi), who designed military grand strategies for the HTS, is now the defence minister. Assad Hassan al-Shaibani, a founder of the HTS-led Salvation Government which controlled territories such as Idlib, is the foreign minister. The above represents the core team for al-Sharaa’s outreach to the world, which no doubt has been steadfast. This is not the first time that the international community has had to deal with a jihadist ideologue, whose movement is in control of a state. The Taliban-led interim government systems in Afghanistan continue to hold power in the country, four years after the collapse of the Republic at the time led by Ashraf Ghani. However, al-Sharaa’s Syria has been mainstreamed much faster. As per scholar Aaron Zelin’s database, the HTS-led government has had formalised engagements with nearly 30 countries. Comparatively, in the same time frame, the Taliban had managed engagements with only seven states. The reasons for the pace of this ‘new’ Syria’s return are rooted in geopolitics, ranging from regional dynamics between Iran and the Gulf states to Russia’s engagements in the country suffering a critical setback, resulting in Moscow’s diminishing presence in the region. Even during the last leg of Assad’s reign, the Syrian leader had started to increase his political bets within the Arab fold, after being shunned during Arab Spring protests in the country. There was a sense of hedging away from the idea of being a client state to Iran and finding solace and acceptance within the Arab brethren for long-term stability. Over the last few months, the erstwhile president did not react militarily to Israeli transgressions within his country’s territories that targeted Iranian militias and infrastructure allegedly belonging to the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC). As per some reports, the United Arab Emirates (UAE) even discouraged Assad from reacting after Israel bombed an Iranian diplomatic mission in the Syrian capital, which led to an extended military exchange between Israel and Iran. The regional discourse around arresting the slide of Syria’s political future is much more intricate than just a Shia-Sunni rivalry or an Israel-Iran contestation. Additionally, it is also much more consequential than a US-Russia or US-China competition. The outcome of Syria’s political direction is hinged as much on regional geopolitics as it is on al-Sharaa’s political acumen in navigating the country’s internal fissures and external geopolitics. Some actors are going to be more critical to manage than others. To begin with, while Iran is putting a brave face on the outcomes in Syria, the fact remains that it has, for now, lost considerable strategic depth in the region as a result. A new presidency in Lebanon aided by the US and Saudi Arabia aimed at undercutting any resurgence by Hezbollah has further added to its woes. Tehran will look to regain some, if not all, of its influence in a protracted manner over the months to come. Similarly, Türkiye, which both holds on to parts of northern Syrian territory, supports the Syrian National Army (SNA) rebel group and looks upon the US-supported Kurdish groups as a national security threat, will also face an understated but prominent ideological contestation with Saudi Arabia. Both Riyadh and Abu Dhabi have spent a better part of the past decade bringing down the influence of groups such as the Muslim Brotherhood, their affiliates, and political Islam in itself as a concept. They have also benefited from the dissolution of Hamas, Hezbollah, and Islamic State, amongst others, via the gamut of conflicts shaping the landscape. Pivoting from geopolitical challenges, al-Sharaa’s ideological challenges are yet to be played out in the open. The ease with which al-Sharaa seems to have used Islamist ideologies in the past, and with him now moving towards managing a state and talking about elections, constitutions, and democratic norms, puts him in a direct clash with his peers and, perhaps, many within the HTS as well. The scholar Cole Bunzel has highlighted in his works many Salafist ideologues across the region and beyond who have already targeted al-Sharaa’s stance on constitutional democracy instead of building an Islamic state. In 2019, HTS’s chief of religious authority wrote that 'Democracy, from a creedal standpoint, is opposed to Islam, as Islam is premised on giving rule to God, while democracy is premised on giving rule to what is apart from God, whatever that may be.' The HTS further added in the same year that the 'Sovereignty of the sharia is the aim of jihad'. Currently, al-Sharaa seems to stand against his own institution’s diktats. Some cracks within al-Sharaa’s ‘new’ Syria are also already visible. A new group from Syria, under the tutelage of Egyptian jihadist Ahmed al-Mansour for new propaganda output, has already started to challenge the political leadership of President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi in Cairo. Mansour has called for Egyptians to mobilise on 25 January, the anniversary of the Arab Spring and the toppling of erstwhile President Hosni Mubarak’s three-decade-long rule. Pro-Sisi media in Egypt has begun to counter Mansour’s narrative. While this is the first instance of a Syrian jihadist aiming for a foreign state’s political rule, it may not be a one-off event. Other similar groups may take shape in the country, as those who have fought with or alongside al-Sharaa may well have different political aims and might just completely disagree with his choice. Finally, the fact remains that much of the positive euphoria around al-Sharaa is yet to be contextualised. There remain more points of infraction than celebration. For regional states, it is a battle for influence and ideological one-upmanship. For Europe, it is about mitigating and managing any potential influx of refugees as the continent continues to reel from the political fallout, such as the rise of the far-right, as a consequence of previous such mass movements beginning in 2013. The US intends to continue its counter-terror operations against Daesh, aiding Israeli interests, and maintaining a level of power projection across the region. Meanwhile, Russia, Iran, and China will intend to renew and reaffirm their influence in the coming future, as a part of big-power contests where the Middle East is one of the three critical theatres, joining Ukraine and the Indo-Pacific. Amidst all this, al-Sharaa must survive, thrive, and gain the world’s confidence. He is already off to a better start than what the Taliban had managed. However, his longevity will depend as much on his political pedigree, as it would on the management of his ideological realities.

Thailand: Nationalism Rears Its Ugly Head Again – Analysis	By William J Jones On 9 December 2024, former yellow shirt street protest leader and media mogul Sondhi Limthongkul issued a public threat to the Thai government led by Prime Minister Paetongtarn Shinawatra. The threat — annul the 2001 joint communique signed by then prime ministers Thaksin Shinawatra of Thailand and Hun Sen of Cambodia and withdraw from the 2001 Memorandum of Understanding. The Memorandum of Understanding in question laid the framework for negotiations between the two kingdoms regarding the Overlapping Claims Area in the Gulf of Thailand. Sondhi vowed to return in 15 days and begin staging street protests if his demands were not met. The central claim by Sondhi and other Thai nationalists is that the Memorandum of Understanding is illegal because the treaty infringes on Thai territorial sovereignty and hencemust be ratified by Parliament to be lawful. The government has repeatedly clarified that while the Memorandum of Understanding is indeed a treaty, it is only a framework for negotiation and does not require parliamentary approval. But the failure of the current Pheu Thai Party government in its public communications has allowed the spectre of dangerous Thai nationalism to resurface. Sondhi and his remarks about ‘selling out Thailand’ and a return of ‘Thaksin’s system’ are nothing new. Sondhi was behind the first yellow shirt street protests which rocked the kingdom and brought Thaksin down in a military coup in 2006. The impact of the yellow shirts peaked between 2009 and 2011 during the leadership of Abhisit Vejjajiva, when yellow-shirt nationalists helped spark a short border war between Cambodia and Thailand over the Preah Vihear Temple. Cambodian and Thai territory is a central feature once again amid the rise of Thai nationalism. Cambodians burned down the Thai embassy in 2003 after an alleged remark by a Thai actress that Angkor Wat belonged to Thailand. Thai nationalists were arrested after encroaching on the Cambodian border to put down territorial markers in 2011. To understand Thailand’s current political landscape, it is worth taking a step back to evaluate the damage that the yellow shirts and Thai nationalists caused the last time they took to the streets. The Preah Vihear Temple issue became an international one when Cambodia filed a complaint with the International Court of Justice (ICJ), objecting to Thai military occupation of the temple and its grounds in 1954. On 15 June 1962, the ICJ ruled that the temple was on the Cambodian side of the border and was the property of the Kingdom of Cambodia. Most importantly, the ICJ did not rule on the watershed itself, instead leaving the issue for the two countries to negotiate. The disputed territorial boundary surrounding the Preah Vihear Temple remained unresolved until the early 2010s when Thai nationalists pushed the issue to the fore. In 2008, the Thai government, then led by Thaksin’s proxy People’s Power Party, signed a joint communique with the Cambodian government agreeing to Cambodia’s listing of Preah Vihear Temple as a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The joint communique caused the yellow shirt nationalists to hit the streets again, eventually ousting Thaksin’s brother-in-law, then-prime minister Somchai Wongsawat, in a bloodless coup. Domestic pressure caused Thailand to withdraw its support for Cambodia’s listing and shortly after, the Thai military occupied parts of the Preah Vihear Temple complex. These events led the Cambodian government to ask the ICJ in April 2011 for an interpretation of its original 1962 ruling. Cambodia asked the ICJ to determine the ‘vicinity of the Temple’ and rule on the disputed watershed, which would demarcate the border between the two countries. On 11 November 2013, the ICJ ruled that the ‘vicinity of the Temple’ began with the promontory to the north and that the temple was situated in Cambodian territory. The ICJ ordered Thailand to remove its military from Preah Vihear Temple. Nationalist tensions caused a short and deadly border war between the two Southeast Asian states in 2009. The volatility of the Preah Vihear Temple issue on both sides of the border caused Cambodia’s then prime minister Hun Sen to ban Thai citizens from visiting the Preah Vihear Temple. Thai villages along the border are still waiting for the border to be re-opened. The re-emergence of Sondhi Limthongkul and his threat to resume mass street protests bode ill for Thailand’s domestic politics and its foreign relations with Cambodia. It is unclear whether the conditions are right for a new round of yellow shirt street protests in Bangkok. The yellow shirt movement is far diminished from its previous robust form, having withered under the nine-year rule of General Prayut Chan-o-cha. But given the uncompromising position of yellow shirt nationalists, it is almost certain that any movement towards negotiation on the Cambodia–Thailand Overlapping Claims Area will encounter major resistance. On 22 August 2024, Thaksin gave a highly publicised three-hour speech where he outlined his vision for Thailand. This high-profile speech included a pledge to negotiate the Overlapping Claims Area and ‘unlock’ its lucrative oil and gas resources. This speech undoubtedly rankled Thaksin’s opponents. Today, the very persons that began Thailand’s two decades of deadly political destabilisation — Thaksin Shinawatra and Sondhi Limthongkul — are back at it again. Regardless of any outcome negotiated by a Thaksin-led government, anything less than full Thai sovereignty over the Overlapping Claims Area will not be good enough for Thai nationalists. They will seek to scuttle any negotiated compromise, no matter how fair or helpful to Thai interests. The current Pheu Thai government’s lack of communication is providing ammunition to its opponents. Only recently has Thai Foreign Minister Maris Sangiampongsa announced that a public forum would be held to gain input from civil society. But even this was at odds with previous statements made by Prime Minister Paetongtarn Shinawatra. Due to their uncompromising stance, Thai nationalists have already caused Thailand to lose territory surrounding the Preah Vihear Temple, compromising Thai national interests in the name of their love of the country. The same people responsible for the previous debacle are standing in the way of Thailand–Cambodia relations once again.

The US Strategy To Constrain China In The AI Sector Will Further ...	By Zhou Chao Since the Trump administration, the U.S. has gradually increased its restrictions and blockades on China in the field of high-tech industries, with the aim to curb the development speed of China's advanced technologies and maintain its own advantage over China. This approach has continued into the Biden administration without change. The same is true in the rapidly growing field of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in recent years. However, within the AI sector, the U.S. seemed to show a certain degree of willingness for cooperation with China at one point. From 2023 to the first half of 2024, in exchanges at various levels between the two countries' governments, the U.S. side consistently expressed a willingness to cooperate with China on the global AI regulatory framework. The most obvious example of this was the official invitation extended to the Chinese delegation to attend and speak at the first Global AI Summit held in November 2023 in the United Kingdom. Considering the close relationship between the U.S. and the UK, it would have been difficult to imagine the Chinese delegation's attendance without U.S. permission. Subsequently, high-level government dialogues on AI were held between the U.S. and Chinese governments in Switzerland. For a moment, it seemed that China had returned to the global stage in the AI field. However, based on a comprehensive analysis of various factors, researchers at ANBOUND believe that the 'tech Cold War' between the two will persist and intensify, with no substantial shift in sight, particularly in the AI field. The significance of AI technology makes it inevitable that the U.S. will take every measure to suppress China's advancements in this field. Since the advent of modern science and technology, one of humanity's central challenges has been to harness technology in a comprehensive and efficient way to support both production and everyday life. Throughout the first three industrial revolutions, and even in the ongoing fourth technological revolution, new technologies have yet to fully free people from monotonous, repetitive labor to allow them to focus solely on creative endeavors. However, the rapid development of AI, particularly generative AI, has made this long-sought goal a tangible reality. Research highlights that through automation and smart technologies, AI can take over tedious, repetitive tasks, freeing up time and energy for more complex and creative work. AI's potential to automate production processes, optimize supply chains, enhance product design, and more can further boost productivity, creating more space for human innovation. Beyond its impact on productivity, AI also plays a critical role in advancing scientific research and technological innovation. It can assist scientists with large-scale data analysis and simulations, accelerating the pace of discovery. It can aid in the development of new materials, the creation of new pharmaceuticals, and the solution of complex scientific challenges, driving progress in various fields. In military applications, AI also holds great promise for enhancing efficiency and combat capabilities. Such transformative potential in reshaping human labor and daily life is truly disruptive. The country that gains a dominant position in this technology will inevitably rise as a global leader in both political and economic spheres. Given that China is already recognized as a systemic competitor, the U.S. cannot afford to allow China's AI technology to fully flourish and will continue to aggressively suppress it. Secondly, the development of China's AI industry and technology in recent years indicates that the U.S. measures to counter it need to be further intensified. In the first half of 2024, a report released by MacroPolo, a think tank under the Paulson Institute, showed that while the U.S. remains the undisputed global leader in AI talent, China has made remarkable progress in terms of talent cultivation and the prospects for talent development. In 2022, the proportion of top global AI researchers trained in China rose to 47%, a significant increase from 29% in 2019. AI talent from China has also made notable improvements in qualifications. Among the top 2% of elite AI talents, 26% come from China, while the U.S. accounts for 28%, with both countries being very close. In the previous survey in 2019, only 10% of the most elite AI talents were from China. In terms of job choices, the previous survey showed that only 11% of top AI talents (the top 20%) chose to work in China, while the U.S. employed nearly 60% of the world's top AI talents. However, the 2024 survey revealed that 28% of top AI talents have chosen to work in China, while 42% are working in the U.S. This indicates a significant narrowing of the gap between China and the U.S. in recent years, with the choice of workplace for AI talent shifting from U.S.-dominated to a competitive dynamic between the two countries. Regarding research institutions, in the previous list of the top 25 AI research institutions compiled by MacroPolo, based on the affiliations of paper authors, Tsinghua University and Peking University were the only two Chinese institutions. But in the 2024 statistics, Chinese research institutions now hold 6 positions, with Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Zhejiang University, the Chinese Academy of Sciences, and Huawei also making it into the top 25. Tsinghua and Peking University ranked 3rd and 6th, respectively. Previously, among AI researchers who received their undergraduate education in China, about 56% chose to pursue graduate studies in the U.S. However, according to the 2024 report, this figure has dropped to around 36%. Since graduate education is closely linked to future career destinations, this trend suggests that more AI talent may choose to work in China in the future. The report suggests that these trends are largely driven by the rapid growth of China's AI industry, which has led to increased demand for talent, as well as the growing emphasis by Chinese universities and tech companies on AI talent cultivation and recruitment. As things stand, the increasing strength of China's AI capabilities is the primary reason for the shifting trends in the flow of top AI talent. Although the U.S. still ranks at the top globally in terms of AI research strength and international appeal, China's rising influence means that the U.S. will need to take act to contain the development of China's industry and research while strengthening its own research capabilities and global attractiveness. In the specific area of hardware, Huawei successfully launched a 7-nm chip phone last year. Although in-depth analysis suggests that the breakthrough was mainly due to the use of older-model photolithography machines for multiple exposure and etching operations, it remains a fact that China's research and development capabilities continue to advance despite multiple rounds of sanctions. Therefore, the U.S. needs to intensify its efforts to more effectively curb China's progress in AI technology. Moreover, the U.S. business community's ties to China have gradually loosened, making the resistance to further sanctions less significant. For a long time, the U.S. business sector has been a key opposing force to U.S. sanctions on China. Due to the substantial investments and profit interests that American companies have in China, the business community has consistently opposed deep and comprehensive sanctions against China. Take Nvidia, a key player in the AI field, as an example. Its president, Jensen Huang, repeatedly emphasized in 2022 and 2023 that the Chinese market is crucial, even indispensable, and that Nvidia would not leave the Chinese market. After the U.S. escalated its sanctions, Nvidia continued to export to China, even if it meant cutting down the functionality of its chips. However, data from the 2023-2024 fiscal year revealed that although revenue from Mainland China accounted for 21% of Nvidia's total annual revenue, it dropped to single digits in the fourth quarter of the 2023-2024 fiscal year, with the proportion likely to continue decreasing. Despite the decline in revenue share from Mainland China, it did not hinder Nvidia's overall revenue growth. Therefore, the importance of the Chinese market for leading U.S. AI companies is gradually diminishing. Additionally, China's recent calls for increased use of domestically produced chips will undoubtedly further erode the confidence of foreign AI companies in the Chinese market. For the broader U.S. business community, the importance of the Chinese market is also steadily diminishing. In 2023, American and Western companies withdrew over a hundred billion dollars in profits from the Chinese market, and investment institutions have been continuously scaling back their investments. This also means that when the government is ready to implement deeper sanctions on China, the opposition pressure from the business community will be more limited. According to a report from The New York Times in the first half of 2024, over 100 tech leaders from Silicon Valley were lobbying Congress at that time, urging lawmakers to impose more restrictions on China's AI sector. Among them were Palantir CEO Alex Karp and Sequoia Capital managing partner Douglas Leone. Palantir, a leading U.S. data analytics and AI company, is also a major defense contractor for the U.S. government and is rumored to have assisted the U.S. military in locating and killing Al-Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden. The New York Times reported that this lobbying effort from Silicon Valley not only sought to push Congress to limit China's progress in the AI field but also aimed to improve AI regulations, increase technology research and development funding, and ease immigration restrictions to attract more international AI talent to the U.S. These lobbying moves are undoubtedly targeted primarily at China, aiming to both technologically block China's progress and to intensify the brain drain from China, thus hitting China's AI technology development from both fronts. ANBOUND has previously pointed out that China's stringent regulations in the AI sector are detrimental to the development and application of technology. The overall level of openness and social freedoms in China also hampers further advancements in AI technology. The current state of AI technology development in China mainly benefits from the accumulation of previous years and remains in a relatively static state. However, as U.S. sanctions deepen and become stricter, particularly with targeted measures against China, the development of technology and hardware will be further constrained, and the trend of talent outflow will become more pronounced. As a result, China's AI industry may face even greater difficulties in its development. With the Democratic Party's looming electoral defeat last year, the Biden administration began in the fourth quarter of 2024 to escalate its blockade and crackdown on China's chip industry, with even mature chip manufacturing equipment now being included in the sanctions. As a critical support for AI technology, the continued tightening of chip industry sanctions is undoubtedly a clear indication of the further tightening of the U.S. noose around China. Final analysis conclusion: As a global technological trend, China and the U.S. will continue to cooperate in the field of AI regulation. Even after Donald Trump formally took office, the AI dialogue mechanism between China and the U.S. was expected to continue. However, this will not alter the growing trend of the U.S. tightening its AI noose around China. During the Cold War, the U.S. and the Soviet Union cooperated in preventing nuclear proliferation, yet the U.S. never ceased its efforts to suppress Soviet advancements in nuclear technology. In the context of the U.S.-China technological rivalry, some have described the U.S. approach as a 'small yard, high fence' on current trends and future directions, the yard may not necessarily become smaller, but the fence will inevitably continue to grow higher.

With A New Government, Many Bulgarians Fear A Return To The Past ...	By Katerina Vasileva and Ivan Bedrov (RFE/RL) -- With the approval of a new coalition government, Bulgaria's parliament has ended a prolonged stretch of political instability, during which the country was largely governed by caretaker cabinets and underwent seven elections in four years. Despite finishing first in the October 2024 elections, the country's dominant political force, the center-right GERB party, did not have a majority to govern alone. But after long and involved negotiations, it has finally managed to scrape together a coalition with the former communist and pro-Russian Bulgarian Socialist Party; the populist There is Such a People party; and a faction of the Movement for Rights and Freedoms, which has traditionally represented Bulgaria's ethnic Turks. Guiding the new coalition will be Prime Minister Rosen Zhelyazkov, a senior GERB official with extensive government experience, having previously served as both a minister and parliamentary speaker. The coalition has already drawn criticism from opposition leaders and political analysts who have questioned its commitment to fighting corruption and maintaining the country's pro-Western stance. Borisov's Return For many Bulgarians, the GERB party, led by Boyko Borisov, is synonymous with corruption. A linchpin of Bulgarian politics, Borisov served as prime minister three times between 2009 and 2021 and was widely criticized for presiding over a system defined by widespread graft, a captured media, and alleged misuse of EU funds. Borisov eventually stepped down in 2021, shaken by months of massive anti-corruption protests. Despite winning elections since, his GERB party struggled to find willing coalition partners. Of particular concern is GERB's relationship with Delyan Peevski, a powerful and influential tycoon who has been accused of corruption and influence peddling and sanctioned by the United States and the United Kingdom. Instead of distancing itself from Peevski, as many Bulgarian politicians had urged, the coalition eliminated wording from earlier drafts of the political agreement that would have curbed his influence. This decision prompted the reformist We Continue the Change-Democratic Bulgaria alliance to withdraw from negotiations and stay out of the coalition. Despite Prime Minister Zhelyazkov's ambitious agenda, which includes enacting EU-mandated reforms, pursuing eurozone membership, and bolstering the rule of law, many Bulgarians are not convinced. That's partly due to the coalition's inherent contradictions -- particularly its attempt to bridge pro-Western and pro-Russian interests. The pockmarks of compromise and political expediency are already showing. The phrase 'pro-European' has been stripped from the coalition's opening statement, and commitments regarding Ukraine and Russia have been watered down to accommodate the historically pro-Russian Bulgarian Socialist Party's reluctance to support aid to Kyiv. It's worth remembering that the There is Such a People party started life as an anti-GERB and anti-corruption movement. With the last four years defined by political paralysis and reforms never getting off the ground, money from the European Union has almost dried up. Restoring this crucial financial pipeline might not be easy given that it requires implementing EU-mandated reforms and anti-corruption measures -- overhauls that the increasingly euroskeptic coalition member There Is Such A People has previously blocked. Will Bulgarian Continue Its Pro-European Path? Nevertheless, under the new government, Bulgaria is unlikely to shift its orientation away from the EU and the West. The country is a newly minted member of the Schengen visa-free zone and has pledged to avoid cooperation with 'anti-European parties.' Speaking on January 16, Zhelyazkov said he would ensure continuity in the country's geopolitics, mentioning the eurozone as a priority. There are also some checks and balances. Addressing parliament on January 16, Nadejda Iordanova from We Continue the Change-Democratic Bulgaria, said that the opposition parliamentary group would be watching to see if the government stuck to a pro-European path. 'We will support the path to the euro, energy independence, and the modernization of the army,' Iordanova said. '[We] will be the opposition, we will be consistent, we will work for the modernization and strengthening of institutions.' The last four years have been characterized by political inertia and stagnant reform -- something that won't necessarily change now that Bulgaria has agreed on a government. What many Bulgarians fear now is not just that things will stay the same but that things will get worse, a return to what they see as a particularly unscrupulous and corrupt decade under the rule of Borisov and GERB.

Iraq Is In For A Rough 2025 – Analysis	Iraq is a developing democracy, but its location — between Iran, Saudi Arabia, Turkey and Syria — means that it always faces pressure from outside its borders. The list of challenges it faced in 2024 ranged from ongoing security threats, including attacks on U.S. military bases by armed groups, political shifts and discussions about the presence of U.S. forces, and, perhaps above all, instability from the war in Gaza and the collapse of the Assad regime in Syria. To deal with these challenges, Prime Minister Mohammed Shia al-Sudani visited Washington to sign economic agreements and advocate for a stronger Iraq-U.S. partnership that moves beyond security to include energy, education and investment. Sudani worked to avoid being drawn into regional conflicts, instead focusing on internal infrastructure and economic development. Broader regional conflicts, particularly the tensions between Israel and Iran, and increased instability in the region made it harder to deal with the challenges related to displaced people and repatriations from Syrian refugee camps. Baghdad completed a nationwide census, the first in 40 years, which will affect the distribution of power in the nation’s sectarian system, possibly increasing internal tension. Iraq will not get a time-out in 2025. Despite the defeat of the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria in 2019, remnants of the group and other militias continue to pose threats — with potential for resurgence if political and economic grievances remain unaddressed. Linked to the threat from terror groups, border security and smuggling operations also remain major issues. The planned end of the U.S.-led coalition’s mission by September 2025 introduces new security dynamics, with a shift toward bilateral security arrangements (though a small number of American troops will remain). This change could either stabilize or further complicate Iraq’s security environment. Meanwhile, Iraq’s economy relies on oil revenues, which comprise 95 percent of Iraq’s federal budget and expose the country to market fluctuations. Iraq sells about 35 percent of its exports to China, making it vulnerable to China’s economic slowdown and Washington’s anti-China policies. The end of the dollar auction platform that monitored foreign currency transactions, ensuring compliance with international standards, will reshape the financial landscape, potentially leading to increased activity in the black market and challenges in currency management. Despite some economic growth, non-oil sectors are struggling, and inflation is expected to rise slightly to 3.5 percent due to financial pressures and internal economic challenges. In its effort to diversify the economy and relieve pressure on the federal budget, Baghdad aims to limit the public sector to 1-2 percent of the private sector in the next decade. Reconstruction costs from the war against ISIS will cost an estimated $88 billion, in addition to ongoing infrastructure development such as the Development Road project that will connect West Asia to Europe via Turkey. Iraq may also face tension with incoming Trump administration, which is avowedly pro-Israel and may view Iraq as part of Iran’s sphere of influence. Trump may enact punitive measures that could harm Iraq’s stability, increase tensions and depress economic activity. Political reform, reducing Iranian influence and consolidating state authority over arms are seen by the U.S. (and many Iraqis) as essential for Iraq to assert its independence. The country is preparing for parliamentary elections in 2025, and the results could potentially reset the political landscape. There is also a push for electoral reforms to ensure better representation and reduce marginalization of smaller political parties, a concern in the Kurdish region, which is dominated by two family-based parties. The 2024 census results could lead to further tensions between Baghdad and the Kurdish leaders who fear a loss of influence in Iraq’s sectarian system (which was imposed by the U.S.), while constitutional disputesbetween Baghdad and Erbil remain unresolved. To top it all off, Iraq is highly vulnerable to climate change; dealing with water scarcity, droughts and increased temperatures, which impact agriculture and urban living conditions, will tax the government’s abilities and funds. Iraqi governments have not prioritized efforts to improve water management, rebuild water infrastructure and modernize the agricultural sector, and have instead blamed climate change on Iran and Turkey for upstream damming of the Tigris and Euphrates rivers. The water flow of these rivers is down 30 percent since the 1980s and may further shrink by up to 50 percent before 2030. This degradation of natural resources threatens food security and could lead to displacement of rural people to urban centers in search of work, and may cause social unrest if the unemployment rate climbs above the current 15.5 percent (though it is probably higher for the youth). The U.S. still influences Iraq by requiring a sanctions waiver for Iraqi purchases of electricity from Iran, and it recently banned all foreign transactions in Chinese Yuan. Washington controls the disbursement of Iraq’s dollar-denominated oil revenues from an account at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. American interventionists ignore the effects of a decade of sanctions, 'the worst humanitarian catastrophe ever imposed in the name of global governance,' and violence and disorder loosed by the invasion of Iraq. American leaders may be reluctant to maintain normal state-to-state relations with Iraq after their war of choice caused 4,500 U.S. military deaths and cost $2.1 trillion — nearly 40 times the pre-war estimate — and may feel the U.S. earned the right to intervene in Iraq as needed The word for 2025 is 'sovereignty.' Despite many challenges like reducing oil dependency, ensuring political stability amid sectarian divides and managing environmental crises, the Sudani government must focus on protecting the state. An aggressive Trump administration may view Iraq as part of Iran’s sphere of influence, and Iran will try to cut its losses in Syria and Lebanon by strengthening its hand in Iraq. That said, Baghdad knows it and Tehran are 'neighbors forever,' so it must press for relations based on mutual respect and benefit.

Navigating Myanmar’s Border Trade In The Post-Military Coup Era –...	By Windia Soe From the impacts of post-coup policies and border trade disruptions to the rising influence of ethnic armed organizations and shifting power structures, Myanmar’s economic and political fabric is undergoing profound changes. 3 Key Takeaways: Border trade remains a critical pillar of Myanmar’s economy, accounting for $7.7 billion of its $30 billion international trade in 2023-2024. However, post-coup policies, such as foreign exchange controls, increased import restrictions, and ongoing armed conflicts, have disrupted traditional trade routes and exacerbated economic challenges. EAOs have gained significant influence over Myanmar’s border trade, controlling major trade hubs like Muse and Chinshwehaw. This shift challenges the military junta’s authority. It has forced foreign stakeholders, including China and India, to engage directly with EAOs to safeguard their investments. Myanmar’s reliance on low-complexity exports, such as natural gas and jade, contrasts with its trading partners’ focus on value-added goods. Addressing this imbalance through industrial development, technological advancement, and export diversification is crucial for achieving equitable and sustainable trade growth in Myanmar. Geopolitical Strategic Position Myanmar spans 676,578 square kilometers with diverse landscapes, including the Arakan Mountains in the west and the Shan Plateau in the east. It borders Thailand and Laos to the southeast, China to the north and northeast, and India and Bangladesh to the west. Its location near the Andaman Sea, Bay of Bengal, and Indian Ocean shipping lanes makes it a vital regional link and trade hub into China from the Bay of Bengal. The Historical Evolution of Border Trade Under Military Rule Myanmar’s economy, rich in natural resources like oil, gas, and minerals, suffered under decades of military rule and economic mismanagement. During the socialist period, key trading partners included Japan, the UK, and the US, supported by official development assistance (ODA). After the 1988 military coup, Western sanctions redirected Myanmar’s trade towards neighbors such as China and Thailand. The 1962 coup saw industries nationalized, eliminating competition and stifling economic growth. These policies pushed many businesses into the informal economy, spurring illegal border trade. A market-oriented economy reintroducedin 1988 attracted private investment, boosting imports and exports. Border trade agreements with China, Thailand, India, and Bangladesh in the 1990s further solidified cross-border commerce, establishing 17 official border trade stations. Trade Policy Reforms Under Semi-Democratic Transition Period Since 2011, Myanmar has pursued trade liberalization to integrate into global markets. Key reforms include reducing export taxes on Cut-Make-Pack (CMP) goods, exempting agricultural products from commercial taxes, and eliminating state monopolies. Customs duties have been progressively reduced, and most exports were duty-free, barring a few exceptions like rice and bamboo. Export taxes include an 8% commercial tax and a 2% income tax on private-sector exports, while state-owned enterprises pay only an 8% commercial tax. Foreign trade was overseen by institutions like the Myanmar Foreign Trade Bank (MFTB) and Myanmar Economic Bank (MEB), while trade policies are aligned with World Trade Organization (WTO) standards. Despite capacity-building challenges, these measures have enhanced trade flows and encouraged foreign investments. Border Trade’s Economic Significance Border trade accounts for a substantial portion of Myanmar’s economic activity, crucially supplementing maritime trade restricted by Western sanctions. The agricultural sector, contributing 22% of GDP and 29% of exports, relies heavily on border trade to access regional markets. In 2023-2024, border trade generated $7.7 billion of Myanmar’s $30 billion international trade. In the 2023-2024 fiscal year, Myanmar’s international trade exceeded $30 billion, with $7.7 billion from border trade. Despite challenges like a $734.2 million trade deficit in 2022-2023, key exports include garments, gas, and pulses, while imports comprise refined oil, machinery, and raw materials. Land routes dominate trade with China and Thailand, while sea routes prevail with India. Myanmar-China Border Trade China is Myanmar’s largest border trading partner, with bilateral trade surpassing$3.279 billion in FY 2023-2024. Major border hubs include Muse, Lweje, and Chinshwehaw, with Muse accounting for the highest trade value. Myanmar exports low-complexity goods like natural gas and precious stones to China while importing industrial materials like fabrics and iron pipes. In 2022, Myanmar exported $9.62 billion worth of goods to China, with key exports including precious stones ($4.05 billion), petroleum gas ($1.31 billion), and rare-earth compounds ($604 million). These exports have grown at an average annual rate of 14.4% since 2017. Imports from China, valued at $13.5 billion, were dominated by industrial materials like fabrics ($1.25B) and iron pipes ($625M), with a 3.36% annual growth rate since 2017. Myanmar's reliance on low-complexity goods like natural gas, jade, and agricultural products, with minimal value addition, contrasts starkly with China's focus on value-added goods, highlighting a disparity in economic complexity. In 2022, Myanmar ranked 118th on the Economic Complexity Index, compared to China’s 18th. The disparity in economic complexity between the two nations highlights Myanmar’s need for industrial development, technological advancement, and export diversification. Strengthening these areas could reduce reliance on low-value goods and foster more equitable trade relations. Myanmar-Thailand Border Trade Thailand ranks as Myanmar’s second-largest export partner and third-largest import partner. Trade occurs through six checkpoints: Hteekhee, Tachilek, Myawady, Kawthoung, Myeik, and Mawtaung. In the first quarter of FY 2024-2025, Hteekhee led with $472.66 million in trade, followed by Tachilek ($80.48M) and Myawady ($63.23M). By June 2024, total border trade reached $737 million, down significantly from $1.7 billion the previous year. Border crossings, particularly Myawaddy-Mae Sot, account for about 80% of Myanmar-Thailand trade, including legal and illegal activities in 2022-2023. However, ongoing armed conflicts have disrupted traditional routes like Myawaddy-Mae Sot, forcing traders to adopt alternative shipping methods. The Yangon-Kawthoung-Ranong maritime route, launched in 2024, demonstrates the growing importance of container shipping, which offers more excellent reliability compared to uncertain land transport. By October 2024, this maritime route facilitated $60 million in trade, complementing traditional land routes such as Myawaddy-Mae Sot. For instance, in March 2024, Myanmar exported 1,767 tonnes of freshwater fish using 17 container ships from Aungmingala Port. These shifts underscore the adaptability of Myanmar’s trade networks amidst logistical challenges. Myanmar-India Border Trade Myanmar is the only ASEAN country sharing land and maritime borders with India, a crucial link between India’s northeastern states and Southeast Asia. The 1,643 km shared border with Arunachal Pradesh, Nagaland, Manipur, and Mizoram integrates isolated India’s northeastern region with ASEAN markets. Myanmar’s Sagaing Region and Chin State are key trade hubs. Bilateral trade facilitated through Moreh-Tamu and Zowkhathar-Rhi volume remains modest, reaching $2.175 billion in 2016-17. Myanmar exports beans and pulses ($809 million) and timber ($156 million) while importing sugar ($424 million) and pharmaceuticals ($184 million), highlighting untapped potential in the trade relationship. The introduction of the Special Rupee Vostro Account (SRVA) mechanism in 2024 has streamlined transactions by allowing settlements in Indian Rupees alongside Chinese Yuan and Thai Baht. This transaction reduces costs and promotes efficiency in cross-border commerce. However, challenges persist, particularly in the timber trade. Sanctions and smuggling have complicated this sector, with illegal activities often financing conflict with the military junta and Ethnic Armed Organizations (EAOs), which rely on these proceeds to support their operations. Political stability, law enforcement, and transparency are essential to address these issues. Impact of Post-Coup Policies on Myanmar's Trade Political instability following the military coup in 2021 has disrupted border trade and reshaped the economic landscape. The military junta has reversed economic liberalization, opting for restrictive policies emphasizing state control and self-sufficiency. Central Bank of Myanmar (CBM) mandated the repatriation and conversion of foreign currency income into Myanmar Kyat (MMK) within one day. While aimed at curbing USD outflows and rebuilding reserves, these measures have limited importers' access to foreign currency, stifling trade. Policies like the car import ban and increased licensing requirements (35% to 74% of import lines) reflect the SAC’s efforts to regulate economic activity. The combination of these restrictive policies has led to several impactful changes in Myanmar's trade dynamics: Export values fell by $4 billion by 2023, while garment exports hit a five-year low due to the withdrawal of foreign brands. Economic restrictions have also fueled informal trade, particularly in timber, with an estimated 80% trafficked illegally to China and India. Rising prices for essential goods and transport disruptions have worsened inflation and food shortages, especially in conflict-affected areas. Rising Influence of Ethnic Armed Organizations (EAOs) EAOs have gained significant control over Myanmar’s border trade, undermining the junta’s authority. Key trade stations like Muse and Chinshwehaw with China are under EAO control, facilitating millions in daily trade. These groups’ strategic acumen and resilience have reshaped power dynamics, challenging the junta’s dominance. Notably, the Muse trade station, controlled by the Three Brotherhood Alliance (3BHA), handles $6 million daily trade, while the Chinshwehaw station, under MNDAA control, handles over $1 million daily. As a result, Myanmar-China trade volumes have dropped from $640 million to $416 million in just one year, exposing the junta’s failure to maintain stability. Strategic Importance of EAOs in Border Trade Rakhine State is pivotal in China’s Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), hosting critical infrastructure like the Kyaukphyu deep-sea port and oil and gas pipelines. China's Kyaukphyu deep-sea port and Special Economic Zone (SEZ), a crucial endpoint for the China-Myanmar Economic Corridor, connect Yunnan Province to the Indian Ocean, offering an alternative route to bypass the Malacca Strait. As of August 2024, EAOs and PDFs fully control 10 of 19 Chinese projects in northern Shan State and central lowlands, worth over $2.4 billion, and partially control key infrastructure, including the China-Myanmar oil and gas pipelines, cross-border power lines, Muse-Mandalay railway, and significant trade routes. As Myanmar's internal conflicts escalate, China and India have adopted strategies to safeguard their interests. India’s engagement with ethnic groups aims to ensure the success of strategic projects like the Kaladan Multi-Modal Transit Transport Project. China employs a dual-track approach, balancing relations with the SAC and EAOs to protect investments and secure supply chains. However, disruptions caused by the KIA's seizure of key border towns and rising rare earth prices underscore challenges to China's influence. Growing EAO control over these projects highlights the Myanmar Military's inefficient role in stabilizing Chinese investment. As EAOs consolidate power, foreign stakeholders must engage directly with local actors (EAOs) to protect their interests and contribute to regional stability. Rakhine’s potential as a trade hub hinges on political stability and international cooperation. Conclusion Myanmar’s evolving trade landscape reflects broader political and economic upheavals.

Russia’s Floating Nuclear Power Plant Passes One Billion kWh	The Akademik Lomonosov floating nuclear power plant in Russia's Arctic Chukotka region has generated its first billion kilowatt hours, as it approaches five years since entering commercial operation. The floating nuclear power plant (FNPP), part of the Rosenergoatom division of Rosatom, is providing about 60% of the energy for the western Chukotka region and Chersky in Yakutia and has been increasing its output each year. It began commercial operation in May 2020, and its operators say the amount of energy it has now generated would be enough to 'make a double espresso for everyone on earth'. Natalia Tarasova, Deputy Director for Human Resources Management at the FNPP, said: 'The past year was a landmark one ... the first fuel campaign in the history of the plant was successfully completed. In the Arctic conditions, this is a challenge, and we coped with it. I associate this success, first of all, with the effective planning of work and the coordinated work of all the plant personnel. One of the features of our work is that some of the personnel work on a rotational basis ... it should be noted that the non-standard approaches to work have been an integral part of the FNPP project since its inception.' It is the world's only operating floating nuclear power plant. It is based, with its coastal infrastructure, by the city of Pevek - population 5000 - to which it supplies heat and power. The Akademik Lomonosov has two KLT-40S reactors generating 35 MWe each, which are similar to those used in a previous generation of nuclear powered icebreakers. It is also providing energy for the development of mining of the Baimskaya ore zone. It has the capacity to provide electricity to a city with a population of up to 100,000 people. Rosatom is in the process of constructing four floating power units and is targeting the export market for floating nuclear power plants with capacity of at least 100 MWe and an assigned service life of up to 60 years featuring RITM-200M reactors, derived from those used on Russia's latest nuclear-powered icebreakers.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWedeXgydby82adj5xVOforT	2025-01-16T16:51:29-08:00	
Iran’s Jews In The Crosshairs – OpEd	By Sifra Lentin Iran has an indigenous Jewish community of about 9,000 persons[1]. This is the largest Jewish diaspora in the Middle East outside of Israel. Ever since the 7 October 2023 attack on Israel by Hamas, a proxy of Iran, Iran’s Jews have actively participated and been very vocal in protest marches, official letters, and interviews, loudly denouncing the actions of the State of Israel in the current war.[2] This is to be expected as they have always publicly hewn to their government’s line since the Islamic Revolution of 1979. But this time, their obedience does not seem enough for the ruling regime. Indications of this are emanating from Iranian officials themselves. The recent 10 November warning on public television to Iran’s Jews by General Mohammad-Jafar Asadi of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps[3], stated that if Iranian Jews were anti-Zionists they should prove this by 'taking more action on the ground'. The TV interview itself took place after the 4 November execution of 20-year-old Iranian Jew Arvin Ghahremani from Kermanshah, on murder charges. This was the first such in the community after 30 years.[4] The community views the timing of Arvin’s execution as a warning to them. Karmel Melamed, an Iranian Jewish journalist in the U.S. who is in contact with his community in Iran, says the Jews still remaining in Iran 'know that their situation has got worse, and their safety is in peril because their community leaders were unable to save Ghahremani despite their recent efforts to pause or delay his execution.'[5] Arvin’s trial had many shortcomings, as his plea of self-defense was given short shrift by the courts. His execution without intimation to his family, a necessary protocol, also highlights the exponential increase in human rights violations against Iran’s minorities since the death of the young Sunni Kurdish woman Mahsa Amini on 16 September 2022.[6] These two factors – being a minority and a Jew – at a time when Israel and Iran are at war and there is civil unrest against the ruling regime, make living in Iran dangerous for its Jews.[7] This is even though Iran’s Jews still enjoy one of three minority-reserved seats in the Majlis (parliament), the other two being for the Armenians and Zoroastrians[8]; unlike the nation’s Baha’is, Arabs, Balochis, and Communists, the Jews are a recognised minority.[9] Jews have lived in Iran since 2700 B.C.E. According to Lior Sternfeld in his book Between Iran and Zion: Jewish Histories Of Twentieth-Century Iran (2019), the emancipation of Iran’s Jews began with the slow demise of Persia’s Qajar Dynasty and the Constitutional Revolution of 1906 to 1911, which popularized the notion of a public political sphere. This meant a new notion of citizenship, granting minorities elected representation, and releasing them from a nominal dependency on the ruling Shah to protect their rights. This did not last long as it was also a period of political instability, which paved the way for the iron-fisted but pro-development Reza Khan, the first Shah of the Pahlavi Dynasty, in 1925. His rule marked the beginnings of a progressive era for all of Persia’s minorities including various denominations of non-Shia Muslims, Jews, Christians, and Baha’is. During this time, the insidious concept of Najasat (ritual impurity) under Shia law, which legitimized discrimination, violence against, and persecution of, minorities in Persia, was removed.[10] [11] (It was first implemented under the Safavid dynasty (1501 to 1736) and continued to be enforced by the Qajars.) Reza Shah I abdicated in 1941.[12] During his reign about 1,00,000 Jews were living in Persia, and many in villages were urbanizing by seeking work in cities like Isfahan, Hamadan, Sanandaj, Shiraz, and Tehran which were fast developing. His son Mohammed Shah Reza Pahlavi II ascended the throne and this opened the political sphere for everyone including minorities to participate equally. This was a period of modernisation and westernisation of Iranian society and great freedom for its many minorities who now began seeking higher education and excelling in their chosen fields, and a few became big businessmen and philanthropists. Iran’s Jews then, as now, are indigenous Iranians by virtue of their 3,500-year history in Iran[13] Although they have always been small in numbers, their contribution to 20th-century Iranian society through their institutions – 13 active synagogues, five Jewish schools and two kindergartens, and the 100-bed Sapir Hospital in Tehran alone – has always been outsized.[14] Many were prominent intellectuals, doctors, teachers, journalists, and businessmen like the current Jewish representative in the Majlis and head of the Tehran Jewish Committee Dr. Homayoun Sameyah Najaf-Abadi, a pharmacist known for helping Tehran’s poor. Like other Iranians in the 20th century, and with the political sphere open to them, they participated actively, many as members of the Tudeh or Communist party, and voiced a range of opinions through community, communist, and mainstream media, as several became journalists.[15] Few ever considered leaving Iran after the founding of the State of Israel on 14 May 1948. This is particularly notable as the early immigrants who left for Israel in the years 1948 to 1953 were mostly from rural Iran and economically weaker sections. Even then, there were returnees to Iran in these early years as life was tough in Israel. Of a population of about 1,00,000 Jews in 1948, only 27,182 left for Israel.[16] Those who stayed often visited Iran to meet family and friends. Even if they were not motivated to leave their homeland, Iran’s Jews, particularly its biggest community in Tehran, played a crucial role in helping other Jews undertake Aliyah or immigration to Israel. European Jewish refugees like the Poles released from Russian gulags in 1941, who made Tehran their home during the Second World War, and, Iraqi, Afghan, Pakistani, and Indian Jews, who all stayed in transit camps in Tehran briefly while awaiting El Al flights to Israel, were supported and embraced by his community. Iran was the only Middle East nation to have diplomatic relations with Israel and a consulate (est. 1949) and then a consulate-general in 1950 in Jerusalem till its Prime Minister Mohammad Mossadeq closed the consulate in 1951.[17] Iran never rescinded its ties with Israel and trade and economic relations between the two nations continued unabated, as did the transit camps in Tehran. During this time, Iran’s Jews unlike Jews in Arab countries like Iraq, Syria, Egypt, and Morocco, did not feel pressured to uproot themselves and begin a new life in Israel. This was despite the encouragement of Zionist emissaries who worked amongst the community in Tehran, the largest, and many smaller regional communities like Yazd. It was with the Revolution of 1979 that overthrew the Pahlavi dynasty and established the Islamic Republic of Iran, that problems began. Soon after on 9 May 1979, the wealthy Jewish philanthropist and leader of the Tehran Jews, Habib Elqanian, was accused of spying for Israel and executed. It was this that triggered Iranian Jews to leave their beloved homeland. A transactional geopolitical and economic relationship between Iran and Israel continued post-1979 till Iran’s ruling regime pursued a new 'transboundary project' creating the Lebanese Hezbollah in response to Israel’s 1982 occupation of Lebanon.[18] According to Rachel Freedman, a Mashadi Jew and journalist and author, more than half of Iran’s Jews left for the U.S., settling in Greater Los Angeles (also referred to as Tehrangeles), Baltimore, and Maryland, making up an Iranian Jewish community of about 80,000 today. Others left for Israel and Europe. Israel has a population of 1,00,000 Jews of Iranian origin. Referring to this period, Freedman states in her lecture to the Birmingham Representative Council for Jews on 3 December 2023, that 'in the Islamic Republic of Iran, the Jews became more religious to distinguish them from Israel and Zionism.' This is borne out by the fact that soon after Habib Elqanian’s 1979 execution, representatives from the community met Ayatollah Khomeini in Qom, who then publicly made a distinction between Judaism and Zionism, allegedly ending, according to Sternfeld, the widespread speculation that all the Jews were undercover Zionist agents.[19] [20] This gave the community some respite but resulted in them distancing themselves from family and friends residing in Israel[21] although contacts with family settled in Europe and the U.S. continued even after the current War began. Today, the portends for Iran’s Jews are not so good as tensions between Iran and Israel show no signs of abating. Where once the Islamic Republic of Iran prided itself on being home to the largest Jewish diaspora in the Middle East, this may soon no longer be true. According to U.S.-based Iranian Jewish journalist Karmel Melamed, the daily duress[22] his community lives under has resulted in many quietly immigrating overseas.

He was executed under a sentence of qisas (retribution in kind) after Iran’s Supreme Court rejected his appeal, and, after the victim’s family refused to accept 'blood money' from Ghahramani’s family in exchange for Arvin’s life. The Norway-based Iran Human Rights (IHRNGO) article of 24 May 2024 details that there were shortcomings in the trial, the foremost being oversight by the courts in recording Arvin’s plea that he acted in self-defense, and, the fact that he had rushed the victim to hospital.

A spike in registered violence against minorities also followed. See U.S. Department of State, '2023 Report on International Religious Freedom: Iran,' [7] The Iranian Jewish diaspora in the United States has come together on various forums to highlight the harassment and crimes perpetrated against Iran’s Jews and often the lack of a fair investigation.

[8]It is Iran’s largest minority the Baha’is that are not recognised and persecuted See Bombay’s Early Baha’is [9] Iran had a strong Communist Movement in the early 20th century that went underground after the Islamic Revolution in 1979. Although Communism is a political ideology not a religion, Iranians who are Communists are also deprived of rights like government jobs and live under duress. [10] See Legacy of Jews in the MENA – World Jewish Congress and [11] The forced conversion of Mashad’s Jews to Shia Islam in 1839 and the death of 50 of them during this onslaught on the community, is a nadir in Iranian Jewish history. Many Mashadi Jews fled to neighbouring regions like Afghanistan and undivided India, and those who stayed behind either practiced Judaism as crypto Jews (i.e. secretly whilst publicly professing another religion). See Rachel Freedman, 'The secret Jewish lives of my family in Iran,' Jewish Chronicle, 14 November 2024, [12] Reza Shah’s abdication was during the Second World War. The Allied Powers perceived that he was under German influence, and Iran was geostrategically important because of its location and its rich reserves of oil. [13] Iran’s Jews are indigenous to Persia as underscored by two historical milestones. The release of exiled Jews in Babylonian captivity by Persian Emperor Cyrus II, founder of the Achaemenian dynasty, who conquered Babylonia in 538 BCE and permitted these captives to return to Jerusalem and rebuild the Jewish Temple known as the Second Temple, points to the early presence of Jews as not all of them returned to Judea. The Biblical Book of Esther which is read during the Jewish festival. of Purim, recalls the 5th BCE story of the Jewish Queen Esther, wife of Persian King Ahasuerus, in foiling the machinations of the evil vizier Haman to save her community from certain death. See Purim | Definition, Story, History, Traditions, & Facts | Britannica [14] Loeb, Lawrence, 'Travels Through Iran: A Photo Journal' in Houman Sarshar (ed.).

The United States Makes A Play For Rojava – OpEd	In one of its final moves in office, the Biden administration is trying to secure U.S. influence over Rojava, the Kurdish-led region of northeastern Syria. Now that Rojava is being attacked by Turkish-backed militias and faces a possible Turkish invasion, the Biden administration is reinforcing U.S. military positions in Rojava, making it more likely for the Kurds to maintain control over northeastern Syria. Despite the possibility that President-elect Donald Trump may bow to Turkish pressure, as he did when he facilitated a Turkish attack on Rojava during his presidency, officials in the Biden administration are trying to safeguard Rojava and prepare the Kurds to play a major role in Syria’s future. 'We need to stand with the Kurds, and President Biden intends to do that,' National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan said last month. For the past decade, the United States has partnered with the Syrian Kurds. In the war against the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS), the U.S. military aided the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), which did the bulk of the fighting on the ground in Syria. U.S. military officials repeatedly praised the Kurds for their courage, calling them the most effective fighters against ISIS. 'We’ve worked alongside the SDF for some time,' Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin acknowledged last month. 'We have a good relationship with them and I think it will remain.' At the same time that the SDF fought ISIS, the Kurds carved out an autonomous region in Rojava, where they organized the Democratic Autonomous Administration of North and East Syria (DAANES). Although the United States has not formally recognized the region’s autonomy, the U.S. military has kept soldiers in the area, helping to solidify its independence. Officials in Washington have defended the U.S. military presence in Rojava by saying that they are helping the Kurds prevent a resurgence of the Islamic State. 'Our entire mission in Syria is to ensure the continuing defeat of ISIS,' Pentagon Spokesperson Sabrina Singh said at a January 8 press briefing. While the United States has supported the Kurds, it has maintained reservations about the partnership. Not only has the U.S.-Kurdish partnership created frictions with Turkey, a NATO ally that portrays the SDF as terrorists, but U.S. officials have not supported the Kurds’ social revolution in Rojava, which has created a more inclusive and democratic politics in northeastern Syria. During the past year, in fact, the Biden administration began moving away from its Kurdish partners. Administration officials discouraged Rojava from holding municipal elections that would likely legitimize the SDF and its associated Democratic Union Party. For many years, a goal of the United States has been to empower the Kurdish National Council (ENKS), a group of opposition parties supported by Turkey. Some U.S. officials even began reviewing options for withdrawing U.S. forces from Rojava, though such a move would leave the Kurds vulnerable. Prior to the ouster of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad this past December, U.S. diplomats floated a deal in which Assad would cut his ties to Iran in exchange for the withdrawal of U.S. forces from Syria. Now that opposition forces have overthrown the Syrian government, however, the Biden administration is refocusing its attention on its Kurdish partners, hoping to use them to influence Syria’s political development. One of the administration’s moves has been to supervise talks between the SDF and ENKS, a maneuver that may appease Turkey. Kurdish leaders have presented the talks as an effort to establish a unified Kurdish front in negotiations with Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), the U.S.-designated terrorist organization that now controls Damascus. At the same time, the Biden administration has moved to limit Turkish attacks on Rojava. Although the Turkish-controlled Syrian National Army (SNA) has been attacking Rojava since late November, when HTS began its offensive against Assad, the United States has provided the SDF with support, even reinforcing positions near the Turkish border. While aiding the SDF, the Biden administration has sought additional assistance from France, which also stations troops in Rojava. Earlier this month, Secretary of State Antony Blinken met with French Foreign Minister Jean-Noel Barrot, who praised the Kurds for their role in the defeat of the Islamic State and insisted that they must play a role in the future of Syria. 'The Kurds of Syria shall have their role to play,' Barrot said. 'We owe it to them.' Still, several factors may undermine the Biden administration’s efforts, particularly as they concern Turkey. A critical question is whether Turkey will invade Rojava. Since Assad’s ouster, Turkish officials have grown increasingly hostile toward the Kurds, with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan repeatedly threatening Kurdish militias with eradication. Another uncertainty concerns the intentions of the incoming Trump administration. Although Secretary of State Blinken anticipates that Trump will try to prevent more conflict in Syria, the president-elect has previously bowed to Turkish pressure. In recent statements, Trump has praised Erdogan and signaled that he has no interest in interfering with the Turkish president’s plans for Syria. Erdogan 'sent his people in there through different forms and different names,' Trump said on January 7, referring to Erdogan’s maneuvers that led to Assad’s ouster. 'And they went in and they took over, and that’s the way it is.' Whatever Trump’s intentions may be, he may find it difficult to ignore Syria. If he abandons the Kurds, then he will be leaving Syria more firmly under the control of HTS, the very kind of organization that he insists is a threat. In fact, many U.S. officials have indicated that there is great danger in Syria being controlled by HTS, which has its roots in al-Qaeda. It is a time 'of both real promise but also peril for Syria and for its neighbors,' Blinken stated last month. Knowing that the Kurds have been reliable partners, the Biden administration has seen an opportunity to use them to its advantage. Rather than cowering before Turkish threats, as Trump has done in the past, Biden has moved to deter Turkish attacks while enabling the Kurds to maintain control over much of northeastern Syria. What the Biden administration is doing, in short, is making a play for Rojava, believing that it may provide the United States with significant leverage over the future development of Syria.

The Fatal Effort To Dismantle UNRWA – OpEd	Over the past 15 months, the international community has failed to prevent genocidal atrocities in Gaza. Dismantling the UN refugee agency would perfect the nightmare. Early in the year, State Department officials briefed Joel Rayburn from the Trump transition team there could be a humanitarian 'catastrophe' in Gaza when a new Israeli law barring contact with the UN refugee agency for Palestinians takes effect at the end of the month. The UN Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA) is the primary aid agency operating in the Gaza Strip. After more than a year of war, the UN and other aid organizations warn Gaza is close to uninhabitable. Tens of thousands of houses have been destroyed. More than 46,000 Palestinians have been killed and over 107,000 injured. In the future, these numbers are likely to prove three to four times higher. And still worse could be ahead. During President Trump's first term, his administration gradually cut all U.S. assistance to UNRWA. The Biden administration later resumed U.S. aid to the agency. Last March, Congress passed a law that bans the U.S. from funding UNRWA until at least 2025. Why should the horrific policy errors of the past be compounded with monstrous new policy mistakes? The origins The fate of UNRWA is one of the many dilemmas I scrutinized while working on The Fall of Israel (2025). After achieving an initial truce in the 1948 Arab-Israeli War, Count Folke Bernadotte, a Swedish diplomat, used it to lay the groundwork for the UN Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA) for Palestine Refugees in the Near East. Bernadotte tried to balance the different interests of the Israelis and Palestinians, the major powers in the region and the UN Partition Plan. Having witnessed the horrible outcome of the Jewish Holocaust in Europe and hoping to avert a catastrophe in Palestine, he also proposed that the UN should establish a Palestine conciliation commission and Arab refugees would have a full right to return to their homes in Jewish-controlled territory. Just hours after his proposal, Bernadotte was assassinated in Jerusalem by the Jewish paramilitary Stern group, while pursuing his official duties. One of those who planned the killing was Yitzhak Shamir, the future prime minister of Israel, and the predecessor and onetime mentor of Benjamin Netanyahu, Israel’s current PM. Ever since then, UNRWA has been a lifeline to generations of Palestinians in the West Bank, the Gaza Strip and the adjacent Arab countries. Created as a purely temporary measure, UNRWA’s mandate has been subject to renewal every three years ever since. Historically, the United States has been UNRWA’s largest financial contributor, with more than $7.3 billion since 1950. From the start, these contributions have been subject to a variety of legislative conditions and oversight measures, however. Funding threats Decades of U.S. policy toward Israel and the occupied territories, however ambiguous, was reversed almost overnight, when the Trump administration executed a series of dramatic policy changes in 2018 and canceled nearly all U.S. aid to the West Bank and Gaza, plus $360 million in annual aid previously given to the UNRWA. Subsequently, the Biden administration restored much of the funding, yet provided Israel weapons and financing for the mass atrocities of those the UNRWA funding was supposed to help. After allegations surfaced connecting a few of the 30,000 UNRWA employees with the October 7, 2023, Hamas-led attacks against Israel, the Agency fired nine staff members following a UN investigation. While it denied allegations that the agency has widespread links to Hamas, Congress enacted a March 2024 prohibition on U.S. funding to UNRWA (P.L. 118-47), which is set to last until late March, 2025. To put things into context: The Empire State Building is said to have 21,000 employees. Imagine what would happen if six of them would be suspected of terrorism and therefore the entire building would have to be dismantled and all employees fired? It would be an absurd collective punishment for the alleged crimes of a few. Worse, the Israeli laws passed on October 28, 2024 and scheduled to take effect 90 days later, would endanger the lives of hundreds of thousands of Palestinians in Gaza, the West Bank, and Jerusalem. Millions of lives threatened The new U.S. and Israeli legal measures emboldened Jewish settlers, particularly the Messianic far-right. In May 2024 they launched several attacks on the UNRWA headquarters, setting fire to the perimeter of the building in East Jerusalem. The attacks against UNRWA came after months of far-right settler protests outside of the building, following Israeli claims of UNRWA-Hamas links; accusations that lacked verification, according to U.S. intelligence. Among the protesters was Aryeh King, a deputy mayor of Jerusalem and a prominent advocate for settlements, who called Palestinian Gazans 'Muslim Nazis,' described them as 'sub-human' calling for captured Palestinians to be 'buried alive' in December 2023. By the year-end of 2024, some 265 UNRWA staff had been killed in hostilities since October 7, 2023. Despite a record-high number that suggests intentional targeting, those behind the Israeli strikes have not been prosecuted. More than 5.9 million Palestinians, including three of four in Gaza, are registered with UNRWA as refugees. The stakes In Gaza, nearly two million Palestinians are displaced and dependent on aid for food, water and medical services. U.S. officials say there's no serious backup plan for providing humanitarian supplies and services to Palestinians. With the new U.S.-Israeli laws, senior UNRWA emergency officers presage social order in the Strip could collapse. Here are some ways to preempt such disasters: The White House should pressure Israel to suspend and nullify the impending adverse acts against UNRWA U.S. Congress should lift current prohibition on UNRWA funding through March 2025 UNRWA’s funding should be broadened by the U.S. and internationally in light of the devastation and genocidal atrocities caused in Gaza The Agency’s existence should be premised on the implementation of all relevant and existing UN resolutions both the U.S. and the international community have voted for. How probable are such measures in the conceivable future? Highly unlikely. What’s the alternative? Far worse, far worse.

Europe’s Economy Slows As Its Welfare State Grows – OpEd	By Mihai Macovei European countries are the largest welfare states in the OECD and among the highest in the World. At the same time, Europe’s economic dynamism has faded out and European leaders are getting increasingly worried about it. According to Christine Lagarde, the ECB President, Europe’s generous social model is at risk unless the region fixes a persistent decline in growth. In a recent report, Mario Draghi strongly calls for reforms and investments to reinforce productivity growth, while keeping untouched the continent’s oversized welfare state. For Austrian school economists, this sounds like having your cake and eating it too, because the issues of economic growth and income redistribution are intrinsically linked. Europe’s problem with anaemic growth Lagarde acknowledges that Europe trails behind the US in terms of productivity growth. Faced with rapid advance in innovation, the EU remained stuck in the 'middle technology trap', while the US and China are spearheading the digital revolution. Europe is falling behind in emerging technologies such as microchips, AI, and electric vehicles and only four of the world’s top 50 tech companies are European. Draghi’s report on 'The future of European competitiveness' reveals that economic growth has been lower in the EU than in the US over the past two decades. The EU – US unfavourable gap in terms of GDP at constant prices has doubled from about 15% in 2002 to 30% in 2023. Around 70% of the gap has been driven by lower productivity in the EU (Graph 1). Moreover, Europe’s growth prospects are not good. The continent enjoys relatively high trade openness, but is now facing strong competition from Chinese exporters and potential high tariffs from the US. On top, EU companies are burdened by high energy costs and European countries will probably need to spend significantly more for defence, adding to already high public spending. Graph 1: EU vs US labour productivity. Source: The future of European competitiveness: Report by Mario Draghi The solutions proposed by Draghi to boost productivity growth and innovation have little to do with increasing economic freedom. They are primarily aiming at centralizing and reinforcing government intervention and keep in place the massive welfare state. Draghi calls for a new industrial strategy for Europe which should be coordinated at EU level. It may help overcome the current division of policies and financing sources among countries. But it cannot solve the more fundamental issue of inefficient allocation of resources and bad incentives that industrial policies bring about. In a similar way, decarbonisation and new clean technologies cannot reduce the current high energy costs without an economic cost. Current production facilities based on fossil fuels are cheaper and their replacement would increase the cost of doing business. The report also argues that EU’s investment-to-GDP ratio should rise by around EUR 800 billion or 5 percentage points of GDP per year, which would require substantial public subsidies. Draghi advocates the creation of a common safe asset, funded by joint European debt. However, although cheaper, mutualized debt would still add to an already high debt burden. A Large and Inefficient Welfare State At the height of the eurozone crisis in 2012, German Chancellor Angela Merkel tried to make the case that Europe’s welfare states were too large, as Europe accounted for 7 percent of the global population, for a quarter of global GDP and for 50 percent of global social spending. The situation has not improved in the meantime and public social spending in many European countries exceeded by five to ten percentage points the OECD average of 21% of GDP in 2022. According to the OECD, public social spending in France, Finland, Denmark, Belgium and Italy is close to 30 percent of GDP, being driven by pensions, health spending and other social transfers such as unemployment benefits, disability pay and child allowances (Graph 2). Graph 2: Public social spending (% of GDP). Source: OECD Data [ OECD] Despite its size, the European social model is fairly inefficient. The large spending on social protection in EU economies does not necessarily result in poverty reduction. According to the Brookings Institution, this is particularly the case in economies from Southern Europe, such as Spain, Greece, Italy and Portugal, where social spending is quite high, but the social assistance coverage of the poorest 20 percent of the population is relatively low. In contrast, small welfare states in Central and Eastern Europe, spend about half, i.e. less than 15% of GDP on social protection, but achieve a better coverage of the poorest strata of the population. The Manhattan Institute goes one step further and argues that generous welfare states in Europe are not helping the working poor. Universal 'social insurance' schemes that allow all the members of the society to live middle-class lifestyles during periods of unemployment, sickness or retirement are funded by most European countries through fairly high payroll and consumption taxes on workers with low earnings. In the largest EU welfare states, the poorest full-time workers are net taxpayers, subsidizing nonworkers, which is different from the US. In countries such as Germany, Denmark and the Netherlands, the poorest half of the population pay a much higher share of their income in taxes than the richest tenth. This distorts work incentives and renders everyone poorer. Draghi’s welfarist error It is wishful thinking to believe that EU’s growth problem could be solved without first downsizing the wasteful system of income redistribution from workers to nonworkers and reducing the tax burden. Overall government spending in Europe is also among the largest in the World at around 50% of GDP. The higher the level of government spending as a share of GDP, the bigger the overall tax burden, more of which will be spread from the rich to the middle-class and those of modest means. In his magnum opus 'Human Action', Ludwig von Mises has already debunked the mainstream fallacy that production and distribution are two separate and independent economic processes. According to mainstream economists, when the production of goods and services has come to an end, the government can intervene to ensure a more 'fair' distribution of the national income among members of the society. Allegedly, this would not weigh on economic output which is perceived as independent from the subsequent public redistribution of incomes. That is why Lagarde and Draghi believe that Europe can boost its growth performance irrespective of the social model. But, this is wrong. In a market economy, goods and services come into existence as someone’s property and if the government wants to redistribute them, it must first confiscate them. Governments can easily encroach upon private property rights, but this cannot represent a solid basis for sustainable economic growth. According to Mises, investment and capital accumulation are founded upon the expectation that their fruits would not be expropriated. Without this assurance, people would prefer to consume their capital instead of safeguarding it for the expropriators. People would reduce savings and investments and entrepreneurs would take less risk. Workers would work less hours and enjoy more leisure if they earn less on a net basis. This would depress economic growth and living standards for both the rich and the poor. Gwartney, Holcombe and Lawson have shown this empirically. As the size of general government spending has almost double on average in OECD countries from 1960 to 1996, their real GDP growth rates have dropped by almost two thirds on average. Moreover, the worst performers were some Sothern European countries that increased the size of the government the most (Graph 3). Graph 3: Government spending and economic growth among OECD countries. Source: James Gwartney; Randall Holcombe and Robert Lawson, (1998), The Scope of Government and the Wealth of Nations, Cato Journal, 18, (2), 163-190 Europe’s slow economic growth, weak productivity and poor innovation are just symptoms of the excessive public spending and welfare state. In a short reaction to Draghi’s report, Blanchard and Ubide note that countries do not necessarily need to be leaders in innovation in order to prosper. They can use the innovations of others and still be able produce competitive products. But, according to Mises, this can only happen if governments allow markets to function freely and do not stifle individual entrepreneurship. This is the fundamental problem that Europe should fix first. About the author: Dr. Mihai Macovei (macmih_mf@yahoo.com) is an associated researcher at the Ludwig von Mises Institute Romania.

Ralph Nader: Jimmy Carter Was My Last President – OpEd	Jimmy Carter was my last president. I believe that is true for progressive civic groups, too. He actively opened up the federal government to engagement and participation from long politically excluded American activists. When he was campaigning in 1976, he would say that he wanted to be more of a consumer advocate than I am, that he would take seriously my recommendations for his nominations to head federal regulatory agencies. Pleasing rhetoric, I thought. Then, in August 1976, after his nomination, he invited me to Plains, Georgia, for talks and an overnight stay at his modest home. Together with his wife Rosalynn, we talked over a simple supper of black eye peas. The next day, I spent several hours with Carter in his study, going over what policies the civic community wanted him to pursue, what he was likely to confront in Washington and responding to his searching questions. He was taking copious notes — a good sign, I mused. He punctuated the importance of the visit by introducing me to the attending members of the national press corps and promptly had me umpire part of the daily softball game between Carter’s campaign aides and the reporters. I left Plains with his phone number and a matter-of-fact assurance of more receptivity to come. After his election victory over President Gerald Ford, I invited him to address a special gathering of citizen advocates in a large hotel ballroom near the White House. To my surprise, he accepted. There must have been nearly 1,000 people in the room with a dozen civic leaders on the dais. I introduced them to president-elect Carter, who then delivered remarks we all were pleased to hear. This signal gathering, never again repeated by any president elect, did not get much media for the simple reason that reporters saw it as public relations around popular policies. Not so. Once in office, he chose numerous civic leaders and other solid progressives to head regulatory agencies such as Occupational Safety and Health Administration, the Environmental Protection Agency, National Highway and Transportation Safety Administration, the Federal Trade Commission and the Consumer Product Safety Commission, among other important positions in the White House and other departments. Furthermore, Carter took a stand behind probably the most widely opposed legislation ever by corporate lobbyists: the creation of a consumer protection agency with the authority to intervene before federal agencies and departments to champion consumer interests and, if their arguments were arbitrarily rejected, to take these agencies to court. That agency would upset the cushy, often secret relationship between federal agencies and the companies they were supposed to regulate. The corporatists went into a frenzy of lobbying, meeting regularly in the Madison Hotel to plan each week’s anti-consumer tactics. We had the votes to create the consumer agency in the Senate, but, unfortunately, the House voted first on Feb. 7, 1978, and narrowly defeated the bill despite our efforts and those of Carter’s formidable Esther Peterson, the special White House assistant for consumer protection. No president since has made any mention of resurrecting this vital objective of the consumer movement to institutionalize consumers’ well-being and set an example for the states to do the same. Needless to say, President Ronald Reagan shut down Carter’s consumer presence, replacing his appointments, deregulating the health, safety and economic justice agencies, and inviting a rapacious 'wish list' from commercial and industrial interests. He even took down Carter’s 32 solar panels from the White House roof, reflecting his support for the fossil fuel companies. Unfortunately, the last 18 months of Carter’s presidency witnessed punishing inflation, Federal Reserve Chairman Paul Volcker’s sky-high interest rates to stop spiraling prices and increasing conservative rebellions from his own Democrats in Congress. The pressure from all these quarters and the preoccupation with the lengthy Iranian hostage crisis drained his energy from consumer protection issues. Still, no other president since has taken our calls, met with us for serious discussions in the White House and provided more government action and information stressing that the economy, after all, must be heavily judged by its defense and advance of consumer welfare. The expectations of the current generation of consumer advocates has never come close to expecting a president like Jimmy Carter. He gave the leadership of the Federal Trade Commission to Michael Pertschuk — the very successful staff architect for Sen. Warren Magnuson’s championing of consumer protection legislation. He placed Public Citizen’s Joan Claybrook in charge of the auto safety agency, made Eula Bingham the head the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, Donald Kennedy head of the Food and Drug Administration, Douglas Costle the director of the Environmental Protection Agency, and Gus Speth to head the new Council on Environmental Quality in the Executive Office of the President. Today, consumer leaders rarely get their calls returned by the White House or the agencies, whether under Democratic or Republican control. In all the obituaries and articles, written about the death of Jimmy Carter, there was almost no mention of his pioneering work in consumer protection. His performance needs to be front and center for both his legacy and to provide standards for both presidential campaigns that ignore consumer issues and, for sitting presidents. Presidents need to realize, as did Jimmy Carter, that 'consumers' are just another name for all the American people.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWedeXgydby82SxnIBh09i6h	2025-01-16T16:14:39-08:00	
Why We Shouldn’t Be Concerned About AI Replacing Jobs – OpEd	By Walter Block I frequently fly from New Orleans, Louisiana, to Vancouver, British Columbia, and then back again. There is no direct airplane route between these two cities. Often, the best route is via a connection through the Dallas Fort Worth Airport. This facility has become almost a second home for me. It alone constitutes almost a veritable gigantic city. Like every major metropolitan entity, it has a train system. This one is called the Skylink. It runs twenty-four hours per day seven days per week and arrives at each terminal station every two minutes. You can even time this on the handy clock located therein. These two-car little trains are very much needed because to get from one terminal to another takes a matter not of yards, nor even several distances of a football field, but, rather, literally miles. Interestingly, all of those rail vehicles are fully automatic. None of them have any human conductors at all. They are very safe, efficient, and reliable. Announcements are clear as to which terminal is approaching, along with those warning people that the Skylink is about to move, so clear the doors, and, also, upon arrival, to allow people to depart from the train before others embark upon it. Imagine, though, if this light rail system had human beings operating it. This would create hundreds of jobs, maybe even thousands. Should we then get rid of this automatic machinery and hire workers to pilot these conveyances? This is economic illiteracy on steroids. A far better way to look at this matter would be that these machines free up labor. They enable numerous skilled workers to turn their energies to the production of other goods and services. These would have been impossible to provide if these people were stuck ferrying air travelers around the Dallas airport. In this way, we can have our cake and eat it too; we lose not one whit of transportation from terminal to terminal, and we can also have all these other goods and services. It is a win-win situation. At one time, there were a massive number of laborers operating not horizontal trains but vertical ones: elevators. When one stepped into one of them (this was way before the experiences of many readers of this column; take my word for it), there was a guy standing there, or, perhaps, sitting on an especially made seat built for him. He wasn’t some sort of pervert, just waiting around in the elevator ready to hassle people. He was the elevator operator. He would ask you what floor you wanted, and off you went together. When you got there, he would say 'Step up,' or 'Step down,' or 'Waitasec, I can do better than that,' whereupon he would try to get this conveyance closer to the desired floor (in those bygone days, elevators were not as accurate in this regard as they are nowadays). Tens of thousands of people were so employed. Thanks to ongoing technical progress, however, they were freed up to engage in other occupations, with no loss whatsoever to our vertical travels. As everyone who has been a passenger on an airplane in the last few decades knows, there are veritable swarms of Transportation Security Administration (TSA) employees thick as thieves to be found at airports. They busily check our luggage, pat us down, confiscate our toothpaste, seize our nail clippers as dangerous implements (yes, they once did this to me), and will not allow us to bring a full water bottle (we have to first empty them and then fill them up again once we pass security). We owe their existence to terrorists who like to blow up planes. Without these terrorists threatening to dynamite our aircraft, there would be no need for these TSA officials. Before the terrorists began their deadly depredations, people walked straight onto airplanes with no intermediation by anyone. Should we thank the terrorists, if only at least for reducing our unemployment rate? Not a bit of it. Were there no such thing as a terrorist (oh, happy day), if no one ever even thought of (goodness gracious) bombing an airplane, these TSA workers would hardly be needed. They would have been able to produce all sorts of goodies the identity of which we cannot be sure. We can only know for certain that we would be far richer than we are now, at present. To put this in even greater perspective, at one time in our history, 98 percent of our labor force worked on farms. That statistic is now down to about 3 percent. The economically illiterate way of looking at this alteration is to bemoan all those lost jobs in agriculture. A more rational one is to appreciate all the goodies made possible by this shift in employment. Our economy is replete with yet other examples. Included would be telephone operators, ex-employees of Kodak, those who once manufactured typewriters along with attendant carbon paper and Wite-Out, those who used to work in the horse and buggy industry, etc. The latest concern along these lines is that Artificial Intelligence will soon unemploy us all. The misnamed Center for American Progress, a left-wing group, publicly worries about just this phenomenon we have been discussing. In their view: 'The Biden administration and Congress must adopt a worker-centered approach in its response to the development and use of artificial intelligence.' No, no, no, a thousand times no. To the extent that AI substitutes for human labor, we will be more prosperous, not less so. Such groups 'centering' on workers should be applauding these new initiatives. The International Labor Organization, an agency of the United Nations of the same philosophical persuasion, is engaged in 'minimizing the negative effects of AI-induced technological unemployment.' The main effects of this breakthrough will be to enrich us all and reduce poverty. What, me worry? Not to be outdone by all this caviling, Keynes maintained that 'a new disease … (called) technological unemployment … (is) outrunning the pace at which we can find new uses for labour.' All I can say to that bit of economic nonsense is hardy har har. About the author: Walter Edward Block is an American economist and anarcho-capitalist theorist who holds the Harold E.

Ukraine Military Situation: Mounting North Korean Casualities – A...	By Can Kasapoğlu 1. North Korean Casualties Mount in Kursk North Korea has continued to deepen its engagement in the Russian region of Kursk, where Pyongyang’s troops have been pushed into high-risk offensive tasks. South Korean intelligence estimates that hundreds of North Korean fighters have been killed in action, and thousands more wounded. But despite these casualties, North Korea has continued to rotate and reinforce its troops, showcasing its commitment to Russia’s war. Notably, Ukraine has captured some of these troops, and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has posted videos of their interrogations on his X account. South Korean news outlets reported that the captured troops were serving with the North Korean Reconnaissance General Bureau, a key intelligence agency. While Ukraine has yet to capture a high-ranking North Korean officer, this possibility cannot be ruled out. Nonetheless, Pyongyang will likely send additional troops from its most elite formations to Kursk—and possibly to occupied Ukraine. American officials report that Russia has agreed to supply North Korea with Su-27 and MiG-29 combat aircraft in return for its contributions. The two allies may also share ballistic missile technology and submarine systems. These developments demonstrate that Kyiv and Seoul need to deepen their security and intelligence cooperation. 2. Battlefield Assessment Today 18 percent of Ukraine is under Russian occupation. Despite high casualties, the Russian military maintains an offensive footing on multiple fronts. The Kremlin’s abundance of manpower highlights Ukraine’s force generation troubles. Kyiv has denied social media claims that it transferred technicians from the Ukrainian Air Force to help stabilize the front lines. But press sources indicate that President Zelenskyy intervened to countermand this decision. True or not, these rumors point to a grim reality. Over the past week, the Russian military has successfully pushed onto the highway network surrounding Pokrovsk. It has likely secured Neskuchne, to the southwest of Velyka Novosilka, where Russian combat formations have already been operating along the Mokri Yaly River. Russia has also gained territory in Toretsk and Kurakhove. In Kursk, Russia and Ukraine have been conducting separate tactical offensives at high operational tempos. As in previous weeks, Russia’s operational concepts have involved launching both mechanized, echeloned attacks and waves of soldiers at Ukrainian defenses. Ukraine’s attempts to hit the Russian rear with fire-support weapons have found some success: on January 7, Kyiv conducted a precision strike against Russia’s 810th Separate Marine Brigade in Kursk. 3. Drone Warfare Update As previous editions of this report have highlighted, Russia has continued to use first-person-view (FPV) drones equipped with fiber-optic cables to counter Ukraine’s electronic warfare efforts in Kursk. In recent interviews, Ukrainian personnel have stated that they have resorted to using shotguns against these drones because other defenses have failed. Russia continued to launch loitering munition salvos against Ukraine, employing predominantly Iranian Shahed drones. The Kremlin’s target set included Ukraine’s population centers and energy grid. Statistical assessments suggest that Moscow, with Tehran’s help, has the capacity to launch over 1,500 Shaheds per month. In drone warfare, volume matters. Roughly half of Russia’s strike packages fail to breach Ukraine’s air defenses and others fall prey to Kyiv’s electronic warfare efforts. But even a low rate of success can cause significant damage. In November 2024, its most prolific month to date, the Russian military launched 2,300 kamikaze drones at Ukraine. Iranian drones will likely continue to grow in importance throughout 2025. Two bright spots did emerge for Ukraine. First, Defense Intelligence of Ukraine (GUR) operatives managed to infiltrate the Russian rear area and inflict damage on enemy units. Second, Ukraine used its robust long-range strike capabilities to conduct overwhelming strikes deep inside Russia, most prominently in a January 14 attack on ammunition depots at the Engels-2 air base and various chemical plants.

Biden’s Sordid Legacy: Ravaged Rights And Liberties – OpEd	Joe Biden’s presidency ends on January 20, 2025. There will likely be a media stampede to hallow his reign and trumpet his virtues. But Biden perpetually trampled his January 20, 2021, oath to 'preserve, protect and defend the Constitution of the United States.' In his 2022 State of the Union address, Biden declared, 'When dictators do not pay a price for their aggression, they keep moving.' And he kept moving until his own political party dumped him. Later in 2022, President Biden proclaimed that 'liberty is under assault.' But he was referring solely to a few court rulings of which he disapproved, not to the federal supremacy he championed for almost 50 years in the Senate and the White House. The absurdity of the Biden reign was epitomized in July when he was browbeaten into ending his reelection campaign. In Biden’s 11-minute speech announcing that decision, everything was sacred — including the Oval Office ('this sacred space'), 'the sacred cause of this country,' 'the 'sacred task of perfecting our Union,' and the 'sacred idea' of America. Biden announced that 'I revere this office' — a hint that viewers should revere him, too. Biden has worshiped political power his entire life — and so it was no surprise that religiosity suffused his valedictory address. Biden asked: 'Does character in public life still matter?' That signaled that most of the coverups of his abuses and potential kickbacks will continue at least until January. No wonder Hunter Biden had a big smile as he sat just outside of the video sweep in the Oval Office. But Biden never permitted his Attorney General, Merrick Garland, to release the audiotape of Biden’s bumbling interview with Special Counsel Robert Hur — perhaps the single biggest step toward Biden’s expulsion from American political life. Biden told viewers of that July spiel: 'Nothing can come in the way of saving our democracy.' So Democratic Party bosses had no choice but to nullify 15 million primary ballots cast for Biden and jam a replacement candidate down the nation’s throat. For years, the Democratic Party has equated vanquishing or destroying Trump with saving democracy, justifying any tactic — fair or foul — to thwart Trump. Perhaps Biden’s biggest innovation was his doctrine that preserving democracy requires destroying freedom of speech. His appointees launched the Disinformation Governance Board to police Americans’ criticisms of government and plenty of other topics. The Orwellian name helped torpedo that board, but that was not even the tip of the iceberg of federal abuses. A federal appeals court slammed the Biden administration for conducting an unconstitutional censorship 'pressure campaign designed to coerce social-media companies into suppressing speakers, viewpoints, and content disfavored by the government.' That same court found that censors especially targeted speech by conservatives and Republicans. For at least 15 years, Biden has relied on a two-step routine — ruthlessly vilifying his opponents and then appealing to 'our better angels,' a phrase recycled from Lincoln’s first inaugural address. Biden lulled listeners into assuming he is personally one of those 'better angels' as he flailed anyone in the way of his latest power grab. From portraying any Republican who wanted to cut domestic spending as a 'terrorist' in 2011, to claiming that Mitt Romney wanted to put black people back 'in chains' in the 2012 presidential campaign, to endlessly misrepresenting the 2017 violence at a Charlottesville protest, Biden out-Nixoned Nixon. The media has sainted Biden on civil rights despite his championing crime legislation in the Senate that vastly increased the number of black and Hispanic citizens sent to prison. In a 2019 piece headlined 'Joe Biden and the Era of Mass Incarceration,' the New York Times hyped Biden’s favorite fix: 'Lock the S.O.B.s up!' In his final full month before being demoted to lame-duck status, Biden made one last lunge to portray himself as a savior of the Constitution. After a Supreme Court decision blocked rigged political prosecutions of former President Trump, an outraged Biden condemned the decision. Seemingly speaking down from Mount Olympus, Biden declared that presidents 'face moments where you need the wisdom to respect the limits of the power of the office of the presidency.' But then he claimed, 'I know I will respect the limits of the presidential power, as I have for 3½ years.' That line obliterated all the president’s lofty pretenses. While Biden piously invoked the 'rule of law' in that brief statement, he consistently behaved as if his good intentions entitled him to dictatorial power. Biden speedily followed up by proposing a 'No One Is Above the Law' constitutional amendment. But Biden would have been more honest if he labeled his pitch the 'No One Is Above the Law Except Me' amendment. In the same week that Biden trumpeted his proposed amendment, he announced new schemes to avoid complying with the Supreme Court ruling forbidding him from illegally and unilaterally forgiving hundreds of billions of dollars of federal student debt owed by 30 million people. Biden then openly bragged that the decision striking down his program 'didn’t stop me' from canceling student-loan debt with one new scheme after another. No wonder almost half of student-loan debtors are not bothering to pay what they owe Uncle Sam. Biden weaponized federal law at the same time he exempted himself and his appointees from the statute book. FBI agents conducted a heavily televised raid in August 2022 on Donald Trump’s Mar-a-Lago home in Palm Beach, Florida, seizing 33 boxes of evidence and documents. Five months later, the Justice Department announced that Biden may have also wrongfully stored or possessed numerous classified documents in his home and offices. Trump was swiftly indicted for his alleged offenses, while Biden was effectively absolved because jurors would likely see him as an elderly man with a bad memory. Although Biden was unfit to prosecute, he remained fit to possess almost boundless power over America and much of the world — at least until Democratic Party poohbahs and billionaire donors carried out a de facto coup ending his reelection campaign. Biden is seeking to portray himself as the patron saint of the Rule of Law. The president spoke in June 2024 as if he worshipped legal procedures, but his devotion is selective. Biden has stretched executive power far beyond reason. The FBI has illegally wiretapped more than 3 million Americans in recent years, but the Biden administration recently torpedoed congressional efforts to curb that surveillance crime spree. The FBI has 80 agents on a task force to curb 'subversive data utilized to drive a wedge between the populace and the government.' Multiple FBI offices across the nation may have secretly infiltrated church services to 'identify the bad Catholics' (those who prefer traditional church services), according to FBI memos and whistleblowers. An FBI analysis justifying targeting Catholics portrayed rosaries as extremist symbols that helped justify federal targeting. The FBI classified all 1,000 people arrested on charges linked to January 6 as domestic terrorists — including peaceful grandmothers. No wonder that people joke that FBI now stands for 'Following Biden’s Instructions.' In a spiel last summer before Democratic Party leaders labeled him mentally unfit, Biden invoked 'the character of George Washington,' which he said 'defined the presidency' with his belief that 'power was limited, not absolute.' Biden claimed that 'character' was the only restraint on White House power — suggesting that Americans were luckier than ever to have him in the Oval Office. Biden pirouetting as a constitutional vestal virgin is on par with Henry Kissinger winning the Nobel Peace Prize after ravaging Southeast Asia — an award that spurred Tom Lehrer to proclaim that satire was dead. Biden did not permit his victory laps to interfere with his ongoing coverups designed to assure that Americans remained ignorant of Biden administration scandals till after Election Day. Americans did not learn the hard facts (despite a congressional investigation) about allegations on Tim Walz’s connections to the Chinese Communist Party, or the full details on the Secret Service’s failure to protect Trump, or the White House string-pulling for the federal censors muzzling countless Americans to safeguard the Biden administration’s reputation. And the Biden White House continued deluging Americans with phony claims of progress in Ukraine’s war against Russia while refusing to disclose almost any details on exactly how the U.S. was intervening and risking World War Three. Rather than pound the White House for belated disclosures that could change the outcome of the election, much of the media simply continued reciting 'Orange Man Bad.' If the Wizard of Oz was a contemporary political campaign story, the media would overwhelmingly side with the guy behind the curtain. Nowadays, withholding evidence is the only proof of innocence required in Washington. At a 2023 Juneteenth celebration, Biden proclaimed that he would need a second term to 'literally redeem the soul of America.' Biden missed that train. He also missed the chance to satisfy his gender-fluid supporters by publicly coming out and personally identifying as 'nondictator.' Biden helped turn Washington into an Impunity Democracy in which government officials pay no price for their crimes. Thanks in part to Biden’s efforts stretching back to the Nixon era, Americans today are more likely to believe in witches, ghosts, and astrology than to trust the federal government. But Biden’s apologists will seek to redeem his name in the history books by defining down dictator. Instead of designating a ruler who tramples the law and Constitution, 'dictatorship' will only refer to presidents who publicly proclaim their plans to do bad things to good people. An earlier version of this piece was published by the Future of Freedom Foundation.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWch3Zvb2hjSSD_7JE5fHT_C	2025-01-16T16:01:35-08:00	
New Year Sees Uptick And Expansion Of Fighting On Ukraine’s Front...	The recent holiday and New Year season brought no respite in Ukraine, but rather an escalation and even expansion of the fighting, consistent with developments in 2024, the UN Under-Secretary-General for Political Affairs said in a briefing to the Security Council on Thursday. 'Most disturbingly, in 2024 we witnessed an alarming rise in the toll of civilian casualties,' Rosemary DiCarlo told ambassadors. She said the total number of civilians killed and injured last year was 30 per cent higher than in 2023, citing figures from the UN human rights office, OHCHR. Child toll ‘particularly distressing’ The increase in child casualties was 'particularly distressing' as more boys and girls were killed or wounded in the first three quarters of 2024 than in all of 2023. At least 12,456 civilians were killed in Ukraine from February 2022, when the war began, through December 2024. Among them were 669 children. Another 28,382 adults and 1,833 children were injured. Actual figures are likely to be significantly higher. Verified attacks on schools and hospitals also increased, with more than 580 educational and health facilities damaged or destroyed within nine months. Death and displacement continue This month has also been marred by violence. At least 13 people were reportedly killed and more than 100 injured in an attack in Zaporizhzhia on 9 January. 'Hostilities in the last two weeks have forced new displacements, with more than 1,600 people, including children, fleeing frontline areas, primarily in the Donetsk and Kharkiv regions, according to local authorities,' she said. Civilian casualties were also recorded in Russian-occupied territories. An alleged Ukrainian strike on a supermarket in Donetsk city on 10 January reportedly left two people dead, and two others injured. Ms. DiCarlo reiterated the UN’s unequivocal condemnation of all attacks targeting civilians and civilian infrastructure, adding that they must cease. Diplomats and humanitarians impacted The daily attacks have also made things increasingly difficult for the diplomatic community and international organizations operating in Ukraine. A 20 December strike on the capital, Kyiv, damaged six foreign embassies. Days before, a drone attack struck a vehicle belonging to the UN nuclear energy agency, IAEA, near the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant, located in the south. 'For humanitarian workers, too, this was another difficult year. Ten aid workers were killed and 41 injured in the line of duty,' she said. North Korean troops Ms. DiCarlo reported that as fierce fighting continues in the east and south of Ukraine, deadly clashes persist in Russia’s Kursk region, and the UN remains concerned over the impact on both sides of the border. Furthermore, there are reports that military personnel from the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea (DPRK), commonly known as North Korea, were captured in the Kursk region. 'The reported involvement of the DPRK troops in fighting alongside the Russian forces continues to raise serious concerns regarding further internationalization of this already dangerous conflict,' she said. Dire humanitarian crisis Ms. DiCarlo also addressed the dire humanitarian crisis in Ukraine. On Thursday, the UN and the Government launched a $2.6 billion plan to assist some six million people this year, which she urged the international community to fully support. She noted that the number of those in need has decreased, from 14.6 million in 2024 to 12.7 million now, due to improved access to services in the capital and other major urban centres. However, conditions near the front lines have reached catastrophic levels. She urged the Council not to forget about the many thousands of Ukrainian civilians living in Russian-occupied territories. 'The needs in these areas are estimated to be severe and worsened by extremely limited humanitarian access. We renew our call for the safe, rapid and unimpeded passage of humanitarian relief to all civilians in need,' she said. Energy grid under attack The humanitarian situation is compounded by the current harsh winter conditions and the widespread damage that Russia’s attacks have caused to energy production, with the latest wave occurring the previous day. During the last quarter of 2024, Russia carried out at least four large-scale coordinated attacks targeting energy infrastructure. Meanwhile, the UN continues to work with the Ukrainian authorities to restore energy generation capacity, while creating opportunities in the renewable energy sector. Prisoners of War Turning to other matters, Ms. DiCarlo said reports indicate that Russia and Ukraine conducted a prisoner exchange on Wednesday, resulting in 50 people returning to their homes. While welcoming the development, and the reported exchange of more than 300 prisoners of war late last month, she said the UN remains alarmed by reports of executions of Ukrainian prisoners of war (POWs) by Russian forces. A recent UN human rights report assessed that allegations of 19 incidents since August, involving the killing of 62 persons, were credible. It also found that Russia has used widespread and systematic torture against Ukrainian POWs. Furthermore, the use of torture against Russian prisoners of war by Ukrainian forces has also been documented, and the Ukrainian authorities have reportedly opened investigations into the accusations. Ms. DiCarlo concluded her remarks by stating that as the third anniversary of the Russian invasion approaches, 'global calls for de-escalation and the beginning of a process to end the fighting are growing louder.' She said the Secretary-General’s good offices remain available to support all good faith efforts towards a just, lasting and comprehensive peace.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWch3Zvb2hjSSHM1X-0KuOaN	2025-01-16T15:59:25-08:00	
Trump Keeps Tariffs On Table In Call With Denmark On Greenland	By Magnus Lund Nielsen (EurActiv) -- US President-elect Donald Trump did not withdraw his previous threat of targeted tariffs on Danish goods in a phone call with Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen, as his desire for control of Greenland shows no sign of abating. The 45-minute conversation between Trump and Frederiksen on Wednesday was focused on Greenland, Frederiksen's office said in post on social media. On Thursday, Frederiksen told Danish media TV2 that Trump's threats of targeted tariffs on Danish goods were still present after the conversation. Frederiksen said she spoke with Greenlandic Prime Minister Múte B. Egede both before and immediately after the phone call. Senior figures from the Danish business sector were invited for a briefing at the prime minister's offices in Copenhagen later on Thursday. Trump first mentioned his economic threats against Denmark in a press conference at his Mar-a-Lago estate last week, saying he would 'tariff Denmark at a very high level' if the country did not cede or sell Greenland. 'We are in a serious situation,' Frederiksen told reporters in Copenhagen on Thursday. A spokesperson for the European Commission told Euractiv that 'The EU has instruments and processes in place to deal with unfair economic coercion against a single member state'. After Donald Trump’s first term in the White House, the European Commission proposed the Anti-Coercion Instrument (ACI) for such purposes. The Commission can impose counter-tariffs unilaterally without the approval of member states. The conversation between the president-elect and the Danish leader took place after an eventful few weeks that have strained relations between Washington, Nuuk and Copenhagen. Trump has repeatedly expresssed a desire to achieve 'control and ownership' of Greenland, an autonomous territory of Denmark – an EU and NATO member – and has refused to rule out using military or economic muscle to do so. His son then paid Greenland's capital a surprise visit, fuelling further speculation. However, officials from Denmark and Greenland have repeatedly stated that the autonomous region is not for sale. Trump first mentioned buying Greenland in 2019. Trump has threatened to impose tariffs on goods from a specific EU country at least once previously – with planned duties on French luxury goods eventually shelved shortly before the end of his first term.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWch3Zvb2hjSSM4_VlTcFBnA	2025-01-16T15:57:06-08:00	
US Confident Israel-Hamas Ceasefire, Hostage Release Deal Will St...	U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Thursday he is confident that a Gaza ceasefire and hostage release deal agreed to by Israel and Hamas will start as scheduled on Sunday and end 15 months of fighting despite a last-minute dispute between the warring parties. 'I am confident, and I fully expect that implementation will begin, as we said, on Sunday,' Blinken told reporters in Washington at his farewell news conference as America’s top diplomat. For a while on Thursday, the start of the ceasefire and the initial release of hostages were thrown into question as Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu accused the militants of backtracking on parts of the agreement. A statement from Netanyahu’s office said Hamas was trying to 'extort last-minute concessions.' Netanyahu's office accused Hamas of backtracking on an understanding that he said would give Israel a veto over which Palestinian prisoners convicted of murder would be released in exchange for hostages held by the U.S.-designated terror group. A short time later, Izzat al-Rishq, a senior Hamas official, said the militant group 'is committed to the ceasefire agreement, which was announced by the mediators.' Blinken said, 'It's not exactly surprising that in a process and negotiation that has been this challenging and this fraught, you may get a loose end,' Blinken said. 'We're tying up that loose end as we speak.' Netanyahu said his Cabinet would not meet to give necessary approval to the agreement until the militant group accepts all the elements. One Israeli official said the vote was now likely to occur on Friday. Even with the prospective ceasefire days away, Palestinian medics said Israeli forces carried out multiple airstrikes Thursday in Gaza, killing at least 77 people in the narrow strip of land along the shores of the Mediterranean Sea since the ceasefire was announced. If the ceasefire takes hold, U.N. agencies said they were ready to surge humanitarian aid to Palestinians in Gaza, where the United Nations says at least 1.9 million of the 2.3 million people living there have been displaced, and 92% of housing units have been destroyed. Israeli President Isaac Herzog offered his strong support for the ceasefire after the deal was announced Wednesday. 'As the President of the State of Israel, I say in the clearest terms: This is the right move,' he said. 'This is an important move. This is a necessary move. There is no greater moral, human, Jewish or Israeli obligation than to bring our sons and daughters back to us — whether to recover at home or to be laid to rest.' But one of the main opponents of the deal in the government, Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich, called it 'a bad and dangerous deal for the national security of the State of Israel.' The first phase of the agreement includes a 42-day ceasefire, the release of 33 hostages from Gaza, the release of Palestinian prisoners from Israel, a phased Israeli military withdrawal from Gaza and an increased flow of aid for Palestinian civilians. During the first phase, there will be negotiations on the details of a second phase focused on bringing a permanent end to the conflict with the release of the remaining hostages and a full Israeli troop withdrawal. A final phase concerns rebuilding Gaza, with a new governing and security structure. The war in Gaza began when Hamas sent its fighters into Israel in an Oct. 7, 2023, terror attack that killed more than 1,200 people and led to the abduction of about 250 hostages. Of those hostages, just under 100 are thought to remain in Hamas custody, but about a third are believed to be dead. Gaza authorities say nearly 47,000 Palestinians — most of them children and women — have been killed in Israeli military operations. Israel, without providing evidence, says the death toll includes 17,000 militants it has killed. In a statement, the Hostages and Missing Families Forum, which includes the families of 98 hostages, said Wednesday it welcomes 'with overwhelming joy and relief the agreement to bring our loved ones home.' 'However, deep anxiety and concerns accompany us regarding the possibility that the agreement might not be fully implemented, leaving hostages behind,' the statement continued. 'We urgently call for swift arrangements to ensure all phases of the deal are carried out.' A senior official with the outgoing administration of U.S. President Joe Biden told reporters that two of the living American hostages — Keith Siegel and Sagui Dekel-Chen — will be among the first hostages released. The official spoke to reporters on condition of anonymity, as customary in such briefings. 'Fighting in Gaza will stop, and soon the hostages return home to their families,' Biden said as he announced the ceasefire deal Wednesday at the White House. Biden urged his successor, President-elect Donald Trump, to implement the agreement, as Biden prepares to hand over power on Monday. Trump said on his social media network that he was 'thrilled' and that his administration would build upon the success of this deal to expand U.S.-mediated Abraham Accords to normalize Arab-Israeli relations. 'This EPIC ceasefire agreement could have only happened as a result of our Historic Victory in November, as it signaled to the entire World that my Administration would seek Peace and negotiate deals to ensure the safety of all Americans, and our Allies,' he wrote on Truth Social. Analysts say Trump’s fiery threats last week — of 'all hell' breaking loose against Hamas unless there was a deal before his inauguration — may have played a role. 'President-elect Trump has been very, very clear. He said he would unleash hell on Hamas if the hostages weren't released,' said Mirette Mabrouk, a senior fellow at the Middle East Institute. 'I mean, really, there isn't very much more hell that you could unleash on the current inhabitants of Gaza. They're already in hell, but there's also the feeling that he must have placed some pressure on Prime Minister Netanyahu as well. And this is why we are now moving forward.'	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWch3Zvb2hjSSPLr4n4uf8L2	2025-01-16T15:54:15-08:00	
Experts Weigh Chance Of Success In New South China Sea Case Again...	Philippine officials have suggested that, in the face of grave aggression from China in the South China Sea, new legal action is not a matter of if, but when. Jonathan Malaya, assistant director-general of the National Security Council, told a press briefing this week that, being pushed 'to the wall,' Manila is considering all options including new international lawsuits.In 2013, the Philippines filed an arbitration case against China under the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, or UNCLOS, the first time any nation had challenged China over its maritime claims. Known as PCA Case No. 2013-19, it ended in 2016 in victory for the Philippines, with the arbitral tribunal ruling in favor of the Philippines on most of its submissions and rejecting China’s claim of historic rights to vast areas in the South China Sea using the so-called nine-dash line on its maps. Nearly 10 years on, China still refuses to accept the ruling despite it being final and binding for all parties concerned. Renewed efforts Under former President Rodrigo Duterte, the Philippines and China appeared to have shelved the tribunal’s decision, a loss of opportunity to those who wanted to promote a new legal framework for the South China Sea. Yet there have been constant calls on the Philippine government since President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. took power to renew efforts to reinforce the ruling, including by filing new cases. 'I have recommended the filing of the following cases before an UNCLOS tribunal,' said former Justice Antonio Carpio, part of the legal team that defended the Philippines' case in 2016. 'The first is compulsory arbitration over the overlapping claims in the continental shelf beyond the exclusive economic zone of the Philippines in the Spratlys.' UNCLOS determines that a littoral country’s exclusive economic zone, or EEZ, measures 200 nautical miles from the shore and the continental shelf may extend beyond the EEZ. 'The second case is compulsory arbitration for damages arising from the ramming by Chinese coast guard vessels of Philippine coast guard vessels,' Carpio told Radio Free Asia, referring to a number of serious incidents over the last few years near disputed reefs including Sabina Shoal and Scarborough Shoal. 'And the third case is compulsory arbitration to establish the rules to govern fishing in Scarborough Shoal which the 2016 tribunal declared is a historic fishing ground of Filipino, Chinese and Vietnamese fishermen,' Carpio added. China, which took de-facto control of Scarborough Shoal in 2012, has been accused of blocking Philippine ships from accessing the area and harassing them. The world’s largest coast guard vessel 5901, China’s ‘Monster’, has been operating inside the Philippines’ EEZ almost constantly since the beginning of the year to exert control over the Scarborough Shoal area. Support for UNCLOS Building upon the 2016 ruling under UNCLOS may be a smart move that could garner international support but a maritime expert suggested that 'making greater use of the United Nations would expand Philippine options for arbitration.' Greg Poling, director of the Asia Maritime Transparency Initiative at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington, wrote in a recent article that even though the U.N. cannot compel China to comply with the 2016 arbitral award 'the General Assembly would be able to pass nonbinding resolutions and, most importantly, forward the matter to the International Court of Justice for an advisory opinion.' Poling suggested that the Philippines could file with the General Assembly a resolution demanding compliance with the 2016 arbitration, which it would win. It could also file another resolution seeking an advisory opinion from the International Court of Justice on issues such as whether China’s behavior violates international treaties, and it could win that, too. He argued that 'repeated losses in different international bodies would raise the costs of noncompliance and make a face-saving compromise progressively more attractive' for China. 'International law is not self-enforcing,' Poling said, adding that an arbitral victory is only useful if it could be used to rally international support, impose costs, and eventually compel at least partial compliance by the wrongdoing party. 'We have thought about submitting a resolution before the U.N. General Assembly,' said former Justice Antonio Carpio. 'This needs prior lobbying for votes.' 'It would be reckless to ask for a U.N. General Assembly vote unless you have a headcount of how many votes you will get,' the legal expert said. But that’s when the Philippines’ ally the United States and like-minded nations could come to its support, said Greg Poling. 'The U.S. should lobby other states to vote with the Philippines,' he told RFA.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWch3Zvb2hjSSKLNcbP27yVB	2025-01-16T15:52:55-08:00	
Joe Biden’s Terrible Legacy – OpEd	The moniker 'Genocide Joe' is well deserved and one that Joe Biden can never live down, along with any other names that describe the damage he brought to the country and to the world. His legacy is that in every position he held, he was a happy servant for imperialist and neo-liberal interests, like all of his white house predecessors. On January 20, 2025, Joseph R. Biden will no longer be president of the United States. Unlike other one term presidents he was not defeated in a re-election effort. He was undone by the same wealthy donors who rigged the process to make him the Democratic Party’s nominee in 2020. Biden was already not up to the task of running in 2020 but his obvious state of debility had noticeably worsened by 2024. He could no longer rely on claims that he only had a stutter when there were so many strange outbursts, verbal miscues, handshakes with invisible people, and wandering off as a toddler would do. The June 2024 debate with Donald Trump sealed the deal and the forces who had previously been reluctant to say the emperor had no clothes, moved against him. He was forced to stand down. The attempt to shoehorn Kamala Harris in at the last minute failed spectacularly and Donald Trump will be president again. At this moment it is important to remember Joe Biden’s racism, slavish devotion to neo-liberalism and imperialism, and to a genocide in partnership with Israel, which he committed to carrying out until his last days in office. Serious ceasefire negotiations, now in place were the work of the incoming Trump team, while Biden, with bipartisan congressional support, assisted in every atrocity and war crime. Joe Biden was nothing if not consistent during his career as a senator, vice president and finally president. He was a reliably conservative Democratic Party senator, one who often expressed himself using insulting and racist language when discussing government policy. No one should have been shocked when Biden had one of his famous angry moments in a meeting with Black leaders as president elect in December 2020. The group’s modest requests for voting rights protections and the need for federal intervention to address police brutality were dismissed by the man that millions of Black people helped to win the presidency. At one point the notorious Biden temper rose up and he chastised the group. 'If it doesn’t count for y’all to hell with y’all!' He meant the words and governed accordingly, only living up to his promise to rich funders during his campaign in 2020, assuring them that in his administration, 'No one's standard of living will change, nothing would fundamentally change.' He was true to his word, refusing to take any action that the oligarchy didn’t want to see realized. In foreign policy he was always hawkish and always a zionist. All of the machinations that made Biden the democrats’ nominee in 2020 and eventually president brought disaster to millions of people. In 2022 he instigated a war with Russia, using Ukraine as a U.S. proxy. Three years later the war rages on but Biden failed to as he said, 'reduce the ruble to rubble .' Instead, the futile effort to sanction Russia’s energy sector increased consumer prices in the United States and internationally. He then pivoted with the forgettable phrase 'Putin’s price hike ' in hopes that struggling people wouldn’t blame him for worsening their lives. The foolish phrase soon disappeared but popular discontent didn’t and helped to defeat Kamala Harris. Biden was maniacal in his commitment to using Ukraine to weaken Russia. On September 26, 2022, two of the NordStream pipelines which connected gas lines from Russia to Germany mysteriously exploded. The U.S. was the suspected perpetrator from the very beginning and in February 2023 investigative journalist Seymour Hersh provided solid evidence that Biden and his foreign policy team were responsible for the terrorist attack on an ally. Without inexpensive Russian gas, Germany was forced to buy more expensive U.S. liquefied natural gas (LNG) and in the process has ruined its own economy but like a good little vassal, has not dared to speak about what is obvious to anyone who is paying attention. Bipartisan support for the war in Ukraine has cost $183 billion in public funding and thousands of Ukrainian lives. The administration is even forcing Ukraine to lower the conscription age to 18 and send very young men into battle as cannon fodder. Any stated concerns about that country’s fate are fake as the Biden administration scuttled a tentative peace agreement between Ukraine and Russia which took place shortly after the war began. The continuation of death and destruction there are all the fault of the U.S. While money was sent to Ukraine in a hand over fist fashion, people in this country were always told that they had no needs which their government needed to address. The outpouring of spending during the covid era provided stimulus payments and increased eligibility for Medicaid and SNAP nutritional benefits. But it all ended and millions of people were asked to vote for Kamala Harris despite being made destitute. Nearly seven millionwho had voted for Biden in 2020 chose not to in 2024 and Harris and Biden will be spectators at Trump’s inauguration. There were a reported 771,480 homeless people in 2024, an 18% increase over the previous year. Once again we see that the ending of pandemic programs which included eviction moratoriums, rental assistance, and tax credit programs had devastating impacts. The Biden administration responded by blaming an influx of migration and natural disasters , never mentioning its own role in perpetuating this crisis of low wages and lack of affordability. But the one issue which seals Biden’s eternal disgrace is his support of Israel. Immediately after Operation Al-Aqsa Flood began on October 7, 2023, Biden raced to Israel to publicly declare his support for the apartheid state. Since that time more than $17.9 billion in military aid has gone to Israel, with a new $8 billion sale announced just one week ago. The term sale is a misnomer, Israel actually spends money the U.S. allocates to buy more weaponry. As of July 2024 there were an estimated 186,000 people killed by the Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) in Gaza and none of those deaths would have occurred without U.S. support. The International Criminal Court (ICC) issued arrest warrants for Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu and the former defense minister in November 2024 but Joe Biden, Secretary of State Antony Blinken, and National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan should also be threatened with arrest. Of course congressional leadership should also be on that list because they too are culpable in the crimes which included targeted assassination of journalists and public officials, destruction of hospitals, destruction of homes followed by the bombing of tent camps where people were then forced to live. In real time the world has seen people burned alive, and watched as Israeli civilians and officials blocked food aid from coming to needy people. The IDF has committed rapes and soldiers rioted when there was a possibility of punishment of the perpetrators. All of these crimes can be laid at Joe Biden’s feet. Now it is Donald Trump who can take credit for moving a ceasefire proposal forward, a proposal whose provisions were accepted by Hamas months ago. Of course it was Black people who first warned Biden that his policy regarding Israel might lead to defeat. Black clergy spoke up first. 'Black faith leaders are extremely disappointed in the Biden administration on this issue,' said Rev. Timothy McDonald of Atlanta. 'We are afraid. And we’ve talked about it — it’s going to be very hard to persuade our people to go back to the polls and vote for Biden.' The most loyal demographic for the democrats foretold the eventual outcome. Black politics is in a weakened state with prominent misleaders and surrogates urging support for democrats. But all of the people can’t be fooled all of the time. In 2024 fewer of them could be corralled into holding their noses and voting for Kamala Harris. Joe Biden is truly Genocide Joe. He is also Austerity Joe and Militarism Joe. All of the worst imperatives of the duopoly have been prioritized by a one-term administration to such a degree that victory became impossible. It is strange that when Biden’s 2020 victory over Trump was announced, there was quite literally partying in the streets in cities across the country. But there is no fond memory of him now. The words 'But Trump!' that were used to silence anyone questioning Biden’s actions now ring hollow. Trump may indeed live up to the worst expectations about him. He may have the 'mass deportations' that he pledged, but Biden deported more people in his one term than Trump did in his first. As always historians will whitewash a president’s actions and find ways to sing praises of some kind. The words will ring hollow however, and the homeless in the U.S. and in Gaza will have the final say. Joe Biden’s legacy is one of immiseration, war making, and death. During Jimmy Carter’s funeral he fell asleep in a perfect denouement symbolizing a presidency which ends in ignominy and disgrace.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWch3Zvb2hjSSO6mFSNniVz8	2025-01-16T15:50:37-08:00	
Reflecting On Turkish-American Relations In A Second Trump Term –...	By Selim Koru (FPRI) -- The election of Donald J. Trump for a second term marks a major shift in global politics. It appears that the neoliberal era, marked by free trade and liberal political norms, has come to an end. It is difficult to predict what will come in its place, but the new era seems to be heavy on civilizational politics and economic fragmentation. One country that seems excited about the coming order is Turkey, where President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan has been governing for almost a quarter century and will likely remain in power for years to come. This paper will assess Erdoğan’s time in power, dividing Turkish foreign policy into three distinct periods: 2002 to 2012, 2013 to 2023, and the third marked by the current alignment. It will then use this as a basis for thinking about Turkish-American relations in the coming years. I will argue that, while the Erdoğan and Trump governments could find common areas in the short term, their political bases are far apart, which could create difficulties for the alliance in the medium to long run. The First Phase: 2002-2012 The first phase (2002 to 2012) was characterized by political and economic liberalization. The Justice and Development Party (AK Party) rose to power in these years as a reformist group. Its leaders broke from the far-right Islamist tradition and created a centrist movement heavily inspired by third way liberalism in the United States and United Kingdom, as well as Christian Democracy in Europe. They were to be social moderates who also embraced the neoliberal economic paradigm of the time. The centerpiece of their foreign policy was Turkey’s accession bid to the European Union. Its Islamist roots enabled the AK Party government to maintain its conservative base, while its new stance allowed it to forge a bond with liberal and progressive elements at home and abroad. Today this period is often thought of as the golden age of Turkey-US relations, but that was not evident at the time. The AK Party was ambivalent about former President George W. Bush, his 'War on Terror,' and Washington’s liberal interventionists. Turkey famously did not allow the United States to use Turkish territory in its ground invasion of Iraq in 2003, and neoconservative was a dirty word in Ankara. Still, Turkey’s new government was relatively accommodating to American interests and focused on economic development and EU reforms at home. In 2008, the AK Party’s leadership was ebullient about the election of former President Barack Hussein Obama, whom they saw as an agent for reconciliation with the Islamic world. The optimism culminated with the Arab Spring protests and the rise of the Turkish model as an American-approved prescription for the Arab world. Yet, Ankara and Washington were not able to shape these movements. The AK Party came to be dominated by Erdoğan, who sharpened its extractive and exclusionary aspects, losing the support of liberals and facing opposition from civil society. Turkey’s relations with Israel also worsened with Erdoğan’s blowout against former Israeli Prime Minister Shimon Peres at Davos in 2009 and with a flotilla that Turkish organizations sent to Gaza in 2010 that was raided by Israeli security forces. Liberal Turkey was tipping into a more reactionary place conducive to the centralization of power. The era ended with the Gezi Park protests of 2013, a nationwide progressive movement against the AK Party’s rule. Erdoğan suppressed the protests forcefully and accused Western powers of instigating them. The same year, a bitter feud erupted between Erdoğan and his erstwhile ally, Fethullah Gülen, leading to waves of purges throughout the next decade. The Second Phase: 2013-2023 The second phase of Turkish foreign policy (2013 to 2023) was characterized by strident self-assertion, often bordering on revisionism. This was also a time when the AK Party government captured the country’s institutions and built its own political regime within the husk of the failing Kemalist order. The coup attempt in 2016 solidified this transformation and allowed Erdoğan to create the 'executive presidency,' which effectively combines the powers of the judiciary, legislature, and the executive. The Obama White House was souring on Erdoğan over his authoritarian politics, but US-Turkey relations really declined over the Syrian civil war. The countries tried to cooperate at first but later pursued their own, often conflicting goals. The United States worked with the Kurdistan Workers’ Party (PKK)-affiliated People’s Defense Units to defeat ISIS, while Turkey worked with Islamist groups against the Assad regime and the People’s Defense Units. The Erdoğan palace also publicly implied that the United States was responsible for the 2016 coup attempt and blamed Washington for its refusal to extradite Gülen, whom it believed to have masterminded the operation. Turkey sought to curb its dependence on the Transatlantic Alliance, pouring more money and attention into its indigenous defense and developing deeper relationships with revisionist powers. Ankara bought top-shelf military technology from Russia and became more serious about building up its relationship with China. The EU accession process was effectively over, but Erdoğan maintained strong relations with leaders in Eastern Europe, such as Prime Minister Viktor Orbán of Hungary and President Aleksandar Vučić of Serbia, and eventually Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni of Italy. Turkey supported Ukraine in its defense against Russia, but it often echoed Russian talking points about the causation and possible resolution to the war. From the perspective of Turkish nationalists, the most exciting aspect of these years was Turkey’s growing footprint across the world. The Turkish military conducted several incursions into Syria, taking and occupying territory in that civil war, and staged operations in Iraq, pursuing PKK targets and thereby solidifying its presence in that country. It also established military bases in Somalia, Qatar, and Libya. Under the 'Blue Homeland' doctrine, Turkey acted far more aggressively to set its maritime claims in the Eastern Mediterranean. In the Caucasus, Turkey backed Azerbaijan’s military to take back Nagorno-Karabakh. The effort began in 2020, re-erupted in 2022, and culminated with a complete Azerbaijani victory in 2023. A growing array of Turkish defense contractors and military leaders also built relationships across Africa and Central Asia. Perhaps Turkey’s most risky policies during this period, however, were in the realm of the economy. Turkey experimented with alternatives to neoliberal orthodoxy like ending central bank independence, cutting interest rates in the face of inflation, and boosting spending. The resulting infusion of cash into the economy allowed the Erdoğan palace to make it through contentious elections and referenda.[1] The Minister of Finance, Berat Albayrak, who also happened to be Erdoğan’s son-in-law, framed his economic policy as a struggle against the American-dominated global financial system. He claimed that Turkey would look for new trade partners and sources of finance, but he was never able to articulate a clear alternative policy. Turkey did boost export numbers and saw growth across low-value-added sectors, but this also resulted in an inflationary cascade and an exodus of investors. The standard of living dropped for the vast majority of Turkey’s citizens. In 2020, Albayrak resigned in a huff, and successive economic teams were reduced to crisscrossing the Gulf monarchies to scrape up funding. It was mostly this economic trajectory that ultimately stopped Turkey’s revisionist streak. As the country was approaching the 2023 elections, Erdoğan increased public spending, campaigned on a muscular revisionist platform, and prepared for a return to orthodoxy. The Third Phase: 2023-Present Since Erdoğan won the general elections of 2023, Turkey has entered the third phase of foreign policy in the AK Party era. In this phase, the presidential palace appears determined to expand its domestic project, deepening its dominance over institutions, politics, and culture, but its economic and foreign policies have undergone significant changes. The presidential palace has curtailed, or at the very least postponed, its revisionist ambitions. Erdoğan signaled the changes with the appointment of three cabinet ministers: Mehmet Şimşek as the minister of finance, Hakan Fidan as the minister of foreign affairs, and Ali Yerlikaya as the minister of the interior. Another significant appointment was İbrahim Kalın, hitherto the presidential spokesperson and chief strategist, as the head of the National Intelligence Organization. All four men are known for unwavering loyalty to Erdoğan, and all have reputations for being heavy on policy and dry on politics. The sharpest change in this period has been in economic policy. Under Şimşek, Turkey has been determined to undo the damage to its credibility in the global financial community, bring down inflation, and re-attract investment. To this end, the Central Bank has raised interest rates to 50 percent and kept them there until December 2024, while Şimşek has implemented tight fiscal discipline. The brunt of the burden has been borne by wage earners and consumers, which cost the government dearly in the 2024 regional elections, but Erdoğan seems determined to stay the course. Despite the country’s persistent problems, most economists expect inflation to come under control in the coming years, and for the country to continue developing into a significant industrial power. The reversal in policy therefore seems to have averted catastrophe for the Turkish economy. On the diplomatic front, Turkey is trying to engage the West in a rapprochement and started by lifting its veto on Sweden’s membership in NATO. This was not a return to the liberalism of the first decade of the twenty-first century, but rather a step back from the precipice of the revisionism of the 2010s. It also helps that Fidan is a much stronger foreign minister than Mevlüt Çavuşoğlu and can build authority without engaging in civilizational polemics with his Western counterparts. Ankara’s various actors are no longer free to engage in international spats but have to coordinate tightly with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. In August 2024, Fidan was invited to the Gymnich meeting of EU foreign ministers, and he appears to enjoy the respect of political actors in Washington. Leading up to the 2024 US elections, the Western world was holding its breath, and Turkey’s rapprochement yielded few policy results. Some Western countries lifted some restrictions on weapon exports to Turkey after Sweden acceded to NATO, but nothing concrete on customs union modernization or Turkey’s return to the F-35 program. Western countries also have not seriously entertained Erdoğan’s offers to mediate in conflicts like Ukraine and Israel-Palestine. Still, Turkey was now on firm footing. With the spectacular return of Trump to the White House, the liberal objections to Erdoğan’s conduct at home have evaporated. Erdoğan and his team look like respectable, mature strategists. The question is how this third phase of Turkish foreign policy will interact with the inherently unpredictable, yet fast-approaching second Trump presidency. Breaking into the Trump Era Trump’s return to the White House was anything but guaranteed. Ankara’s policy elite have consistently favored him and wanted him to win the elections, but they prepared for a Democratic victory. Erdoğan’s 2023 team—and his entire third phase approach—was designed to calm liberal elites in Washington and Brussels and extract favorable deals on technology and trade. With those concerns no longer relevant, the question now is whether Ankara will be able to connect with the incoming Trump team in a meaningful manner. A second Trump presidency could make the world more comfortable for Erdoğan and the type of politics he represents. Liberal norms and multilateral institutions are likely to thin out further in the years ahead, while national sovereignty, military might, industrial brawn, and sheer popularity are going to be more pronounced. Many in Ankara anticipate a time when borders will be redrawn and historic deals will be made by sovereign leaders negotiating behind closed doors. This is why the political elites in the AK Party era have been consistently sympathetic to Trump’s ascendance and strictly critical of the culture and policies of the Democratic Party. Some strategists in the Trump-Erdoğan space have been arguing that the geopolitical interests of Turkey and the United States align very strongly, potentially yielding a powerful partnership. There are good reasons for thinking this way. In the short term, Turkey could help Trump’s team to bring about rapprochement with Russia and end the Ukraine war. While Turkey will likely protest against Washington’s enabling of Israel, it could negotiate for a US withdrawal from Syria and greater control in Iraq, the Eastern Mediterranean, and other territories where the United States is involved. Trump also seems to be interested in continuing to roll back Iranian influence across the Middle East, which has already worked in Ankara’s favor and could continue to be an area of cooperation. Where would things go from there? Discounting some of the cultural factors and looking at the map of the Middle East from a military and economic perspective, Turkey-US interests could continue to align. Turkey is the only power in the region with a large population, wide industrial base, agricultural potential, powerful and increasingly innovative military, and an ambitious trading culture. It has long-standing institutional links to the United States and could help it reach areas where American influence is not as welcome, such as Africa, Central Asia, and the Muslim world at large. Some might consider a closer Turkey-Israel relationship to be icing on this cake, acting as an anchor for American power in the region. This kind of realignment could also help Erdoğan achieve some of the aims he sought in the second phase of his foreign policy. The problem is that this kind of a future has no political basis in Turkey, and considering the latest trends, nor in the United States. For American policymakers of the past decades, Turkey policy and Middle East policy have been in slightly separate categories, but that is quickly changing. The spectacular downfall of the Assad regime and the ascendance of Turkish-backed rebels in Damascus, make Turkey part of the Middle East in a way that it was not before. If Turkey’s efforts continue to yield fruit, the 'Shia Crescent' could soon be replaced by a more popular and more populous Sunni force. Neither Erdoğan’s government nor the nascent Syrian government are likely to emphasize their plans on Israel at this critical juncture, but they will in time place their weight on the side of Palestinian sovereignty. In Israel, meanwhile, far-right movements are now in control of the state and are moving ever more aggressively in their wars and settlement projects. One might think it would be Washington to work with both sides to avert the inevitable clash, but there too the political ground has shifted in ways that Turkey might not be ready for. Erdoğan and his team are used to being the nationalist rebels in an otherwise liberal environment. For over two decades, Islamist operatives like Kalın and Fidan excelled at building relationships with establishment types in Washington. Being the Muslims in the post-Christian West, they could always count on a certain degree of deference, even sympathy. They were prone to give lectures and press their counterparts on issues like the PKK in Syria, Gülen, the coup attempt of 2016, or simply the 'multipolar order.' This was even the case in Trump’s first term when the president was surrounded by handlers like Rex Tillerson, James Mattis, and H. R. McMaster who reined him in. These were also the kinds of people the Erdoğan team was used to dealing with. They were liberals who had trained themselves to look past national and religious symbolism, focusing on immediate economic indicators and security cooperation. Yes, Turkey’s elite acted in strange ways, but they were crucial NATO allies and usually took their commitments seriously. The second Trump term could be significantly different, with a team that amplifies Trump’s nationalism and converts it into policy. Trump’s second term picks are figures like Tulsi Gabbard and Marco Rubio, floated for director of national intelligence and secretary of state respectively. They are as strong friends of Greece and Cyprus as they are critics of Turkey. Pete Hegseth, an Army veteran who might head the Pentagon, is close enough to Christian nationalist groups to have actual crusader tattoos. Even if some of these picks do not make it through the confirmation process, there is no coincidence that their type comes up repeatedly. The premise of reactionary right-wing movements is that they actually cater to the civilizational sentiments of their base. Over time, it becomes difficult to separate political theater from actual policy. When looked at in this way, there are serious conflicts between an 'America First' base and the Islamist, national revivalist base in Turkey. Officials in an 'America First' White House might respect Turkey’s success on the ground, diplomatic outreach, and experience, but they will also be able to tune into its ideological undercurrent. Long confined to the fringes of politics, the MAGA right is familiar with undertaking long political projects and will be more likely to see, and be alarmed by, Ankara’s vision for the region. Turkey has proven that it can connect with far-right movements in Hungary and Italy, but a similar transformation in the United States means a systemic shift, pulling Turkey into areas of actual irreconcilable differences. This could be in Israel, but also elsewhere in the Mediterranean. Greece and Turkey joined NATO together in 1952, and American diplomacy has long been careful about maintaining the delicate balance between the two countries. Trump’s new team might not be similarly inclined. Toward the end of Trump’s second term, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo already had tense relations with Turkey and began to favor Greece, visiting American military bases on the islands. It is possible that this dynamic could strengthen under a second Trump presidency. So, while Erdoğan’s charisma may have some weight with Trump, the political movements that the two men are embedded in are not very compatible. Relations between the countries could improve in the short term but are unlikely to enjoy stability in the coming years.

The Philippines-US Alliance: The Biden Legacy – OpEd	On January 14, 2025, U.S. President Joseph R. Biden Jr. delivered his final address at U.S. Department of State. Echoing his past statements, President Biden declared that the world is at an 'inflection point' and that the 'Cold War period is over, and a new era has begun.' This new era is underpinned by a 'fierce competition' primarily between Washington and Beijing. President Biden underscored that that the U.S. is 'winning the worldwide competition…America is stronger, our alliance are stronger, our adversaries and competitors are weaker.' Mr. Biden’s remarks were in part delivered to consolidate his foreign policy legacy as the 46th President of the United States. As he leaves the White House, it might be worth looking into his administration’s record in dealing with the Philippines-U.S. alliance, the oldest of Washington’s bilateral alliances in East Asia. Repairing Ties President Biden came into office in January 2021 at one of the lowest points in the history of the Philippines-U.S. alliance. Nearly a year before, then-Philippine President Rodrigo R. Duterte declared the abrogation of the 1998 Visiting Forces Agreement (VFA), a crucial pact which provides the legal basis and framework for the presence and treatment of U.S. forces in the country. The abrogation of the VFA was the culmination of Mr. Duterte’s efforts to upend Philippine foreign. After all, President Duterte was vocal about his desire to 'separate' from the U.S. and 'realign' the Philippines with China. The VFA is an important component of the Philippines-U.S. alliance which is anchored on the 1951 Mutual Defense Treaty (MDT). Under the latter, Manila and Washington agreed to 'act to meet the common dangers in accordance with its constitutional processes' in the event of an 'armed attack in the Pacific Area.' The allies also agreed to 'develop their individual and collective capacity to resist armed attack.' These provisions of the MDT can fully be implemented if Washington has military presence in the Philippines. In other words, the VFA operationalizes the Philippines-U.S. alliance, which is but part of a broader network of U.S.-led system of alliances and partnerships in the Indo-Pacific region. Without the VFA, the Philippines-U.S. alliance would largely be an alliance only in paper. Thus, there was strategic imperative for the Biden administration to restore stability in the Philippines-U.S. alliance. At the start of its term, the Biden administration adopted what was already becoming a bipartisan consensus in Washington – the strategic competition with China. Indeed, the Interim National Security Strategic Guidance, issued within just two months into Mr. Biden’s term, provided that China is the 'only competitor potentially capable of combining its economic, diplomatic, military, and technological power to mount a sustained challenge to a stable and open international system.' Owing in part to its geographical location, the Philippines was (and is) a key actor in the evolving regional power balance. As such, the Biden foreign policy team needed to move quickly to repair the alliance with Manila. Fortunately for the Biden administration, there three major developments which helped persuade President Duterte to reconsider his decision to withdraw from the VFA. First, the Whitsun Reef incident of March 2021 when the Philippine government expressed concern over the presence of more than 200 hundred fishing vessels manned by Chinese maritime militia. This incident, which led to a 'terse exchange of statements' between Manila and Beijing, provided an opportunity for the Biden administration to express its support for the Philippines, as well as to reaffirm the public commitment that the MDT is also applicable in the South China Sea. Second, by its final full year in office, the Duterte administration has little to show for the supposed major infrastructure projects from China. This in turn strengthened the position of those who have strong reservations about Duterte’s foreign policy, including the Philippine defense establishment which has close historical links with the U.S. Third, at the height of the COVID-19 pandemic, the U.S. donation of much needed vaccines. Philippine Ambassador Jose Manuel Romualdez convinced President Duterte to reconsider his decision to end the VFA in light of the health and other challenges caused by the pandemic. Subsequently, Mr. Duterte himself admitted publicly that he 'conceded the continuance of the Visiting Forces Agreement, in gratitude' for the vaccines provided by Washington. Thus, when U.S. Secretary of Defense Lloyd J. Austin III visited the Philippines in July 2021, the Philippine government announced President Duterte decided to fully restore the VFA. Malacañang announced that President Duterte and Secretary Austin had 'open and frank discussion on the status and future direction of Philippines-U.S. engagement.' They agreed that the 'alliance can be further strengthened through enhanced communication and greater cooperation.' Seizing Opportunities The restoration of the VFA provided some measure of stability in the security relations between Manila and Washington. However, it was the Philippine presidential transition in 2022 that provided the Biden administration the opportunity to reinvigorate the alliance with Manila. Although initially perceived to continue the 'Pivot to China' initiative of the Duterte administration, President Ferdinand R. Marcos Jr. shifted course in foreign policy. Indeed, in his speech at the 77th United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) barely three months into his term, Mr. Marcos declared that '[b]y reinforcing the predictability and stability of international law, particularly the 1982 United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, [the Philippines] provided an example of how states should resolve their differences: through reason and through right.' President Marcos reaffirmed the 2016 Arbitral Tribunal Award which his predecessor has dismissed a mere 'piece of paper' which he would 'just throw away.' In a stark departure from Mr. Duterte’s vocal anti-American tendencies, President Marcos, in his first bilateral meeting with President Biden at the sidelines of the 77th UNGA, declared that the Philippines 'continue to look to the United States for that continuing partnership and the maintenance of peace in our region.' Seizing the opportunities, the Biden administration achieved major strides in strengthening the Philippines-U.S. alliance. First, the expansion of the Enhanced Defense Cooperation Agreement (EDCA). Signed in 2014, EDCA provides for the increased rotational presence of U.S. forces in the Philippines. As an implementing agreement of the MDT and VFA, EDCA also seeks to promote interoperability and support the AFP modernization program by identifying 'agreed locations' in which the U.S. military is authorized to, among others, deploy forces and materiel, train, and preposition equipment and supplies. In 2016, the allies announced the initial five EDCA locations: Basa Air Base in Pampanga; Fort Magsaysay in Nueva Ecija; Antonio Bautista Air Base in Palawan; Mactan-Benito Ebuen Air Base in Cebu; and Lumbia Air Base in Cagayan de Oro. In 2023, the Biden administration brokered a deal with the Marcos government for the 'full implementation' of EDCA. This entailed the addition of four new EDCA sites in addition to the original five: Naval Base Camilo Osias in Santa Ana, Cagayan; Camp Melchor Dela Cruz in Gamu, Isabela; Balabac Island in Palawan; and Lal-lo Airport in Cagayan. The strategic location of the bases may suggest that the allies are not just forging closer security cooperation in the context of the West Philippine Sea (WPS), but also of Taiwan. Second, the agreement on the Bilateral Defense Guidelines (BDG). With the aim of promoting better alliance management, the BDG aims to, among others, foster 'a common understanding of roles, missions, and capabilities within the framework of the alliance to face emerging regional and global security challenges.' Anchored on previous U.S. private assurances and public declarations, the BDG provides that an 'armed attack in the Pacific, to include anywhere in the South China Sea [SCS], on either Philippine or U.S. armed forces – which includes both nations’ Coast Guards – aircraft, or public vessels, would invoke mutual defense commitments under Article IV and Article V of the MDT.' Cognizant of China’s coercion below the threshold of armed conflict, the BDG underscores the need to 'build interoperability and cooperation in both conventional and non-conventional domains while taking into account asymmetric, hybrid, and irregular warfare and gray-zone tactics as well as artificial intelligence and other emerging technology areas.' Moreover, mindful of the historical asymmetry that characterized Philippines-U.S. alliance, the BDG provided guidance in order to promote a more equal relationship, including alliance coordination and bilateral planning. Third, the signing of the General Security of Military Information Agreement (GSOMIA). The agreement will serve as a 'framework to facilitate the exchange of classified military information between the Philippines and the United States.' Manila also announced that GSOMIA will 'allow the Philippines access to higher capabilities and big-ticket items from the United States [and ] also open opportunities to pursue similar agreements with like-minded nations.' At the time when GSOMIA was signed, the allies also broke ground on a new combined coordination center at Camp Aguinaldo, the center of the Philippine defense establishment. The Biden administration also saw an expansion of military training exercises and aid to the Philippines. Indeed, the 2024 Balikatan Exercises – the last under the Biden administration – was the largest thus far, with about 16,000 American and Philippine military personnel who participated. With the participation of other like-minded partners like Australia and France, the 2024 Balikatan Exercises 'prepared the combined forces for potential contingencies and disasters and increased each country’s ability to work together to protect Philippine sovereignty and preserve a free and open Indo-Pacific region.' In addition, the U.S. Department of Defense (DOD) announced in April 2023 that it 'intends to expand funding on top of the $82 million' that has already been allocated toward infrastructure investments in the original EDCA sites. In October 2023, Manila and Washington approved sixty-three additional projects to be constructed in the EDCA locations. In 2024, the Philippines announced that it plans to procure the Typhon missile system from the U.S. In its four years in power, the Biden administration managed to take advantage of the opportunities to modernize its oldest bilateral alliance in East Asia. Indeed, the Biden administration also sought to strengthen the alliance management with the convening of first 2+2 Ministerial Dialogue (among defense and foreign ministers) in seven years, and the inaugural 3+3 Meeting (among defense and foreign ministers, and national security advisers). A Network of Alliances While revitalizing the bilateral Philippines-U.S. security relations, the Biden administration also made steps to build a network of alliances in the region. Indeed, in April 2024, Washington hosted the first Japan-Philippines-U.S. trilateral summit. In his remarks, President Biden underscored that 'a great deal of history in our world will be written in the Indo-Pacific over the coming years… we commit to writing that story and a future together, to building an Indo-Pacific that is free, open, prosperous, and secure for all.' In the Joint Vision of Statement issued by Presidents Biden and Marcos, and then-Japanese Prime Minister Kishida Fumio, the leaders expressed their 'serious concerns about the People’s Republic of China’s (PRC) dangerous and aggressive behavior in the South China Sea.' The three leaders also expressed their 'strong opposition to any attempts by the PRC to unilaterally change the status quo by force or coercion in the East China Sea,' as well as underscored the 'importance of peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait as an indispensable element of global security and prosperity.' The trilateral summit launched Luzon Economic Corridor initiative as part of the G7 Partnership for Global Infrastructure and Investment (PGI). As the first PGI initiative in the Indo-Pacific region, the Luzon Economic Corridor aims to support connectivity among Subic Bay, Clark, Manila, and Batangas in the Philippines. The three countries expressed their commitment 'to accelerating coordinated investments in high-impact infrastructure projects, including rail; ports modernization; clean energy and semiconductor supply chains and deployments; agribusiness; and civilian port upgrades at Subic Bay.' Apart from the historic trilateral summit, the Biden administration also sought forge and strengthen cooperation among its allies and partners through other platforms. Indeed, a meeting among the defense ministers of Australia, Japan, the Philippines, and the U.S. was convened for the first time in June 2023. The following year, another meeting of the 'Squad' was convened. In 2024, a Maritime Cooperative Activity (MCA) among the four countries was conducted in the Philippines’ Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ). In doing so, the Squad underscored that they are 'safeguarding the international order based on the rule of law that is the foundation for a peaceful and stable Indo-Pacific region. Our four nations reaffirm the position regarding the 2016 South China Sea Arbitral Tribunal Award as a final and legally binding decision on the parties to the dispute.' Quo Vadis? Indeed, President Biden will leave a legacy of an enhanced Philippines-U.S. alliance. As such, administration of Mr. Donald J. Trump has a strong foundation to build upon as it implements its foreign policy agenda in the Philippines and beyond. There are three areas where the Trump administration can focus on with respect to the Philippines-U.S. alliance. First, the continuous implementation of EDCA, BDG, GSOMIA, and other agreements. Second, further institutionalizing the mechanisms for alliance management. Third, strengthening the efforts to build a network of alliances and partnerships in the region. However, it remains to be seen how the second Trump administration will deal with the Indo-Pacific. Nonetheless, if the first Trump term is any indication, there is reason to believe that President Biden’s successor would likely sustain the upward trajectory of the Philippines-U.S. alliance. After all, it was the first Trump administration that underscored that 'strategic competition, not terrorism, is now the primary concern in U.S. national security,' while describing China as a 'revisionist power.' Moreover, it was the Trump government that clarified treaty commitments to the Philippines in both public statements and domestic legislation, and clarified US South China Sea (SCS) policy. Time will tell if second Trump administration will indeed build upon its predecessor’s foreign policy legacy.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfCV9aVM5t2M2cmIQDJtpnt	2025-01-15T16:36:06-08:00	
Myanmar Four Years After The Coup – Analysis	Almost four years after the February 1, 2021 coup in Myanmar, the military junta’s widespread and systematic abuses against the population – including arbitrary arrests, torture, extrajudicial killings and aerial bombardments of civilians – amount to crimes against humanity and war crimes. For ordinary citizens, the human rights situation in Myanmar continues to deteriorate daily. According to the UN Human Rights Council, Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International, the military’s unlawful airstrikes in the Sagaing region and Kachin State clearly amount to war crimes. There are significant developments on both the domestic and international fronts. However, many of these developments were continuations of existing trends rather than radical new ones (with the exception of the enactment of the Conscription Act). Hence, ordinary Myanmarese continue to live in fear of arrest, torture and military attack, while most military and political powers inside and outside of the country seem to be involved in pursuing their own interests. Continuing Armed Conflict and Violence Data collected by Vimutti shows an overall increase in military fighting in 2024 compared to 2023. In total, Vimutti recorded 192 reports of fighting in 218 of Myanmar’s 330 townships, in every state or region except the Ayeyarwady Region.Fighting has even spread to some townships that had seen little or no conflict in the four years since the coup, such as Chipwi and Tsawlaw townships, in Kachin State; Gwa and Thandwe townships, in Rakhine State; and Hopong, Hsihseng and Lawksawk, in southern Shan State. (Credit: Map Vimutti) This reflects some of the significant gains made by resistance groups over the past year. Areas under resistance control have expanded further. In some cases, notably in Karen State, this has led to Ethnic Armed Organisations (EAOs) reversing decades-old defeats and losses. Resistance groups have also carried out an increasing number of attacks on the capital, Nay Pyi Taw, and attacked military bases during visits by senior officials. These attacks have occurred in parallel with shifts in the conflict dynamics in central Myanmar, suggesting that the area could become even more important for the conflict in 2025. However, the military junta, SAC (State Administration Council), has managed to retake some territory. The military has also demonstrated its ability to adapt and innovate in response to the changing situation, for example through the extensive use of drones. The reintroduction of conscription by the military was, indeed, one of the most significant developments of the year, and has had a profound impact on psychological, social and economic levels, as much (if not more) than on military levels. Civilian Casualties and Political Killings Vimutti’s monitoring, like that of other organizations, shows an increase in civilian casualties in 2024, partly due to a significant increase in airstrikes carried out by the SAC. Amid territorial losses to armed opposition groups, the military has stepped up its 'scorched earth' tactics against civilians. The junta’s extensive air and artillery operations have resulted in bombed schools, refugee camps and medical centers. A group of UN-experts put the number of civilian casualties at more than 6,000. Rakhine State had the highest number of casualties, followed by Shan State and Sagaing Region. The use of indiscriminate explosives by all actors also puts civilians at risk, and in November the International Campaign to Ban Landmines reported that Myanmar would surpass Syria as the country with the highest reported number of landmine casualties in 2023. The media has also reported at least 227 targeted killings in the past year; a similar number to 2023. Incidents occurred in all states and regions except Chin and Karen states. Almost all targeted killings were claimed by resistance groups or can be assumed to be the work of resistance groups, as the targets were aimed at SAC. SAC-appointed administrators were the most common victims. A specific increase in incidents in March and April was directly linked to the introduction of conscription. {A quick note on journalism in parentheses. It is not only in Myanmar that journalists are often forced to navigate difficult and varied landscapes. They often have a different idea of the purpose of journalism than the groups they cover. In Myanmar, according to Hein Thar of Frontier Myanmar, the military regime has completely lost control of the narrative and has given ground to ethnic armed groups and resistance groups after the coup. The military’s hostility towards journalists is notorious; it has arrested, tortured and killed reporters since the coup. But even within the anti-junta forces, there are vastly different media strategies that often reflect their political ideologies.} Education and healthcare From February 2021 to November 2024, the Myanmar military, the feared Tatmadaw, has carried out at least 200 attacks on schools across the country. These attacks include artillery, air and drone strikes, which have damaged or destroyed more than 146 primary, secondary, tertiary (university) and religious schools in Magway, Mandalay and Sagaing regions and in Chin, Kachin, Karen, Karenni and Rakhine states. Resistance groups have also been responsible for some (although an unknown number of) attacks, including the bombing of two secondary schools in Natogyi Township, Mandalay region, where military personnel were stationed. There have been at least 323 reported attacks on the healthcare sector in 2024. These incidents resulted in the deaths of 28 nurses and damage to 126 health facilities. As of September 3, at least 43 hospitals and clinics were still occupied and used by armed groups for non-medical purposes. These figures nevertheless represent a decrease in incidents, casualties and occupations compared to 2023. In addition to the obstruction of health care, the SAC has closed several hospitals this year for the alleged use of personnel involved in the civil disobedience movement; not to mention the fact that it has recruited health workers to serve as combat medics. Climate-related issues have also had a negative impact on the economy in 2024. The extreme heat wave in April and May, exacerbated by electricity and water shortages, led to outbreaks of diseases and even deaths: 1,473 people died from heat-related causes in April alone. In July and September, flooding caused by monsoon rains and typhoons also resulted in illnesses and casualties, as well as significant damage to education and health infrastructure. In July, a report estimated that more than 1,700 schools were closed in nine states/regions; in December, the SAC estimated 875 damaged schools and 241 damaged health facilities, as a result of flooding in the aftermath of Typhoon Yagi. Post-coup trends in declining enrollment and pass rates in SAC-administered final examinations, limited availability and rising prices of medicines and medical supplies, and poor conditions in SAC prisons have continued. Media reports also indicated that in 2024 fewer students had enrolled in higher education after passing their final examinations, compared to students in 2020. In contrast, the opposition has made strides in providing and/or facilitating higher education. However, the Basic Education Completion Assessment examinations administered by the Government of National Unity (NUG) have been criticized, mainly over the decision not to issue certificates to students who ‘violated examination rules and regulations’. Students and their parents argued that the rules failed to take into account the difficult circumstances in which students lived and were required to sit the examinations. Separately, a new trade policy imposed by the SAC in September, requiring importers of pharmaceutical products to deposit export earnings in foreign currency in SAC-accredited banks before applying for an import permit, has worsened the already difficult situation of obtaining needed medicines and medical supplies across the country. Several pharmaceutical companies and importers have since closed or temporarily halted operations, exacerbating the shortage of medicines and driving up the prices of available supplies. Not only have Myanmar residents lost access to preventive medicines and vaccines, but there have also been a number of preventable deaths due to lack of or delays in access to medicines for chronic diseases such as diabetes, hepatitis B, HIV and tuberculosis. Similarly, restrictions on access to medicines and delays in, or even denial of, treatment have led to a number of deaths in SAC prisons, resulting in the death of at least 22 political prisoners in custody in 2024. Perhaps the most notable death was that of former Mandalay Regional Prime Minister and NLD Vice Chairman Dr Zaw Myint Maung. A large crowd attended the latter’s funeral, making it the largest public gathering since the mass protests immediately following the 2021 coup. The death of Dr. Zaw Myint Maung and other prominent political figures have raised particular concerns about the conditions of other elderly political prisoners and those with chronic conditions. Lack of communication with prisoners and access to prisons -- even for established and independent organizations such as the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) -- has raised concerns about the welfare of prisoners, potentially fueling anti-SAC sentiment and leading to accusations against the SAC for violations of international standards for the treatment of prisoners. According to the Assistance Association for Political Prisoners (AAPP), 21,479 political prisoners were still being held at the end of 2024. Throughout the year, there have been consistent reports of the poor conditions in which political prisoners are being held, their mistreatment by prison officials and other prisoners, and their transfer between prisons. Towards a united resistance? Another major story during 2024 was the SAC’s announcement that it would hold elections. The SAC has promised new elections since the 2021 coup, but in 2024 there was a clear shift towards more concrete preparations, notably the Union Election Commission’s ongoing review of political party registrations and the conduct of a census in October. It remains to be seen whether and how this will be organized further. It also remains unclear to what extent the ‘opposition’ can speak with one voice. Some resistance actors are making efforts to set up their own administrations, which have expanded both geographically (as the area occupied by the resistance has expanded) and thematically. Several of these actors have made progress in setting up legal systems. However, these have sometimes been criticised, particularly for their slowness in processing cases. There have also been other tensions between local communities and resistance administrations, including around taxation, natural resource management and the perception that the administrations are acting in an unprofessional manner. Moreover, overlapping spheres of activity and ideological differences have led to tensions and even conflicts among resistance actors, particularly in Chin State. International Tug-of-War Internationally, the UN and ASEAN have both failed to make significant progress in resolving the Myanmar crisis. The UN’s efforts have been hampered by geopolitical divisions (China and Russia are blocking tougher measures) and the SAC’s refusal to engage in meaningful dialogue. Meanwhile, ASEAN continues to rely on the Five-Point Consensus as the main basis for its engagement in Myanmar. This has not proven effective. ASEAN members remain divided on how to handle the situation, and civil society has criticized the continued engagement with the SAC. The main reason is clearly internal divisions within ASEAN. Despite ASEAN’s decision to allow only non-political representation by the SAC at high-level meetings, this has been systematically circumvented by countries such as Thailand, Cambodia and Laos. Senior SAC officials have attended more than 500 ASEAN meetings since 2021, including 20 ministerial meetings. In this context, the opposition has argued that there is no non-political representation through the SAC. Criticism has also been levelled at the failure of both the UN and ASEAN to formally engage with key opposition actors, such as the NUG and EAOs. As James Shwe argued in a recent opinion piece, 'a more nuanced and proactive approach is needed to effectively support Myanmar’s path to democratic transformation'. The role of Western humanitarian aid in helping those in need is also important, but Western diplomatic pressure has so far been negligible, and pro-ASEAN, and therefore ineffective. While sanctions play a role, they will almost certainly have limited impact on any collapse or transformation of the regime. The junta maintains its war economy by manipulating the exchange rate, which has allowed it to weather half-hearted Western measures. The roles of Thailand, India and Bangladesh may be important, but China will be crucial, argues Myanmar watcher David Scott Mathieson. Thailand Of Myanmar's ASEAN neighbours, Thailand has been the most active, including hosting informal ASEAN meetings on the situation in Myanmar. But The Diplomat is pretty tough on Thailand: 'Rather than pursuing diplomatic dead ends, Thai leaders should focus their energies on areas that can bring tangible benefits to the people of Myanmar: ending the exploitation, extortion and forced return of asylum seekers from Myanmar; combating rising xenophobia and anti-Myanmar sentiment online and offline; channeling cross-border aid through community groups; blocking all arms sales to Myanmar in line with the 2021 UN General Assembly resolution; and ordering Thai banks to halt financial transactions that sanction junta entities.' But, as I argued here some time ago, there are too many conflicting ‘interests’ preventing this. Recent infractions by the China-backed United Wa State Army ( UWSA) have left Bangkok with some tough decisions to make. The UWSA generates significant revenue from the production and trade of narcotics. Much of the contraband flows through Thailand, meaning that certain Thai businessmen are making big profits. Given this context, Thailand’s lack of decisive action against the UWSA gives the public the impression that some authorities are complicit in or profiting from the illegal drug trade. However, on January 12, 2025, it was announced that Thailand and China have joined forces to combat call centre scams, human trafficking, and transnational crime, with a focus on locating missing individuals who have been deceived into traveling to neighboring countries. China China has always been a major player in Myanmar, but in 2024 it took on a more direct and forceful role. The country has traditionally pursued a policy of alternating between covert aid to resistance groups and support for the junta, all to balance its own geo-strategic and economic interests. China has now positioned itself as the dominant player, unilaterally exerting its influence on the crisis in Myanmar. The Chinese Foreign Minister outlined the three red lines for China regarding the situation in Myanmar at the 9th Mekong-Lancang Cooperation Foreign Ministers’ Meeting on August 16, 2024 in Chiang Mai, Thailand: (1) that Myanmar should not be subject to civil war; (2) that it should not be separated from ASEAN; and (3) that external forces should not interfere in Myanmar’s affairs. Jason Tower, Country Director for Burma at the US Institute for Peace, summarizes the Chinese position as follows: 'Beijing views Myanmar through its own economic and geo-strategic interests, with little regard for broader peace.' In particular, the EAOs in the northern Shan and Kachin states are being pressured by China to stop fighting and negotiate with the SAC. A recent Crisis Group report highlighted how many fraud and human trafficking scam networks operate within the area under the junta’s control, illustrating the intertwining of conflict and criminality. Reports suggest that these operations often involve kidnapping for fraud, with victims forced to work against their will, akin to modern slavery. These alarming developments not only pose a security risk to China, but also pose a challenge to relations with the junta. Meanwhile, India has shown tentative signs of engagement with the opposition and the SAC, possibly signalling a shift in its approach and/or a desire to become more involved in negotiating, possibly to counter China. However, it remains unclear whether this engagement will develop into a coherent and effective diplomatic strategy. US and EU The US, meanwhile, has largely been absent from addressing the crisis in Myanmar, sidelining the country through its passive approach -- (we’ll see if this changes under Trump?). An analysis by Lucas Myers, senior associate for Southeast Asia at the Wilson Center, argues that 'from a U.S. national interest perspective, the United States has an unmissable opportunity to support the establishment of a stable, federal, inclusive, and democratic government in Myanmar.' But he adds that 'missing that opportunity or delaying it too long risks hampering U.S. influence or, at worst, slowing the resistance’s efforts to overthrow the junta. Disappointment over a perceived lack of U.S. support is increasingly widespread in Myanmar.' Some analysts have therefore suggested that China is taking advantage of this diminished U.S. commitment and exploiting a gap in U.S. leadership in a critical area of the Indo-Pacific region. The European Union has provided aid to Myanmar since 1996, initially focusing on health care, HIV/AIDS programs, livelihoods, and repatriation programs for returnees. The first EU country- specific assistance strategy for Myanmar in 2007 marked a major milestone, and EU assistance played a crucial role in the aftermath of Cyclone Nargis in 2008. The EU presents itself as 'a leader among development partners and demonstrates a strong commitment to the country’s development despite ongoing crises. EU assistance in Myanmar is strategically organized around three key sectoral priority areas: (1) Peace and Governance, (2) Education and (3) Supporting Livelihoods and Green Growth'. On 6 January 2025, a joint statement was issued by the European Union and the governments of the United States, Australia, Canada, New Zealand, Norway, the Republic of Korea, Switzerland, Timor-Leste and the United Kingdom to address the human rights and humanitarian crisis in Myanmar. They urge the military regime and all armed actors in Myanmar to de-escalate violence and respect international humanitarian law and international human rights law. They stress that addressing the underlying discrimination and brutal treatment faced by the Rohingya must be part of a political solution to the crisis in Myanmar. Plus: 'We reiterate our full support for ASEAN’s central role in finding a solution to the crisis.' Hence, both the US and the EU, as well as China, believe that ASEAN must continue to play a central role. ... and Russia? Russia’s ties with the military regime have expanded beyond arms sales and military training since the coup. For the junta, Russia is now Myanmar’s largest source of military aid. The Tatmadaw relies heavily on Russian aircraft to suppress anti-SAC forces. Myanmar is also the only country in Southeast Asia that supplies military equipment to the Russian armed forces for use in Ukraine. But the two ‘pariah regimes’ now work closely together in a wide range of sectors. Naypyidaw is seeking cooperation with Moscow to solve the country’s energy crisis by importing Russian oil and working with Russian energy companies to exploit the country’s hydrocarbon reserves and develop renewable energy sources, including wind, hydro and nuclear. The SAC wants Russia to supply Myanmar with nuclear power by transferring small modular reactors. Naypyidaw’s nuclear ambitions have fueled fears that the junta is seeking to acquire nuclear weapons. For now, it remains guesswork, but it is clear that the SAC and the Kremlin get along well, although China remains Myanmar’s main source of trade and investment.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfCV9aVM5t2M95sXo2BCNdt	2025-01-15T16:31:05-08:00	
How The ‘Amazon Of Europe’ Is Paying The Price Of Hydropower And ...	Restoring the unique ecosystem along the Mura, Drava and Danube rivers is being hampered by controversial water management practices still taking place in protected areas, sometimes under the supervision of the same state agencies in charge of restoration. By Vedrana Simicevic Back in the 1970s, Marijan Kolednjak grew up closely connected to the Drava, a majestic river that originates in Italy, passes through four countries before joining the Danube close to the border between Croatia and Serbia. 'The river was so full of fish back then that we could use just gubasnica[simple fishing rods improvised from a sewing needle and bamboo] to catch them during the spawning period,' says Kolednjak, president of the local fishing club in Opcina Cestica, located in the northern part of Croatia. Today, things are radically different. Some of the most common species like smud (zander) and bolen (asp) have become rare sights, while Kolednjak remembers how much stronger and higher the river was back then. The markings on the riverbank clearly show that the level is now at least a metre lower. It’s even worse underground. 'The water pipes used for local supply usually went 6 metres deep in the ground. Now you must dig at least 11-12 metres to find the water,' he says. These massive changes are mostly attributed to the large number of hydroelectric power (HEP) plants located mainly in the Austrian and Slovenian parts of the Drava, 22 in total. The lower Croatian part is now the central point of restoration efforts to save one of the last primeval river landscapes of Europe, a unique green belt which stretches 700 kilometres along the Mura, Drava and Danube rivers. This area, known as the 'Amazon of Europe', is a prime example of how the second largest renewable electricity source, hydroelectric power, comes at a huge price – destroyed river ecosystems. Activities like sediment extraction and deforestation have caused additional harm. BIRN investigations show that restoration of the river ecosystem remains a far-off prospect. The planned conservation projects are still too small to reverse the historical damage and protection is additionally hampered by controversial water management practices that still take place in protected areas, sometimes supervised by the very same state agencies that are in charge of restoration. Map of the protected areas in The Biosphere Reserve Mura-Drava-Dunav initiative (TBR MDD). Image: WWF Over exploitation Full of beautiful forests, meadows and wetlands and rich in biodiversity, this large biotope network of protected habitats, home to many rare and endangered species that rely on the river ecosystem, connects five countries – Austria, Slovenia, Croatia, Hungary and Serbia. Thirty years ago, the strict border policies in place kept the nature in this area isolated from any intensive human activity. Since the start of the 1990s, however, exploitation of the rivers began to gain momentum. 'During the 60s and 70s, a lot of rivers had been destroyed in Austria, Germany and Middle Europe in general, but this area was kept pristine. The question was how to preserve it from the same fate,' explains Austrian landscape ecologist Arno Mohl from WWF Austria, one of the creators of The Biosphere Reserve Mura-Drava-Dunav initiative (TBR MDD), launched in the 1990s. The years of conservation efforts culminated in 2021, when this transboundary reserve, arranged between five countries and patched together from 300,000 hectares of protected areas, was officially recognised by UNESCO. As part of attempts to restore degraded river sections and floodplains, 17 large restoration projects worth almost 60 million euros have already been rolled out under the aegis of TBR MDD. The EU, keen to jump on the conservation bandwagon turned its biodiversity strategy into the new Nature Restoration Law, which instructs member states on efforts to restore 25,000 kilometres of rivers by 2030. Hydropeaking Although no more hydroelectric plants are allowed in the TBR MDD area, the rivers and biodiversity still suffer from the existing plants, which harm the river ecosystems in several ways. The parts of the rivers immediately below the plants experience the wrath of so-called hydropeaking – the sudden change in the water flow whenever the plant needs more water to produce more energy. The sharp changes in water level and flow velocity are extremely harmful to river organisms. 'One to five metres difference in the level can happen even twice in a day, and that is especially catastrophic for the fish population,' explains Mohl. According to WWF Austria and EuroNatur experts, four fish species have already disappeared from the Drava: the grayling, the Danube streber, the starlet and the bullhead. Nine others are in steep decline. The existing plants in the upper parts also dramatically disturb sediment transport. The gravel and sand that rivers naturally carry downstream are essential for forming flood plains and their fragile ecosystems, and for maintaining the natural state of the riverbed. When plants and their dams retain the water, sediment is retained too. With less sediment coming downstream, the riverbed deepens over time. 'It means you get the deep channel with a lower water level that loses connection to flood plains, which then dry out, losing existing biodiversity,' says Dr Martin Pusch from the Leibniz-Institute of Freshwater Ecology and Inland Fisheries in Berlin. The deepening of the riverbed affects the level of underground water too. 'On the Drava, the massive amount of sediment is stopped by more than 20 hydropower plants. The river, once rich with branches, became a channel and the consequence is a loss of habitats, drying of forests and many dried-up wells,' explains Jasmin Sadikovic, president of the NGO Green Osijek and one of the leaders of the large transboundary river restoration project LIFE RESTORE for MDD, worth 20 million euros. Restoration projects like these are focused on preserving the floodplain forests, widening the riverbed, reconstructing side channels, and distributing the sediment for the development of new natural gravel and sand bars. It includes the removal of artificial embankments so that the river can erode sediment from its banks. 'To restore the rivers to their natural state before the hydropower plants is impossible; you can only mitigate consequences. And that is precisely what we are trying to accomplish with these projects,' says Sadikovic. The restoration of the rivers, he emphasises, is also important for flood control. 'Over time, people got too close to the river, leaving too little space for the natural flow. This is becoming more problematic with climate change, when heavy rainfall happens over a short period, and the river doesn’t have space to grow, which increases the risk of heavy flooding,' says Sadikovic. With the restoration or creation of side channels, the excess water will be able to overflow from the riverbed more slowly and be absorbed by the floodplains, he explains. Yet this restoration flies in the face of old methods of river management, which rely on building embankments and extracting sediment to deepen the riverbed as the best strategies to prevent flooding. 'This old way of thinking was proved to be wrong. The embankments and riverbed deepening will briefly lower the water level at a particular location during the flood. But if you do that in many places, you will worsen the situation,' argues Pusch, pointing out that within these artificially limited river channels, water flows faster and flood waves will form quicker and higher. Despite that, many national strategies still incorporate 'old ways' into water management and rarely compromise with the need for river restoration. Conflict of interests It’s not uncommon that, under the justification of the fight against floods or waterway maintenance, harmful projects are still taking place in different parts of the Biosphere Reserve. These interventions include the same activities recognised by TBR MDD strategies as harmful to the ecosystem, like sediment extraction, forest cutting or embankment construction. Some of these projects are even managed by state agencies in charge of restoration programs or by local authorities. In Croatia, for example, the national agency for water management, Hrvatske vode, is conducting a number of interventions on the Drava with potentially harmful activities, while at the same time leading LIFE RESTORE for MDD projects involving riverbed and habitat restoration. In Croatia, however, there is hardly any control over what is happening on the ground. Most construction projects on the river, even if they are done in the Nature 2000 area, get released from obligations to go through detailed Environmental impact assessment (EIA) procedures, according BIRN’s investigations. The official decisions that all these projects will not be harmful to the environment is always justified with minimal assessment analysis ordered by investors. The best-known of such controversial projects happened four years ago when Hrvatske vode got the green light from the Ministry of Environmental Protection to extract a large amount of sediment from the Drava, near the city of Osijek, without any obligation to go through EIA procedures. Environmental NGOs – WWF Adria, Zelena akcija, BIOM and the Croatian Society for Bird Protection – sued the ministry, stating that the project is harmful. A year earlier, on the initiative of Ivan Anusic, then prefect of Osjecko-baranjska county (and currently deputy prime ninister and defence minister), the Croatian government allowed river sediment exploitation, lifting the ban that had been in place for the previous decade. Anusic stated in the media that sediment extraction is important for maintaining the waterways and that gravel should be used for profit. In 2021. Hrvatske vode received permission from the government to sell the extracted sediment at a price of 49.5 kuna per cubic metre (about 6.50 euros). The extraction abruptly stopped in 2021 after the High Administrative Court revoked the ministry’s decision over the EIA procedure. By then, almost 300,000 cubic metres of sediment had been dug out. Even so, Hrvatske vode seems not to have given up on the project. After the Environment Ministry issued a new decision that an EIA procedure would be required, the water agency issued a tender invitation to conduct the EIA study at the end of 2023. According to the procurement description, it still intends to extract the remaining 165,304 cubic metres of sediment if a positive EIA decision is received from the Environment Ministry. In fact, nobody applied to the tender. NGOs warn that the majority of decisions deeming EIA procedures unnecessary are ordered at the county level, where the control mechanisms are less stringent. 'An increasing number of projects are discussed on a county level which don’t possess enough expert capacity to asses properly potential harm for the environment. And remarks from civil society get completely ignored,' says biologist-ecologist Tibor Mikuska, lead project manager at the Croatian Society for the Birds and Nature Protection. Scrolling through decisions made at the Osjecko-Baranjska and Varazdinska counties, where most of the protected parts of TBR MDD in Croatia are located, it is plain that even in the last few years the majority of interventions on the river avoided any EIA procedures. In July, for example, a decision was made for the construction of port infrastructure at Topoljski Dunavac by port authority Vukovar, which includes embankment construction, removal of vegetation and extraction of 2,000 cubic metres of sediment from the river. Even more sediment, 24,000 cubic metres, is set to be extracted for the construction of a dock for river boats as a part of the maintenance of Daljski channel conducted by the Erdut municipality. Six months ago, a two-year renewal was approved for the reconstruction and extension of the embankment 'ZOO garden' in Osijek managed by Hrvatske vode. In an opinion from 2022, the Department for Environmental Protection at the Environment Ministry stated that following the completion of the project additional worsening of the hydro-morphological state of Drava could be expected, which might 'present an obstacle in the future improvement of the watercourse'. Even so, the Department for Environmental Protection concluded that an EIA was not necessary. At the end of 2022, another project of Hrvatske vode, focused on the reconstruction of the embankment Visnjevac near Osijek, received 110 remarks from citizens and NGOs. They argued that the intervention is unnecessary and planned forest cutting would be extremely harmful. Almost none of the remarks were accepted. These are only a few examples of at least a dozen recent potentially harmful projects located in protected areas that didn’t have to go through a proper EIA evaluation. And some of them, paradoxically, are funded by EU funds aimed at nature protection and restoration. In a recent report by the NGOs Bankwatch and Euronatur, published in October, the authors listed a number of EU-funded projects which, they argued, have caused direct harm to biodiversity. Among the mentioned examples is another restoration project managed by Hrvatske vode in cooperation with the Croatian state agency in charge of forest management, Hrvatske sume. The goal of the project, which received 3.6 million euros of EU funds under Croatia’s National Recovery and Resilience Plan, is to restore a side branch of the Drava River, improve ecological conditions and mitigate flood risks. The report accuses Hrvatske sume of unnecessarily cutting 15-metre-wide and 5.5-kilometre-long corridors on both banks of the old side branch, damaging protected alluvial forests. The cutting was reported to NGOs by local citizens. Hrvatske sume argued it needed to create the passages for its equipment. Hrvatske vode did not reply to BIRN inquiries about the aforementioned projects. A wider problem Croatia is not the only TBR MDD country where restoration is coming up against harmful practices. Another example from the Bankwatch and Euronatur report refers to maintenance work done on the Drava by the Slovenian Water Agency, between the village Nova vas pri Markovcih and the Croatian border. This part of Drava is not in the TBR MDD area, but it does belong to the Natura 2000 network. According to the report, 15,000 cubic metres of gravel had been extracted by March 2024, marking the return of a long-forbidden practice. Slovenian ecologist Damijan Denac, director of the large nature conservation NGO DOPPS-Birdlife and one of the collaborators in the report, says that sand and gravel extraction of this kind has not happened in Slovenia for the last 20 years. This, however, changed after the massive floods in 2023, which prompted the Slovenian government to introduce a law permitting water maintenance work without EIA procedures. 'Last year, concessioners in charge of maintenance requested permission to extract sediment at the two locations. They got on with it, despite a negative opinion from the Slovenian Institute for Nature Conservation,' says Denac. After lobbying from activists, extraction was stopped, but Denac fears that this could signal the wider return of harmful practices. The Slovenian Institute for Nature Conservation confirmed to BIRN that the Slovenian part of the Biosphere Reserve – which only includes the Mura river – is not being spared some of these dubious practices. Over the years, the institute has submitted several reports to state inspectors about the illegal expansion of the Krapje gravel pit, which resulted in the disappearance of 6 hectares of flood forests. The gravel pit is still in operation. As for the Danube, making up a third of the Biosphere Reserve rivers, a new set of problems for conservation efforts has arisen over recent years because of climate change. 'Water levels are generally decreasing. The Danube is still heavily used for water transport and ships need a certain depth of the waterway – this tends to result in additional extraction of the sediment,' explains Jasmin Sadikovic. The Bankwatch and Euronatur report warns about an ambitious EU-funded Hungarian project that plans to improve the navigability of the Danube by dredging a navigable channel. The report states that the project has many risks that significantly outweigh the benefits, including the negative impact on 58 areas that provide high-quality drinking water and the extraction of riverbed material which will additionally decrease groundwater levels. Due to conflicting standpoints, a Strategic EIA procedure is currently pending. In Serbia, where water transport is also a priority, restoration projects, although planned, haven’t even started yet. Compromise solutions for these problems exist, but they are rarely included in the EU and national regulations, warn most of the conservation experts contacted for this article. One of the mitigating measures should be, for example, ensuring that the amount of water sufficient for the maintenance of the ecosystem is always directed into the side channels instead of hydropower plant turbines. Although this so-called biological minimum is different depending on the area, in general it should be at least 10 per cent of the average flow. 'In practice, in many EU countries no one is monitoring whether plants respect this measure, so often the minimum is only 5 or even 2 per cent,' says Pusch. The drastic fall in water levels, explains Denac, has turned the Slovenian part of the Drava river into an almost completely degraded river. But for the rest, mainly the Croatian part, there is still a chance if mitigating measures are applied. Tibor Mikuska, however, warns that many of these protecting guidelines are not included in the recent Management plan for the Croatian Mura-Drava regional park – the protected area along Mura and Drava in Croatia – especially the ones regarding ongoing economic activities. Echoing the opinion of many fellow ecologists, Arno Mohl thinks that more ambitious and large-scale restoration efforts and regulations are needed if the EU really wants to protect the damaged river ecosystem. 'Institutions in charge of water management have been accustomed to doing the same things for the last 40 years, but this business-as-usual doesn’t work anymore,' says Mohl. 'They, too, need to adapt.'

Vietnam’s New Regime Finds Its Footing – Analysis	By David Brown When Vietnam’s long-time leader Nguyen Phu Trong passed away on 19 July 2024, only the Minister of Public Security, Police General To Lam, was ready to act. All other politicians that may have once hoped to lead the all-powerful Communist Party of Vietnam in Trong’s stead instead chose retirement when they learned the contents of their dossiers that Lam’s subordinates had assembled. A few days after Trong was laid to rest, the Party’s 200-member Central Committee assembled to acclaim Lam as his successor. Lam was not well known to the general public prior to his ascension to General Secretary. He made his career in the Ministry of Public Security, serving six years as deputy minister before taking the helm of the ministry in 2016. In this role, Trong’s determination to rid the Party of corruption burned ever more fiercely. To Lam’s contribution to Party anti-corruption efforts seems to have been invaluable. But there was scepticism about whether the new General Secretary will be able to manage a much broader mandate. Many doubted the ability of a policeman to keep order in the ruling Party, run a sprawling government and steer a fast-growing economy. By early November 2024, the question of Lam’s suitability had a very clear answer. With Prime Minister Pham Minh Chinh as his principal aide, Lam intends nothing less than a root-and-branch renovation and rationalisation of Vietnam’s sprawling bureaucracy. Periodically since the nation won its independence, its leaders have promised sweeping changeswithin a socialist framework. In the 1980s, they succeeded brilliantly with the Doi Moi reforms that did away with rationing and allowed the development of a market economy. In contrast, previous attempts at streamlining public sector institutions have accomplished very little. Trong, for example, endorsed a program of administrative reform while wrangling with his nemesis, Nguyen Tan Dung — a former prime minister notoriously tolerant of corrupt activity by fellow officials. But Trong allowed that initiative to wither once he forced Nguyen Tan Dung out of office. Trong’s attention turned instead to punishing individual Party members who fell short of his standards for probity. This was Trong’s signature ‘fiery furnace’ campaign — it persisted until his death and reportedly weeded out some 17,000 corrupt or backsliding cadre. Now as the Party leader, Lam has shifted the focus to institutional reforms. In contrast to Vietnam’s relatively efficient private sector enterprises, the public sector is strikingly overstaffed and inefficient. Resolution 18-NQ/TW, issued by the Party Central Committee in 2017, was intended to address bureaucratic bloat, but Trong had been far more interested in weeding out doctrinal backsliders. During Trong’s leadership, ministries and Party offices did not put much effort into getting leaner and more efficient with the exception of the sprawling Ministry of Public Security, where Lam was deputy minister and then promoted to minister. As minister, Lam did not downsize the Ministry of Public Security so much as refocus and streamline it, eliminating many mid-level offices and staff, doubling the number of boots on the ground and, over the next several years, doubling the Ministry of Public Security’s strength again. Statements by Lam and Prime Minister Chinh in the last few months of 2024 strongly suggest that — mindful that the Party’s 14th Congress will convene in January 2026 — they found it more efficient to resurrect Resolution 18-NQ/TW rather than spend months building a consensus on what reforms are needed and how soon. The emerging plan would reduce and reorganise ministries and Party offices to eliminate functional overlaps. Authority to make and execute decisions is to be delegated to localities, subject only to after-the-fact reviews by higher levels. Underperforming cadre and officials — said to be about 20 per cent of the total — are to be ‘filtered out’. In March 2025, every state agency is required to report its plans for restructuring and streamlining. By the end of the year, with a nod from the Politburo and the Cabinet Office, each should be putting its plans into effect. If all these plans go as intended, the ‘new era’ that Lam often refers to could materialise, with the political system becoming noticeably ‘leaner, more compact, stronger, more efficient, effective and impactful’. When the 14th Congress convenes in January 2026, Lam and his team will reap the rewards by being accorded another five years to show what they can do.

Eastern European Energy Crisis Could Spell Trouble – Analysis	By Luke Coffey Immediately after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, Europe entered an energy crisis. European countries scrambled to diversify away from Russian energy sources. The crisis caused mass inflation across the continent and drastically increased heating and electricity costs for Europeans. However, after resilience, tenacity and billions of euros in new investments, Europe has made significant progress, but it has not been able to move completely away from Russian energy. Now, almost three years later, a new energy crisis is developing in Eastern Europe, and it is not getting the attention it deserves. This month, Transnistria, a breakaway region of Moldova essentially under Russian control, stopped receiving Russian gas. This development is already affecting the rest of Moldova and could potentially impact the broader Eastern European region. To understand the current energy crisis in Moldova, one must look at recent history. Many might find it surprising that, even after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, Gazprom, the Russian state energy company, continued to send natural gas to Eastern Europe through Ukrainian territory. Most of this gas ended up in Hungary, Slovakia and Austria, but some also flowed into the Russian-backed Transnistria region of Moldova. While it may seem unusual for Ukraine to allow Russian gas to transit its territory, there were straightforward reasons for doing so. The EU was slow to find alternatives for Eastern European countries dependent on Russian gas and pressured Kyiv to allow gas transit. Meanwhile, Ukraine received billions of dollars in transit fees from Gazprom, which were critical for its war-torn economy. In light of economic sanctions after the invasion, Gazprom needed all the customers it could get, even if it meant relying on Ukraine for transit. However, by last summer, President Volodymyr Zelensky recognized the absurdity of this arrangement and announced that Ukraine would not renew its transit contract with Gazprom. It expired at the end of 2024. This marked the first clear sign of an impending energy crisis in Eastern Europe in 2025. At the EU and Ukraine’s behest, Azerbaijan engaged Russia in talks to secure a deal to allow Baku to export gas to Europe via Ukraine’s pipelines. Despite progress, this deal was never finalized. By December, both Moldovan and local Transnistrian de facto authorities had declared states of emergency. Now, they are in the early days of an energy crisis. The Kremlin has long used its energy resources as a hybrid weapon against Moldova. In 2006, Gazprom dramatically increased prices for Moldova, which had a negative impact on the economy. Again, in 2009, 2014, 2021 and 2022, Russia either cut or threatened to cut gas to Moldova for political reasons. Direct Russian attacks on Ukraine’s energy infrastructure have also triggered massive blackouts in several Moldovan cities. Moldova’s Western allies have worked to counteract Russia’s energy pressure campaign. As poor weather and inflation gripped the region in winter 2022, the EU provided hundreds of millions of euros in emergency support, while Romania supplied electricity to replace that lost due to the Russian bombing of Ukrainian power plants. By October 2023, Moldova announced it would no longer purchase gas from Gazprom. Despite these measures, Moldova remains indirectly dependent on Russian gas. Transnistria received free Russian gas supplies transiting Ukraine en route to the breakaway territory. Transnistrian authorities then used this gas at the Russian-owned Cuciurgan power plant to generate electricity, which they sold — cheaply within Transnistria and at higher prices to the rest of Moldova. Electricity sales were a major source of revenue for Transnistria, creating mutual dependency: Moldova relied on Transnistrian electricity and Transnistria relied on Moldovan payments. Further complicating matters, the regional Soviet-era power grid forces even Romania-generated electricity to pass through Ukraine and Transnistria before reaching Moldova. To address this vulnerability, Moldova is constructing modern power lines directly with Romania, but these are not slated for completion until later this year. In the meantime, Moldova’s energy outlook is grim. Transnistrian authorities have already implemented rolling blackouts and switched their main power plant from gas to coal. However, coal reserves are expected to last only until the end of February. Additionally, Transnistria is now only producing enough electricity for its own needs, leaving the rest of Moldova without supplemental energy. Although this energy crisis is currently confined to a small sliver of Moldova, it has the potential to escalate and impact the broader region. If Transnistria’s economy collapses due to a lack of revenue from electricity sales and reduced industrial activity, there is concern about a mass exodus of Transnistrians into Moldova proper. Such an influx could place enormous strain on Moldova’s already overstretched public services. If Moldova cannot manage the influx, refugees are likely to move into Romania, creating additional challenges for that country. This concern is not unfounded, as many Transnistrians hold multiple passports, including Moldovan, Romanian, Russian and Ukrainian. This situation could have been avoided and there is plenty of blame to go round. While it is understandable that Ukraine does not want Russian gas transiting its territory given Moscow’s ongoing invasion, the EU has been slow to prepare for the expected crisis. Meanwhile, Russia could have continued exporting gas to Transnistria via other routes, such as the TurkStream pipeline through Bulgaria and Romania into Moldova, but the Kremlin chose not to. Moldovan authorities have stated they would not block Russian gas transit to Transnistria, prioritizing the well-being of citizens in the breakaway region. However, Moscow has used alleged Moldovan debts to Gazprom as a pretext for halting supplies. The more likely explanation is that Moscow sees an energy crisis in Moldova as a means to weaken its pro-European government ahead of critical parliamentary elections this year. Once again, energy is being wielded as a tool of foreign policy, leaving ordinary people to suffer the consequences. Luke Coffey is a senior fellow at the Hudson Institute.

Development Issues And Directions Of Macau’s Gaming Industry – An...	By He Yan Macau, sometimes touted as the 'Monte Carlo of the East', is a global casino hub with an economy heavily reliant on the gaming industry. For a long time, this sector has contributed around 80% of the local government's tax revenue. In recent years, however, Macau's gaming industry has been severely impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, leading to significant economic repercussions. As a result, Macau is also exploring economic diversification to reduce its dependence on casino revenues. On December 20, 2024, Sam Hou Fai was sworn in as the sixth Chief Executive of the Macau Special Administrative Region. During the ceremony, national leaders gave a speech urging Macau to transition from a gaming capital to a moderately diversified economy. The goal is for non-gaming industries to account for about 60% of Macau's GDP by 2028, up from 50% before the pandemic in 2019. Over the past 25 years, Macau’s GDP has grown fivefold, with its economic achievements being globally recognized. However, its overly singular economic structure has made it vulnerable to the shocks of the pandemic and the global economic downturn. Especially in the post-pandemic period, its economic recovery has been quite slow. According to Statista’s information on the gross revenue from gaming and gambling in Macao from 2013 to 2023, the highest total gaming revenue before the pandemic was MOP 361.87 billion, while the lowest was MOP 224.13 billion. After the pandemic, the gaming industry in Macau was severely affected, with total gaming revenue falling to a record low of MOP 42.84 billion in 2022. Although the economy rebounded significantly in 2023, the total revenue reached only MOP 183.7 billion. In the current development difficulties of Macau's gaming industry, particularly the issue of sluggish recovery due to the impact of the pandemic, ANBOUND has pointed out several key reasons: First, the gaming industry is a cultural industry. Culture is the most important industrial factor and the most important consumer factor, as it determines whether an industry and consumption will undergo an upgrade or a downgrade. For instance, Monaco’s gaming industry is known for its cultural characteristics, with cultural symbols embedded in every corner of its gaming sector. The history of Monte Carlo dates back to the 6th century CE, when it was part of an ancient Greek city-state. Throughout history, many artists, writers, musicians, and actors have lived and worked in Monte Carlo, including the great artist Picasso, and famous movie stars such as Marilyn Monroe and Elizabeth Taylor. World-renowned events like the Monte-Carlo Jazz Festival and the Les Ballets de Monte-Carlo are important cultural symbols of the region. Additionally, the Hôtel de Paris under the Monte-Carlo Société des Bains de Mer showcases original artworks by the Monaco royal family in its suites. Similarly, the Hôtel Hermitage Monte-Carlo, known for being an art connoisseur's hotel, often hosts important art exhibitions, concerts, philosophical conferences, and events where art and thought converge. Meanwhile, Macau's gaming industry is known for its focus on money. Although the gaming industry is a pillar of Macau’s economy, its lack of investment in culture has caused its appeal to be solely centered around 'gambling'. For example, the VIP rooms, which once dominated Macau’s gaming industry, have been rife with illegal activities such as money laundering, under-the-table gambling, and violent debt collection. Junket operators often organize trips for Mainland Chinese residents to Macau for high-stakes gambling, and some corrupt officials have become regulars at these VIP rooms. In this city of decadence, the tragic stories of gamblers losing everything are played out daily. Near the MGM casino, there is a pedestrian path known by gamblers as 'Paralysis Avenue'. Some gamblers, having lost all their money, will curl up on the stone benches here, spending the night in hope of borrowing money to try their luck again at the casino. Is this a cruel 'gambling city' or a global tourism and leisure capital? The answer is obvious. It is precisely due to the lack of a culturally rich foundation that, during the pandemic, Macau was only able to resort to hosting concerts and sports events to increase revenue. Since the reopening over a year ago, Macau has seen a continuous stream of concerts, with singers and bands from Hong Kong, Taiwan, South Korea, and the United States performing. International sports events have also been on the rise. In early December, U.S. media reported that the NBA had signed a cooperation agreement with Sands China, and from 2025 onwards, the NBA preseason warm-up games will be held in Macau. However, hosting concerts, sports events, and other diversified activities cannot save Macau’s economy or gaming industry. According to local casino employees, there is a clear lack of overlap between concertgoers, general consumers, and the clientele of the gaming businesses themselves. Therefore, although the concert business seems to be thriving, it has not brought in significant profits, with casinos mainly generating income through venue rentals. Furthermore, the majority of fans attending concerts, who tend to favor younger singers and music groups, are not interested in gambling. As a result, these concerts have not effectively driven betting activities in the casinos. Secondly, there is the impact of consumer demographics. On one hand, economic weakness has led to a downgrade in spending among Mainland Chinese visitors. For many years, tourists from Mainland China have been the primary customer base for Macau's gaming industry, but after the pandemic, the consumption patterns of Mainlanders have changed, which affected Macau’s economy. Data shows that in 2023, Macau recorded over 28.21 million inbound tourists, equivalent to 71.6% of the number in 2019. Among them, 67.5% came from Mainland China, followed by 25.5% from Hong Kong, and 1.8% from Taiwan. Mainland tourists overwhelmingly dominated the numbers, with no significant difference before and after the COVID-19 pandemic. However, they did not bring the same economic benefits as before. It is understood that familiar visitors to Macau often take the free shuttle buses operated by Macau's gaming companies that connect all the major casinos, hotels, land border checkpoints, airports, and piers. Additionally, a huge amount of free snacks at the casinos were consumed. According to the gaming expenditure information by Macau’s Statistics and Census Service, in 2023, 61.1% of the operating expenses of gaming companies were for goods and services provided for free to customers, which saw an increase of 3.7 times to MOP 19.51 billion, with hotel rooms and food-beverages being the major expenditures. On the other hand, there has been a loss of elite consumer spending. It is understood that the current revenue from Macau's gaming industry comes almost entirely from the more common 'lucky gaming' types in casinos, such as table games and slot machines, and a small portion coming from lottery activities. In 2019, the revenue from VIP rooms accounted for nearly half of the total 'lucky gaming' revenue, reaching 46.2%. However, this proportion dropped to a quarter in 2023, only 24.7%. The increased revenue has shifted from the VIP rooms to the mass gaming tables. In 2019, mass gaming tables accounted for 44.2% of gaming revenue, but by 2023, this had risen to 63.9%. According to a report by Citigroup analyst George Choi in September last year, the bank observed 228 'whale' gamblers who collectively wagered HKD 433 million since 2024, surpassing the total amount wagered by 224 'whales' in 2023, which was HKD 397 million. Despite this, some experienced gaming industry consultants believe that while the entire gaming industry has recovered well and the mass market is thriving with casinos making profits, VIP rooms represent high-value customers, with individual bets often reaching one to two million patacas. In contrast, bets at mass tables are only a few hundred patacas each, meaning it would take tens of thousands of customers to make up for the loss. At present, with this shift, elite spending in VIP rooms has not been recovered, and the capacity of the mass market is near saturation. This leaves little room for future growth in the gaming industry. Final analysis conclusion: After the pandemic, Macau's gaming industry suffered a severe blow, and the decline of this major industry has dealt a heavy impact on the local economy. Although Macau is striving to achieve economic diversification to seek more stable economic growth, the gaming industry will remain the iconic sector of Macau for a considerable period of time. Therefore, it is particularly important for the Macanese authorities to gain a deep understanding of the real challenges facing the development of Macau's gaming industry. This includes recognizing the importance of culture to the gaming industry and understanding that the elite consumer group is a key driving force for consumption growth.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfCV9aVM5t2MyxgupxNIXBc	2025-01-15T16:18:56-08:00	
Circassian National Movement Energized By Kyiv’s Recognition Of R...	On January 9, Ukraine’s Verkhovna Rada voted overwhelmingly for a resolution declaring that Russian actions during and at the end of the Russian invasion and occupation of Circassia were an act of genocide. Specifically, the resolution says that Russian actions between 1763 and 1864 bear 'all the signs of genocide and that if such crimes were committed today, they would undoubtedly be recognized' as an act of genocide as defined by the UN Convention (Ukrainian National News, January 9; Circassia Today, January 10; Ukrainian Government Portal, accessed January 14). The declaration also says that the Ukrainian parliament seeks to honor 'the memory of all the victims of this crime and to express its solidarity with the Circassian (Adyghe) people' and condemns in the strongest possible terms 'the genocidal actions' of the Russian government. It further calls on the Russian Federation to recognize this action as a crime and to apologize for it. It also 'recognized the right of the Circassian (Adyghe) people in the diaspora to repatriate to the lands of their former settlement in the northwestern Caucasus with the further realization of the right to national self-determination on their historical territory' and called on other countries to take similar steps. The Circassian national movement has long aimed to restore a Circassian state in the North Caucasus that the Russian Empire destroyed during its 101-year-long campaign to annex that region. In pursuing this goal, the Circassian movement has three intermediate goals. First, they hope to receive international recognition of Russia’s actions, leaning the death or expulsion of 90 percent of Circassians as an act of genocide to the same degree that the terror famine was in Ukraine. Second, they look for the return of Circassians to their ethnic homeland. There are now some seven million Circassians in the diaspora compared to the only 700,000 today in their ethnic homeland. Third, they aim to overcome the Soviet-imposed and Russian-maintained division of the Circassian nation in the North Caucasus into smaller and more easily controlled nationalities and promote the revival of a common Circassian nation. Moscow has worked hard to block all three of these efforts. It fears what a united Circassian nation would mean not only for its control of the Caucasus but, more generally, given Circassian influence with other groups, for its domination of the periphery of the Russian empire. The Kremlin, however, has taken a major loss in the first goal as a result of Ukraine’s resolution, with the likelihood that its defeat will lead to other losses in the other two goals. (On these Circassian aspirations and Moscow’s moves against them, see Window on Eurasia, October 17, 2020, May 22, 2021, May 29, 2023; see EDM, May 19, 2022, May 23, June 22, September 20, 2023). Circassians and their Ukrainian supporters have been seeking the adoption of such a declaration for more than a decade (see EDM, May 27, 2014). There was an upsurge in interest in such moves after Georgia took that step in 2011, another at the time of the 2014 Sochi Olympics, which Putin organized on the very site of that genocide on its 150th anniversary. In the last three years since the Kremlin leader launched his expanded invasion of Ukraine, this interest increased given Kyiv’s interest in reaching out to non-ethnic Russians inside the Russian Federation (seeCommentaries, February 10, 2014; see North Caucasus Weekly, May 20, 2013; see EDM, August 8, 2024; Window on Eurasia, October 20, November 9, 2022, August 2, 2024). The Circassians were especially energized after Kyiv recognized Chechnya as a temporarily occupied land and have worked closely with the Chechens and the Ukrainians since that time (see EDM, November 1, 2022). Overwhelmingly, Circassian activists have been jubilant about Ukraine’s decision (Kavkaz Realii, January 10; Kavkaz Uzel; Ekho Kavkaza, January 11). They are planning to expand their contacts with other governments, in the first instance in the Baltic countries, Poland, and Finland, hoping to secure additional declarations of this kind (Kavkaz Realii, January 10). They are discussing how to expand their contacts with other nationalities within the Russian Federation to form a common front to defeat Russian imperialism in Ukraine and win independence for all of them (Caucasusfree.com, accessed January 14). Additionally, they are working to form new and more comprehensive organizations, such as a common Circassian parliament that would link groups in the homeland and the diaspora closer together, and a newsletter in multiple languages about Circassian events to reach a broader international audience (Window on Eurasia, November 26, 2024). Remarkably, a handful of Circassian groups have spoken out against Ukraine’s action, a reflection of Moscow’s efforts to control them to muddy the waters and weaken the Circassian movement (Aydınlık, January 12). The most prominent of these groups is the International Circassian Association (ICA), one many Circassians have long suspected of having been captured by Russian intelligence services and have since abandoned (see EDM, February 16, 2023; Window on Eurasia, July 2, 2020, May 4, 2022, February 1, 2023, January 11, 27, July 28, 2024). This latest and widely unpopular action by the ICA will reinforce such suspicions. It almost certainly will lead to its collapse, forcing Moscow to step up its efforts against other groups and to use repression even more widely against Circassian activists in Russia. Such moves, however, will backfire, highlighted by one of the Circassian’s greatest strengths. In the age of the Internet, what Moscow does in the diaspora or the Caucasus rapidly becomes known to the other, radicalizing opinion and reducing Moscow’s ability to control the situation of a nation, most of whose members are living beyond the direct control of the Russian state. Due to the Circassians’ large population and influence among other groups, both within the Russian Federation and abroad, because they have allied themselves with Ukraine to block Russian mobilization in their regions, will become a bigger target for the Kremlin (see EDM, October 18, 2022). Moscow is likely to conclude that it now more than ever must use harsher repressive measures against the Circassians it can reach at home or abroad, attacking anyone who supports or even covers the Circassians, which the Jamestown Foundation has done for decades (e.g., Jamestown, May 29, 2020). This risks, however, further weakening Moscow’s position. The only thing constraining them from such attacks may be some familiarity with the words Gandhi reportedly used about struggles between repressive regimes and those who oppose them, which this author used in his remarks to the International Conference on Independent Circassia in Istanbul in August 2023 (Window on Eurasia, August 8, 2023). Ghandi said to have presciently observed first that the opponents of national movements ignore the latter, then laugh at them, then attack them, and finally, surrender to them. What the Ukrainian parliamentarians have done has likely brought that day closer. What Moscow is likely to do in response may bring it closer still.

Kuala Lumpur – Jakarta: Strategic Fallback Options – Analysis	Indonesia President Prabowo Subianto 's visit to Malaysia on January 9 was as a symbol to further reaffirm bilateral ties and to cement closer personal ties, bond and trust at the highest level, with Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim. It also cements the notion that both countries still value the importance of historical and cultural roots and ties despite the existing loggerheads over territorial disputes and the constant competition over geopolitical interests and investment opportunities. In 2023, Indonesia ranked as Malaysia's seventh-largest trading partner globally and third-largest among ASEAN member states, with total trade of RM111.21billion (USD24.39 billion). Prabowo also wanted to further deepen his new development agenda for Indonesia in increasing its fallback options and in widening the diversification efforts, reflecting the same efforts and momentum that Malaysia is doing now under Anwar in increasing dependence on other growing powers and BRICS. Prabowo realises that both countries share the same dilemma of security threats and the complexities of responding to big powers' tailor made manouvres for the region and individual states, and in navigating the new hard power traditional threats. All these while both states are trying not to jeopardise the economic interests and the subsequent domestic political support and returns that are mutually entangled with current or new powers. Both nations share the same policy outlook and approach that focus on getting the best out of both sides of the power rivalry between the West and traditional partners in China and Russia, and Prabowo also realizes that the way forward in this approach will face greater challenges and scrutiny especially under the new Trump administration. Each will need to prove its worth in the eyes of Trump and how each will display new forms of confidence building measures in reinventing ties with the US and the West, and how this will translate into tangible measures and impact on economic and key geopolitical returns to both parties without inviting potential retaliatory measures both in economic and hard power tenets. In distinguishing himself from his predecessor, Prabowo will need a more realistic, reliable and a distinct set of domestic and foreign policy of his own, and there is no indication for now that he intends to drastically change the conventional strategic hedging and balancing approach of Indonesia as in the past years. Realising that he still trapped in the quandary of elevating Indonesia's coming of global age status while balancing the need to take sides that will be needed if Indonesia was to reap the full benefits from different quarters, he is looking into the similar trap setting faced by Anwar and Malaysia in this regard, while striving to lessen mutual competition and wariness. Both have to face the geographically inevitable fact of mutually dependable economic and political connotations in weathering the same set of potential storms and current threats. Prabowo sees Malaysia as a needed partner in softening Indonesia's similar pursuit of this policy, and using Malaysia as an example where a regional emerging force of combined strength and similarity in development and economic model and potential as an added advantage in complementing Indonesia's rise and ambition to be a global player. Both nations share similar traps, limitations and openings in the field of the wider geopolitical power equation, and both see that it will be wiser and strategic in the long term to minimize mutual competition and wariness two build a deeper fallback and interdependent option for mutual benefits. Both are emerging voices in global affairs and stakes in the supply chain and key emerging industries and sectors which play a central role in the global power rivalry and the fierce competition for these critical resources and advantages including critical minerals, semiconductor, digital economy, new energy transition, EV, artificial intelligence and others. The West looks at both Malaysia and Indonesia as not only having the future economic potential of altering the stakes, but also more importantly in consolidating and leading the voices of the Islamic world and the developing world, particularly in dealing with Russia and China led mechanisms including BRICS. Indonesia under Prabowo will most likely see a new rise of both economic and military power and capacity, and this drive will bring both potential and challenges for Jakarta's future regional and global leadership role and the impact on regional power entanglement. With this, the ambitions of Indonesia is already beyond ASEAN, and Prabowo realises that Malaysia and its leadership of ASEAN are thus imperative for Indonesia to serve as the needed equal partner and supporter in facing potential headwinds and retaliations for its growing ambitions, hunger and stakes in the bigger schemes of power rivalry in the world and in playing a deeper role in solving global conflicts. With these greater overarching needs and goals, Prabowo will not want to have a diversion of attention by having to deal with existing regional tensions or issues either with Malaysia or in dealing with the fallout of the South China Sea dispute. Prabowo needed a strong and pragmatic Malaysian role and leadership at the ASEAN level in keeping off external threats and ensuring a stable regional economic dynamism, which will help Indonesia to project and expand its role and influence at the wider level. Without Malaysia being at the forefront of keeping both the country and the region stable and safe, Indonesia will be forced to make alterations to its foreign policy extent and scope which will inhibit its larger intention to move away beyond ASEAN. Malaysia is also needed as a positive ripple effects of renewed attraction for the right inflow of external security assurances, economic and investment capacity and the needed technological and trade inflows and injections which will also create spillover impact for Indonesia. \For Malaysia, Indonesia is seen as the interdependent partner for a multi-domain and multi-faceted structure of geopolitical, economic and political factors. Indonesia is the de facto regional leader in terms of joint historical foundation of ASEAN, and its growing military and economic prowess and influence is seen as a needed partner and a platform for capitalization of positive mutual interdependence. Both nations realise that both serve as the central essence of strength for ASEAN and in reducing internal wariness and in improving internal trade gap, and both also tried to be a higher power trendsetter with greater influence in the Global South and the Islamic world either through the OIC or though direct bilateral engagements with key Muslim powers in the Middle East or through regional groupings in a wider array of diplomatic, economic and geopolitical friendshoring. Indonesia will want Malaysia to continue to steer ASEAN through the conventional safety and returns of the status quo, in serving as the practical bridge and hedging capacity against the external power rivalry and in preserving regional stability without rocking the current dynamics, lest inviting greater external interference that will complicate Indonesia's policy options. Malaysia will also need Indonesia's growing global clout and similar foreign policy approach of strategic balancing and hedging while quietly navigating the best returns from a deepening inroads into the alternative system of economic friendshoring dependence. For Indonesia, Malaysia is getting the needed returns of security assurances from existing mechanism including the Five Powers Defence Arrangement (FPDA) and also a wide range of American defence support, which is seen as also giving the region and Jakarta the needed spillover greater regional defence and security assurance and counterbalancing effect. For both nations' defence and economic friendshoring efforts and in enhancing positive long term guardrails for one's own and the region's security resilience, each nation's unique strength is needed. Both will also want to redouble efforts to boost economic and energy and food and energy resilience and security, especially with the similar current trajectories of both nations in transforming their economic fundamentals and resilience.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfCV9aVM5t2MzL56dlwcthD	2025-01-15T16:14:56-08:00	
No, Climate Change Is Not Causing California’s ‘Insurance Crisis’...	By Connor O'Keeffe Last week, parts of Los Angeles, California, were devastated by a series of especially destructive wildfires. While fires are common in the southern California region, a couple of factors came together to turn last week’s flare-ups into major conflagrations. First, LA experienced a lot of rainfall in 2022 and 2023. The wet conditions spurred the growth of a lot of brush and grasses on the hills surrounding LA’s metropolitan area. 2024 brought an exceptionally hot summer and almost no rain during what was supposed to be the wet season, which dried out the now abundant vegetation. The various state and local government authorities that own this wilderness obviously did not clear this dried-out brush with effective methods like tree thinning and controlled burns, leaving the surrounding urban areas vulnerable. The second factor was the wind. The region frequently experiences strong, warm winds that originate high in the southern Nevada desert and travel down across California into the Pacific Ocean, gaining speed and intensity as they squeeze through the mountains and canyons surrounding Los Angeles. These winds are common and, therefore, predictable enough to have a name: the Santa Anas. Wind is air moving from an area with high air pressure to an area with lower pressure. And last week, a high-pressure system stalled over Utah while a low-pressure system was present off the Pacific coast. The result was record-setting Santa Ana winds, with some gusts reaching over 100 mph. For reasons that remain unknown at the time of writing, several fires started in the hills surrounding the Los Angeles Basin last Tuesday. The heavy Santa Ana winds helped the fires spread quickly through the dry brush, filling the government-owned land towards Los Angeles suburbs like Altadena and the Pacific Palisades. On Tuesday and Wednesday of last week, the fires tore through these towns. While virtually everyone was able to evacuate in time, the level of property destruction caused by these fires is unprecedented. A substantial part of the Pacific Palisades was completely leveled—including my own childhood home and the entire neighborhood I grew up in. More than twelve thousand buildings were razed to the ground. While that figure includes several mansions owned by the Hollywood elite, the fires also wiped out homes that had been bought by middle-class Californians decades before the property values swelled to their current levels. For many of those folks, the bulk of their wealth was tied up in houses that are now gone. Making matters worse, many of the homes destroyed last week were uninsured. Progressives and establishment media outlets seized on this fact to blame climate change for driving insurance providers out of high-risk areas. This talking point is complete nonsense. If the risk of natural disasters in an area people want to live in increases, that’s good for insurance companies. It drives up the demand for their product. It’s true that home insurance providers have been fleeing the areas affected by these fires—with one provider canceling thousands of policies in the Pacific Palisades in the last year alone. But that’s not because of climate change, it’s because of government intervention. In an unhampered insurance market, the prices people pay for coverage are very situational. Obviously the value of whatever is being covered will impact premiums, but so does risk. For natural disasters like floods and wildfires, the risk of a storm or blaze destroying a home can change drastically from one street to the next. Insurance providers invest a lot of time and resources into analyzing these risks so they can charge competitive prices that account for the likelihood of a claim being filed. There is no escaping the fact that homeowners insurance will be expensive in high-risk areas. But that’s not something we should even want to escape. High insurance prices are how the market both signals that an area is a risky place to live and dissuades people—especially the poorest, most vulnerable households in society—from living in these high-risk areas. When governments mess with insurance prices—either through subsidies, cheap public insurance, or price controls—the result is always the same. More people move to dangerous areas that are highly susceptible to natural disasters. In 1988, California passed a law that forced insurance prices down by 20 percent, banned providers from using forecasts of future risk to set prices, and subjected all future price increases to government oversight. With rates severely decoupled from risk, the state saw extensive development in some very fire-prone areas. Then, after an exceptionally bad fire year in 2017, insurance providers tried to get approval to raise premiums to account for the high level of risk across the state. The government said no. As a result, seven of the twelve largest home insurance providers pulled out of California. And that trend is continuing today. The government of California had also tied the hands of insurance providers by restricting their ability to factor the cost of reinsurance into their rate calculations. You can think of reinsurance as insurance for insurance providers. These firms are structured to cover single houses burning down—not entire towns. So, they go to reinsurance providers to get covered in the event that many of their customers suddenly need to file claims at the same time. California did partially roll back this restriction a few weeks ago, but for many of those in the Palisades and Altadena who could not get insurance, it was already too late. In true California government fashion, a new regulation was just rolled out that will legally require the few insurance companies who remain to provide coverage in high-risk areas if they want to continue doing business in the state. But, because of government price caps, these areas are unprofitable—which is why there’s no coverage. So, by pretending to address the problem while forcing insurance providers to take on economic losses, state officials risk driving even more providers to drop all their customers and pull out of the state entirely. Wildfires in southern California will never go away. But they certainly don’t have to be as destructive as the fires that tore through LA last week. In addition to the obvious changes that need to be made to the management of government land and the reliability of government water infrastructure, the state needs an insurance market that is based on reality; one that is allowed to convey the real risk of living in fire-prone areas. As long as the state government keeps hiding these risks from its citizens in the name of fairness, the people of California will remain in serious physical and financial danger.

MEPs In Letter Writing Spree Over Musk’s EU Activism	By icoletta Ionta (EurActiv) -- Lawmakers from across the European Parliament have launched a flurry of initiatives over Elon Musk’s recent actions, with one even proposing him for the 2025 Nobel Peace Prize, according to documents seen by Euractiv. The European adventures of Musk – the billionaire and consigliere to President-elect Donald Trump – have sparked intense commentary and debate among MEPs. Many are now putting their feelings on Musk in writing, seeking co-signatories for letters that include an invitation to Brussels, a proposal for a debate, and a far-fetched nomination for one of the world's most prestigious prizes. On Tuesday, Greek lawmaker Emmanouil Fragkos, from the right-wing European Conservatives and Reformists, circulated a letter addressed to Parliament President Roberta Metsola that called for Musk to address a plenary session. The letter, seen by Euractiv, had been signed by 43 MPs – mostly, but not exclusively, from the Parliament's right-wing and far-right groups. Centre-right European People's Party member Branko Grims and Romanian Socialist Maria Grapini had also signed the letter. Describing him as a 'trailblazer in the digital revolution,' the letter framed the invitation as part of efforts to 'revitalise Europe’s productivity' and ensure global competitiveness. Meanwhile, S&D lawmaker and foreign affairs committee vice-chair Hana Jalloul Muro penned another letter, to the EU's top diplomat Kaja Kallas. She expressed alarm over digital platforms’ potential to influence electoral processes within and beyond the EU. The signatories include 45 lawmakers, mostly from the Socialists, Greens, and The Left groups. The letter calls on Kallas to expand EU's foreign policy and sanctions framework to counter foreign interference in electoral processes, as well as for the EU to develop new tools to address emerging threats posed by online platforms like Musk’s X and Musk himself. Adding to the flurry of proposals, Grims, not content merely to sign the Fragkos letter, has also nominated Musk for the 2025 Nobel Peace Prize. The proposal, addressed to the Norwegian Nobel Committee and seen by Euractiv, is currently in the signature collection phase. Grims writes that Musk deserves the prize for his 'outstanding and successful efforts to preserve freedom of speech' linking these efforts to global peace and development. The nomination also lauds Musk for removing 'all systemic options for introducing any form of political censorship from X.' As next week’s plenary session approaches, attention also shifts to the political group leaders, who must decide whether to put a debate on Musk on the agenda. A debate has been proposed by the Socialists under the title: 'Elon Musk and the abuse of social media – threats to European democracy.' The Conference of Presidents – the Parliament's leadership body – will discuss the proposal on Wednesday evening, with Commission vice-president in charge of regulating Musk's X, Henna Virkkunen, in attendance.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfCV9aVM5t2M5SdnWMRYJTU	2025-01-15T16:11:12-08:00	
Strategic Partnership Agreement Between Armenia And The USA: An A...	The signing of a strategic partnership document in Washington between Armenia’s Foreign Minister Ararat Mirzoyan and U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken can be considered an unsurprising and anticipated development. Over the past four years, the Biden administration’s Armenia-focused regional policies, the deepening of bilateral cooperation in various spheres, and the June 2024 decision by the U.S. and Armenian governments to elevate their relations to the level of a strategic partnership made the signing of such a document predictable. Another important point worth noting is that the Pashinyan government chose to sign this significant document with the Biden administration during its final days in power. This indicates that the Armenian government may lack confidence in the long-term prospects of bilateral relations and, therefore, aims to institutionalize the development of U.S.-Armenia ties under the current administration. From a broader context, the signing of the strategic partnership charter between the two countries prompts a reassessment of the geopolitical balance in the South Caucasus. Evaluating the potential threats and challenges posed by this agreement for Azerbaijan necessitates a regional and global perspective. The U.S. Approach to Strategic Partnerships The United States has signed strategic partnership agreements with various countries worldwide, typically encompassing security, economy, energy, and democracy. For instance: 1. Georgia: In 2009, the U.S. and Georgia signed a Strategic Partnership Charter. This agreement expanded cooperation in security, energy, and democratic reforms. 2. Kazakhstan: The U.S. has developed strategic partnerships with Kazakhstan, focusing on energy, nuclear security, and economic cooperation. For example, Kazakhstan’s uranium reserves have been a central focus of collaboration. 3. Turkey: As NATO allies, the U.S. and Turkey maintain a strategic partnership covering security, defense industries, and energy sectors. These examples could be extended further. As demonstrated, U.S. strategic partnership agreements encompass political, military, economic, and social components. The agreement with Armenia should be analyzed within this context. According to official statements from both countries, the U.S.-Armenia strategic partnership agreement primarily focuses on two areas: 1. Security Cooperation: A special U.S. border security group is scheduled to visit Armenia next week. This signifies collaboration in border protection and efforts to enhance American influence in the region. Additionally, military cooperation, joint exercises, and military education programs are part of the agreement. 2. Deepening Strategic Dialogue: This agreement is a continuation of the strategic dialogue announced in June 2024 and reflects Armenia’s efforts toward integration with the West. U.S.-Azerbaijan Relations: Is There a Strategic Partnership? Azerbaijan and the U.S. have engaged in long-standing cooperation in the energy sector. Beginning with the 'Contract of the Century' in 1994, this collaboration resulted in significant U.S. oil company investments in Azerbaijan’s economy. This agreement also facilitated Azerbaijan’s integration into Western energy markets. Additionally, Azerbaijan has cooperated with the U.S. on counterterrorism, border security, and regional stability. However, this cooperation has not been formalized under a 'strategic partnership' designation, marking a critical difference compared to Armenia’s agreement. Is the U.S.-Armenia Agreement a Threat to Azerbaijan? It would be inaccurate to classify this agreement as a direct threat to Azerbaijan. There is no evidence that the U.S. intends to form a military alliance with Armenia or pursue specific anti-Azerbaijani policies under this framework. However, the agreement does present certain challenges for Azerbaijan: 1. Weakened U.S.-Azerbaijan Relations: The warming of U.S.-Armenia ties could further strain already problematic relations between Baku and Washington. 2. Potential Armenian Armament: In the near term, Armenia may accelerate its military modernization with U.S. support. 3. Impact on the Peace Process: The elevation of U.S.-Armenia relations to a strategic partnership level could negatively affect the Armenia-Azerbaijan peace process. Feeling U.S. backing, Armenia might adopt less constructive positions during negotiations. 4. Regional Implications: U.S. support for Armenia in border security could draw attention from neighboring countries such as Iran and Russia. In conclusion, while the U.S.-Armenia strategic partnership agreement introduces new dynamics to the South Caucasus, it does not constitute a direct threat to Azerbaijan. It is also essential to note that this document reflects a partnership, not an alliance. As seen with similar agreements signed with other post-Soviet states, the U.S. employs these partnerships to pursue its regional interests. Despite the challenges posed by this agreement, Azerbaijan does not adopt a pessimistic view of its future relations with the U.S. The primary reason for this cautious optimism in Baku is the anticipated administration of Donald Trump. There is a belief that the new administration might revise its predecessor’s irrational South Caucasus policies and elevate relations with Azerbaijan to a new partnership level. Overall, the main goal of Azerbaijan’s foreign policy remains to deepen existing cooperation with regional and global power centers, including the U.S., to achieve stability and progress in the region.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfCV9aVM5t2M2xLSrgo37j0	2025-01-15T16:09:43-08:00	
TikTok ‘Refugees’ Flock To China’s RedNote	By Luisetta Mudie More than half a million users have piled onto the Chinese social media platform Xiaohongshu, also known as RedNote, days ahead of a looming ban on TikTok in the United States, according to data from app stores and social media videos. Styling themselves 'TikTok refugees,' many young Americans, seeking an alternative to TikTok, are flocking to join RedNote’s 300 million existing users -- who are mostly in China -- taking what they see as refuge from the ban, which could be enforced on Jan. 19. On Wednesday, Xiaohongshu, which literally means 'Little Red Book' -- a reference to the famous book of quotes from Mao Zedong, the founder of communist China -- topped the list of most popular free downloads on the Apple Store and the Google Play store for Android users in the United States. RedNote allows users to share videos, photos and text posts, along with various shopping features. Known as China’s version of Instagram, it is particularly popular for sharing travel, makeup and fashion tips. It is owned by Shanghai-based Xingyin Information Technology. More than 700,000 new users joined the app, a person close to the company told Reuters, although the company didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment. Estimates from app data research firm Sensor Tower showed that U.S. downloads of RedNote up by more than 200% year-on-year this week and 194% higher than the previous week, Reuters reported. The apparent exodus comes ahead of a Jan. 19 deadline for the banning of TikTok in the United States under a bipartisan bill, should its Chinese parent ByteDance not have sold it by that time. In April, U.S. President Joe Biden signed the bill amid concerns that China’s government was using TikTok both to collect sensitive data about Americans and feed them propaganda. Lawyers for Chinese-owned TikTok asked the Supreme Court on Jan. 10 to postpone implementation of the ban, which takes effect the day before President-elect Donald Trump takes office. Navigating in Chinese Since RedNote uses Mandarin Chinese, new users were using translation tools to navigate the site. Some were confused; others were gleeful. 'I have no idea what I’m doing here,' commented Elle Belle from the United States under the video that cited a desire to avoid platforms run by Zuckerman. 'I can’t even read the RULES.' 'I’m literally emotional right now bc we are so freaking awesome,' wrote @Unty Tan. Some hoped to relocate entire communities that existed on TikTok, while others said the move is a form of protest, or a way to avoid using platforms owned by Meta. 'I would rather stare at a language I can’t understand than to ever use a social media [platform] that Mark Zuckerberg owns,' says one former TikToker in a video posted to the platform on Jan. 13, referring to the Facebook CEO. The aversion to Meta was apparently linked to reports that the company had paid online activists to boost messages calling TikTok a threat to American children. ‘Give me all your datas’ But the surge of new RedNote users from the United States prompted a series of jokes and memes by long-term Chinese Xiaohongshu users, riffing on fears of spying and data collection. 'Welcome to spy station, give me all your datas,' quipped user @BubbleTea from Guangdong on Jan. 14, in a comment reposted to social media app Bluesky, accompanied by a cat photo. 'American datas!' replied another user, also with a cat photo. Meanwhile, Xiaohongshu user BigTooth donned a cowboy hat to address new arrivals in a broad Texas accent, teaching them how to comment on Chinese posts. 'You came over to this app, wanting to learn some Chinese, but you ain’t even got a Chinese keyboard on your phone,' he says. 'But it’s OK. Don’t worry about that.' 'I’m gonna teach you three Chinese expressions, and you can even type them out with your English keyboard,' he adds, suggesting '6,' '66' or '666' to indicate approval, XSWL, 'Dying laughing,' and NB, a somewhat rude expression that nonetheless means something is admirable. American users started putting the tips into practice in comments. '66 (am I doing it right?),' commented U.S.-based RedNote user @KotaGibbs, gaining more than 1,000 likes. 'You’re missing one 6, should be 666,' answered user @Cold from Canada. Comparing notes Many users compared notes about each other’s countries, according to screenshots of conversations posted to Bluesky on Jan. 15. 'Can you guys tell us what’s wrong with our country, looking at it from your perspective outside of America?' asks one user. 'Just wondering if it is true that Americans need to have 2-3 jobs to survive?' @momo_yu wanted to know. 'yes, the economy is not great so people work multiple jobs just to live,' user @ally replied from the United States. 'People have guns and shoot children for no reason,' answered @thisisjiaming from Beijing. 'Sadly this is true,' commented @kimkimchii from the United States. 'You people still believe election can improve your life,' wrote @Vivianfunny from Hong Kong, where only 'patriots' approved by Beijing are allowed to run in elections. Some American users embraced the new experience. 'I’m having a lot of fun over there, we share a sense of humor and beefs with our governments,' Bluesky user ‪DarbyMae Shaw‬ ‪commented on Jan. 15. But others weren’t too sure. '😂😂 less funny is that it censors posts from people of color and the lgbt community,' user @kluggin responded, in a reference to the ruling Chinese Communist Party’s far-reaching social media censorship. Can you add a translation feature? According to a Jan. 13 article on the website Advocate.com, one 'TikTok refugee' reported being banned for posting content about transgender people. While some memes and videos crossed the language barrier by using subtitles, other users were crying out for automatic translation, according to a comment on the Apple Store. 'Please please please!!! I love this app so so so much but I only speak english,' said a review by Sour_emy. 'A lot of people in the us are moving to this app ... so I was hoping there could be a translation feature added for things like comments and descriptions!!' 'It would bring a lot of new people coming from tiktok,' the review said. Users seemed relatively unworried by the security concerns that also surround Xiaohongshu. The government of democratic Taiwan banned its officials from using Xiaohongshu, Douyin and TikTok amid concerns that the Chinese-owned platforms could compromise the island’s security. Meanwhile, a Chinese journalist now living in the United States who declined to be named for fear of reprisals said the exodus seemed ironic to him. 'It’s hilarious that they’re escaping from an American prison run by the Chinese to a Chinese prison that’s also run by the Chinese,' the journalist said.

What Comes After A Gaza Ceasefire Deal – OpEd	By Osama Al-Sharif A long-awaited ceasefire deal between Israel and Hamas appears imminent, according to US, Israeli, Qatari and Palestinian sources. After months of fruitless negotiations, the two sides are now closer than ever to sealing a multi-phased agreement that would bring an end to the bloodletting, allow for the release of Israeli captives and Palestinian prisoners, and ensure a gradual Israeli withdrawal from war-ravaged Gaza. Details are sketchy, but what is clear is that US President-elect Donald Trump has stepped in and put pressure on Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to embrace a deal before his inauguration on Jan. 20. President Joe Biden also spoke of an agreement to be sealed soon, while Secretary of State Antony Blinken unveiled his vision for a postwar Gaza on Tuesday. Speaking about his own foreign policy achievements, Biden mentioned the plight of the people of Gaza, 'who have been through hell,' and spoke of the right of Palestinians to self-determination. Trump, on his part, said on Monday: 'We are very close to getting it done. There has been a handshake, and they are getting it finished. If it won’t happen, there will be a lot of trouble.' It is ironic and sad that Trump has been able to push all parties to accept a deal when Biden could have done the same months ago, thus sparing many innocent lives on both sides. The fact that Biden and Blinken have allowed Netanyahu and his far-right coalition to carry out the worst genocide in modern times, all while supplying Israel with tens of billions of dollars-worth of arms, is an indelible stain that has made the US complicit in the Gaza carnage. Trump will take credit for stopping the massacre and ending what had become the most horrific war against civilians in the 21st century. Netanyahu, who wasted no opportunity to derail an agreement that could have been reached many months ago, finds himself in a corner. He has not delivered a 'total victory,' nor has his army been able to free all hostages. Under the proposed agreement, the Israeli military will withdraw from key positions in Gaza, culminating in total withdrawal in the final phase of the ceasefire agreement. The end of the war — a final cessation of hostilities that is yet to be agreed upon — will trigger a political crisis in Israel. Netanyahu’s far-right partners have threatened to quit the coalition. Pressure will rise in Israel for an independent inquiry into the events of Oct. 7, 2023. Netanyahu’s trial on corruption charges will resume. His margin of maneuverability will become much smaller. It is unlikely that he will be able to survive politically as captives begin to return home and the world has a first glance at the level of mass destruction Israel has inflicted on Gaza. Regarding the 'day-after' scenario, Blinken’s vision of a reformed Palestinian Authority role, with Arab participation, will depend on how the Trump team sees things. While Hamas has sustained significant losses in its leadership structure and military prowess in Gaza, it has survived as a political force. What role it will have in Gaza in the future depends on the Trump White House, Israel and, to some extent, the PA. Much also depends on what the people of Gaza want. They have paid the ultimate price for the events of Oct. 7, 2023, and it is up to them to determine their own future. They should be allowed to do so. The biggest challenges once a ceasefire deal is adopted are to facilitate the passage of humanitarian assistance and the documentation of war crimes in Gaza. That last challenge will not be mentioned in the ceasefire deal. But even if the war ends, the world should not ignore the fact that Israel has committed serious breaches of international law. Independent investigators and foreign journalists must be allowed into the stricken Strip. They have to report to the world the horrific war crimes that Israel has committed over the past 15 months. Accountability must be a cornerstone of any lasting agreement involving Gaza. Meanwhile, one has to be wary of Israel’s commitment to the ceasefire deal. In Lebanon, Israel has allegedly violated the agreement with Hezbollah hundreds of times. The same will happen in Gaza. Israel will find excuses to derail the deal and resume its aggression in Gaza. The guarantors — the US, Qatar and Egypt — must make sure that an end to the war is lasting and that Israel will have no reason to resume its attacks. Two complex issues are: who will end up ruling Gaza and when can reconstruction begin. Trump has yet to unveil his Middle East policy, especially regarding the future of the West Bank and the PA. He is reportedly eager to complete what he started with the Abraham Accords. He is to make clear his stand on Palestinian statehood and the right to self-determination. These are issues that will shape the region and the future of the Palestinian-Israeli conflict. More than 15 months of the Israeli war on Gaza have failed to liquidate the Palestinian issue. Despite the destruction, the targeting of women and children, journalists, doctors, medics, academics and aid workers, the world today is more aware of the just cause of the Palestinians than ever before. And then there is the issue of inter-Palestinian reconciliation. The Palestinian leadership must conclude that reconciliation and unity are the bulwark of a just cause that the world must address and rectify. After more than 46,000 fatalities — although that figure could double once the war ends — the Palestinians must overcome their differences and find common ground if they are to plead their case to the world. And, as much as there must be Israeli accountability, there will also have to be a Palestinian revision of the consequences of the events of Oct. 7, 2023, and the geopolitical changes that have occurred as a result. Palestinians have the right to resist the occupiers but they must agree on how to conduct their resistance. Israel has used the Hamas attacks to launch a genocidal war that has claimed tens of thousands of innocent lives and wreaked inconceivable destruction on Gaza, home to more than 2.3 million Palestinians. There will have to be lessons learned. No outside actors can tag what has happened as a victory or a loss. It is for the people of Gaza to decide. After all, it is they who have paid the ultimate price. Osama Al-Sharif is a journalist and political commentator based in Amman.

Israel, Hamas Agree Cease-Fire Deal, Although Much ‘Uncertainty’ ...	By Kian Sharifi (RFE/RL) -- Israel and the U.S.-designated Palestinian terrorist group Hamas have reached a multiphase cease-fire deal that includes the exchange of Israeli hostages for some 1,000 Palestinian prisoners and the delivery of urgent humanitarian aid into the Gaza Strip. Mediated by Qatar and Egypt, the agreement will go into effect on January 19, according to Qatari Prime Minister Sheikh Mohammed Bin Abdulrahman al-Thani. It includes three stages, with the final stage focusing on the reconstruction of Gaza. The conflict broke out in October 2023, when Hamas-led militants attacked settlements in southern Israel, killing around 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and taking 251 hostages to Gaza. Israel retaliated by launching a devastating war in the Palestinian enclave that has killed over 46,000 people, according to Gaza health authorities. The conflict has led to the mass destruction of the territory and the displacement of most of its 2.3 million residents. What We Know The details of the agreement have not been formally published, but a clear image has emerged from official comments and media reports based on leaked drafts of the deal. In the first phase, a six-week cease-fire will begin, during which Israeli troops will gradually withdraw from central Gaza. During this phase, Hamas will release 33 hostages -- expected to be mostly women, the elderly, and the sick -- in exchange for Palestinians held in Israeli prisons. Some hostages were released in November 2023 in exchange for 240 Palestinian prisoners. Hamas is still holding 94 hostages, but Israel believes that only 60 are still alive. Palestinians displaced by the conflict will be allowed to return to their homes in the first phase of the deal, while humanitarian aid will start to flow into the Hamas-run enclave. Nearly the entirety of Gaza residents were forced to flee their homes, fueling a major humanitarian crisis. Further negotiations on the second and third phase of the agreement will begin on the 16th day of the deal’s implementation, and analysts say this could pose the first real challenge to the cease-fire’s longevity. The second phase of the agreement involves the release of the remaining hostages and, crucially, the end of the war. 'There is a lot of uncertainty as to whether Israel is committed to a permanent end of the conflict,' said Michael Horowitz, the head of intelligence at the Bahrain-based Le Beck International consultancy. What It Means The Iran-backed Hamas has suffered greatly in the course of the war, losing its leader, Ismail Haniyeh, and his successor, Yahya Sinwar, within months of each other. Horowitz said Hamas will claim victory simply because it survived the war. 'The question is whether it can truly return to power in Gaza, retain its military capabilities, and even capitalize on this perceived victory to consolidate its presence outside of Gaza, namely in the West Bank,' he added. Iran, whose so-called axis of resistance has suffered multiple setbacks since the outbreak of the Gaza war, sees the cease-fire as good news. Israel fought a devastating war with the U.S.-designated Lebanese political party and armed group Hezbollah late last year, decimating its senior leadership and degrading its military capabilities. Hezbollah came out of the war a shell of its former self, and its weakening led to the election of a president and prime minister in Lebanon who are favored by Western powers and Iran’s regional rivals. Adding insult to injury, Syrian rebel forces opposed to the government of Iran’s longtime ally Bashar al-Assad launched a lightning offensive on the very day that Hezbollah and Israel agreed to a cease-fire. The Iran- and Russia-backed government of Assad fell in under two weeks, dealing a major blow to both Tehran and Moscow’s regional ambitions. Horowitz said the Gaza cease-fire allows Iran to fully de-escalate and engage the Donald Trump administration once he takes office later this month. Iran may also sit back and recalibrate its strategy, such as deciding whether to re-arm Hamas, which Horowitz said may not pose the same threat to Israel as it once did for a long time. 'I think the West Bank may be more interesting for Iran, as this is where the future of the Palestinian divide between Hamas and Israel will play out,' he added. Many in Israel will welcome the end of the war and the return of hostages, but the cease-fire deal could turn into a headache for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who has claimed several times that the war will continue until 'total victory' over Hamas. Given the staunch opposition to the deal among far-right members of his cabinet -- some of whom have threatened to quit -- Netanyahu’s top priority will be to ensure his government does not collapse, according to Horowitz.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfCV9aVM5t2M-hjVBWmRX44	2025-01-15T16:01:03-08:00	
Rubio To Lobby Thailand Not To Deport Detained Uyghurs To China	By Josh Lipes and Shahrezad Ghayrat U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio – the incoming Trump administration’s pick to lead the U.S. State Department – will lobby Thailand to ensure that 48 ethnic Uyghurs held there on immigration charges are not sent back to China where they would likely face persecution, according to rights groups. The Florida Republican’s pledge underscores the potential impact he will have, if confirmed, over the next four years on ties between the United States and China. The relationship is under strain amid President-elect Donald Trump’s threats to slap sweeping tariffs on Chinese exports once he assumes office next week. Rubio, a noted China hawk, made the comments Wednesday when asked about the issue by fellow Sen. Jeff Merkley during a Senate hearing to confirm his appointment as America’s top envoy. '[Beijing] is seeking to repatriate Uyghurs who have escaped China, and right now there are 48 Uyghurs in Thailand, and Thailand is on the verge of repatriating them back to China,' said Merkley, a Democrat from Oregon. 'Will you lobby for Thailand to not send these Uyghurs back to the horror they will face if they’re returned?' Rubio said he would. 'Yes, and the good news is that Thailand is actually a very strong U.S. partner – strong historical ally as well – so that is an area where I think diplomacy could really achieve results because of how important that relationship is and how close it is,' he said. Rubio called the situation in Thailand 'one more opportunity for us to remind the world' about the persecution Uyghurs face in northwestern China’s Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region, where authorities have detained an estimated 1.8 million members of the ethnic minority in internment camps beginning in 2017. 'This is not some obscure issue,' Rubio said at Wednesday’s hearing. 'These are people who are basically being rounded up because of their ethnicity and religion and they are being put into camps.' Decade of detention The 48 Uyghurs have been detained at Thailand’s Immigration Detention Center since 2014 after attempting to use the Southeast Asian nation to escape persecution in China. They have been kept in poor conditions in the prison-like facility, barred from legal or social contact and denied access to healthcare, according to Campaign for Uyghurs, a U.S.-based advocacy group. On Monday, a Uyghur detainee told Radio Free Asia, a news service affiliated with BenarNews, that, upon hearing news late last week that he and others might be deported to China, 'we were deeply concerned and anxious.' In response, the 48 Uyghurs began a hunger strike on Jan. 10 and called upon fellow Uyghurs living abroad for support, said the detainee, who spoke on condition of anonymity over fear of reprisal. 'We are appealing to anyone who can assist in preventing our deportation to China,' he said at the time. On Tuesday, Campaign for Uyghurs warned that deportations would violate Thailand’s obligations under the Convention Against Tortureand its own Anti-Torture Act. The group of refugees is part of an originally larger cohort of over 350 Uyghur men, women and children, 172 of whom were resettled in Turkey, 109 deported back to China, and five who died because of inadequate medical conditions. Thailand is not a signatory to the 1951 U.N. Refugee Convention, and therefore does not recognize refugees. China pressures Thailand Rubio’s comments came days after U.S. Rep. Chris Smith, a New Jersey Republican who co-chairs the Congressional-Executive Commission on China, said that it appeared China was pressuring the Thai government to repatriate the remaining Uyghurs and hand them over 'to be incarcerated, tortured and cast away in forced labor camps as the U.S. implements its transition to a new government.' If Thailand gave into the pressure, it would be seen as unfavorable by the incoming Trump administration, he said in a statement on Monday. 'Forced rendition of refugees would also cast a pall on Thailand’s efforts to improve its own anti-trafficking record, given the prospect that Uyghurs will be sent to one of the Chinese Communist Party’s forced labor camps in the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region,' Smith said. 'Thailand needs to abide by its obligations under the Convention Against Torture, and it should immediately provide the United Nations Office of the High Commissioner for Refugees access to the refugees,' Smith said. Previously, the State Department and Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) said they have continued to remind governments, including Thailand’s, about obligations to uphold the principles of non-refoulement, which prohibit returning individuals to places where they are at risk of serious human rights violations. No immediate risk says advocacy group Despite concerns that the 48 Uyghurs could be forcibly repatriated to China, Turgunjan Alawdun, president of the World Uyghur Congress (WUC) told RFA that the advocacy organization 'received news' that they were no longer at immediate risk of being returned. The WUC said that because of the confidential nature of their communication, the Thai official cannot be identified. But it added that it had been working to coordinate a campaign for the detainees’ release with the European Union, U.S. lawmakers, UNHCR and rights groups. The official said Thailand’s image was seriously damaged after the deportation of more than 100 Uyghurs to China in 2015, and that the Southeast Asian country is still recovering. For Thailand to deport Uyghurs again would be 'diplomatic suicide,' the Thai official said, according to the WUC. Thailand has not officially indicated whether the Uyghurs will be protected from deportation and the WUC’s claim could not be independently confirmed. Thai officials did not immediately respond to RFA requests for comment. The WUC’s claim appears to have been corroborated by the UNHCR, which told RFA on Monday that, after hearing unconfirmed reports the Uyghurs were to be deported, it checked with Thai authorities who assured the agency to the contrary. Nevertheless, the Uyghurs must be released from the Thai immigration facility where they have been held for the past 10 years, Alawdun said on Tuesday. 'Although they are now safe from the immediate threat of deportation, having them remain imprisoned indefinitely does not align with international laws and regulations regarding human rights and freedom,' he said. 'We must not cease our efforts to secure their freedom.' The WUC has organized protests in front of Thai embassies on Friday, Alawdun said. 'Our main demand at these protests is the release of our imprisoned compatriots to a third free country,' he said. 'We are demanding that Thailand stop unjustly detaining them in prison.'	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfCV9aVM5t2Mw9MbLqhkHG4	2025-01-15T15:55:37-08:00	
Uzbekistan Unveils Plan To Upgrade Middle Corridor Trade	(Eurasianet) -- The Uzbek government is authorizing measures to diversify trade routes that bypass Russia. A decree issued by Uzbek President Shavkat Mirziyoyev sketches a five-year improvement plan to facilitate commerce via the Middle Corridor, an emerging network connecting China to Europe via the Caspian Sea corridor. The areas covered by the decree include expanding trade routes, reducing transportation costs and achieving greater efficiency in freight transport logistics. The underlying premise of the decree is that Uzbekistan must reduce its dependency on Russia as a gateway to trade with the West. Another aim of the decree is to improve infrastructure and procedures for tractor-trailer-borne goods, including an expanded network of truck stops and more efficient systems to reduce transit times at border crossings, including those at Davut-ota, Gisht Kuprik and Navoi. Transport Minister Ilkhom Makhkamov told news outlet O’zbekiston 24 that the plan additionally calls for improvements in connections to Afghanistan and Turkmenistan, with the aim of boosting trade with Iran, Turkey, Azerbaijan and Georgia. The measures outlined in the decree are designed to synchronize Westward-oriented trade corridors with the newly launched Kyrgyz-Uzbek-China railway. Officials from the three countries held a ground-breaking ceremony in late December, but construction work isn’t expected to commence in earnest until the summer of 2025.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfCV9aVM5t2M6Pl-AGDhMag	2025-01-15T15:52:16-08:00	
Five Popular Checks On Trump’s Agenda – OpEd	On the one hand, there’s no sugarcoating how progressives feel as President Trump retakes office: rough. Trump and his allies in Congress are already rolling out plans to cut taxes for billionaires, slash services for the rest of us, pollute the planet, and deport people who’ve lived here their whole lives. But if you look closely, you’ll see signs people aren’t just going to accept all this. Here are five that caught my eye from this past election year. 1. Populist anger is boiling over. Americans have had it with economic elites. Union activity has been on an upswing for a few years running now, with union petition filings in 2024 significantly up over 2023. After a successful national strike in 2023, the United Auto Workers won an election in Tennessee in 2024, a major breakthrough in the traditionally anti-union South. And more Amazon warehouse workers and drivers are pushing to unionize, breaking open one of America’s most anti-union corporations. Also last year, communities in places like Wisconsin fought back against a private equity takeover of nursing care. And nationally, popular anger positively exploded over the greed of health insurance companies. Trump likes to play a populist on TV. But if he moves to slash workers rights, cut taxes for CEOs, and erode health care access and other services, he’ll have a fight on his hands. 2. The peace movement is back. The movement for a ceasefire in Gaza drew support from a vast, diverse coalition of young people — with support from different faith communities (including many Jewish groups), as well as unions, environmentalists, and many others. They haven’t succeeded yet. But they’ve won broad, bipartisan public support for a ceasefire, an arms embargo on Israel’s extremist leaders, and a foreign policy informed by human rights. Politicians won’t be able to avoid this issue anytime soon. 3. Climate wins are slowly adding up. Our leaders continue to fail us on climate, with the fires in Southern California driving that point home dramatically. But an alternative vision is slowly taking shape. The Biden administration’s signature climate law, the Inflation Reduction Act, is unleashing record investments in green jobs, fueling unprecedented growth in renewable power across the United States. The more local support initiatives like these win, the harder they’ll be for Trump and his allies to reverse. 4. Most people support their immigrant neighbors. One of the worst moments of the 2024 campaign was the ridiculous slander of Haitian Americans in Springfield, Ohio by Donald Trump, JD Vance, and other right-wing figures. But Springfield natives showed up to support their Haitian neighbors, most of whom are in the country perfectly legally and have revitalized the community. Locals flocked to Haitian restaurants, churches, and community centers to show their solidarity, prompting even state and local Republicans to speak out against their leaders’ dangerous lies. There’s a lesson here. While hardline immigration measures can poll well in the abstract, people feel much differently when members of their own communities are affected. When it comes down to it, most people don’t want their neighbors deported. 5. Even where Democrats lost at the polls, progressive issues won. Forget 'red states' and 'blue states' — there’s support for progressive ideas in all 50 states. In the last election, several states that voted for Trump also passed ballot measures to raise the minimum wage, guarantee paid leave, protect abortion access, and liberalize their marijuana laws. It’s a trend that’s been building for years. Once you filter out the noise around candidates and just ask people about progressive policies directly, even 'red state' voters tend to say yes. The key is to make candidates themselves run on those policies — without watering them down. In short, our politics are a mess right now. But our country isn’t 'lost' — only our leaders are. When Americans organize around our common decency, it’s going to get a lot harder for bullies like Trump to walk over us.

Nigeria Tops Report For Number Of Christians Killed, Kidnapped In...	By Hannah Brockhaus Nigeria was the country with the most Christians killed and kidnapped in 2024, according to the latest report from advocacy group Open Doors. The World Watch List, released Jan. 15, found that 3,100 Christians were killed and 2,830 Christians were kidnapped in Nigeria in 2024, far more than other countries in the same year. The report also said the country with the most Christians arrested in 2024 was India, at 2,176, and Rwanda experienced the most attacks on Christian churches or buildings with 4,000. The Open Doors watch list confirmed that Christian persecution continued to grow 'in absolute terms' among the about 100 countries the group monitored in 2024, with 13 countries classified at 'extreme levels' of Christian persecution. The group estimates over 380 million Christians worldwide experienced at least a 'high level' of persecution and discrimination because of their faith. North Korea, Somalia, Yemen, Libya, and Sudan are the report’s top five countries for Christian persecution in 2024. Nigeria ranks No. 7 on the watch list. Eritrea, Pakistan, Iran, Afghanistan, India, Saudi Arabia, and Myanmar round out the top 13 countries, all classified as having 'extreme' levels of anti-Christian persecution. With the release of the World Watch List 2025, Open Doors Italy Director Cristian Nani said, '380 million Christians in the world do not enjoy the basic human right to believe what they want. How many more killed, displaced, abused, and imprisoned Christians do we need to count before we put religious freedom at the center of public debate?' 'In 32 years of research, we record a steady increase in anti-Christian persecution in absolute terms,' Nani added. '2024 is again a record year of intolerance: 1 in 7 Christians suffer discrimination or persecution because of their faith: It is crucial to get back to talking about religious freedom in the public debate.' Open Doors, which supports persecuted Christians in more than 70 countries, compiles its annual World Watch List through information from local networks, national researchers, external experts, and an ad hoc team of analysts. To formulate its ranking, the advocacy group analyzes the pressure on a Christian’s life in five areas: private, family, community, church, and public life. Violence is added as a separate element in the analysis. Nigeria has been grappling with Muslim extremist violence since 2009, perpetrated by groups such as Boko Haram, which reportedly persecute Christians, sometimes kidnapping them for ransom and, in some cases, killing them. While a 2025 report from the pontifical charity Aid to the Church in Need said the abduction of Catholic clergy and religious in Nigeria decreased from 28 in 2023 to 12 in 2024, it is still one of the most dangerous countries in which to be a priest or religious. The latest religious to be kidnapped in Nigeria, Sisters Vincentia Maria Nwankwo and Grace Mariette Okoli, who were abducted on Jan. 7 from the Archdiocese of Onitsha, have been released and are 'in good health,' according to the leadership of their congregation, the Immaculate Heart of Mary, Mother of Christ (IHM).	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfCV9aVM5t2M-GHaCvqFrNh	2025-01-15T15:46:20-08:00	
Biden Bids Farewell With Oval Office Address	By Patsy Widakuswara U.S. President Joe Biden gives his farewell address from the Oval Office Wednesday evening, five days before he ends his term and President-elect Donald Trump is inaugurated. In a letter released Wednesday morning, Biden reflected on how his administration began in the shadows of COVID-19 and the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol by a mob of Trump supporters intent on overturning the result of the 2020 election that Biden won. 'Four years ago, we stood in a winter of peril and a winter of possibilities,' he said in the letter. 'But we came together as Americans, and we braved through it. We emerged stronger, more prosperous, and more secure.' The president’s farewell address comes a day after Jack Smith, the special counsel who indicted Trump on charges of illegally trying to cling to power after the 2020 election, released his final report. Smith’s report said that the evidence would have been sufficient to convict the president-elect in a trial, had his 2024 election victory not made it impossible for the prosecution to continue. Trump has repeatedly denied wrongdoing and attacked the special counsel’s work as politically motivated. Biden’s speech follows remarks he made Monday at the U.S. State Department defending his foreign policy record and will be his fifth and final formal address from the Oval Office. In his previous Oval Office address six months ago, Biden explained his decision to step aside and endorse his vice president, Kamala Harris, to run against Trump in the 2024 election. Biden reflected on the 'battle for the soul of America' framework that he campaigned on in 2020 when he won against Trump. 'I ran for president because I believed that the soul of America was at stake,' Biden wrote, arguing that is still the case and that America is an idea based on the belief that 'we are all created equal, endowed by our Creator with certain unalienable rights, among them life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.' 'We’ve never fully lived up to this sacred idea, but we’ve never walked away from it either,' he said. 'And I do not believe the American people will walk away from it now.' Biden’s legacy Biden is leaving office with a 39% approval rating, according to Gallup. He has been using the final weeks of his administration to cement his legacy. Thomas Schwartz, presidential historian from Vanderbilt University in Tennessee, said that Biden’s legacy will be affected by how Trump governs in the next four years. 'If Trump ends up being a disaster … either ushering economic chaos, or if there's more world chaos from conflicts, Biden will be remembered more favorably,' he told VOA. 'If Trump really proves to be as dangerous to democratic norms as Biden and the Democrats suggested, then I think he may be seen as very prophetic.' Conversely, by inheriting a strong economy and a winding down of U.S. foreign entanglements, Trump has the potential to become a president in the caliber of Ronald Reagan, Schwartz said. In which case Biden will be noted by historians for his legislative achievements but 'won’t be remembered as fondly.' The White House also released an extensive fact sheet detailing the Biden-Harris administration’s achievements domestically and abroad. The sheet highlighted 'historic' economic progress that added 16.6 million jobs, grew the GDP by 12.6% and raised median household wealth by 37%. It underscored investments in infrastructure, clean energy, and semiconductors through Biden’s signature legislation, the Inflation Reduction Act and CHIPS Act. The White House argued that through targeted relief and fair taxation, the Biden administration rebuilt a 'stronger, fairer economy,' creating opportunity from the bottom up. On the foreign policy front, the administration insists it is leaving the incoming Trump administration with a 'very strong hand to play.' 'We're leaving an America with more friends and stronger alliances, whose adversaries are weaker and under pressure,' the president said in his foreign policy address Monday, 'an America that once again is leading, uniting countries, setting the agenda, bringing others together behind our plans and visions.' The president again defended his decision to withdraw the U.S. from Afghanistan in 2021. Republicans and some Democrats have criticized the manner with which Biden ended America's longest war as chaotic, costing the lives of 13 service members and dozens of Afghan civilians in a terrorist attack in Kabul. Biden said in the letter it has been 'the privilege of my life to serve this nation for over 50 years.' 'Nowhere else on Earth could a kid with a stutter from modest beginnings in Scranton, Pennsylvania, and Claymont, Delaware, one day sit behind the Resolute Desk in the Oval Office as President of the United States,' he added. 'I have given my heart and my soul to our nation. And I have been blessed a million times in return with the love and support of the American people.' Asked about his post-presidency role, Biden last week said, 'I’m not going to be out of sight or out of mind.'	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfCV9aVM5t2MzFYJ05qC5UZ	2025-01-15T15:43:27-08:00	
Behind The India-China Talks: Unravelling Beijing’s Deceptive Lon...	By Kalpit A. Mankikar Sun Tzu’s treatise on war offers many stratagems to deal with the enemy. He emphasises deception and patience, cautioning that the general who makes many calculations like a chess player is more likely to win. Unfortunately, endurance is in short supply when it comes to India-China dynamics, especially in the era of 24/7 news cycles. In December 2024, the 23rd meeting of the Special Representatives (SRs) between India’s National Security Advisor, Ajit Doval, and China’s Foreign Minister, Wang Yi, took place after a hiatus of nearly five years. The SRs mechanism was constituted in an agreement in 2003, which mandated that ways to resolve the boundary question should be looked into from a political perspective. In the Indian readout, both Doval and Wang Yi underscored the overall India-China bilateral relationship was dependent on the maintenance of peace and tranquillity in border regions. Decks are being cleared for the Kailash Mansarovar pilgrimage in Tibet, trade in border areas, and data sharing on trans-border rivers. The Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs communique refers to the 'six consensus'—developments related to the disengagement along the border—as a 'solution'. It states that the border issue should be 'handled appropriately', and should not affect the development of bilateral relations. It cites efforts on both sides to arrive at a 'mutually acceptable package solution' to the border issue, based on the SR accord on the boundary issue reached in 2005. The Chinese readout also pledges that the two nations must empower the SRs framework, and strengthen coordination and cooperation in diplomatic and military negotiations. It also refers to the continuation of the SRs mechanism through a meeting in the next year, underlining that a stable China-India relationship is key to peace in Asia. The Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs assesses the SR mechanism’s revival as 'hard-won', giving an impression that it values efforts to normalise ties after the tense military standoff. Yet, like the generals listening to Sun Tzu’s counsel, Beijing had other calculations up its sleeve. While all along, China’s actions were classified as grey-zone warfare, academics are now increasingly debating the use of the term 'ICAD', denoting 'illegal, coercive, aggressive and deceptive' behaviour, to explain Beijing’s tactics. China is building on its ICAD strategy, as evidenced by its large hydro-power project on the Yarlung-Tsangpo river in Tibet, which becomes the Brahmaputra after it enters Arunachal Pradesh. New Delhi has conveyed its concerns to Beijing, insisting that the interests of lower riparian states like Bangladesh be protected. Furthermore, the Xinjiang Autonomous Region announced the formation of two counties in the Hotanprefecture, subsuming territory in Ladakh. This is in line with the cartographic-onslaught strategy under which China earlier unilaterally renamed towns in Arunachal Pradesh, to which it lays claims. Beijing has also published an official map showing large parts of Indian territory as part of China. This renewed belligerence might be propelled by China’s calculations that New Delhi was too eager to reduce tensions with Beijing, and due to the important divergences in New Delhi and Washington D.C.’s strategic interests. Liu Zongyi, Director of the South Asia Research Center of the Shanghai Institutes for International Studies, assesses that India’s motivation to mend fences with China is influenced primarily by financial and economic considerations. First, he points to the fact that the military standoff in eastern Ladakh has drained India’s finances due to heightened investments in weapon purchases and physical infrastructure development, diverting New Delhi’s focus from the Indian Ocean. Second, he adds that Western-led containment alliances around China had led to strategic competition between Washington and Beijing and that India was keen to use this opportunity to develop its economy, for which it needed China as a development partner. Third, there is also a belief that India was relenting on its 'xiè mò shā lǘ' [卸磨杀驴] attitude towards Chinese corporates, which roughly translates ‘to kill the donkey after the grinding is done’. The implication here is that New Delhi unjustly curbed Chinese firms doing business in India. Yuan Jirong, who covers India, as a correspondent for a Chinese media outlet, believes India-US compact is fraying due to divergent strategic interests. First, he makes this argument based on an assessment by Washington that India was a 'big country' pursuing its own interests, and it would never formally become an ally of the US, thus circumscribing US-India cooperation. Second, he also argues that India’s aspiration for global leadership will mean that it may challenge the US. Conversely, he also suggests that Washington’s goal is to encourage competition between the two developing powers that are rising parallelly, thus letting its global hegemony continue. This pessimistic outlook on India-US relations does not seem to be rooted in reality, given that US National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan visited Delhi in January 2025, meeting the Indian leadership to take stock of the 'Comprehensive Global Strategic Partnership' between the two nations in sectors like technology, defence, space, civil nuclear, clean energy, semiconductors, and artificial intelligence (AI). Washington has also announced its intent to remove hurdles to cooperation in the field of civil nuclear, including removing regulations for Indian scientific establishments, under which they are subjected to export restrictions with respect to specific goods and know-how. During Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping at the October 2024 BRICS summit in Russia, Modi affirmed that stable India-China relations would contribute to a multi-polar Asia and a multi-polar world. Chinese strategists feel that India’s conceptualisation of a 'multipolar Asia' as the basis of a 'multipolar world', places India on an equal footing with China in Asia, thereby hindering Chinese ambitions to become the dominant power in Asia. Beijing feels that given the power differential between the two, India would be incentivised to join other countries to check and balance China. Thus, China would prefer to keep the border issue alive, and its projection of a rapprochement is only a ruse to further its ICAD strategy. About the author: Kalpit A.

China’s Debt Diplomacy: Economic Expansion Or Strategic Coercion?...	China’s Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) has been heralded as a transformative vision for global infrastructure development, linking continents through an intricate web of trade routes, ports, and railways. With over 140 countries participating and an estimated $1 trillion in investments, the BRI’s scale is unprecedented. However, the promise of prosperity often comes with a hidden cost, as many nations find themselves ensnared in unsustainable debt and geopolitical dependencies. For many developing nations, what begins as an opportunity for growth soon morphs into a precarious trap of unsustainable debt and strategic dependence. The Indian Ocean Region: A Theater of Debt Diplomacy The Indian Ocean Region (IOR) has emerged as a pivotal arena for Chinese investments under the BRI due to its critical role in global trade. Over 80% of the world’s maritime oil trade passes through the IOR, making it a strategic chokepoint for global commerce. Ports such as Hambantota in Sri Lanka, Gwadar in Pakistan, and Chittagong in Bangladesh illustrate Beijing’s calculated strategy of embedding itself in regional infrastructure to bolster its influence and secure economic and military footholds. The results, however, have often been economically devastating for the host nations. Sri Lanka: The Hambantota Port, financed by a $1.4 billion Chinese loan, quickly became a liability for Sri Lanka. Unable to service its debt, the nation was compelled to lease the port to a Chinese state-owned enterprise for 99 years. This lease highlighted the severe financial repercussions for Sri Lanka and highlighted Beijing’s ability to convert economic leverage into strategic advantage. The port’s location, just a few nautical miles from vital shipping lanes, grants China significant influence over one of the world’s busiest maritime corridors. For Sri Lanka, the arrangement has sparked domestic debates over sovereignty and economic mismanagement, while for the region, it has raised alarms about the precedent it sets for Chinese control over critical infrastructure. The port’s potential use for military purposes emphasises its strategic importance to Beijing. Pakistan: The $60 billion China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC), a flagship BRI project, exemplifies the pitfalls of unchecked borrowing. Beset by financial irregularities and security concerns, CPEC has left Pakistan grappling with mounting debt and an economy on the brink of collapse. Despite promises of economic revival, the corridor has exacerbated Pakistan’s financial instability. Maldives: Chinese investments in the Maldives, including major infrastructure projects, have plunged the island nation into significant debt. A recent financial cooperation agreement between the Maldives and China aims to mitigate its economic distress but raises questions about further entrenchment of Chinese influence. Africa: A Continent Entangled Africa’s extensive participation in the BRI has brought much-needed infrastructure and a legacy of debt distress. For instance, the Nairobi-Mombasa Standard Gauge Railway in Kenya, lauded as a transformative project, has faced criticism for its steep costs and questionable profitability. On the other hand, Ethiopia’s Addis Ababa-Djibouti railway showcases some success in connecting landlocked nations to ports, albeit under heavy financial dependence on China. Zambia’s reliance on Chinese loans has placed it in a precarious situation, with fears of losing control over critical national infrastructure such as airports and power plants. These examples illustrate the dichotomy of outcomes within Africa, highlighting the need for better financial scrutiny and sustainable partnerships. Zambia: With Chinese loans accounting for a significant portion of its external debt, Zambia faces the risk of losing control over key infrastructure, including airports and power plants. This vulnerability highlights the dangers of over-leveraging through opaque financial arrangements. Kenya: The Standard Gauge Railway, a flagship project funded by China, has been criticised for its exorbitant costs and lack of financial viability. The project underlines how Chinese loans often burden economies without delivering proportional benefits. The Dual-Use Strategy China’s infrastructure investments frequently serve dual purposes, blurring the lines between civilian and military objectives. Ports initially constructed for commercial use, such as Gwadar and Hambantota, have strategic potential to bolster Beijing’s military footprint in the Indo-Pacific. This dual-use approach allows China to extend its strategic reach while maintaining plausible deniability. Economic Dependency as a Strategic Tool Beyond infrastructure, China’s debt diplomacy leverages economic dependencies to sustain its industrial economy. This strategy enables Beijing to dominate local markets by flooding them with cheap goods, undermining domestic industries and stifling their growth. Over time, host nations find their manufacturing capacities eroded, forcing them to rely on imports from China. This dependency weakens economic sovereignty and shapes domestic policies, as governments often prioritise debt repayment over social and economic development. The resulting fiscal constraints reduce the capacity for public investment, entrenching economic stagnation and furthering China’s influence. A Case for Alternatives: India’s Approach India’s strategic investments starkly contrast China’s opaque and predatory lending practices. The development of Chabahar Port in Iran and the operationalisation of the North-South Transport Corridor emphasise regional connectivity and mutual benefit. India’s focus on transparency and economic sustainability offers a more equitable engagement model for developing nations. Lessons and Warnings The cautionary tales of Sri Lanka, Pakistan, and Zambia highlight the risks of engaging with China’s BRI without thoroughly assessing the long-term implications. While the allure of infrastructure development is compelling, nations must prioritise sustainable partnerships over short-term gains. Transparent and accountable alternatives, such as those offered by India and other global powers, are crucial to countering the strategic and economic coercion embedded in China’s debt diplomacy. As developing nations navigate these geopolitical waters, they must choose between development and stagnation and between sovereignty and subjugation. The consequences of these decisions will shape the global order for decades to come.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWdnrnpeCzdSz4Yqqaq6Cv8m	2025-01-14T17:25:19-08:00	
Singapore’s New Prime Minister Entangled In Old Politics – Analys...	By Michael Barr For Singapore’s People’s Action Party (PAP) government, the best news of 2024 came in May, when then prime minister Lee Hsien Loong (72) handed the premiership to his handpicked successor, Lawrence Wong (then 51). Lee’s succession plans had been the nagging background story in Singapore politics since 2016. After a painful journey replete with a disastrous first choice of successor, compounded by years of procrastination, the result has been a camera-friendly new prime minister who presents the reassurance of continuity and competence supplemented by a veneer of generational change and youthful energy. The rest of 2024 continued the narrative of 2023, in which most political stories were negative developments that the government needed to manage, rather than positive developments that it could exploit. The least edifying stories were those about elite politics, in which story after story featured the government devoting the resources and the time of the cabinet, the parliament, the Attorney-General’s Chambers and the police variously pursuing Lee Hsien Loong’s private agenda against his siblings, prosecuting the Leader of the Opposition and cleaning up the ruling elite’s dirty laundry. More mundane was the December news that two cabinet ministers are suing Bloomberg for its reporting of transactions related to their personal residential properties, which totalled nearly $120 million Singapore dollars (US$88.2 million). The Singapore press managed to report the libel action without mentioning the value of the ministers’ real estate portfolios. One of the lowest points for the government in 2024 was the conviction in October of a former senior cabinet minister, S Iswaran, on corruption charges. The conviction came only after the original charges were downgraded to those that would apply to a civil servant who had not declared a gift. At least Iswaran faced jail time. In 2023, after the US Department of Justice caught six senior executives of a Singapore-based government-linked company paying US$55 million in bribes, the company was fined US$422 million but the executives were not charged or publicly identified due to ‘lack of evidence’. An even lower depth was plumbed with the news, also released in October, that the UK government had granted Lee Hsien Loong’s younger brother, Lee Hsien Yang, political asylum. Hsien Yang was in a property dispute with his brother over the estate of their late father, former prime minister Lee Kuan Yew. Even though Lee Hsien Loong did not contest his father’s will — in which Lee Kuan Yew explicitly stated his wish to demolish the family home — the Singapore state has deployed the power of the cabinet, the parliament, the police, the Urban Redevelopment Authority and the Building and Construction Authority to advance Lee Hsien Loong’s agenda of turning the family home into a memorial to his father and himself. The conflation of public and private interest is nothing new, with members of founding prime minister Lee Kuan Yew’s family routinely occupying senior positions in government-linked corporations and Singapore’s two sovereign wealth funds. He also had a record of publicly justifying policy changes by referencing the lived experience of his children, and more than once introduced educational innovations that happened to benefit his children and grandchildren. But earlier generations of politicians in Singapore kept tighter control of the narrative and kept the discretionary acts of self-interest within tighter bounds. Today’s leaders seem to think they can maintain control of the narrative while flaunting their deployment of state power in pursuit of private agendas. This is a significant turning point in Singapore’s pattern of governance, since it subordinates the common good to self-interest. Singapore’s ruling elite has never been shy about pursuing self-interest while in office as long as no laws were broken and no conflicts of interest became subjects of common gossip – a standard that was easy to maintain because of the complete absence of any laws or conventions requiring political office holders to declare their financial interests, assets or conflicts of interest. Lee Hsien Loong’s successor could make his mark by resurrecting these modest standards while policing the precedent set by Iswaran’s plea bargain, requiring the declaration of ‘gifts’ to government ministers. Lawrence Wong arrived in office as Lee Hsien Loong’s protege. His political apprenticeship consisted of three years working closely with Lee as his Principal Private Secretary. Since stepping up as prime minister, Wong has indicated that he wants to make changes, but this will not be easy while Lee Hsien Loong continues to sit in Cabinet as Senior Minister. So far, the primary assertion of Wong’s independence has been his choice of deputy prime ministers in May. Wong chose two men a generation older than himself, neither of whom could challenge or undermine his leadership. But he was unable to replicate this pattern in the December 2024 election of the powerful Central Executive Committee of the PAP, where Wong was elected secretary-general but is flanked by two assistant secretaries-general who were his rivals in the race to be prime minister. If Wong is looking to both stake a claim to leadership and rein in the culture of self-interest and self-absorption, a decisive first step would be to end the Singaporean state’s partisan involvement in the Lee family feud. Continuing with business as usual will confirm that Lee is still the boss. About the author: Michael Barr is Associate Professor of International Relations at Flinders University.

Vietnam’s Deep Integration Into The CPTPP Will Substantially Impa...	By Zhou Chao Recently there have been media reports that Vietnam seems to be further reforming the power structure of its ruling party. The reports suggest that the Communist Party (CPV) in Vietnam is dividing the party’s internal power into three major areas in hopes of achieving a rational division to improve decision-making efficiency. The further improvement of the checks and balances mechanism within the CPV’s power structure also 'helps strengthen internal supervision, ensure effective checks on power, and make the selection of cadres more reasonable'. However, as for the credibility of the reports, there is currently no substantial and strong evidence to confirm the authenticity through in-depth investigation and comparisons. That said, it is important to note that in the past decade, Vietnam has undergone profound changes in many areas, including politics, economy, and society. First, in terms of the political power structure, the highest political power in Vietnam is divided into four major pillars, known as 'tứ trụ' in Vietnamese: the General Secretary of the CPV, the President, the Prime Minister, and the Chairman of the National Assembly. These four positions are held by different individuals, reflecting a balance of power. Since 2021, after Nguyễn Phú Trọng stepped down as President, Tô Lâm briefly held both the positions of General Secretary and President for five months before quickly relinquishing the latter. Since then, Vietnam’s highest power structure has no longer displayed a 'triple unity' of party, government, and military. Since 2001, the CPV’s Central Committee has abolished the Politburo Standing Committee and retained only the Secretariat, with the number of Politburo members gradually increasing from 7 in the 12th Party Congress to 18 in the 13th Party Congress, showing a general trend of decentralization in the highest power structure. Second, the anti-corruption campaign continues to deepen. On December 24, 2024, the Government Inspectorate of Vietnam held a nationwide online meeting to provide a preliminary summary of the implementation of the Anti-Corruption Law over the past five years. Data shows that from 2020 to 2024, a total of 264 leaders at various levels were disciplined for dereliction of duty and for condoning corrupt practices; 73 individuals were criminally prosecuted for causing corruption due to negligence. Notably, both former Presidents Nguyễn Xuân Phúc and Võ Văn Thưởng were ousted due to involvement in corruption. Third, political freedom continues to increase. Previously, in local elections, Vietnamese voters could directly elect representatives to the People's Councils at various levels, and these representatives were responsible for formulating local policies and overseeing the work of local governments. In recent years, Vietnam has continued to implement groundbreaking reforms in the political field. In some local elections, independent candidates have been allowed to run, which has increased political diversity and competition to some extent. As a one-party state, Vietnam has never expressed its intention to adopt a separation of powers system, but under the trend of the ruling party self-limiting its power, social and political freedoms have improved. Fourth, economic market-oriented reforms continue to advance. In December 2024, Vietnam's Ministry of Home Affairs announced that after streamlining, the government is expected to have only 13 ministries, 4 ministerial-level agencies (a reduction of 5), and 5 government-affiliated agencies (a reduction of 3), along with a reduction of 190 public service units. Through this approach, the Vietnamese authorities aim to streamline institutions, clarify functions, and save costs, ensuring that government functions are fully aligned with supporting the development of the market economy. In recent years, Vietnam has also implemented significant reforms in state-owned enterprises (SOEs), including introducing market-oriented management mechanisms, reducing government intervention, and promoting privatization. In 2024, one of the most notable moves in Vietnam's economic reforms was the abolition of the State Capital Investment Corporation (SCIC). Nguyễn Khắc Giang, a political researcher at the Vietnam Institute for Economic and Policy Research (VEPR), stated in an interview that, in Vietnam's current economic development strategy, excessive reliance on state-owned enterprises is no longer seen as a key path for growth. As a result, Vietnam tends to privatize some SOEs, allowing them to compete in the market as private entities rather than having state-owned enterprises dominate the market. Vietnam has already seen the rise of large private enterprises like VinGroup, which spans multiple industries, including manufacturing, real estate, technology, and electric vehicles. The government is attempting to provide a more balanced and fair business environment for these private companies, encouraging competition among enterprises. Additionally, in terms of legislation, Vietnam has allowed the formation of independent unions. Although specific regulations and practical implementation are still pending, this represents a legal opening. In the future, Vietnam's market-oriented tendencies are expected to further strengthen, particularly in the protection of labor rights and the development of labor social movements. In terms of a series of actions taken by Vietnam in recent years, its fundamental motivation is undoubtedly to fully integrate into the framework of the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP). In the current Asia-Pacific region, the two main regional trade cooperation frameworks are the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) and the CPTPP. In terms of overall scale, RCEP's 15 member countries cover approximately 2.2 billion people, accounting for about 30% of the global population, with a total economic volume of USD 26 trillion. The combined GDP and trade volume of its members represent about one-third of the global total, making it the largest free trade agreement (FTA) in the Asia-Pacific region and globally in recent years. RCEP emphasizes adherence to multilateral trade system rules with the World Trade Organization (WTO) at its core and relatively focuses on the interests of developing countries. In practice, RCEP seeks to balance 'flexibility' and 'high standards'. In contrast to RCEP, the CPTPP is a strict, comprehensive trade agreement that sets high standards in many areas, such as labor and environmental rules, competition policies, state-owned enterprises, intellectual property regulations, internet rules, and the digital economy, while RCEP adjusts flexibly according to the specific needs of countries at different levels of development. In terms of tariff levels, the RCEP stipulates that its zero-tariff coverage reaches over 90% and maintains certain quotas for agricultural products, a standard lower than the CPTPP agreement, which requires 99% zero tariffs, zero subsidies, and zero barriers—the 'three-zero' standard. This means that in certain areas, the coverage and strictness of the RCEP agreement are relatively weaker. Relevant studies generally suggest that RCEP tends to give some consideration and preferential treatment to the actual situations of developing countries, while the CPTPP more strongly reflects the deep free trade aspirations of developed countries. As a developing country, why is Vietnam making significant efforts to deeply integrate into the CPTPP framework? Researchers at ANBOUND believe the main reasons may be the following: First, Vietnam has already decided to focus on advancing to the high end of the industrial chain and is no longer willing to rely solely on the comparative advantage of labor to develop labor-intensive industries. In recent years, foreign investment in Vietnam has increasingly focused on high-value-added sectors. For example, technology giants such as Samsung, Intel, and Nvidia have established production bases in Vietnam, which has not only provided Vietnam with opportunities for technology transfer but also directly boosted the export of high-tech products. In 2023, Vietnam's electronic product exports surpassed USD 100 billion, making it an important electronics manufacturing hub in Southeast Asia, second only to China. In addition, Vietnam has actively introduced emerging industries such as electric vehicle manufacturing and new energy technologies, accumulating energy for future economic growth. For high-value-added products, developed country markets are the most important consumer terminals. In recent years, Western countries, particularly the U.S., have frequently imposed sanctions on environmental and labor condition grounds. In 2024, the U.S. once again refused to recognize Vietnam's market economy status. To enhance its position in the industrial chain and further enter developed country markets, Vietnam has no choice but to align itself with the higher standards set by the CPTPP. Second, the practical benefits from trade have prompted Vietnam to continue deeply integrating into the CPTPP. Since joining the CPTPP, Vietnam's international trade scale has continued to expand. The agreement has granted Vietnam lower tariff rates with developed economies such as Japan and Canada, significantly boosting the competitiveness of Vietnam's exports. In 2024, Vietnam's exports to CPTPP member countries grew by over 20%. At the same time, CPTPP member countries have become the main source of Vietnam’s trade surplus. However, within the RCEP framework, Vietnam generates an annual trade deficit of about USD 50 billion in trade with China alone. Furthermore, the CPTPP has not only driven the development of Vietnam's outward-oriented economy but has also helped upgrade its domestic consumer market. With the expansion of the middle class and the growth of household income, Vietnam’s domestic demand potential is being increasingly unlocked. One point that should be noted is that, as a small country, Vietnam is destined to develop an outward-oriented economy. The markets of developed Western countries are the main sources that can provide practical trade benefits to Vietnamese enterprises and drive the upgrade of domestic consumption in Vietnam. Therefore, Vietnam can only continuously align itself with the CPTPP to provide lasting momentum for its foreign trade. Third, Vietnam's population surpassed 100 million in 2023, making it the 15th country in the world and the third in Southeast Asia to reach a population of over 100 million. However, in December 2024, Vietnam News Agency cited data from the Vietnamese Ministry of Health’s Population Department, which stated that Vietnam's total fertility rate in 2024 was 1.91, a historic low, and is expected to continue declining in the coming years. Statistics show that Vietnam's total fertility rate has been below the 2.1 required to ensure population stability for three consecutive years, with the rate dropping to 1.91 in 2024. If this downward trend continues, Vietnam’s population will begin to experience negative growth after 2054, with the decline expected to accelerate. Since 2011, the proportion of people aged 60 and above in Vietnam has exceeded 10%, signaling that the country has entered an aging society. The latest data also indicates that the aging of Vietnam’s society is deepening. Changes in the population structure mean that the advantage of low labor costs will continue to diminish, making it increasingly difficult to sustain labor-intensive industries. As a result, Vietnam will need to continue advancing its position in the industrial chain. Therefore, only by continuing to integrate into the higher standards and stricter requirements of the CPTPP can Vietnam have the opportunity to achieve this goal. As it stands, although the Vietnamese authorities firmly deny that they will fully adopt the Western liberal democratic path, and the one-party system in Vietnam is unlikely to undergo fundamental changes in the short term, i.e., 3-5 years, the basic trend of Vietnam's deep integration into the CPTPP is already very clear. This, in turn, is likely to have a series of profound impacts on its relationship with China. First, the ideological gap between Vietnam and China is likely to continue widening. For a long time, ideology has been a key focus for China in its efforts to strengthen ties with Vietnam. During several high-level exchanges in recent years, Chinese officials have repeatedly emphasized that the two nations should 'maintain a shared institutional foundation'. However, as Vietnam deepens its integration into the CPTPP, the overall freedom of the ruling party and society is likely to significantly increase, causing the ideological gap between Vietnam and China to gradually widen. In the future, ideology may not only fail to serve as a bonding agent to bridge the differences between both countries but could even become a new point of conflict. Combined with the existing territorial and maritime disputes between the two, the potential for tensions in Vietnam-China relations is likely to gradually increase. Second, Chinese capital and Chinese enterprises operating in Vietnam will face more restrictions and uncertainties. The CPTPP has stricter and higher requirements for rules of origin. To ensure smooth exports, especially to European and American markets, the Vietnamese government is likely to increase pressure on Chinese enterprises operating in Vietnam to localize, requiring them to procure more raw materials and components from Vietnam or encouraging more companies in related supply chains to move to Vietnam. At the same time, due to the additional restrictive requirements of the CPTPP on state-owned enterprises and state capital, infrastructure projects in Vietnam led by Chinese state-owned enterprises are likely to face more challenges in securing contracts in the future. Third, although independent unions have not yet been formally established in Vietnam, legal openings have already been made. As Vietnam further integrates into the CPTPP, the space for activities of social organizations is expected to expand. Due to the structural and historical issues in Vietnam-China relations, the overall anti-China sentiment within Vietnamese society is deeply ingrained, and the strengthening of the bilateral relations is often interpreted negatively by the public in Vietnam. It can be expected that with Vietnam’s deeper integration into the CPTPP and the increase in social freedoms, Chinese capital and Chinese enterprises will likely face growing suspicion and hostility from grassroots organizations in Vietnam on issues such as labor and environmental concerns. The economic activities of Chinese enterprises are likely to encounter increasing interference from the public, with Western NGOs in Europe and the U.S. likely to back these movements. Final analysis conclusion: ANBOUND believes that the CPTPP will be the core framework of global trade in the future, and it is likely to gradually replace the WTO. Vietnam's pursuit of joining this core trade bloc will certainly strengthen its position in the global economy in the future, but it will also lead to structural political reforms. This means the growing distance between the two nations will become an inevitable outcome.

Troubled China-Backed Project Casts Shadow On New Malaysia-Singap...	By Iman Muttaqin Yusof Amid buzz about a new free-trade zone at the tip of the Malay Peninsula, some observers are wondering if an anticipated rush of foreign investors will pour in money, given a troubled China-backed housing megaproject in the same area. Malaysia and Singapore signed off last week on the Johor-Singapore Special Economic Zone (JS-SEZ). Officials say it promises to boost the economies of the two neighboring countries with tax incentives for investors, fast-tracked business approvals, and a focus on high-tech industries such as artificial intelligence and renewable energy. It is 'rare to see two countries collaborating as a team to promote mutual economic growth and attract investments,' Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim and Singaporean counterpart Lawrence Wong said in a joint statement on Jan. 7. But analysts interviewed by BenarNews warn that the still unfinished Forest City project, a U.S. $100 billion endeavor, could spook foreign investment in the JS-SEZ. Started in Malaysia’s Johor state by one of China’s largest developers 12 years ago, the ambitious project has failed to meet its lofty goals and is a cautionary tale. 'The troubled Forest City project could indeed cast a long shadow over the JS-SEZ’s potential to attract investors,' said Michael Warren, founder of Consulting Board Asia, a business consultancy. 'Investors may harbor skepticism based on Forest City’s issues, associating them with similar risks in the JS-SEZ.' China’s potential role in the new free-trade zone is 'significant as a source of investment,' Warren told BenarNews. White elephant in the room Launched in 2013, Forest City promised a futuristic urban paradise of luxury condos, shopping malls, and state-of-the-art facilities. It planned to accommodate 700,000 residents in waterfront apartment towers on four man-made islands spanning 30 sq km (11.6 square miles) between Malaysia and Singapore. Historically, Johor has had close economic ties with Singapore, with many of its residents working in the Lion City and commuting daily via a bridge that spans the Johor Strait. Forest City was touted to create 220,000 jobs and contribute an estimated 200 billion ringgit ($47.6 billion) to the nation’s gross domestic product by 2035. But with its empty apartments, barren malls, and deserted streets, the development has become a symbol of overreach, earning the project the notorious label of a 'white elephant.' A recent government initiative to revive the project has introduced tax breaks and reduced income tax rates to attract foreign investors, but analysts remain divided on its potential to spur economic growth in the region. 'One key lesson from Forest City is the importance of aligning development projects with market demand and economic fundamentals,' said Chan Wei Khjan, lead advisor for the SEZ at YYC Group, a financial consultancy firm. Forest City’s failure stemmed from an overreliance on real estate without a supportive ecosystem, a Johor official said. 'Everyone learned the lesson after Forest City,' Johor state official Lee Ting Han told BenarNews. 'It cannot just be residential or commercial projects. The JS-SEZ has to be about creating jobs, developing industries, and populating the area – not just selling property.' Public policy consultant Adib Zalkapli said it would take time to build 'a truly seamless business environment' in the region. Despite these concerns, government officials project that the JS-SEZ will create 20,000 skilled jobs within five years and contribute $4.3 billion annually to Malaysia’s economy. Chinese investments Chinese companies are leading foreign investments in the JS-SEZ, market analysts said. In June last year, Malaysian Economy Minister Rafizi Ramli pitched the zone to over 100 Chinese firms during a visit to Beijing. 'We are not just seeing interest; we are seeing concrete commitments,' said Kohe Hasan, chief executive of M Kapital Consulting, a strategic business advisory firm focused on Southeast Asia. She pointed to Zhejiang-based Tianma Precision Machinery, which recently pledged $100 million to establish a manufacturing facility in Johor. 'The region provides seamless connectivity to Singapore’s financial, regulatory, and logistics infrastructure while maintaining the cost efficiencies that Johor offers,' Kohe said. Johor recently recorded 43 billion ringgit ($9.55 billion) in investments, with 21.5 billion ringgit ($4.78 billion) coming from countries such as China, Singapore, and South Korea, she said. 'With the SEZ now formalized, we expect more Chinese firms to offshore to Johor,' said Samuel Tan, CEO of Olive Tree Property Consultants, a property consultancy firm. BenarNews asked the Iskandar Regional Development Authority and Invest Johor for data on the number of Chinese companies planning investments in the area, but did not receive an immediate response. The JS-SEZ’s launch comes as global supply chains shift, driven by the U.S.-China trade war. Chinese manufacturers are adopting a 'China Plus One' strategy to diversify operations across Southeast Asia and avoid tariffs. 'Opening manufacturing facilities abroad allows Chinese goods to access sanctioned markets through third-party countries,' said Ahmad Mohsein Azman, an analyst at BowerGroupAsia, a business advisory firm. However, the zone does not solely rely on Chinese investments, according to Kohe. 'Beyond China, the JS-SEZ is attracting global interest from multinationals, private equity, and venture capital, focusing on advanced manufacturing, digital services, and sustainability to diversify investments,' she said.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWdnrnpeCzdSz8_rRWi1DCx4	2025-01-14T17:18:38-08:00	
Animal Farm Politics: The Deep State Wins Again – OpEd	It cost the American taxpayer $24 million to find out what we knew all along: politics is corrupt. After four years of being subjected to special prosecutor Jack Smith’s dogged investigation into alleged election interference by Donald Trump, the Justice Department has concluded that Trump would have been convicted of breaking the law if only he hadn’t gotten re-elected. In other words, the Deep State wins again. The revelation here is not that Trump broke the law but the extent to which sitting presidents get a free pass when it comes to misconduct. None of this is news. The Deep State has been operating from this exact same playbook for decades, regardless of which party has occupied the White House. Indeed, Richard Nixon let the cat out of the bag when he explained that the very act of being president places one beyond the rule of law ('when the president does it … that means that it is not illegal'). This is how we ended up with an imperial president—empowered to act as a dictator, above the law and beyond any real accountability—and why 'we the people' keep finding ourselves mired in a political swamp of lies, graft, cronyism and corruption. George Orwell, who died 75 years ago on Jan. 21, 1950, must be rolling in his grave. In the 75 years since George Orwell died, his works of dystopian fiction—which warn against rampant abuse of power, mind control and mass manipulation coupled with the rise of ubiquitous technology, fascism and totalitarianism—have become operation manuals for power-hungry political regimes wedded to the corporate state. While Orwell’s novel 1984 foreshadowed the rise of an omnipresent, modern-day surveillance state, his novel Animal Farm aptly sums up the state of politics today, propped up by a two-party system designed to maintain the illusion that voting matters. Orwell understood what many Americans, caught up in their partisan flag-waving, are still struggling to come to terms with: that there is no such thing as a government organized for the good of the people—even the best intentions among those in government inevitably give way to the desire to maintain power and control at all costs. As Orwell explains: 'The Party seeks power entirely for its own sake. We are not interested in the good of others; we are interested solely in power, pure power. What pure power means you will understand presently. We are different from the oligarchies of the past in that we know what we are doing. All the others, even those who resembled ourselves, were cowards and hypocrites. The German Nazis and the Russian Communists came very close to us in their methods, but they never had the courage to recognize their own motives. They pretended, perhaps they even believed, that they had seized power unwillingly and for a limited time, and that just around the corner there lay a paradise where human beings would be free and equal. We are not like that. We know that no one ever seizes power with the intention of relinquishing it. Power is not a means; it is an end. One does not establish a dictatorship in order to safeguard a revolution; one makes the revolution in order to establish the dictatorship.' No doubt about it: the revolution was successful. That January 6, 2021 attempt by President Trump and his followers to overturn the election results was not the revolution, however. Those who answered President Trump’s call to march on the Capitol were merely the fall guys, manipulated into creating the perfect crisis for the Deep State—a.k.a. the Police State a.k.a. the Military Industrial Complex a.k.a. the Techno-Corporate State a.k.a. the Surveillance State—to amass even greater powers. It took no time at all for the switch to be thrown and the nation’s capital to be placed under a military lockdown, online speech forums restricted, and individuals with subversive or controversial viewpoints ferreted out, investigated, shamed and/or shunned. It was a set-up, folks. The Justice Department’s policy of not prosecuting a sitting president was the tell. The only coup d’etat to undermine the will of the people happened when our government 'of the people, by the people, for the people' was overthrown by a profit-driven, militaristic, techno-corporate state that is in cahoots with a government 'of the rich, by the elite, for the corporations.' This swamp is of the Deep State’s making to such an extent that every successive president starting with Franklin D. Roosevelt has been bought lock, stock and barrel and made to dance to the Deep State’s tune. Beneath the power suits, they’re all alike. Donald Trump, the candidate who swore to drain the swamp in Washington DC, merely paved the way for lobbyists, corporations, the military industrial complex, and the Deep State to feast on the carcass of the dying American republic. Joe Biden was no different: his job was to keep the Deep State in power. Trump’s return to the White House has already thrown wide the gates to all manner of swampiness. Follow the money. It always points the way. As Bertram Gross noted in Friendly Fascism: The New Face of Power in America, 'evil now wears a friendlier face than ever before in American history.' Writing in 1980, Gross predicted a future in which he saw: '…a new despotism creeping slowly across America. Faceless oligarchs sit at command posts of a corporate-government complex that has been slowly evolving over many decades. In efforts to enlarge their own powers and privileges, they are willing to have others suffer the intended or unintended consequences of their institutional or personal greed. For Americans, these consequences include chronic inflation, recurring recession, open and hidden unemployment, the poisoning of air, water, soil and bodies, and, more important, the subversion of our constitution. More broadly, consequences include widespread intervention in international politics through economic manipulation, covert action, or military invasion...' This stealthy, creeping, silent coup that Gross prophesied is the same danger that writer Rod Serling envisioned in the 1964 political thriller Seven Days in May, a clear warning to beware of martial law packaged as a well-meaning and overriding concern for the nation’s security. Incredibly enough, more than 60 years later, we find ourselves hostages to a government run more by military doctrine and corporate greed than by the rule of law established in the Constitution. Indeed, proving once again that fact and fiction are not dissimilar, today’s current events could well have been lifted straight out of Seven Days in May, which takes viewers into eerily familiar terrain. The premise is straightforward. With the Cold War at its height, an unpopular U.S. President signs a momentous nuclear disarmament treaty with the Soviet Union. Believing that the treaty constitutes an unacceptable threat to the security of the United States and certain that he knows what is best for the nation, General James Mattoon Scott (played by Burt Lancaster), the head of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and presidential hopeful, plans a military takeover of the national government. When Gen. Scott’s aide, Col. Casey (Kirk Douglas), discovers the planned military coup, he goes to the President with the information. The race for command of the U.S. government begins, with the clock ticking off the hours until the military plotters plan to overthrow the President. Needless to say, while on the big screen, the military coup is foiled and the republic is saved in a matter of hours, in the real world, the plot thickens and spreads out over the past half century. We’ve been losing our freedoms so incrementally for so long—sold to us in the name of national security and global peace, maintained by way of martial law disguised as law and order, and enforced by a standing army of militarized police and a political elite determined to maintain their powers at all costs—that it’s hard to pinpoint exactly when it all started going downhill, but we’ve been on that fast-moving, downward trajectory for some time now. The question is no longer whether the U.S. government will be preyed upon and taken over by the military industrial complex. That’s a done deal, but martial law disguised as national security is only one small part of the greater deception we’ve been fooled into believing is for our own good. How do you get a nation to docilely accept a police state? How do you persuade a populace to accept metal detectors and pat downs in their schools, bag searches in their train stations, tanks and military weaponry used by their small-town police forces, surveillance cameras in their traffic lights, police strip searches on their public roads, unwarranted blood draws at drunk driving checkpoints, whole body scanners in their airports, and government agents monitoring their communications? Try to ram such a state of affairs down the throats of the populace, and you might find yourself with a rebellion on your hands. Instead, you bombard them with constant color-coded alerts, terrorize them with shootings and bomb threats in malls, schools, and sports arenas, desensitize them with a steady diet of police violence, and sell the whole package to them as being for their best interests. The 2021 military occupation of the nation’s capital by 25,000 troops as part of the so-called 'peaceful' transfer of power from one administration to the next is telling. That was not the language of a free people. This is the language of force. January 6, 2021, and its aftermath merely provided the government and its corporate technocrats the perfect excuse to show off all of the powers they’ve been amassing so assiduously over the years. Mind you, by 'government,' I’m not referring to the highly partisan, two-party bureaucracy of the Republicans and Democrats. I’m referring to 'government' with a capital 'G,' the entrenched Deep State that is unaffected by elections, unaltered by populist movements, and has set itself beyond the reach of the law. I’m referring to the corporatized, militarized, entrenched bureaucracy that is fully operational and staffed by unelected officials who are, in essence, running the country and calling the shots in Washington DC, no matter who sits in the White House. This brings us back to Orwell’s Animal Farm, which turns 80 this year. Originally titled a fairy story, the satirical allegory recounts the revolutionary struggle of a group of farm animals living in squalor and neglect on a poorly run farm managed by a derelict farmer. Hoping to create a society where all animals are equal, the farm animals mount a revolution, ejecting the farmer, taking control of the farm, establishing their own Bill of Rights, and operating under the mantra 'four legs good, two legs bad.' Not surprisingly, as is the case with most revolutions, the new boss—a pig named Napoleon—turns out to be no different from their old human oppressor. Over time, a ruling class of pigs comes to dominate on the farm, which is policed by dogs, with the pigs starting to dress, walk and talk like their human counterparts. Eventually, the pigs forge an alliance with their former two-legged adversaries in order to maintain their power over the rest of the farm animals. Before long, the pigs’ transformation into two-legged overlords is complete: 'they were all alike.' Much like the gullible, easily led creatures of Animal Farm, we find ourselves being brainwashed into believing that the tyrannies meted out against us are for our own good; that the trials are tribulations we experience at the hands of the ruling elite are privileges for which we should feel grateful; and that our bondage to the Deep State is actually, appearances to the contrary, freedom. Over time, without their realizing it, the Seven Commandments of liberation and equality that were so central to Animal Farm’s revolutionary movement are whittled down to a single commandment: 'ALL ANIMALS ARE EQUAL BUT SOME ANIMALS ARE MORE EQUAL THAN OTHERS.' And that, as I make clear in my book Battlefield America: The War on the American People and in its fictional counterpart The Erik Blair Diaries, is the lesson for all of us in the American Police State as we prepare for yet another changing of the guard in Washington, DC. The more things change, the more they stay the same.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWdnrnpeCzdSzxq1HFiqsCw3	2025-01-14T17:17:34-08:00	
Should The Fed Accommodate Increases In Demand For Money? – OpEd	By Frank Shostak According to many commentators, a growing economy requires a growing money stock, because economic growth gives rise to a greater demand for money. Failing to add more money, it is maintained, will lead to a decline in the prices of goods and services, which, in turn, will destabilize the economy and lead to an economic recession or depression. Whenever an increase in the demand for money occurs, the Fed should accommodate this with inflation in order to prevent disruptions and to keep the economy on the path of economic and price stability. Historically, many different goods have been used as money. Mises observed that, over time, ...there would be an inevitable tendency for the less marketable of the series of goods used as media of exchange to be one by one rejected until at last only a single commodity remained, which was universally employed as a medium of exchange; in a word, money. Through the ongoing process of market selection, individuals settled on gold as their preferred general medium of exchange. Most economists, while accepting this historical evolution, cast doubt that gold can fulfill the role of money in the modern world. According to Business Insider from June 15, 2011, The basic problem is that the supply of gold is not related to the quantity of goods and services being produced…. As a result of this scarcity, prices decline. Individuals have less incentive to produce new goods and services. Economic growth is stifled. Allowing money to become scarce does the greatest harm to those who have the least. In the past, the relative inflexibility of the monetary system contributed to the chronic lack of growth in many of the world’s less developed countries. Since the 1970s, we have had one of the most flexible monetary systems the world has known, and many of these countries have flourished. With a flexible monetary system, more money can be created to accommodate more growth. Supposedly, the free market—by failing to provide enough gold—would cause money supply shortages and economic instability. The Demand for Money A demand for a good is not a demand for a particular good as such but a demand for the services that the good provides. For instance, an individual demands food because food provides nourishment. In this case, demand means that the individual wants to consume food—the service that the particular food provides. However, this is not the case with respect to money. According to Rothbard, Money…is solely useful for exchange purposes. Money, per se, cannot be consumed and cannot be used directly as a producers’ good in the productive process. Money per se is therefore unproductive; it is dead stock and produces nothing. Money’s main function is simply to fulfill the role of the medium of exchange. By fulfilling this role, money simply facilitates the flow of goods and services between producers and consumers. With the help of money, various goods become more marketable—they can be exchanged for more goods than in a barter economy. What enables this is the fact that money is the most marketable commodity. Therefore, the reason that an individual has a demand for money is in order to be able to exchange money for other goods and services. Consequently, in this sense, an increase in the supply of money would not be absorbed by a corresponding increase in the demand for money, as would be the case with other goods. For instance, an increase in the supply of apples in response to the increase in the demand for apples is absorbed by the demand (i.e., individuals consume more apples). Thus, the increase in the supply of apples by 5 percent would be absorbed by the increase in the demand for apples by 5 percent. The same, however, cannot be said with regard to the increase in the supply of money, which increased in response to the increase in the demand for money. Again, contrary to other goods, an increase in the demand for money really implies an increase in the demand to employ money to facilitate transactions for other goods. A simple increase in the supply of money does not solve this. Further, an artificial increase in the supply of money to accommodate a corresponding increase in the demand for money sets in motion several negatives (e.g., price inflation, a boom-bust cycle). With the existence of a central bank, an artificial increase in the supply of money sets an exchange of nothing for something. When we refer to the demand for money, what we really mean is the demand for money’s purchasing power. After all, individuals do not want a greater amount of money in their pockets, but they want a greater purchasing power. According to Mises, The services money renders are conditioned by the height of its purchasing power. Nobody wants to have in his cash holding a definite number of pieces of money or a definite weight of money; he wants to keep a cash holding of a definite amount of purchasing power. Once the market has chosen a particular commodity as money, the given stock of this commodity is adequate to secure the services that money provides. Within a free market, there cannot be such a thing as 'too little' or 'too much' money. As long as the market is allowed to clear, no shortage or surplus of money can emerge. According to Mises: As the operation of the market tends to determine the final state of money’s purchasing power at a height at which the supply of and the demand for money coincide, there can never be an excess or deficiency of money. Each individual and all individuals together always enjoy fully the advantages which they can derive from indirect exchange and the use of money, no matter whether the total quantity of money is great, or small…. the services which money renders can be neither improved nor repaired by changing the supply of money…. The quantity of money available in the whole economy is always sufficient to secure for everybody all that money does and can do. Conclusion If the Fed were to accommodate an increase in the demand for money with fresh inflation of the money supply, this 'accommodation' should be regarded as an effective increase in the supply of money as such, not purchasing power. Therefore, there can be no net social benefit to such monetary policy, but it does come with a host of negative consequences.

Vietnam Holds Russia Talks And Sets Up Nuclear Project Steering C...	Vietnam's Prime Minister Pham Minh Chinh and his Russian counterpart Mikhail Mishustin have discussed enhancing their countries' Comprehensive Strategic Partnership, including in nuclear energy, as Hanoi sets up a steering committee to implement the Ninh Thuan nuclear power plant project. The two prime ministers signed a joint communique in Hanoi, which according to Russia's Tass news agency covered a comprehensive plan for cooperation between the two countries to 2030 and a memorandum of understanding between Rosatom and Electricity of Vietnam (EVN). In its report on the talks, the Vietnamese government said it would allow the clear defining of 'key areas of cooperation, spanning from economy, trade, energy, and science and technology, to education, culture and defence'. It noted that bilateral trade had increased from USD3.3 billion in 2023 to USD4.57 billion in 2024, and added that there were 60,000 Vietnamese people living in Russia. The Vietnamese prime minister also held talks with Rosatom Director General Alexey Likhachev and, according to the official Vietnamese government account, he said he 'hopes that Russia and Rosatom will continue their cooperation with and support for Vietnam, not only in the development of nuclear power but also in the development of nuclear science and technology for peaceful purposes, contributing to socio-economic development' and 'urged Russia and Rosatom to support Vietnam in human resource training and technology transfer to help Vietnam develop its nuclear technology sector'. It reports that Likhachev said 'Rosatom would continue strengthening cooperation with Vietnam and ... stands ready to foster collaboration and assist Vietnam in building nuclear power plants, establishing a new, modern nuclear centre, transferring technology, localising nuclear products, and developing nuclear science and industry, with a long-term vision spanning hundreds of years'. Vietnam and Russia are already cooperating in the nuclear sector on the construction of a Centre for Nuclear Science and Technology in Vietnam, as well as holding discussions last year over future options for large-scale and small modular reactors in the country. The visit came the day after the Vietnamese government announced the setting up of a steering committee for a proposed nuclear power plant construction project in the Ninh Thuan region, led by the prime minister with the remit to 'direct amendments and supplementation to legal regulations for nuclear power development; direct the research and development of the nuclear power programme and submit to competent authorities for consideration and approval; direct international cooperation with other countries, international organisations and the International Atomic Energy Agency in nuclear power development'. A prvious project, in the central province of Ninh Thuan, was approved in principle by the government in 2009 and was going to feature Russian VVER-1200 reactors - but project work was halted in 2016 because of 'economic conditions'. The Vietnamese government has recently been considering reviving its nuclear energy ambitions - citing energy security, development and net zero targets - and exploring the possibilities of small modular reactors. The announcement of the steering committee follows November's decisions by the National Assembly and the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Vietnam to give their backing to new nuclear. EVN 'has been assigned by the government to be the investor of the project', according to the statement announcing the formation of the steering committee.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWdnrnpeCzdSz2iv1X7hhzcY	2025-01-14T17:13:05-08:00	
Geopolitics Of Sri Lankan President Dissanayake’s Visit To China ...	His first State visit to China as President, has far reaching economic and geopolitical implications Sri Lankan President Anura Kumara Dissanayake will be on a State Visit to China from January 14 to 17, his first such visit to China after being elected President in September last. The visit is expected to have far reaching implications for the Sri Lankan economy as well as for Sri Lanka's geopolitical positioning vis-à-vis India and China, regional powers competing for dominance over South Asia. Faced with the necessity to give India, the immediate and only neighbour, primacy in its sphere of influence, Dissanayake paid his first overseas visit as President to India in mid-December last year. The wide-ranging talks he held in New Delhi resulted in a Joint Statement with as many as 34 points. It was only to be expected that Dissanayake would be visiting China next, to keep a balance between the two South Asian powers and also in recognition of China's place as Sri Lanka's economic benefactor, defence equipment supplier during the war, and an unwavering supporter at the UN Human Rights Council (UNHRC) where Sri Lanka has been regularly assailed by unsympathetic Western powers. Dissanayake has a delicate task ahead of him in Beijing. His every word will be noted and interpreted by the two regional powers. The stakes are high, given the strategic compulsion to go along with India on the one hand, and the need to be accommodative to China which had emerged as the top creditor and development partner since 2010. However, thus far in his tenure as President, Dissanayake has been able to walk the right rope between India and the West on the one hand, and China on the other. China Well Disposed By all accounts, China's leaders are well disposed towards him, not only because of his anti-imperialist (anti-West) background but because of the overwhelmingly popular mandate he and his National Peoples' Power (NPP) had secured. The Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson, Guo Jiakun, told the media that Dissanayake's visit is of 'great importance to the development of China-Sri Lanka relations'. Guo said: 'Since our two countries established diplomatic ties in 1957, the bilateral relationship has stood the test of the changing international landscape, always maintained sound and steady growth, and set up a fine example of friendly relations and mutually beneficial cooperation between countries different in size.' 'China stands ready to work with Sri Lanka through the upcoming visit to deepen political mutual trust, and expand high-quality Belt and Road cooperation and practical cooperation in various fields for continuous new progress in advancing the China-Sri Lanka strategic cooperative partnership,' he added. Guo's statement encapsulates the wide range of the relationship. China had deepened its strategic ties with Sri Lanka during the Presidencies of Mahinda Rajapaksa, Gotabaya Rajapaksa and Ranil Wickramasinghe, with the building of a container terminal in Colombo (CICT), of the Hambantota harbour, development of Colombo Port City, and the building of roads and railways. China hopes that Dissanayake would follow the trend set by his predecessors. According to sources, both Dissanayake and President Xi Jinping would go in for investments rather than loans. After a severe economic crisis in 2022, Sri Lanka announced its first sovereign default of about US$ 46.9 billion. India stepped in with about US$ 4.5 billion, enabling the country to stage a slow recovery and later qualify for the International Monetary Fund (IMF) bailout package. But China refrained from responding to Sri Lanka's requests for extending large monetary assistance. Initially, Beijing wanted Colombo to set its financial house in order. As of August 2024, China's share of Sri Lanka's foreign debt was reportedly 20%. However, in June 2024, Sri Lanka restructured US$ 4.2 billion of debt owed to the Export Import Bank of China (Exim Bank). It was reported that the average interest rate for bilateral loans was around 2.1% and that there would be a moratorium on debt payments until 2028. The ground for further Sino-Lankan economic cooperation already exists, said Dr.Palitha Kohona, former Sri Lankan Ambassador to China. 'China Harbour and Hunan Construction had committed to invest US$ 1.2 billion in the Colombo Port City. SINOPEC has begun a multi-billion dollar investment, including in petroleum outlets, bunkering facilities and oil refining in Hambantota.' 'SinoPharm had plans to establish a pharmaceutical, mainly vaccine, packing plant in Sri Lanka. Chinese solar and wind power companies have recently expressed considerable interest in Sri Lanka's renewable energy sector, including solar panel fabrication as Sri Lanka plans to obtain 70% of its electricity from renewables by 2030. Electric vehicle manufacturers have begun assembly and manufacture of vehicles in Sri Lanka, not only for the local market, but also to target the booming regional markets. Chinese telecom giants may also be interested in the potential of Sri Lanka,' Kohona added. Other sources said that during Dissanayake's visit an agreement would be signed to develop the hinterland of the Hambantota port as an industrial zone with Chinese investments. Major investments are planned in Colombo Port City. 'A South Asia Commercial and Logistics Hub (SACL) is to come up with an outlay of US$ 392 million at the Colombo port. The project is a joint venture between China Merchants Port Holdings (CMPH) and the Sri Lankan government. A luxury ocean-side facility will be built on 269 hectares of reclaimed land at the Port City. It is a joint venture between the Sri Lankan government and the China Harbour Engineering Corporation (CHEC),' Kohona said. The former Ambassador, however, added a note of caution. He said that Sri Lanka should guarantee foreign investments, improve the conditions for doing business, explore markets in China and its companies must participate in international exhibitions. Ticklish Issues While it will be smooth sailing for Dissanayake on economic and investment issues, geo-strategic issues like visits by Chinese research vessels to Sri Lankan port will be ticklish. China insists that the vessels in question are not spy vessels, as India alleges, but are bona fide oceanographic research vessels. After talks with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi on December 16 in New Delhi, Dissanayake said in a statement that he had 'assured the Indian leader that Sri Lanka will not permit its territory to be used in any manner inimical to the security of India as well as towards regional stability.' Back in Sri Lanka, Kohona argued that there is no reason to treat Chinese vessels any differently from the others as long as they complies with Sri Lanka's access requirements. 'We have steadfastly asserted our non-aligned status,' he pointed out. Dissanayake sounded New Delhi on his difficulties in readily accepting India's conditions given the fact that the issue involves an equally important power, China. And India seemed to be accommodative as a result. In his interaction with the media, Indian Foreign Secretary, Vikram Misri, seemed to acknowledge Sri Lanka's predicament when he said that the Sri Lankan government was looking at the issue as there were a number of considerations Sri Lanka needed to take into account. But he did not fail to add that India had highlighted its perspectives including the role that it plays in maritime security in the region. One Year Moratorium Under pressure from India, President Ranil Wickremesinghe had imposed a one-year moratorium on visits by such research vessels, no matter to which they belonged. But the Indians were not happy with the blanket ban. They wanted only Chinese vessels to be banned. The moratorium ended in November last and Sri Lankan Foreign Minister Vijitha Herath played it safe saying that the government had formed a committee to look at the moratorium issue. Oceanographic Research However, China continues to be keen on securing the right to send oceanographic vessels to Sri Lanka. It will raise the issue at the Beijing talks and attempt to persuade Dissanayake to accommodate it. This was indicated on December 18, when Ms.Qin Boyong, Vice-Chairperson of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) came to Colombo and told the President that China has 'plans to restart maritime research activities, which were temporarily halted for various reasons, along with initiating relevant projects.' The other matter China might raise is a wish to make Sri Lanka join its Global Developmental Initiative (GDI) and the Global Security Initiative (GSI). If this idea is put forward, it would be interesting to see how Dissanayake and New Delhi would react. India is wary about China-led institutions of this sort as they could impinge on its sphere of influence, namely South Asia.

Post-Assad Syria: Challenges, Opportunities, And US Role In Shapi...	By Mohammed A. Salih (FPRI) -- The unexpected fall of Bashar al-Assad’s regime on December 8 has put Syria in the spotlight once again. Following over a decade of conflict, the killing of hundreds of thousands of Syrians, the displacement of around half of the country’s population internally or externally, there is a new reality in Syria. While the aftermath of Assad’s fall has gone generally better than expected, the transitional period ahead is one that requires an alert and proactive US approach, rather than a disengaged and passive one. The future of Syria hinges on a number of interconnected dynamics: the evolving role of Hay’at Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) under Ahmed al-Sharaa (aka Abu Mohammad al-Jolani), the trajectory of the tensions between Turkey and the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), the Islamic State (ISIS)’s resurgence and potency, regional dynamics and intervention, and the US role in the shaping the country, particularly through sustained military presence. This article explores each of these dynamics, how they could reconstitute the emergent reality in Syria, and offers recommendations on how the United States should deal with the post-Assad Syria. Hay’at Tahrir al-Sham: Leading the New Syria HTS, or the Organization for the Liberation of the Levant, led the coalition that toppled Assad’s regime on December 8 in a campaign marked by minimal bloodshed or retribution against loyalists. HTS originated in 2017 from a coalition of hardline Islamist groups, many with jihadi backgrounds. Its predecessor, Jabhat al-Nusra, was al-Qaeda’s official franchise in Syria, created by the Islamic State of Iraq (a precursor to ISIS) before their split. HTS leader Sharaa was arrested in Iraq during the mid-2000s for planting a bomb while part of al-Qaeda. Over the years, HTS has undergone ideological shifts, evolving from a group in the transnational jihadi orbit into a Syrian-focused revolutionary entity. Following its campaign against Assad, HTS has displayed surprising tolerance toward non-Muslim and non-Sunni groups, including Christians, Druze, and Alawites. The HTS-led interim government has appointed Mohsina al-Mahithawi, a Druze woman, as governor of the southern Druze-majority Suwaida province. Additionally, HTS has permitted unveiled women in public, let bars in major cities like Damascus function, and allowed New Year celebrations. These gestures of inclusivity have earned the group cautious praise from various quarters inside and outside Syria. However, as recent remarks by Sheikh Hikmat Hajari, the spiritual leader of the Druze community, reveal, there is deep distrust of HTS among the country’s minorities that could threaten the emergence of a unifying central authority in the country. The group’s actions and governance practices have generated concern. For instance, reports of an Alawite shrine being burned by opposition fighters during the recent anti-Assad campaign in Aleppo caused unrest in the Alawite-majority coastal regions. The Ministry of Education’s proposals to amend school curricula to reflect Islamist views have also drawn criticism. Compounding these issues is recently leaked footage of Justice Minister Shadi al-Waisi overseeing a public execution of two women in Idlib in 2015 on charges of prostitution. There is also Sharaa’s self-appointment as the de facto leader of Syria. In a recent interview with Al-Arabiya, Sharaa revealed plans for a four-year timeline to hold presidential elections and two to three years to draft a constitution, outright rejecting federalism. His vision points to a presidential system likely dominated by Sharaa himself. The unilateral formation of a twelve-member interim cabinet, drawn from HTS loyalists, further highlights the group’s concentration of power. HTS is also overseeing the restructuring of the Syrian army, cementing its unilateral control under the current chaotic circumstances. Moreover, HTS’s past suppression of activists and opposition figures, alongside its monopoly of power in Idlib’s Salvation Government do not bode well. The group’s inclusion of foreign jihadi fighters—mainly from Europe and Central Asia—deepens skepticism about its intentions. Several were appointed to senior military roles in late December. Moreover, remarks by Ayisha al-Dibs, Sharaa’s appointee for women’s affairs, stressing Sharia as the basis of governance and rejecting secular models, have heightened fears of an Islamist agenda. When considered as a whole, these actions and statements reveal ideological contradictions that generate legitimate fears of authoritarianism and extremist rule, warranting close scrutiny of HTS and its interim government. The critical question for many is whether the current relative tolerance is a sign of genuine ideological transformation or a tactical maneuver to consolidate power before imposing stricter Islamist governance. The Future of Northeast Syria and Tensions with Turkey A key factor shaping Syria’s future is the ongoing military confrontations between the Turkish-backed Syrian National Army (SNA) and the US-supported SDF. Since late November, the SNA has captured several towns in northern Aleppo province from the SDF. The United States, which considers the SDF a crucial partner in its efforts to combat ISIS, has brokered ceasefires between the two sides, but intermittent clashes continue in key areas such as Kobani and Manbij in northern Aleppo province. Northeast Syria, under SDF control, remains strategically critical due to its energy and agricultural resources and its role as a site housing around 9,000 ISIS prisoners and tens of thousands of ISIS family members, many of whom remain radicalized. SDF Commander Mazloum Abdi has said IS had planned a prison break, seeking to exploit SDF’s fighting with the SNA. The region also hosts most US forces in Syria, alongside the Tanf Base near the Jordanian border. The SDF and other Kurdish groups in Northeast Syria/Rojava have called for decentralization. While Sharaa has pledged 'no more injustice… on our Kurdish people,' he has rejected the federalization of Syria. Keen to assuage Damascus’s concerns and accusations of separatism, Abdi has expressed willingness to allow Damascus control over border crossings and has opposed Syria’s division. These resources are essential for Syria’s recovery, which also serve as the SDF’s primary leverage against the new government. In an effort to directly address issues of mutual interest, Abdi met Sharaa in what was described as a 'positive' meeting under US sponsorship. However, mutual distrust between Kurds and Damascus runs deep, leaving the prospect of an agreement uncertain. Stability in Northeast Syria will depend on how these tensions and power dynamics evolve, alongside the continued fight against ISIS. Under the Assad regime, Kurds were subjected to systematic state discrimination, with tens of thousands deprived of Syrian citizenship. Having experienced unprecedented freedoms and control over their affairs since 2012, Kurds are unlikely to relinquish their gains. Without guarantees for some form of local autonomy in administrative and security affairs and respect for their secular liberties, the SDF and broader Kurdish population are unlikely to disband armed forces or strike agreements with Damascus. The Islamic State in the New Syria ISIS remains a potent threat in Syria, reportedly carrying out around 700 attacks in 2024—three times the number recorded in 2023—and resulting in over 750 fatalities. Operating primarily in the vast Syrian desert spanning Homs, Raqqa, and Deir ez-Zor provinces, its reach occasionally extends to Hasakah. Having evolved over nearly two decades from its origins as al-Qaeda in Iraq in the mid-2000s, ISIS has shown strategic patience and the ability to exploit emerging opportunities. The reported arrest by the HTS administration of several ISIS militants planning to bomb the Shia holy shrine of Sayyida Zainab in Damascus suggests that the group is reverting to its well-rehearsed strategy of inciting sectarian strife, as it did in Iraq during the early years following the US invasion. While HTS currently maintains ideological and political animosity toward both ISIS and al-Qaeda—having clashed with both in its current and previous iterations—any assessment of ISIS in a future HTS-dominated Syria must consider the nuances of Syria’s shifting dynamics and the composition of HTS itself. Syria’s transitional period, marked by weak central authority, fragmented power, and limited military capabilities outside the US-SDF partnership, provides ISIS with opportunities to regroup and expand. Moreover, if HTS continues its trend toward relative moderation—such as tolerating unveiled women, alcohol sales, and participation in a Western-style political process involving elections and some degree of popular sovereignty—hardline elements within HTS, particularly foreign jihadis, could break away, defect to, or cooperate with ISIS or al-Qaeda. These fluid and rapidly shifting circumstances demand vigilance from the United States and its allies. A resurgent ISIS capable of destabilizing Syria and threatening neighboring countries would undermine US and regional interests. The recent attack in New Orleans highlights ISIS’s enduring ability to inspire transnational violence. Enhanced coordination with the SDF, the interim government in Damascus, and regional partners will be critical to countering ISIS and ensuring long-term stability in the region. The Regional Dimension and its Effect on Syria’s Future The Syrian conflict’s regional dimension is deeply complex, with competing actors vying for influence. Among them, Turkey emerges as the main beneficiary of Assad’s fall. Its steadfast support for anti-Assad opposition groups over thirteen years has earned Ankara the trust of these factions and Syria’s Sunni Arab population, the bastion of anti-Assad activism. Economically, Turkish businesses stand to secure major reconstruction contracts in Syria due to their experience and proximity. Diplomatically, Syria is likely to be a Turkish client state for years. The possibility of a continued Turkish military presence in Syria cannot be ruled out. However, Turkey’s regional ambitions come with significant baggage. Since 2015, Erdogan’s militaristic policies and sponsorship of Islamist groups, often in tandem with Qatar, have caused tensions across the region. Israel, despite benefiting from the weakening of the Iran-led axis, is deeply wary of Turkey’s rise and its ties to Sunni Islamist groups in Syria, some with jihadi backgrounds. Reports of Hamas leadership relocating to Turkey further heighten Israeli concerns. Additionally, Israel’s military expansion in Syria, beyond the areas of the Golan Heights it has controlled since 1967, is likely to fuel tensions with the new Syrian authorities and, by extension, Turkey, which by virtue of its new relationship with Damascus may feel pressured to respond in some way to the increased Israeli presence. A report by an Israeli government committee has warned that a military confrontation between Turkey and Israel might be on the horizon. The Gulf states and Jordan are also rushing to respond to the aftermath of Assad’s fall. They have initiated a diplomatic campaign to support and shape the new Syria. Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, which in recent years had mended ties with Assad after years of strained relations and support for his opposition, view Turkey’s triumphalism over Syria, its neo-Ottoman ambitions, and the rise of Islamist groups in Syria with alarm—just as Jordan does. As Turkey lacks the financial means to fund Syria’s reconstruction, the Gulf states, with their immense financial resources, are positioning themselves as key players. The United Arab Emirates and Jordan are also reportedly cultivating influence by backing former revolutionaries in southern Syria, giving them an important role in shaping Syria’s future. Abu Dhabi is likely to have additional motivation to pursue this, given its broader regional proxy conflict with Ankara in Libya and Sudan. Reintegrating the new Syria into the Arab League will be another key leverage of the Gulf and their allies such as Jordan and Egypt. Qatar is poised to play an important role in Syria’s future as well, by virtue of its close relationship with both Turkey and sections of the former Syrian opposition. Doha has already pledged to fund the new government’s increase of salaries and has provided several rounds of humanitarian assistance to Syria. The Qatari state’s Al Jazeera Arabic is also playing a major role in shoring up support for the new authorities among the Arab public. Qatar and Turkey’s policies and roles in Syria has pushed the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia to reduce the new government’s reliance on their regional rivals, hosting the new Syrian Foreign Minister Asaad al-Sheibani. Iran, by contrast, is the biggest loser in Syria. With Assad gone, Tehran has lost a critical link in its regional axis and its direct connection to Hezbollah. Iranian officials are grappling with this loss, oscillating between grief, blame, and denial. A senior Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps commander, General Behrouz Esbati, recently admitted Iran’s 'very bad defeat' in Syria and accused Russia of betrayal. Iranian analysts close to the regime have urged Tehran to pivot toward supporting the SDF against Turkey. The presence of SDF-aligned Sinjar Protection Units within Iraq’s Popular Mobilization Forces (PMF) near the Syria-Iraq border could serve as a conduit for Iranian influence regarding Syria. While the SDF has not leaned on Iran thus far, escalating Turkish-backed attacks may force it to do so, especially if Washington fails to restrain Turkey. In what might be a surprising alignment, even Israel might extend a helping hand to SDF forces if they are abandoned by the United States, given Israel’s concerns over Turkey’s role in a new Syria and the dominance of Sunni Islamists there. Iran’s considerable influence in Iraq, through pro-Iran PMF factions and their presence along Iraq’s 600km border with Syria, provides Tehran room to maneuver in Syria despite recent setbacks. The defeat of SDF and Northeast Syria’s fall will increase the contact line between Iraq and Turkey-backed Sunni militants in Syria—a potentially dangerous development for both Iraq and Iran, especially given the presence of individuals with former jihadi inclinations within the ranks of these groups. Additionally, if Alawites feel marginalized in the new Syria, Iran might find ways to support an internal insurgency in coastal areas against Damascus given its long-standing connections to the community. Redefining the US Role in Syria Upon Assad’s fall, the United States dispatched the State Department’s top Middle East official, Barbara Leaf, to meet with Sharaa and removed the $10 million bounty on his head from his time as an al-Qaeda operative. This move signaled Washington’s intent to establish direct communication with Syria’s new rulers and potentially influence the country’s trajectory. Syria’s story has evolved in unpredictable ways since 2011. While the United States initially supported opposition forces against Assad, this assistance ended as those groups failed to counter Assad’s regime and extremist forces like al-Nusra (HTS’s predecessor) and ISIS. The United States directly intervened in 2014, deploying troops and supporting Kurds to defeat ISIS. Up until Assad’s fall, US presence also aimed to limit the Iran-led and Russia-backed camp’s influence in Syria and the broader region. With the Iranian and Russian challenges now largely absent in Syria, other strategic considerations persist. These factors justify continued US troop presence and diplomatic engagement. Seizing on the emerging opportunity, US policymakers in Washington may adopt a proactive role in shaping Syria’s transitional political process in order to align the new reality in Syria with broader US ambitions for a pro-US regional order. This requires Washington to maintain its 2,000-strong troops in Syria to ensure a strong presence and hand capable of shaping the country’s future. Besides its military presence in Syria, the United States wields significant leverage over the current authorities that allows it to play a crucial role in shaping the country’s future trajectory. Washington’s recent provision of sanctions waivers for Syria on transactions related to the sale of energy and humanitarian supplies, and personal foreign remittances act as a positive gesture of good will and prudent policy. There is a multilayered multi-type US-imposed sanctions regime—from executive orders, to legislative acts, financial and economic sanctions, sanctions on individuals—in addition to various forms of terror-related designations on the Syrian state (dating back to the late 1970s) and former opposition groups currently in power in Damascus, including the HTS. On top of these, there are also sanctions imposed on Syria by European powers. The Syrian people deserve to live in normal conditions after decades of suffering under the Assad dictatorship and a brutal civil war. Washington and Europe’s approach appears to involve a phased removal of sanctions, contingent upon and aimed at encouraging positive behavior by the new authorities. Indeed, the United States and its allies should strategically, and in a spirit of good faith, leverage the removal of sanctions to facilitate a transition toward a pluralistic political system committed to: free elections and the peaceful transfer of power, proportional representation for all communities, decentralized governance to align with local cultural particularities in minority regions, upholding religious freedom, and other measures to prevent Syria from becoming a base for renewed jihadist activity or a threat to neighboring countries. On the issue of maintaining sanctions and terrorism designations against HTS, US and European powers should coordinate their moves. Syria will require anywhere between $250 to $400 billion to rebuild its shattered infrastructure and economy, relying on large-scale foreign aid and investment to achieve this. The United States, European Union, and Gulf Arab states are well-positioned to lead this effort and should use their leverage to guide Syria’s reconstruction and governance in the right direction. Allowing Ankara to dominate the new Syria’s course could provoke regional pushback and derail Syria’s chances of recovery as well. The SDF-Turkey relationship remains a significant challenge for US policy in Syria, given Washington’s partnership with the SDF in northeast Syria. Turkey views the SDF as an extension of the Kurdish movement in Turkey, complicating relations. The United States should encourage ongoing talks between the Turkish government and Abdullah Ocalan, the imprisoned leader of the Kurdistan Workers’ Party. Improved relations between Turkey and Kurdish groups within its borders could pave the way for a peaceful relationship between Ankara and the SDF, reminiscent of the 2012 to 2015 period. As this author has argued elsewhere, establishing a mutually beneficial relationship between Turkey and Syrian Kurds is possible and should be a priority for US diplomacy. The first step, however, is to halt Turkish-backed attacks on Kurdish areas, as these attacks risk creating chaos and instability that could spiral out of control and invite intervention from other regional actors, particularly Iran and Iraqi groups.

Panama, Greenland And The Potential Threat To US Civil-Military R...	Reflect for a moment, that you are the U.S. military: perhaps the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff; perhaps the combatant commander of the U.S. Southern Command or the U.S. European Command; perhaps the commander of a high-priority, deployable unit in the field. You are aware that the incoming president has expressed an intention—perhaps real, perhaps just bluster—to use the military, if necessary, to retake the Panama Canal and take control of Greenland. You know that, by virtue of the 1977 Panama Canal Treaties, the United States relinquished control over the canal in 2000 and thereby guaranteed its permanent neutrality. You know that Panama, a founding member of the United Nations whose sovereignty, territorial integrity, and political independence are therefore to be respected by all other UN member states, maintains full jurisdiction and operational control over the canal. You know that Greenland is a fully self-governing, sovereign territory under the principal control of Denmark, which is a founding member of both the UN and NATO. Greenland’s status, then, is very much akin to U.S. territories such as Guam, the Marshall Islands, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands, all of which presumably would demand U.S. willingness to spill blood and treasure to defend them from outside intervention. You consider territorial expansion to be an outdated concept of a bygone era, as well as a vestige of an imperialistic, Manifest Destiny American past. You recall, by analogy with a Greenland takeover in particular, the insensate 1893 overthrow of Hawaii’s constitutional monarchy, abetted by U.S. Marines, as a reflection of the self-serving, expansionist mentality of the time. You are fully familiar with the laws of armed conflict that reflect long-standing Just War precepts: the requirements that there be a justifiable cause for employing force in the first place; that force be used only as a last resort after all other reasonable options have been exhausted; that one’s intentions be clear and legitimate; that the harms of employing force not outweigh the harms suffered in the absence of such a response; that there be a reasonable probability of success when force is employed; and that any decision to use force must emanate from the highest authority (however unclear it may be in a representative democracy whether the highest authority is the head of state or the people themselves). You realize that U.S. policymakers have chosen not to be a party to the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court, the rationale being that domestic legal institutions and processes are, in the ideal, perfectly capable of holding accountable individual Americans alleged to have perpetrated or directed the sorts of crimes the ICC oversees (war crimes, crimes against humanity, genocide, and, of particular relevance here, crimes of aggression). In this manner, individuals like you, charged with undertaking potentially violent acts at the behest of and on behalf of the U.S. government, ideally need not fear being apprehended and tried by outside authorities for atrocities or associated unlawful or inhumane acts. Realizing this, you also acknowledge how ambiguously defined and interpreted is the crime of aggression (any use of armed force by a state against the sovereignty, territorial integrity or political independence of another state). You know all too well, based on the experience of the ages, that occupation forces are lodestones for strategic failure; breeding grounds for animosity and resentment from the occupied populace; sitting ducks for daily, hourly sabotage that produces casualties among the occupiers, feeds their frustration and demoralization, and leads almost invariably to retaliatory atrocities. All of this diminishes the credibility of the occupier to such an extent that it inevitably is forced to withdraw in ignominious failure. Mission not accomplished. You have sworn an oath to support and defend the Constitution, which implicitly carries with it an obligation to see that the laws be faithfully executed, an acknowledgement in turn that the treaties the United States has signed and ratified are the law of the land. Moreover, your original enlistment oath makes even more explicit your obligation to obey the lawful orders—not just any orders, but lawful orders; not just implied expectations, but expressed orders—of those appointed over you. You fully embrace the necessity of sound civil-military relations to a viable democracy: including a military that is strategically, not just militarily, effective; whose leaders provide sound strategic, not just military, advice to civilian authorities who themselves are strategically competent, not just politically adept, and answer to a strategically aware, civically engaged public. And, lastly, you subscribe unreservedly to the normative values of honor and courage that are at the heart of the stated core values each armed service espouses. So, considering all of this, what will you do—what should you be expected to do—if tasked to deploy troops to support either or both of these missions? Will you simply comply – silently, obediently, unquestioningly – under cover of the claim that you are being politically neutral and obedient to properly constituted authority? Or will you stand up to be counted and demand to be heard in light of the strategic consequences that could result? Will you demand to be given explicit, official orders in writing that emanate directly and transparently from the president himself? Will you demand to have your views heard internally, and will you actually be willing to express them? Will you consider speaking out in public if necessary, and will you be willing to do so? And will you, if worse comes to worst, be willing to resign on principle if the situation calls for such a dramatic act? These are questions you shouldn’t be forced to confront and wouldn’t have to confront if your relationship with the commander-in-chief was one of mutual respect and adherence to the principled norms that are supposed to underlie sound civil-military relations. But all of that will have been lost by the fact that these circumstances have been made a subject of discussion in the first place by an incoming commander-in-chief who respects neither the norms nor the limits that practice and time have put in place.

Wide Ranging Fallout Of Trudeau’s Exit From Canadian Premiership ...	In India, Trudeau was seen as a supporter of Sikh separatism and the US had economic and security issues with him which made President-elect Donald Trump threaten annexation of Canada. Justin Trudeau, Canadian Prime Minister for nine years, announced on January 6, that he would be stepping down in March, unable to resolve the contradictions within his Liberal Party. He would be leading the party in the parliamentary elections that might be held in March. That he and his Liberal Party-led coalition government had got poor ratings in recent opinion polls must have contributed to his decision. To add to his woes, Chrystia Freeland, his Deputy Prime Minister and Finance Minister, resigned last month. The fallout of Trudeau's exit will be on Canada's domestic as well as foreign policy. He has had run-ins with major powers like the US, India and China. It remains to be seen if relations with these will change for the better or for the worse in the post-Trudeau era with a new Prime Minister in place. The current favourite to be PM is opposition Conservative Party leader, Pierre Poilievre. The Conservative Party had gained a 24-point lead over Trudeau's Liberals in the latest opinion poll, according to the CBC's poll tracker. Poilievre is a populist who had been in former Prime Minister Stephen Harper's cabinet. He has been using the social media to tap into Canadians' frustrations over rising housing costs, inflation and unbridled immigration putting pressure on public and civic services. In addition to Poilievre, there could be an Indian-origin leader also in the running. He is Jagmeet Singh, whose New Democratic Party (NDP) representing the Sikhs, has been an ally of the Liberals. But Jagmeet Singh's chances are dimmer than Trudeau's, going by the opinion polls. However, if by chance he stands and wins, India will be sorry as he is a supporter of the Sikh separatist movement in India. Some Liberals could also be in the running like former Finance Minister Chrystia Freeland and Mark Carney, the former head of the Bank of England and Bank of Canada. But, under the circumstances, these leaders' main task should be to re-build the party and connect with public opinion, rather than fight elections. Standoff with India According to Biman Mukherji of the South China Morning Post(SCMP), Trudeau's going will pave the way for a diplomatic reset with India, easing tensions over allegations about New Delhi's involvement in the killing of a Sikh separatist leader and Canadian national, Hardeep Singh Nijjar, in June 2023 on Canadian soil. Nijjar had been a leading Sikh (Khalistani) separatist/terrorist in Canada. The Khalistan movement seeks an independent Sikh homeland in the Indian Punjab. For decades, Canada has turned a blind eye to the anti-India activities of a section of its Sikh population which has been supporting the separatist/terrorist movement. Persistent appeals by India to curb their activities had fallen on deaf ears in Ottawa. Trudeau was courting Sikh separatist leaders for domestic political gain as his coalition government needed the support of Jagmeet Singh's NDP. Trudeau wooed Sikh separatists openly and even included a separatist in his entourage when he visited India. Nijjar's killing became a cause célèbre when the case was publicly taken up with India by Trudeau, with 'evidence' provided by the 'Five Eyes' intelligence network in which the US is a key member. India stoutly denied any involvement and accused Canada of making allegations without a proper investigation or presenting the evidence it claimed to possess. India withdrew its High Commissioner and Canada also did so. Canada cut its student visas for Indians by a third, and India curbed the granting of visas to Canadians. Canada's action caused immense dismay among young Indians seeking higher education in Canada. The curbs would have hurt Canadian universities also, as many of them were running because of the high fees they charged from Indian students. The US complicated matters by asking India to cooperate with the Canadian investigations. India pointed that Canada, especially Trudeau, had been actively supporting Canada-based Indian terror groups. The US, which was also alleging that Indian agents were targeting US national and Sikh separatist Gurpatwant Singh Pannu in New York City, sided with Canada. 'The issue of the alleged Indian involvement in Nijjar's killing won't disappear, but it could be put on the backburner,' strategic analyst Uday Bhaskar told South China Morning Post, speculating on the post-Trudeau scenario. Perhaps, the Ambassadors who were withdrawn would be sent back or the posts would be filled. Reports from Canada say that the Conservative Party leader, Pierre Poilievre, had criticised Trudeau for the way he handled issues with India. India-Canada bilateral trade was US$ 8 billion in 2024 and Indian students have been a major source of income for Canada. Therefore, there are lobbies wanting restoration of normal ties. However, Michael Kugelman writes in Foreign Policy that Trudeau's departure certainly isn't guaranteed to stabilize the free-falling relationship with India. 'Canada's investigations will continue under the next prime minister, which could bring fresh public allegations against India to light. And domestic political factors in Canada—including powerful Sikh constituencies—suggest that Trudeau-era policies won't necessarily change.' 'Canadian opposition leader Pierre Poilievre, who may become the next prime minister, has criticized the rhetoric and actions of Sikh separatists in Canada but some Indian commentators say that he hasn't gone far enough. Still, the leadership transition provides an opportunity for a fresh start for New Delhi,' Kugelman adds. Run-ins with Trump US President-elect Donald Trump's rhetoric about Canada could be key factor in the forthcoming Canadian elections. Trump had threatened to impose new tariffs (25%) on Canada and had even commented on the possibility of the US annexing Canada and making it the 51st.State of the US. Former Canadian Finance Minister Freeland had slammed Trudeau for not having a plan to deal with Trump when he threatened to use economic force (that is: crippling tariffs) to enable annexation. A US tariff of 25% on Canadian exports could lead to a loss of at least one million jobs in Canada. There are also security issues dividing Canada and the US. Trudeau told Trump at Mar-a-Lago on November 30, that he would strengthen border security and stop fentanyl and human trafficking on the US-Canada border. Fentanyl is a potent synthetic opioid drug approved by the Food and Drug Administration of the US for use as an analgesic and anaesthetic. It is approximately 100 times more potent than morphine and 50 times more potent than heroin as an analgesic. At the NATO summit in July 2024 Trudeau promised to increase Canadian defence spending to 2 % of its GDP by 2032, but did not announce a plan to reach that goal. Trump has doubts about these pledges being met and hence the threat of annexation. In June 2024, the Trudeau government imposed a digital service tax of 3% of revenues generated from Canadian users of foreign tech platforms, and worse still, made it retroactive from 2022. US tech firms were livid. Run-in with China Trudeau had bad relations with China too. At the G20 summit in Indonesia in November 2022, Chinese President Xi Jinping angrily rebuked Trudeau after Canadian officials shared with the media, details of a previous Xi-Trudeau meeting. A visibly disturbed Xi pulled Trudeau aside and said that it was 'not appropriate' for details about a previous conversation between the two leaders to have been shared with the media. 'Everything we discuss has been leaked to the paper, that's not appropriate, and that's not the way the conversation was conducted,' Xi said. In his retort Trudeau said: 'In Canada, we believe in free and open and frank dialogue and that is what we will continue to have. We will continue to look to work constructively together but there will be things we will disagree on.' Xi then said: the two sides must 'create the conditions first' for further talks. Xi's tick off came a day after government sources told the media about a Trudeau –Xi conversation on the margins of the summit, where Trudeau had raised 'serious concerns' over China's 'increasingly aggressive interference' in Canada's elections. With relations being tense, Trudeau was left out of any formal meetings with Xi on the side lines of the summit, while other leaders had bilateral talks with him. The next Canadian PM will have to mend fences with China too.

Robert Reich: Will Trump Get Credit For Biden’s Successes? – OpEd	Trump will try to take credit for the Biden economy. Don’t let him. And don’t let Republican enablers of Trump or the media give him credit, either. In 2017, Trump inherited a strong economy from President Obama and never stopped congratulating himself for it. He claimed that 'we created the greatest economy in the history of the world.' Rubbish. Trump tanked the economy with his trade wars and his botched pandemic response. Now, Trump is inheriting an even stronger economy. On Friday, the Department of Labor reported that the nation added 256,000 jobs in December, significantly more than economists expected. The total number of jobs created under Biden’s four years is 16.6 million. That makes him the only president in history to have presided over an economy that created jobs every single month. He has also presided over the lowest average unemployment rate of any president in a half-century, ending at 4.1 percent. The nation gained more jobs in Biden’s four years than it did under Trump’s first term of office, or under either of Barack Obama’s or George W. Bush’s terms of office. Working-age women are now employed at record levels. The gap in employment between Black Americans and their white counterparts is at the lowest level ever. Biden has also presided over an economy that has grown faster and created more jobs than any other advanced economy around the world. Under Biden, the American economy grew faster than did the pre-pandemic Trump economy. Yes, the United States and every other country had to deal with inflation, but Biden brought inflation down to below 3 percent — lower than in most other countries. Americans have every reason to be outraged at decades of policies that prioritized corporations over people. But the Biden administration cracked down on corporate price-gouging, monopolization, and trickle-down nonsense. All this means that Trump begins his second presidency with the best economy a president has inherited in living memory. Will he claim credit for it? You betcha. In addition, some of the most important Biden initiatives will start to pay off only during the Trump presidency (assuming Trump doesn’t reverse them). Biden took on Big Pharma by capping out-of-pocket drug costs for millions of seniors on Medicare. That lowered the price of 64 drugs. These changes will take place throughout 2025. More drugs are scheduled to get cheaper in the following years. Will Trump claim credit? Of course he will. Biden’s infrastructure law will give us better roads, bridges, public transit, and broadband access. But most Americans won’t see those improvements for a year or two, well into Trump’s term of office. Biden’s CHIPS and Science Act will provide more American-made semiconductors, but we won’t see them for a few years, so during Trump’s presidency. Biden’s clean energy initiatives will also pay off with greater fuel efficiency and less pollution. But here again, not for several years. Will Trump claim credit for these successes as well? Do birds fly? His whole life, Trump has taken credit for things he simply inherited, starting with his own personal fortune. Just as he avoids accountability for the bad stuff he’s done, such as his attempted coup against the United States, he congratulates himself for the good stuff others have done. If Trump doesn’t wreck the economy with his bonkers tariff plans or cruel mass deportations, you can be sure he’ll take a bow for what Biden built. Don’t let him. Don’t let Republican politicians claim credit. Don’t let the media allow Trump or other Republicans to claim credit. Speak out. Remind America that these good things happened because of Joe Biden.

Make Greenland Great Again Act Seeks Support In US	By Magnus Lund Nielsen (EurActiv) -- Incoming US President Donald Trump has stepped up his ambitions to buy Greenland as Republican lawmakers introduced a bill to the House of Representatives, provocatively called the Make Greenland Great Again Act. The bill circulated for cosponsors on Monday would allow Trump to start negotiations with Denmark to purchase the territory at 12:01 p.m. EST on 20 January. Although Democratic leadership in the US Congress has scoffed at Trump's expansionist ambitions, Axios reported that some moderate Democratic lawmakers have signalled they are open to the idea. Trump first mentioned buying Greenland during his first term in 2019. He then ruffled feathers in Europe several times in the last weeks after he said he wanted to buy the territory, a part of EU and NATO member Denmark, while not ruling out militaryor economic muscle to do so. His son then paid Greenland's capital a surprise visit, fuelling further speculation. However, officials from Denmark and Greenland have repeatedly stated that the autonomous region is not up for sale. 'We do not want to be Danes, we do not want to be Americans – of course, we want to be Greenlanders,' the Greenlandic Premier Múte B. Egede said at a press conference in Copenhagen on Friday. On Monday, talking to local and international press in Nuuk, Greenland’s capital, Egede said he was looking forward to building closer ties with the US. Axios reported that Danish officials have contacted Trump's team to underline their openness to expanding the US military presence in Greenland. Greenlandic media KNR also reported that the premier was open to the US in mining and trade, adding that they were keen to seek opportunities for cooperation with Trump. Since 2009, Greenland has held the right to declare independence from Denmark. The island of some 56,000 inhabitants, which relies on significant budget transfers from Copenhagen each year, has so far refrained from doing so. Greenland is due to hold parliamentary elections before 6 April.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWdnrnpeCzdSz9pKeqrTiRWA	2025-01-14T16:43:57-08:00	
US, Qatar Say Israel, Hamas At Closest Point Yet To Ceasefire Dea...	The United States and Qatar said Tuesday that negotiations for a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas in the Gaza Strip were nearing agreement after months of stalemated talks, although details were still being worked on. U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said in a Washington speech, 'I believe we will get a ceasefire,' but added that it was up to Hamas to give its final assent. 'It's right on the brink. It's closer than it's ever been before.' Speaking at a weekly briefing, Qatari Foreign Ministry spokesperson Majed al-Ansari described the ongoing talks as in the 'final stages' and at the 'closest point' yet to an agreement, while also cautioning against overexcitement until a deal is announced. Qatar, Egypt and the United States have led a monthslong effort to try to achieve a halt in the fighting, with talks Tuesday in Doha focusing on the last details of a deal. Hamas said it was awaiting maps from Israel showing what parts of Gaza it would withdraw its troops from in the initial stages of the ceasefire. Ceasefire would unfold in stages President Joe Biden said Monday that the deal was on 'the brink' of 'finally coming to fruition.' In a speech at the State Department to highlight his foreign policy achievements, Biden said the deal would 'free the hostages, halt the fighting, provide security to Israel and allow us to significantly surge humanitarian assistance to the Palestinians, who suffered terribly in this war that Hamas started.' The basic parameters of the ceasefire proposal would see the process play out in several stages. Hamas would release hostages it has been holding since the militants carried out their October 2023 attack on Israel, while Israeli authorities would release Palestinian prisoners. Israeli troops would carry out a phased withdrawal from Gaza, and some Palestinians displaced by the conflict would be allowed to return, along with a surge in aid for Palestinian civilians. Months of negotiations have failed to bring a halt to the fighting, but in recent weeks, the effort has gained momentum at a time when the U.S. is preparing for President-elect Donald Trump to take office Jan. 20 as Biden’s four-year term ends. Post-war Gaza governance Blinken made a last-minute case Tuesday for a plan for the post-war reconstruction and governance of Gaza. 'We have a responsibility to ensure that the strategic gains of the last 15 months endure and lay the foundation for a better future,' Blinken told the Atlantic Council, a Washington-based think tank. 'All too often in the Middle East, we’ve seen how the shoes of one dictator can be filled by another or give way to conflict and chaos.' Blinken said the plan envisions the Palestinian Authority inviting 'international partners' to create an interim governing authority to run critical services and oversee the territory. Other partners, notably Arab states, would provide forces to ensure security in the short term, he said. That security mission would depend on a pathway to an independent Palestinian state unifying Gaza and the West Bank and would be tasked with creating 'a secure environment for humanitarian and reconstruction efforts and ensuring border security,' Blinken said. Creation of a Palestinian state, which Israel has refused to support, has been a sticking point in the negotiations. Blinken told MSNBC on Monday that the sides were 'closer than we've ever been' to a deal, but that the conclusion was up to Hamas. Biden’s national security adviser, Jake Sullivan, said Monday that Biden administration officials were keeping Trump’s Mideast advisers abreast of negotiations. Trump's Middle East envoy, Steve Witkoff, has been involved in the latest round of talks. Israel launched its assault on Hamas in Gaza after Hamas fighters stormed across its borders on Oct. 7, 2023, killing 1,200 people and taking more than 250 hostages, according to Israeli tallies. Since then, more than 46,500 people have been killed in Gaza, with most of them women and children, according to Palestinian health officials, although Israel says the death toll includes thousands of Hamas combatants it has killed. Much of Gaza, a narrow strip of land along the Mediterranean Sea, has been laid to waste during the fighting and gripped by a humanitarian crisis, with most of its 2.3 million population displaced, often multiple times. White House Bureau Chief Patsy Widakuswara contributed to this report.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWdnrnpeCzdSz3cf8a9TqVhz	2025-01-14T16:41:29-08:00	
Russia’s Top Diplomat Again Signals Readiness For Trump’s Ukraine...	By Mike Eckel (RFE/RL) -- Russia’s foreign minister signaled that Moscow was ready to hear from President-elect Donald Trump and advisers on proposals to resolve the Ukraine war, saying the incoming administration had 'started to acknowledge the realities on the ground.' The comments from Sergei Lavrov, made during an annual news conference on January 14, were the latest in a series of remarks by Russian officials ahead of potential cease-fire proposals for the conflict, which will mark its third anniversary next month.Trump has said he wants to meet with Russian President Vladimir Putin directly to try and resolve the war, which has killed or wounded more than 1 million troops on both sides. Russia, whose troops currently occupy around 20 percent of Ukrainian territory, has justified its all-out February 2022 invasion of Ukraine in a series of shifting rationales, including preventing it from ever joining the NATO military alliance.'We will be waiting for specific initiatives. President Putin has said on multiple occasions that he is ready to meet, but no proposals have been made yet,' Lavrov told reporters during the three-hour news conference. 'President Trump also said that Putin wanted to meet and he believed they should meet but he first needed to take office.'In the waning days of his tenure, President Joe Biden has rushed to ship billions of dollars in weaponry and other equipment to Ukraine, seeking to bolster its arsenals in the event that the incoming Trump administration scales back arms shipments.In Kyiv, Ukrainian officials have also signaled an openness to hearing Trump’s peace proposals.Speaking in an interview with Newsmax on January 13, Trump asserted that Putin was ready to meet soon after Trump's inauguration on January 20.'I know he wants to meet and I’m going to meet [him] very quickly,' he said. 'I would've done it sooner but...you have to get into the office. For some of the things, you do have to be there.'Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters shortly before Lavrov's event that there were no specifics agreed on yet for a Trump-Putin meeting.Trump's incoming national-security adviser, Mike Waltz, also emphasized a new diplomatic push to resolve the fighting. But he also signaled Ukrainian demands that Russia withdraw from all occupied territories was unlikely.'I just don't think it's realistic to say we're going to expel every Russian from every inch of Ukrainian soil, even Crimea,' Waltz told ABC News in an interview broadcast on January 12. 'President Trump has acknowledged that reality, and I think it's been a huge step forward that the entire world is acknowledging that reality. Now let's move forward.'	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWdnrnpeCzdSz0D2j6aFUYXw	2025-01-14T16:38:49-08:00	
New US Aircraft Carriers To Be Named After Clinton And Bush	In his last week in office, U.S. President Joe Biden has named two aircraft carriers being built after former presidents – the USS William J. Clinton and USS George W. Bush, the White House said in a statement. Construction of the two carriers will begin 'in the years ahead,' it said. 'When complete, they will join the most capable, flexible, and professional Navy that has ever put to sea.' The new carriers are part of a plan to boost American naval power. The U.S. Navy has 11 aircraft carriers, all nuclear-powered, by far the largest fleet in the world. Rivals China and Russia have three and one, respectively. With about 290 ships now, the U.S. Navy wants to expand the total fleet to 381 in coming years, according to the Council on Foreign Relations. The Biden Administration has not explicitly endorsed that 381-ship objective. 'When I personally delivered the news to Bill and George, they were deeply humbled,' said Biden in the statement. 'Each knows first-hand the weight of the responsibilities that come with being commander-in-chief.' Named after presidents Most U.S. aircraft carriers are named after former presidents. Bill Clinton was the 42nd U.S. president, serving two terms from 1993 to 2001. During his time in office, Clinton ordered a naval deployment to respond to the Third Taiwan crisis in 1996, as well as air strikes against Iraq in 1998 to degrade its capabilities to manufacture weapons of mass destruction. His successor, Bush, launched a global effort against terrorism following the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks on the United States and waged wars in Afghanistan and Iraq to defeat what Washington considered 'two of the world’s most brutal and aggressive regimes.' There is already a carrier named after Bush’s father, George W.H. Bush, who was president from 1989-1992. US aircraft carriers The U.S. Navy regularly deploys two or three carriers in the Indo-Pacific amid rising regional tensions. 'Aircraft carriers are the centerpiece of America’s naval forces,' said Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin in response to the naming of the two carriers. 'They ensure that the United States can project power and deliver combat capability anytime, anywhere in defense of our democracy.' A Congressional Research Service’s report on the Ford-class aircraft carrier program said that the scheduled deliveries of several shipbuilding programs would be delayed approximately 18 to 26 months.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWdnrnpeCzdSz5bRzK1jgWfG	2025-01-14T16:36:09-08:00	
NATO Launches ‘Baltic Sentry’ To Increase Critical Infrastructure...	NATO Secretary General, Mark Rutte co-hosted a Summit of Baltic Sea Allies on Tuesday (14 January 2025), along with President Alexander Stubb of Finland and Prime Minister Kristen Michal of Estonia. At the meeting in Helsinki, Mr Rutte announced the launch of a new military activity by NATO to strengthen the protection of critical infrastructure. 'Baltic Sentry' will enhance NATO’s military presence in the Baltic Sea and improve Allies’ ability to respond to destabilizing acts. At the Summit, leaders from across the region addressed the growing threat to critical undersea infrastructure. The Secretary General said recent sabotage had damaged energy and communication cables, but he was confident that, 'by working together with all Allies – we will do what it takes to ensure the safety and security not only of our critical infrastructure but of all that we hold dear.' 'Baltic Sentry' will involve a range of assets, including frigates and maritime patrol aircraft. The Secretary General also announced the deployment of new technologies, including a small fleet of naval drones, and highlighted that NATO will work with Allies to integrate national surveillance assets – all to improve the ability to protect critical undersea infrastructure and respond if required. NATO will work within the Critical Undersea Infrastructure Network, which includes industry, to explore further ways to protect infrastructure and improve resilience of underwater assets. Mr Rutte also stressed the importance of robust enforcement. He highlighted how Finland has demonstrated that firm action within the law is possible, 'Ship captains must understand that potential threats to our infrastructure will have consequences, including possible boarding, impounding, and arrest.'	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWdnrnpeCzdSz8loRK3rhV9T	2025-01-14T16:21:33-08:00	
White House To Remove Cuba From Terror List Amid Vatican’s Effort...	By Daniel Payne The Biden administration in its final days will remove Cuba from the U.S. State Department’s state sponsor of terrorism list, a decision the White House says was facilitated with the help of the Vatican to secure the release of political prisoners there. A senior administration official told media in a call on Tuesday that President Joe Biden would be lifting Cuba from the list. The Biden administration officially announced the removal on Tuesday afternoon. The country has been just one of four on the list, the others being North Korea, Syria, and Iran. The island nation was placed on the list on Jan. 11, 2021, in the waning days of the first Trump administration. The White House said at the time its aim was 'denying the Castro regime the resources it uses to oppress its people at home and countering its malign interference in Venezuela and the rest of the Western Hemisphere.' The White House has coordinated with the Catholic Church, among others, to improve conditions in Cuba and secure the release of political prisoners, the official said on Tuesday. Human Rights Watch says more than 1,000 individuals in Cuba meet the definition of political prisoners. The Vatican is backing the removal of the country from the terror list, the official noted, and has previously helped to secure prisoner releases there. In addition to removing Cuba from the terror list, the White House will also issue the country a waiver from Title III of the 1996 Helms-Burton Act, which strengthened embargo provisions against Cuba. Title III of the law allows U.S. citizens to sue individuals allegedly trafficking in property expropriated by the country’s communist government. In a Tuesday statement to CNA, Miami Archbishop Thomas Wenski noted that Cuba 'was first removed from the list of state sponsors of terrorism during the Obama administration and was put back on the list in the waning days of President Trump’s first administration.' Miami has historically been home to a large portion of Cuban immigrants and Americans of Cuban heritage. 'Cuba, along with Haiti, Nicaragua, and Venezuela, is on the verge of becoming a failed state,' the archbishop said. 'Cuba lacks fuel and food' and lacks as well the ability 'to represent a real threat to the U.S.' 'More than 500,000 Cubans have come to the U.S. in recent months — their presence has not given rise to any increased fears of terrorism,' the prelate added. 'Hopefully, being removed from the list of state sponsors of terrorism will spur the Cuban regime to release its several thousand political prisoners.' Cuba is majority-Catholic. Church leaders there for years have been involved in negotiations with the communist government regarding human rights and market reforms. The country has for decades been accused of human rights abuses. Freedom House lists Cuba as 'not free,' with the country sharply limiting civil and political liberties, while 'official obstacles make it difficult for churches to operate without interference.' Pope Francis hosted Cuban President Miguel Díaz-Canel at the Vatican in 2023. In 2021, amid major protests in the country, the Holy Father professed himself 'near to the dear Cuban people in these difficult moments, in particular to those families suffering the most.' Francis also visited the country in 2015. St. John Paul II likewise famously visited the island in 1998, becoming the first pope to do so. While there he openly prayed that the communist nation would become one of 'freedom, mutual trust, social justice, and lasting peace.' Pope Benedict XVI also visited the nation in 2012.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWdnrnpeCzdSz-Ma83tGKrNn	2025-01-14T16:19:57-08:00	
Twenty Million Radicalizing Muslims Pose A Challenge – OpEd	By Jonathan Power Besides dealing with Ukraine, Russia stands at a major crossroads as it works out how exactly to deal with the 14.5 million ethnic Muslims that live inside its borders. If, added to this are the migrant workers from Central Asia and Azerbaijan, the total is around 20 million. Compare this with Germany which has 5.5 million Muslims and France which has 6 million Muslims. This is quite a cupful to swallow. The Kremlin has struggled for decades to deal with Muslim ways and demands. When communism collapsed, it was relatively easy to restore the Orthodox Church to its traditional pre-eminence. But dealing with the Muslims is much less straightforward. Besides being a religion, they are a political force. The relationship between the power of the Kremlin and the developing power of Islam was seriously put to the test in the 1990s by the wars for independence in the southern Muslim states of Chechnya and Dagestan. Today, stability is threatened by the growing appeal of the Islamic State, ISIS, among disaffected Islamic youth. If Chechnya (now pacified) was the catalyst for the initial spread of militant Islamism, ISIS is now the threat that can spear the soft underbelly of southern Russia. As recently as last year, ISIS militants stormed a Moscow theatre that killed 100 people. The worst atrocity was the attack in 2004 on a school in Beslan that killed 186 children This threat is galvanized by the belief system of IS and Saudi Arabia (which has exported it)—Wahhabism, with its puritanical and anti-female theology. According to President Vladimir Putin over 2,000 Russian citizens have gone to fight with IS, a ruthless organization that blew up in mid-air a Russian airliner. Most of the world thinks only of the fall of the Iron Curtain on Russia’s European borders. But it also fell in the south. 11.6 million immigrant workers mixed with evangelical Wahabist imams, are gradually becoming a potent fifth column inside Russia. Shooting itself in the foot, Russia has dealt too often with the bubbles of incipient disaffection by using the heavy hand rather than dialogue. Inevitably this has led to further radicalism. Nevertheless, a poll conducted by the Media-Orient agency in the north Caucasus of Muslims found that 73% rejected political and religious extremism. But that still leaves a quarter who are attracted to radicalism to varying degrees. Surprisingly, the highest totals of rejection were in Chechnya and Dagestan- 97% and 85% respectively. Perhaps that is because they have both experienced the horror of Islamic extremist-led war. In public, the Russian leadership welcomes the Islamic religion as a moral force. In private there are grave doubts. It is obvious that over the last two decades that Islam, quiescent in Soviet times, increasingly serves as a forum for social and political protests which in some areas have been hijacked by separatists. To complicate things, unlike the monolithic Orthodox Church, Islam is split into competing factions. There is old time traditional Islam on the one hand and on the other fundamentalism, Islamism and Wahhabism. A few years ago, the mufti of Tatarstan, a traditionalist, was seriously wounded in an attack and Valiulla Yakupov, a prominent ideologist of Islamic traditionalism, was assassinated. The Kremlin demands unconditional loyalty to Mother Russia. Many Muslims do not give it and look towards the global Ummah. Their numbers are growing fast. Not even Tatarstan which has existed peacefully in a Christian environment for half a millennium is isolated from the tendency towards radicalism and militancy. According to Alexei Malashenko, co-chair of Carnegie Moscow Center’s Religion, Society and Security Program, writing in the quarterly, 'Russia in Global Affairs': 'The Kremlin simplifies the situation by focusing on the political aspects. It combats extremism and separatism but evades the question of how people in a secular state can live by religious laws. It ignores the fact that the trend in the development of Russia’s civic identity does not always coincide with, and sometimes is even opposed to, that of religious identity.' Malashenko also makes the point that many Muslim scholars, imams, theologians and even local politicians today seek to move away from a simplified dichotomy between traditional and radical. They see that it splits society and that some sort of mix is necessary—not to be violent or brutally puritanical but to recognize the value of the social and political protest. And that even in a modern society Sharia law can be observed, as long as one is not fundamentalist about it. There needs to be both a state-Islamic dialogue and an Islamic-Islamic one. 2000 Muslims going to fight at the side of IS is too many, but it is not a lot. The response to the call of violence is still limited to a very small minority. The time for dialogue and mending grievances has by no means run out. Putin said in an important speech on Islam 'Although religion is constitutionally separated from the state, the state itself is not separated from believers'. Clearly, he has some grasp of the problem. But there is a way to go from words to action.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWdnrnpeCzdSz7uofv7p8eIb	2025-01-14T16:17:52-08:00	
Presidential Elections In Belarus: Lukashenko And The Art Of Bala...	Belarus will hold its presidential elections on 26 January 2025. According to the Belarusian Constitution, the president is elected for a five-year term. Under the electoral law, any citizen of Belarus born in the country, who is at least 35 years old, and has resided continuously in the Republic of Belarus for at least ten years prior to the elections, is eligible to run for president. Candidates must not have a criminal record. Presidential candidates are nominated by citizens of Belarus, provided they secure at least 100,000 signatures from eligible voters. The nomination process is conducted by initiative groups of citizens, comprising at least 100 members. The presidential elections are considered valid if more than 50% of all citizens of the Republic of Belarus registered on the electoral roll participate in the voting process. A candidate is elected president if they receive over 50% of the votes cast during the election[2]. The Central Election Commission (CEC) has registered five candidates for the upcoming seventh presidential elections. These include the incumbent Belarusian president, Alexander Lukashenko; the chairman of the Liberal Democratic Party of Belarus Oleg Gaidukevich, chairman of the Republican Party of Labour and Justice Alexander Khizhnyak, private entrepreneur Anna Kanopatskaya, and the First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Belarus Sergei Syrankov. After verifying the authenticity and accuracy of the collected signatures, the nominees were officially confirmed as candidates. According to data from the Central Election Commission, Lukashenko’s candidacy secured over 2.5 million supporting signatures, while the other candidates collected just over 100,000 signatures each. Igor Karpenko, chairman of the Central Election Commission, stated that 93 international observers have been accredited to monitor the presidential elections, along with 951 national observers in regional commissions. From 1 January 2025, the electoral process entered the pre-election campaign phase. The number of registered voters as of 25 February 2024 stands at 6,825,985. Presidential elections 2020 The outcome of the presidential elections held in early August 2020, in which Lukashenko won by a large majority, intensified tensions with the domestic opposition, backed by Western powers. This led to several thousand protesters gathering at Independence Square, facing the seat of the Belarusian government, in a manner reminiscent of the so-called 'colour revolutions' in many former Soviet republics at the beginning of the 21st century. At the same time, Lukashenko's relations with Moscow were strained following the detention of 32 Russian nationals and one Belarusian citizen, accused of plotting to destabilise Belarus and overthrow his government. While Moscow awaited the release of its citizens, early signs of a 'colour revolution' began to emerge, resembling the one in Ukraine in early 2014. Western countries issued threats and attempted to intimidate Lukashenko, warning him of sanctions and isolation. Some Western governments, primarily France, Germany, and Poland, went as far as demanding a repeat of the presidential elections. The demonstrations escalated into violence between some protesters and security forces, leading to the arrest of hundreds of demonstrators. In the streets of Minsk, vehicles driven by protesters ran over police officers, resulting in the deaths of nine security personnel—an unprecedented event in the history of 'colour revolutions.' Although Lukashenko took the initiative to apologise to protesters, called on the Minister of Internal Affairs to take responsibility for failing to adhere to directives on the peaceful handling of demonstrators, and ordered the immediate release of all detainees, the unrest persisted. Russian state media joined the campaign against the Belarusian government, airing footage of violence by Belarusian security forces and their excessive breaches of the rights and safety of ordinary citizens uninvolved in the protests. This fuelled growing dissatisfaction and outrage among political and social circles both within Belarus and internationally. Disturbing scenes from the bloody demonstrations were featured on the programme Solovyov Live (Соловьёв Live), hosted by Vladimir Solovyov, a figure closely aligned with the Kremlin. Solovyov claimed that Belarusian security forces would not have resorted to violent treatment of helpless youth, women, and the elderly without the approval and explicit directives of the state leadership. This, he speculated, might partly explain the violent actions of some protesters. In an effort to present a balanced view, Solovyov also aired footage of armed clashes between security forces and certain protesters. These individuals displayed combat skills and street-fighting experience, suggesting they had been trained and prepared in advance, likely under instructions from a 'third party' that manipulated the peaceful protests, turning them into violence and bloodshed. Moscow scaled back its unconditional support for the government in Minsk, permitting Kremlin-affiliated commentators to criticise and condemn Lukashenko’s handling of his citizens. He was accused of betraying Russian interests, including his refusal to recognise the independence of Abkhazia and South Ossetia from Georgia after the 2008 armed conflict. His refusal to acknowledge Russia’s annexation of Crimea in 2014, citing strict adherence to the UN Charter and international law, heightened the pressure on him to change his stance. Facing intense pressure from the West and a coordinated Russian campaign against the Minsk government, President Lukashenko decided to release the detained Russian members of the Wagner Group. The president realised the consequences of his policy of prioritising closer ties with the West over Russia. Analysts believe that Lukashenko has always been skilled at balancing relations between East and West to safeguard Belarus’s independence. Opposition without a leader Belarus’s political opposition was effectively without leadership, with no one ready to enter into dialogue with the government within a political framework that could serve as a roadmap for managing the crisis and moving towards negotiations with the current president. Observers pointed to the incompetence of opposition presidential candidate Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya, whom opposition supporters claimed won approximately 70-75% of the votes, while official results announced by the Central Election Commission indicated that she secured just over 10%. Tsikhanouskaya urged her supporters to stay off the streets and remain calm[3] before fleeing to neighbouring Lithuania, where she proclaimed the 'need for new elections in Belarus.' From Lithuania, she declared that she would not concede defeat and announced the start of consultations to form a so-called Coordination Council[4], which she stated was intended to facilitate a transfer of power in the country. Tsikhanouskaya reiterated her willingness to engage in dialogue with the authorities, provided that all individuals detained during the protests are released and those responsible for ordering crackdowns and shootings at protesters are held accountable. Simultaneously, she called on the international community and European nations to assist in facilitating such dialogue. Meanwhile, protesters on the streets of Minsk escalated their demands, calling for Lukashenko’s resignation. The Russian perspective on the 2020 elections Alexander Lukashenko received congratulations from several key allies, including China, Kazakhstan, and Russia. Russian President Vladimir Putin sent a diplomatically lukewarm congratulatory message, characterised by generic phrases that emphasised hopes for the continued strengthening of bilateral relations across all areas, as well as support for Belarus’s cooperation within Eurasian organisations and the Collective Security Treaty Organisation (CSTO), which links Belarus with Russia and several former Soviet states in matters of security and defence. Russia feared losing Belarus in the same manner it lost Ukraine after the ousting of pro-Russian President Viktor Yanukovych in February 2014. In response to the reconciliation initiative proposed by the Belarusian president, Russia acted swiftly to mitigate the risk of the revolution taking a direction detrimental to its interests, as had occurred in Ukraine. Public discontent over the Covid-19 pandemic The demonstrations in Minsk and the ensuing political crisis after the presidential elections were essentially rooted in an economic downturn caused by the Covid-19 pandemic. Economic growth fell below 5%, while unemployment rose from its previous level of around 4%. Relations with the Russian Federation were further strained by Alexander Lukashenko’s demands for Moscow to increase transit fees for pipelines, oil, and goods bound for Europe (Poland and Germany), a request that Russia rejected. Belarus adopted a completely different approach to the Covid-19 pandemic compared to the rest of Europe, including its closest neighbours, Russia and Ukraine. While Ukraine implemented a state of emergency in Kyiv and other regions, and Russia closed schools, cancelled group events, and suspended domestic and international flights, daily life in Belarus continued unaffected, as if nothing had happened. President Lukashenko maintained that there was no need for his country to adopt preventive measures to curb the spread of the coronavirus. 'Such things happen, but the most important thing is not to panic!' Lukashenko declared. Constructive opposition – a matter of national interest Opposition is a vital component of any democratic society, tasked with monitoring government policies with the aim of improving them or highlighting certain shortcomings and errors that may arise in the management of public affairs by the executive branch. Constructive opposition is a legitimate right and a cornerstone of democracy. Protests and the peaceful expression of views and demands are democratic practices universally recognised in democratic systems around the world. Genuine and constructive opposition plays a constitutional role and is accountable solely to the electorate, and should remain free from the influence of external factors that are viewed unfavourably by Belarusian citizens. It represents the essence of democracy and provides a strong foundation for safeguarding the state within the framework of the constitution and the law, while also reinforcing other state institutions. A clear distinction must be drawn between constructive opposition, which seeks to address and rectify mistakes for the benefit of the nation and its citizens, and destructive opposition, which leverages errors to destabilise security and stability, pushing the state into a spiral of violence and chaos. Portrait of the current president The current president, Alexander Lukashenko, has held power for 30 years, ascending to office in 1994 amidst the turmoil following the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991. Early in his presidency and throughout his tenure, he sought to preserve what remained of the state institutions inherited from the USSR. He succeeded in keeping much of the industrial sector under state control and consistently opposed any foreign interference in the country’s domestic affairs. His relations with Russia have always fluctuated, while he simultaneously worked to establish normal relations with the West and NATO. Lukashenko’s professional life has gone through numerous stages, taking him from a farmer and villager to a politician and president, and eventually to a leader whom many in both the West and the East wish to remove from power. Yet, each time, he manages to thwart these efforts and maintain his hold on power. In an October 2021 interview with Matthew Chance, a journalist from the American television network CNN, Lukashenko was asked whether he believed there would be another president of Belarus. Lukashenko replied, 'Matthew, I am not going to be president until I die. If you and your patrons in the West, wherever they are, stop interfering in our situation, and we can be calm and confident as a sovereign independent nation and a people who deserve to be independent and sovereign, believe me, everything will happen sooner than you think. But if you dare to interfere in our affairs again, as in 2020, it will be bad.'[5] Analysts struggle to reconcile the duality of a president who claims he wants to remain in power to resist Russian aspirations to annex Belarus and Western interference in its internal affairs, yet is also portrayed as a dictator who must be removed and whose legitimacy is denied. The West has never criticised other leaders of former Soviet states, such as Azerbaijan’s Ilham Aliyev or Kazakhstan’s Nursultan Nazarbayev, among others. The question is: Is Lukashenko a dictator or a patriot? A famous saying goes: 'No human being embodies absolute good or absolute evil; instead, every person carries a blend of both, in varying degrees.' This reflection may well be the most accurate description of any individual, including Lukashenko. It is an undeniable fact that not all nations are prepared to adopt and implement the Western model of democracy. This model is often incompatible with countries that have distinct cultures, traditions, and unique socio-political developments. The success of a specific democratic model in the United States or Germany does not imply that it should be imposed, generalised, or exported to all countries. Each nation has its own democratic framework, rooted in its traditions, historical experiences, and national values. The painful aftermath of the Arab Spring still demonstrates this, where, instead of democracy, anarchy unfolded in countries such as Egypt, Tunisia, Libya, Iraq, Syria, and Yemen, and the ensuing chaos and lawlessness even led to the creation of the terrorist quasi-state ISIS as a direct consequence. New hopes pinned on President Trump’s policies The new American administration under Donald Trump could introduce changes and take concrete steps in US-Belarus relations. From the American perspective, Belarus is likely to remain within Russia’s sphere of influence. Rather than focusing on severing Minsk-Moscow ties, efforts may shift toward containing and reducing Russian influence in Belarus. As a result, the US stance toward Belarus and the potential easing or tightening of sanctions will most likely depend on US-Russia relations. Criticism of the Belarusian authorities for human rights violations is likely to continue, albeit in a softer tone and remain largely declarative. Belarus’s pro-Western opposition fears that support from the United States may diminish. It is quite likely that the new American administration will delegate the responsibility for backing Belarus’s pro-Western opposition to the European Union. The Trump administration is likely to prioritise enhancing dialogue with Russia to address geopolitical challenges, such as countering Chinese influence, potentially shifting its approach from confrontation to cooperation. Under this scenario, Belarus might expect certain diplomatic concessions from Washington, including visits by senior US officials, similar to those during Trump’s first term. High-profile visits, such as those of National Security Advisor John Bolton on 29 August 2019 and US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo on 1 February 2020, could be repeated in the near future as part of efforts to find a peaceful resolution to the Russia-Ukraine war. Additional positive signs of a potential easing in US-Russia relations have emerged from Washington with Trump’s appointment of Keith Kellogg, a former National Security Advisor and retired US Army Lieutenant General, as Special Envoy for Ukraine and Russia. Kellogg’s focus will be on ending the war in Ukraine, and he advocates for tough negotiations with both Russia and Ukraine to achieve this goal. In an interview with Tesla CEO and X owner Elon Musk on 13 August 2024, US President Donald Trump commended the authoritarian leaders of Russia, China, and North Korea, referring to Russian President Vladimir Putin, Chinese President Xi Jinping, and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un as 'at the peak of their game.' While acknowledging their controversial practices, Trump remarked that, despite often being labelled as dictators, these leaders demonstrate a profound love for their nations, albeit 'a different kind of love.'[6] [1] IFIMES - International Institute for Middle East and Balkan Studies, based in Ljubljana, Slovenia, has a special consultative status with the United Nations Economic and Social Council ECOSOC/UN in New York since 2018, and it is the publisher of the international scientific journal 'European Perspectives', link: [2] The Central Election Commission of the Republic of Belarus.

AUKUS: Flawed And Sinking – OpEd	A stillborn agreement treated as thrivingly alive; an understanding celebrated as consensual and equal. The AUKUS security arrangement between Australia, the United Kingdom and the United States, envisaging the transfer and building of nuclear-powered submarines to the Royal Australian Navy, continues operating in haphazard fashion. So far, the stream has flown away from Australia and into the military industrial complexes of the UK and the US, both desperate to keep the production of these absurd boats steady. Australia has yet to see the fabled white elephants of the sea and remain at the mercy of the US Congress. In the meantime, the country is becoming garrisoned, billeted and appropriated to Washington’s geopolitical vanities. Not being a natural enemy and adversary in any sense, and being the most lucrative trading partner, China has become a fantastically idiotic target for Canberra’s foreign policy dunces. Announced in September 2021 as 'an enhanced trilateral security partnership', AUKUS has hobbled and stuttered its way into 2025. Commentary from the pompom holders for war at such outlets as The Economist continue with such mild remarks as 'ambitious but expensive'. The Australian, armed and eager to do battle in print and digital media against the Yellow Peril, features an article about feeding the military industrial complex by politely calling it 'a defence revolution.' 19FortyFive fastens onto the idea that Australia’s naval modernisation is central in this endeavour, though never mentions the obvious beneficiary. (In two words: not Australia.) 'Nevertheless, AUKUS allows for a broader integration of technological advances in its partners and much-needed modernization of the Australian navy.' This optimistic glow, despite the limping, the delays, and the blunders, can also be found in Australian Defence. The military industrial complex never needs concrete reasons to exist. It’s a creature onto itself. 'Global firms are partnering with Australian based entities in a bid to position themselves for lucrative AUKUS submarine contracts, despite law reforms needed to progress.' One of them is the Texas-based Fluor Corporation, an engineering and construction firm proud, in the words of its Australia & New Zealand president, Gillian Cagney, of its 'thousand engineers who have nuclear capability.' Cagney, like most chiefs and CEOs in this line of work, is good at saying nothing about nothing in particular. When doing so, the language can be guaranteed a good mauling. 'We have that experience and capability that we will be supporting the joint venture to bring to bear and making sure we’re bringing the best in class globally.' Even then, Cagney concedes that the whole business of nuclear-powered submarines for the RAN, known in military planning circles as 'Pillar One', is dicey. Hardly a reason to panic, as this tortured statement testifies: 'One of the things as Worley Fluor Australia we are able to do is in multiple sectors globally is to ramp up to meet our customers needs so it’s no different.' From the United States Studies Centre, that comfortable, uncritical bastion of Pax Americana, a senior research associate, Alice Nason, is found telling France’s Libération that hiccups are bound to take place when the tasks are large. 'In a project of this size, length and complexity of AUKUS, it’s no surprise that disruptions and delays are going to arise.' The truism here is intended to excuse the unpardonable. Why projects of such scale are ever needed is left dangling in ether. These dreary excuses for justifications dressed up as analysis never hide the fundamental defect of AUKUS. It remains, almost entirely, governed by US domestic and foreign interests. It says almost nothing about Australia’s needs, merely speaking to confected Australian fears. It advances the agenda of insecurity, not security. The analysts, lined up from one row to another, cannot assure anybody about what Congress will do if the submarine supply quota lags, or if there will be a war over that strip of territory known as Taiwan. No publication, however lovingly disposed to the business of war, can avoid the teasing worries. Even that pro-Washington, and US defence industry funded outlet based in Canberra, the Australian Strategic Policy Institute, has gone so far as to consider a heresy. In December, it ran an article by Peter Briggs, past president of the Submarine Institute of Australia, suggesting that Canberra consider acquiring 'at least 12 submarines of the French Suffren design. The current AUKUS plan for eight nuclear-powered attack submarines (SSNs) has always been flawed, and now its risks are piling up.' And so we return to where we began: a Franco-Australian agreement to acquire submarines that was sunk in 2021 by Prime Minister Scott Morrison. All in all, forget the submarines, Pillar One, or whatever pillar the strategists tie themselves in knots about. Focus, instead, on the second 'pillar'. Australia has become captive – aided through its dim bulbed representatives – of an empire that fears growing old, haggard and weak. It has been enlisted as servitor, grounds keeper and nurse. Retirees from the US Navy are being given astronomical sums in consultancy fees to divulge wisdom they do not have on junkets Down Under. Think tankers from Australia purporting to be academics make similar trips to Washington to celebrate a failing agreement with treasonous delight. The price Australia is paying is already savagely burdensome. It may well, in the long run, prove worse.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWdb7qD8VV9geNdAaiLqzvhY	2025-01-12T17:29:34-08:00	
The Fall Of Syria’s Assad Regime Is Bad News For Libya – Analysis	Russia’s apparent fast-tracking of plans to establish a military hub in Libya could worsen that country’s protracted conflict. By Peter Fabricius For Russia, as for Iran, last month’s fall of the 54-year-old Assad dynasty in Syria was a major geo-strategic setback. Former Syrian president Bashar al-Assad’s sudden defeat threatened Russia’s important military presence in the eastern Mediterranean. Now Moscow is believed to be trying to negotiate a continued presence with the new Syrian authorities. But it is also transferring military equipment from Syria to nearby Libya, apparently to establish or strengthen Russia’s presence in that country as a new hub for its African operations. This could seriously damage efforts to resolve Libya’s protracted conflict. The end of al-Assad’s regime also has repercussions for Russia’s growing presence across Africa. Moscow’s naval and air bases in Syria have been the hubs for supplying Russia’s continental operations – mainly in Libya and also in Mali, Niger, Burkina Faso, Central African Republic and Sudan. Assad hosted a major Russian military presence in Syria with a warm-water naval base in the port of Tartus, an air base at Khmeimim to the north near the port of Latakia, and a helicopter base at Qamishli in the far northeast. Peace agreements among rival Libyan parties say foreign militaries should have left the country long ago ‘The rapid collapse of the Assad regime in Syria – a regime that the Kremlin helped prop up since 2015 – is a strategic political defeat for Moscow and has thrown the Kremlin into a crisis as it seeks to retain its strategic military basing in Syria,’ the Institute for the Study of War said on 9 December. ‘Putin … intervened on behalf of Assad in 2015 to secure Russian military bases in Syria, support Russia’s wider efforts to project power in the Mediterranean and Red Seas, increase its global footprint in the Middle East and Africa, and threaten [the North Atlantic Treaty Organization’s] southern flank. ‘Russia is attempting to secure its bases in Syria as opposition forces come to power, but Russia’s continued military presence in the country is not guaranteed. [This] especially as Russia’s actions in support of Assad over the past nine years have likely undermined Moscow’s ability to form a lasting, positive relationship with ruling Syrian opposition groups,’ the institute said. Uncertainty about who might constitute the new government also probably complicates these negotiations. And so perhaps as a precaution, Moscow has begun shifting military resources to Libya, where it had already started reinforcing its military presence in 2023/24. ‘Four weeks ago, Russia experienced a clear setback in Syria – an outcome it had not planned for, since losing Assad undermines a key logistical hub that, for nine years, supported its operations in Libya and beyond into Sub-Saharan Africa,’ an analyst at The Sentry, a US-based investigative and policy organisation, told ISS Today. ‘In a bid to preserve its African operations, Moscow has been bolstering its footprint in Libya to compensate for its deteriorating circumstances in Syria in recent weeks. And so far, it has done so without introducing a naval element – at least not yet. ‘Over the last four weeks, Russia has been moving substantial amounts of military resources by air to Libya, from Syria, from Russia and from Belarus.’ Turning Libya into a base for major-power rivalries would complicate the country’s internal crisis Several other reports in mainstream media as well as intelligence sites confirm several flights of large Russian Air Force cargo aircraft from Khmeimim Air Base in Syria to Russia’s al-Khadim near Benghazi in eastern Libya in the last week of December. They speculate the planes were carrying military equipment. This week, Ukrainian intelligence sources who asked to remain anonymous and other analysts said several Russian ships were scheduled to dock in Tartus. They said that the roll on-roll off Sparta and Sparta II would be used to transport military equipment to Libya, though some would be transported back to Russia. The bolstering of Russia’s military presence in Libya threatens to perpetuate, if not aggravate, the conflict in that country. Russia has for years backed the eastern strongman General Khalifa Haftar of the Benghazi-based government in its protracted struggle with the United Nations-backed government in Tripoli. In December, Abdul Hamid Dabaiba, Prime Minister of the government of national unity in Tripoli, strongly objected to Russia reinforcing its Libyan bases. He said this was turning Libya into a base for major-power rivalries and would complicate the country’s internal crisis. It should also be noted that in terms of the peace agreements among rival Libyan parties, all foreign militaries should have left Libya long ago. The sudden collapse of the Assad regime raises questions about Russia’s ability to provide security support to its allies ‘The sudden collapse of the Assad regime also raises questions about Russia’s ability to continue providing military and security support to its allies,’ says Denys Reva, an Institute for Security Studies Researcher. ‘It seems that Russia might currently be overstretched and unable to spare additional resources.’ He says that if Russia were also to lose its access to Libya, that would undermine Moscow’s ability to appropriately support and supply its troops in Mali, Burkina Faso and Niger. ‘The Russians have definitely seen their circumstances degrade in Syria,’ says The Sentry’s analyst. ‘Even if one assumes that they stay in Latakia and Tartus, the environment has become more uncertain, less convenient and riskier. ‘By strengthening its footprint in Libya, Russia may be attempting to compensate for that deterioration in Syria – or at least part of it. If it didn’t do so, Moscow would be risking a fragilisation of its missions in Sub-Saharan Africa.’ For Africa, the net effect of Assad’s demise remains uncertain. A weakening of Russia’s military presence on the continent would arguably be positive, given its performance in the Sahel especially. In Mali, Niger and Burkina Faso, Russia is propping up military regimes that took power via coups, and is accused of gross abuses against civilians, without any visible improvement in curbing terrorism. For Libya, the likely consequences seem to be more unambiguously negative. By switching the focus of its military operations to Libya, Russia has acquired an even stronger incentive to entrench itself in that country and perpetuate the internal conflict, as Dabaiba warned.

Trends In Terrorism: What’s On The Horizon In 2025? – Analysis	By Colin P. Clarke (FPRI) -- Sitting down to write my annual assessment on trends in terrorism in early 2025, I am struggling more than usual, fresh off the horrors of an Islamic State (ISIS)-inspired terrorist attack in New Orleans that killed fourteen people and injured dozens more. It is always a challenge to look beyond the immediate, to take a step back and weigh myriad factors and variables that impact which trends may accelerate and which may disappear. It is impossible to know whether the New Orleans attack suggests a 'new wave' of ISIS-inspired attacks in the West and in the United States in particular. Rather, the attack is another data point that demonstrates what many in the counterterrorism community have been saying ad nauseum for years—the threat posed by ISIS is consistent, enduring, and likely to ebb and flow over time in response to geopolitical events and counterterrorism pressure. Still, the threat is enduring and will remain an uncomfortable truth for policymakers as they attempt to right-size the resources provided to counter-terrorism agencies with their agreed-upon level of risk tolerance. Predicting when and where terrorists will strike is among the most difficult tasks an intelligence analyst has. This requires assessing the combination of capabilities, intent, and operational environment, overlayed with public statements and propaganda of terrorist groups to understand their grievances and discern possible target selection. Terrorism does not always proceed in a linear fashion. In other words, sometimes what seem to be the most obvious or pressing threats fail to materialize, while others that appear to have faded reemerge again. Before the Hamas attacks of October 7, 2023, few counterterrorism analysts outside of Israel dedicated any bandwidth to analyzing the group. And before Hayat Tahrir al-Sham’s (HTS) December offensive that saw the group topple longtime dictator Bashar al-Assad and seize control of Syria, the organization was something of an afterthought, outside of a small circle of committed scholars and experts. As HTS looks to assume power in Syria, disaffected hardliners within the group, including jihadists belonging to the Turkestan Islamic Party and other Central Asian battalions, could seek to splinter off and continue their violent campaign. Both Syria and Afghanistan are now governed by terrorist groups (HTS is formally designated as a foreign terrorist organization by the United States, while the Taliban is not, although elements of the Taliban are designated through their affiliation with the Haqqani Network). So, while Hamas and HTS were mostly under the radar, the group that many were most concerned about—Islamic State Khorasan, or ISIS-K—also launched several high-profile attacks (Iran in January 2024 and Russia in March 2024) while a flurry of plots was disrupted, including a plan to attack a Taylor Swift concert in Vienna, Austria over the summer. The perpetrators in the Swift plot were extremely young, reflecting another trend—youth radicalization—that remains a constant challenge for counterterrorism authorities. ISIS attacks in Dagestan and Oman showed the group’s geographic expanse, a trend likely to continue in the coming year as it seeks to resurge from Syria to Somalia. The group inspired a plot to attack the United States on Election Day in November. Nasir Ahmad Tawhedi was arrested by the FBI before he was able to put his plan into action, in which he intended to murder civilians with AK-47 rifles. The ISIS-K presence in Afghanistan, which the Taliban has failed to attenuate, will continue to destabilize South Asia, where militant groups including Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan and the Baluchistan Liberation Army also remain growing threats to monitor. The former has directly threatened the government in Islamabad while the latter continues to target Chinese nationals and disrupt security along Beijing’s signature foreign policy initiative, the Belt and Road infrastructure project. Sub-Saharan Africa, especially the Sahel region, will continue to be a hotbed of terrorism, as failed states and ungoverned spaces provide sanctuary to a range of jihadist groups associated with both al-Qaeda and the Islamic State. Jama’at Nasr al-Islam wal-Muslimin operates with near impunity in Western Africa, even conducting a massive attack last year that killed more than 600 people in Burkina Faso. The security situation continues to deteriorate as jihadist groups push out toward coastal West Africa, threatening previously stable countries like Ghana and expanding their reach from Cameroon to Nigeria. Along with Burkina Faso, Niger and Mali have employed private military contractors from Russia’s Wagner Group (now rebranded as Africa Corps) to help with coup-proofing, and the mercenaries have behaved predictably, engineering a scorched earth counterinsurgency approach that has exacerbated the terrorist threat, rather than mollifying it. Elsewhere in Africa, both al-Shabaab and ISIS threaten Somalia and the greater Horn of Africa, while the Islamic State’s presence has ebbed and flowed in Mozambique and the Democratic Republic of Congo, among other states in the region. The incessant reverberations of October 7th and the collapse of the Assad regime mean that geopolitical events in the Middle East will still be a significant driver of terrorism this year. Lebanese Hezbollah has been attenuated to a degree many could not have imagined just one year ago. Israel’s devastating pager and walkie-talkie attack in September left the group reeling, killing more than a dozen and injuring thousands more. As the centerpiece of a relentless military campaign in Lebanon, the Israel Defense Forces assassinated Hezbollah Secretary General Hassan Nasrallah in September. While Hezbollah has no doubt been severely degraded, the group remains dangerous and could seek to revert to its roots as a purely terrorist organization. The last time Israel killed a Hezbollah leader, as occurred with Abbas al-Musawi in 1992, the group responded by launching bombing attacks against Israeli targets in Buenos Aires, Argentina. Its global network remains intact, and in the past, it has demonstrated reach with attacks in Panama, Saudi Arabia, and Bulgaria and plots disrupted in Cyprus, Egypt, and Singapore. Hezbollah could look to strike US and/or Israeli interests, including embassies, in countries throughout Latin America, Africa, or elsewhere based on perceived security vulnerabilities. Like Hezbollah, Hamas has also been crippled. Israel’s scorched earth approach in Gaza and the resulting humanitarian catastrophe—45,000 Palestinians have been killed so far—will make it easier for Hamas to recruit the next generation of militants. Hamas will also look to spread its influence in the West Bank. But the group’s capabilities will be limited for the foreseeable future. Still, even if Hamas remains limited in Gaza, the conflict itself has spilled across borders and catalyzed protests, demonstrations, and acts of violence abroad, including in Europe, North America, and Australia. If Hamas decided to do so, it could likely leverage pro-Palestinian sentiment and anti-Israeli grievances to inspire attacks in the West among its supporters or these individuals could take action on their own. This could take many forms, including attacks or plots to attack Israeli embassies or consulates, as occurred in Serbia in June and almost occurred against the Israeli Consulate in New York City in December. Following the attacks of October 7th, there has been a massive spike in both Islamophobia and anti-Semitism globally, with spillover impacting many Western countries. Of all the proxies belonging to Iran’s so-called 'Axis of Resistance,' the Houthis in Yemen may be the most difficult to deter. The United States, United Kingdom, and Israel have all taken turns bombing Houthi positions in an effort to blunt the group’s ability to launch attacks and disrupt commercial shipping in the Red Sea. Between the Houthis, which the Trump administration will seek to redesignate as a foreign terrorist organization, and an array of Iraqi Shia militia groups, including Kataib Hezbollah and Harakat al-Nujaba, elements of the Axis present an omnipresent threat in the Middle East. Upon scanning the horizon, looking ahead it seems plausible that a terrorist group will seek to command the spotlight through a spectacular attack, which could feature the use of an emerging technology like drones, 3-D printing, or involve the use of a weapon of mass destruction. The more lethal or high-profile an attack, the more prestige it garners, and the more mileage an individual or group can get out of propaganda geared toward supporters, followers, and potential new recruits. There is also a growing trend in cooperation between terrorist groups, including the case of the Houthis working with al-Shabaab in Somalia, and al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula expanding cooperation with the Houthis. There is also a state sponsorship element present, with both Russia and China assisting the Houthis with targeting data and weapons, respectively. With President-elect Donald Trump taking office in just a few weeks, there are a host of other terrorism-related issues to consider. The Trump administration could look to designate one of the leading Mexican cartels—the Sinaloa Cartel or Los Zetas—as a foreign terrorist organization, a move which would facilitate more kinetic action against drug traffickers south of the border. As part of its border security policies, the Trump team will be looking to severely curb the flow of fentanyl into the United States, which is facilitated by individuals in China who work hand in glove with criminal organizations in Mexico. On the domestic terrorism front, Trump has discussed the possibility of pardoning some of the January 6thinsurrectionists, a move that 'could trigger a renaissance for militant extremists, sending them an unprecedented message of protection and support,' according to a recent article in ProPublica. 2025 could bring a spike in far-left extremism from those groups, networks, and individuals who see Trump’s presidency as existential. This includes violent anarchists and the most extreme members of Antifa, in addition to single-issue terrorists motivated by a range of issues, including the environment, animal welfare, and access to abortion. With the assassination of a healthcare CEO by a lone actor late last year—and the seeming groundswell of support enjoyed by the attacker—it is not inconceivable that a palpable anti-capitalist streak motivates a copycat action. The attacker was also apparently impressed by the writings of Ted Kaczynski, the Unabomber, and what his manifesto had to say about the creeping ubiquity of technology, an aversion shared by neo-Luddites and so-called technophobes who have attacked 5G cell towers and are pushing back against the encroachment of artificial intelligence. Far-right domestic extremism also looms large, especially when considering the polarization and hyper-partisanship infecting US domestic politics. Moreover, with the immigration debate likely to heat up even further, it is not unreasonable to foresee animosity between immigrant communities and those opposed to their presence. In August 2019, a white supremacist walked into an El Paso Walmart and killed twenty-three people because of his hatred of Mexicans and his obsession with the Great Replacement Theory, a conspiracy positing that there is an ongoing replacement of the native-born white population in the United States, primarily orchestrated by a nefarious cabal of Jews and political elites. Some far-right extremists, particularly racially and ethnically motivated violent extremists, could be emboldened by careless mainstream violent political rhetoric. In both 2024 and 2025, the years have begun with high-profile terrorist attacks committed by ISIS. The trends indicate another concerning year, with a complex array of threat actors and advanced capabilities. The ongoing war between Russia and Ukraine, Israel’s military campaign in the Middle East, and a rising China all demand great power attention. Yet, as the Hamas attack of October 7, 2023 and the takeover of Syria by HTS demonstrated, violent non-state actors, especially terrorist groups, still play an outsized role in geopolitics. Expect this year to be no different. The United States and its allies face no shortage of challenges, compounded by a change in administrations, with no time for Trump to ease back into the job. On the contrary, a bevy of 'Day One' problems await his arrival. About the author: Colin P.

Jimmy Carter: Life And Legacy Of The 39th US President – Analysis	The death of Jimmy Carter on December 29, 2024, marked the passing of the 39th President of the United States, who served from 1977 to 1981 during a pivotal period in the mid-Cold War and a time of societal changes in America. Carter was the only U.S. president to reach the age of 100 and the longest-living former president, with a remarkable 44 years of post-presidency. Although he served only one term, his tenure was marked by significant domestic and foreign policy events and processes that he directly or indirectly shaped. This ensures Carter’s place as an important figure in the history of the U.S. and the world. Moreover, his tireless post-presidency work—founding the Carter Center in 1982 to promote human rights, reduce suffering, and advance peace worldwide—cemented his legacy. For his post-presidency efforts, Carter was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2002. Considering his modest beginnings as the son of a rural working-class family in the American South, few could have predicted Carter’s extraordinary life achievements. Childhood and Youth James Earl Carter Jr., officially known as Jimmy Carter, was born on October 1, 1924, in Plains, a small town in rural Georgia in the southeastern United States. He was the oldest of four children born to farmer James Earl Carter Sr. and nurse Lillian Gordy Carter. Raised in modest circumstances, Carter was exposed from an early age to the social injustices of the American South: racial segregation and the inequalities between the rich and the poor. Carter’s childhood was steeped in life on the family peanut farm. Growing up in a hardworking environment among ordinary Americans shaped his strong work ethic and sensitivity to the struggles of everyday people. In addition to pursuing his education, Carter assisted his parents on the farm. His mother encouraged his education, while his conservative father emphasized discipline and responsibility. Although racial barriers were deeply entrenched in Georgia society, Carter’s family rose above white-black divisions. His mother was known for providing medical care to Black families and openly expressed sympathy for the fight for equality. Although his father supported segregation, he allowed young Jimmy to interact with Black children. These experiences with racial segregation would later inspire Carter to reflect on human rights and justice. Carter attended local schools in Plains, where he excelled academically, particularly in history and science. His dedication to learning and humility made him a model student. After finishing high school, he applied to the U.S. Naval Academy in Annapolis, Maryland, where he was accepted in 1943. The academy was rigorous, but Carter quickly adapted. He graduated in 1946 as one of the top students. During his studies, he developed an interest in engineering and technology. While at Annapolis, he met Rosalynn Smith, his future wife, also from Plains, who would play a key role in his political career. Upon graduation, Carter began his service in the U.S. Navy, working on nuclear energy development for submarines under Admiral Hyman Rickover’s leadership. Although he seemed destined for a bright future in naval science, his father’s sudden death in 1953 forced Carter to leave the Navy and take over the family peanut farm in Plains. Entry into Politics Carter inherited a farm saddled with debt. Despite his naval expertise, transitioning to agriculture was challenging, but he and his wife managed to succeed. Despite financial struggles, droughts, and inexperience, the Carters transformed the family business into a thriving enterprise by the 1950s. Living in Georgia, a state fraught with racial tensions, pushed Carter into an unexpected political career. As a dedicated member of the Democratic Party, he advocated for the abolition of racial segregation, the fight against corruption, and electoral reform. These progressive views led to his election to the Georgia Senate in 1962, where he was re-elected two years later. Such positions were unusual for a white Southern Democrat, but voters recognized his commitment. Although he ran for governor of Georgia in 1966, he lost. Disheartened by the defeat, Carter found solace in Christianity. He became an even stronger proponent of Christian values, opposing racial segregation and social inequality while championing justice. Governor of Georgia and Presidential Campaign In 1970, Carter won the gubernatorial race and served as governor of Georgia from 1971 to 1975. Although he was initially reserved on segregation during his campaign, he declared it a thing of the past upon taking office. He appointed women and African Americans to government positions and introduced numerous reforms. Carter modernized the state administration, reduced bureaucracy, and increased efficiency, focusing on education and environmental protection. After completing his governorship, Carter made a bold decision to run for president. Though a radical move, he believed he had the necessary skills—and he was right. Successfully balancing progressive ideas with pragmatic solutions, he appealed to a broad base of voters. Moreover, Americans were weary of familiar faces. The Watergate scandal exposed the corruption of Washington’s political elite. President Richard Nixon resigned in 1974 due to illegal wiretapping, and public trust in politicians was at a historic low. Carter, as a young, untainted, and moral politician from the South, was a refreshing contrast to the worn-out Washington establishment. During his campaign, he adopted a grassroots approach, visiting nearly every state and engaging directly with voters. Though an outsider to the establishment, his messages of trust, integrity, and the return of ethics to politics won over the electorate. In November 1976, with Walter Mondale as his vice-presidential candidate, he narrowly defeated Republican President Gerald Ford. Carter became the first Southern president since the Civil War openly opposed to racial segregation. Presidency Jimmy Carter’s tenure as the 39th President of the United States was characterized by ambitious domestic reforms, foreign policy successes and setbacks, and conflicts with Congress and the public. Adopting an informal style of dress and speech, he frequently held press conferences and reduced the pomp of the Oval Office. Early in his term, he introduced a series of ambitious programs for healthcare, education, administrative, and economic reform. However, most of these proposals faced opposition in Congress, despite the Democratic Party holding a majority in both the House and the Senate. At first glance, such resistance seems paradoxical, but it can be understood in the context of the time. Congress, after the Vietnam War and Nixon’s Watergate scandal, had become highly skeptical of presidents and often blocked their legislation. In the U.S., a president without Congress can achieve little. Carter grew frustrated and disappointed by the betrayal of his party colleagues, whom he publicly criticized. High hopes and unmet expectations due to unimplemented reforms had already lowered his approval ratings by 1978. In hindsight, it can be argued that Democratic congressmen shot themselves in the foot, as Republican Ronald Reagan came to power in 1981, followed later by George H. W. Bush. Carter’s reputation was further damaged by scandals involving members of his administration, such as accusations that his brother was a lobbyist for Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi—allegations later proven false. Domestic Policy Carter inherited an economy plagued by inflation, stagnant economic growth, and rising unemployment: a state of stagflation. Inflation rose from 6% in 1976 to over 12% by 1980, unemployment remained high at 7.5%, and volatile interest rates reached a staggering 20% during 1980. The 1979 oil crisis, following the Iranian Revolution, further worsened the economic situation, leading to soaring energy prices and growing public dissatisfaction. Business leaders and the general public blamed Carter for the nation's economic woes. However, it was Congress, not the president, that bore the blame. Distrusting major oil corporations, Carter established the Department of Energy in 1977 and proposed a National Energy Plan that included a tax on oil, conservation measures, and the use of alternative energy sources. The Senate rejected the proposal. Carter also founded the Department of Education. Foreign Policy Human rights were at the heart of Jimmy Carter’s foreign policy. His administration openly criticized authoritarian regimes in Latin America, Africa, and Asia for human rights violations, even when these regimes were U.S. allies. While the human rights-first policy earned praise from international activists, it caused tensions with some traditional U.S. allies. In 1977, Carter signed treaties with Panama to transfer control of the Panama Canal to Panama by 1999 while guaranteeing the canal’s neutrality. One of Carter's most significant foreign policy achievements was the 1979 peace agreement between Egypt and Israel, known as the Camp David Accords. Carter personally mediated between Egyptian President Anwar Sadat and Israeli Prime Minister Menachem Begin, organizing peace talks at the presidential retreat of Camp David. The agreements resulted in formal peace between the two countries and Israel’s withdrawal from the Sinai Peninsula. On January 1, 1979, Carter established full diplomatic relations between the U.S. and China while simultaneously severing official ties with Taiwan—a recognition of reality. For much of his presidency, Carter sought to improve relations with the Soviet Union. In Vienna, in June 1979, he and Soviet leader Leonid Brezhnev signed the Strategic Arms Limitation Treaty (SALT II). However, the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan in late 1979 ended these efforts. In January 1980, Carter withdrew SALT II from Senate ratification. In response to the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, Carter introduced the Carter Doctrine in January 1980: imposing sanctions on the Soviet Union (a grain export ban), boycotting the 1980 Moscow Olympics, and increasing military and CIA spending (Operation Cyclone). One of the most challenging moments of Carter’s presidency was the Iran hostage crisis. Following the 1979 Islamic Revolution, Iranian students seized the U.S. embassy in Tehran and took 52 American citizens hostage, later supported by the Iranian Shia authorities led by Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini. The crisis lasted 444 days, and Carter's inability to swiftly resolve the situation severely damaged his political reputation. A military operation to free the hostages, known as Operation Eagle Claw, ended in failure. Ultimately, the Iran hostage crisis marked the end of Carter’s administration. Electoral Defeat and Post-Presidency In 1980, Carter faced a challenge within his own Democratic Party when Senator Ted Kennedy attempted to contest his nomination for a second term. Although Carter secured the Democratic nomination, he faced an ambitious Republican challenger, Ronald Reagan, in the presidential race. Carter lost decisively, with Reagan winning 489 electoral votes to Carter’s 49. However, Carter did not retire from politics in January 1981. On the contrary, he became more active as a global citizen. In 1982, he founded the Carter Center in Atlanta, focusing on humanitarian work, promoting peace, human rights, education, and combating disease. Carter became renowned for his mediation efforts in international crises, helping resolve conflicts in Kenya, Sierra Leone, the Holy Land, and Bosnia and Herzegovina. In the 1990s, he played a role in reducing tensions between the U.S. and North Korea. He also acted as a diplomat in resolving various conflicts in Panama, Nicaragua, Ethiopia, and Haiti. For his efforts, he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2002. Carter authored 32 books outlining his vision for a fairer world. Carter and Biden’s Friendship 'America and the world, in my opinion, have lost an extraordinary leader… He was a statesman and humanitarian. And Jill (Biden’s wife, editor's note) and I have lost a dear friend,' said Joe Biden hours after Carter’s death. Biden delivered a eulogy at Carter’s funeral on January 9, where their decades-long friendship was once again evident. Carter had previously requested that Biden deliver his eulogy. In his speech, Biden stated that his friendship with Carter taught him 'that strength of character transcends titles or power we possess. It’s the strength of understanding that everyone must be treated with dignity and respect. That everyone—and I mean absolutely everyone—deserves a fair shot. Not a guarantee, but a chance.' The friendship between the two politicians began when Biden, a young senator from Delaware, became the first senator to endorse Carter’s outsider candidacy for the White House in 1976. At the time, Biden was serving his first term in the Senate and had not yet become the powerful figure he would later become. Instead of aligning with influential Democratic colleagues in the Senate, he chose to support Carter and campaigned for him across the U.S. during the primaries. The two politicians shared many similarities. Both were moderate on fiscal and social issues and opponents of racial segregation. Both openly spoke about their faith—Biden as a Roman Catholic and Carter as an evangelical Baptist. Despite occasional disagreements, Biden supported Carter during the 1980 Democratic primaries against Senator Ted Kennedy. Carter supported Biden in his bids for the presidency in 1988 and 2008, albeit not very publicly. When Biden ran for president a third time in 2019, Carter remarked, 'I hope there’s an age limit. If I were 15 years younger, I don’t think I could handle the duties I had while I was president.' Nevertheless, he supported Biden at the 2020 Democratic National Convention (DNC). Both Carter and Biden endured four challenging years in the Oval Office before being forced to leave in ways they did not desire. Carter suffered a heavy defeat to Ronald Reagan, while Biden had to forego reelection due to poor health. Both lost to above-average Republican candidates—Reagan and Donald Trump. However, it is undeniable that Carter will have a better place in history as a president due to his 44 years of post-presidency, during which he enhanced his reputation. As a global citizen, Carter promoted peace and democracy worldwide through the Carter Center in over 100 elections across 40 countries. Biden will not have such a post-presidency due to his advanced age. Carter’s legacy is noble, though difficult to achieve in the harsh realities of 21st-century global politics.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWdb7qD8VV9geLsp7eEW8h66	2025-01-12T16:48:38-08:00	
Reality Of Kuala Lumpur-Singapore Interdependence – Analysis	The Annual Retreat between Singapore and Malaysia and the visit by Prime Minister Lawrence Wong marked the symbolization of strategic realization of mutual importance. For Lawrence, it is critical to establish a continuation of rapport and momentum with elevation of personal ties and trust and camaraderie at the highest level with his counterpart. It is vital for Singapore to also tap into Malaysia's model for ASEAN direction this year, especially where Singapore is also trying to establish its own pragmatic version of its foreign policy and in its quest to have its own friendshoring efforts and the tricky navigation in dealing with both China and the important ally of the US. This is also strategic for Lawrence to establish his own set of direction and leadership style as a message to both Malaysia and the region, and using this retreat as the platform in building future resilience and understanding of the direction and intent of the top Singaporean leadership. Singapore is also navigating a new set of geopolitical challenges, and thus trying to increase fallback on both the traditional reliance on the West and also at the same time increasing dependence on alternative powers including the entity of ASEAN.This is where the role of Malaysia in shaping ASEAN in getting the needed economic and political returns to Singapore is capitalised on. In Singapore's efforts to enhance its economic dependence and fallback reshoring options, Singapore does not want to be seen as too obvious in the approach to de risk from possible retaliations or new approaches by China, and by increasing dependence and mutual interdependence with Malaysia, it serves as the needed and closest source of economic and food and energy assurance. Although key sensitive and critical issues between both states still remain unresolved and are being handled with care, both realise that the need to transcend this systemic barrier is stronger and that this should not jeapordise the vast economic and geopolitical returns to both nations if strategic common areas of benefits are to be jointly developed. Common Threats and Interdependent Geopolitical Settings The visit and the Annual Retreat set the path to strengthen future ties and set the benchmark and platform in orienting new visions and pathways of partnerships, also as the symbol that the new leadership under Lawrence is different from the past legacy of his predecessor. In the efforts to present a new independent direction of Singapore, and increasing its resilience, and sees Malaysia as the most critical regional player and the inevitable geographical neighbour. Singapore's food security and supply chain interests at least in the next short term timeline will still be at the dependence of Malaysia, and a new set of ties with Malaysia that is escaping from past legacies and traps will be crucial. Thus, Malaysia is seen as vital to be leveraged in different policy modes, and this is also important to Lawrence in shaping domestic trust and support. Lawrence realises that the new perception, demands and trust among the domestic audience have changed with past controversies plaguing the governance and for him to set a new governance direction, Malaysia plays a central role in ensuring continuous prosperity and security wellbeing. Challenges remain, in the form of continuous security dilemma between both powers, and hard security wariness over bitter and contentious past disputes and issues However, new shared threats and challenges in the region from the continuing potential flare ups in South China Sea and the Taiwan Strait and where both shared the same external security dilemma of maritime threats and big power rivalry, both will want to consolidate more effective deterrence measures and address common gaps. Existing defence mechanisms and ventures including the Five Powers Defence Arrangements (FPDA) are seen as inadequate in providing the tangible and realistic common defence assurances and framework in dealing with the fluidity of the nature of return of traditional threats settings. In the realm of non traditional threats and potential returns in areas of new geopolitical facets, Malaysia's advantage in new fields including rare earths, semiconductor, digital economy and security upperhand in geographical topography to work more closely together. Knowing that US has enjoyed trade surplus with Singapore and thus having a new hope of positive enhancement of ties under Trump 2.0, having closer ties with Malaysia is needed for better utilization of common frameworks with the US in targeting the same sectors of joint interests both in the high value chain development and the values based approach, and as an alternative and de-risking approach from China led initiatives. The United States has a trade surplus with Singapore, and in 2022, the U.S. had a trade surplus of USD $38.3 billion with Singapore. In 2023, the U.S.-Singapore services trade totaled over $49 billion. U.S. services exports to Singapore hit an all-time high of $37 billion in 2023. The U.S. has a large presence in Singapore, with American companies supporting around 215,000 American jobs. In 2022, U.S. foreign direct investment (FDI) in Singapore was US$309.4 billion, which is more than in Mainland China, Japan, and South Korea combined. Although Singapore is well poised to be rest assured in economic and investment assurances from Washington, its strategic pragmatism and realisation of its own geographical limitations propelled it to venture into the need to secure its near border and neighbouring realities and scope of entanglement. ASEAN can be used as a softener to Singapore's approach in securing its interests, in which ASEAN is used as the more collective voice and platform in reflecting and voicing Singapore's concerns for regional security and also the actions by external powers including China. Hence for Singapore, the platform of Malaysia and ASEAN can be seen as necessary in serving as an added fallback option, where Singapore also does not want to be seen as being too aggressive in taking a direct strong response to China and others in expressing concerns on regional power postures. For Singapore, the Special Economic Zone will be beneficial in breaking away from its own geographical limitations and barriers, where the extended land and economic zones in Johor will enable Singaporean firms to use that as a new hub for its expansion into the region and the world. It serves as a needed hub for global expansion and as a consolidation of its status as the premier shipping hub and in securing its supply chain resilience. This is also vital for Singapore to increase its food, energy and supply chain security in getting the needed assurances for its long term security in areas of low politics, and this Special Zone is used as a trust building platform for better overall ties between both nations. As Singapore is reaching its economic maturity and saturation point, it is vital for it to continue to seek for the needed near shore capacity in diversifying its core areas and to provide for the continuous need to feed its increasing demands of its domestic audience, and in preparing for a greying nation and the new challenges of the inter-generational and demographic challenges. In accommodating the new political landscape and demand, Lawrence realizes that conventional economic and socio economic policies will need new revisions and tweaks, in both facing the renewed external headwinds and uncertainties and in facing the changing domestic demographic and political demands and expectations, away from the Lee era. This will be used as a platform to foster greater trust and confidence level and as a confidence building measure in using this as transcending the previous structural bilateral issues. By using low politics and increasing connectivity, people-to-people ties, the increased speed and ease of doing business, investments, and easier cross-border facilitations, both nations can use this means as the transcending factor in dealing with the current thorns and issues in bilateral relations. An Investment and Insurance for the Future Both Malaysia and Singapore remain each other's second-largest trading partners, with bilateral trade amounting toUSD78.59 billion (RM360.12 billion) from January to November 2024, a 6.7% increase over the same period in 2023. This year also marks 60 years of diplomatic ties. For Malaysia, this zone can be capitalised to tap into Singapore's entrenched status as the premier shipping hub and its status as the premier financial and services centre. Knowing that Malaysia cannot do this alone or package this investment hub using Malaysia's advantages and offerings alone, tagging Singapore as a complete package will offer more benefits and attractions to foreign investors by using Singapore's complementary offerings and branding in this regard. With more than 1000 similar economic and investment zones in ASEAN, this Johor-Singapore Special Economic Zone will need to stand out in capturing the needed unique factor by factoring in the existing status of Singapore and also the vast new potential of Johor and Malaysia and the geographical card. This also includes the potential and new openings of the critical sectors and technologies where both nations are keen to develop in either joint capacities or within their own national strategic developments. These include areas of critical minerals, new energy transition, Artificial Intelligence, digital economy and green economy and services and new financial models. This special zone also serves as a needed alternative and fallback option for Malaysia as an exit gateway for the decentralization of its economic dependence on traditional external economic powers including China, and it serves as a message that this model of effective neighbouring economic partnership can be the salvation and as a parallel new investment and economic passageway without the baggage of external factors that might influence domestic and foreign policy considerations and political fallout. Malaysia also needs the critical and strategic high skilled labour, talents, knowledge creation, transfer of technologies and the needed capital in line with the economic transition and energy transition of the country and in parallel of the momentum over the years in positioning Malaysia as the growing regional and global hub for key sectors including on digital transformation, high technology hubs and forward advancement platforms for critical sectors on key minerals, semiconductors and others. By having this renewed initiative, it is hoped to create more spillover impact and getting the needed injection of external inflow of the needed capacities and also in getting the local settings in producing the needed skilled and high skilled talents and human capital, and in incentivising local SMEs as well as local workforce, and in raising income levels and in improving social mobility and holistic living status. This zone also must be streamlined and connected to the existing economic zones and parks and in line with the combined impact of the National Semiconductor Strategy and the New Industrial Masterplan. In the end, both nations realise the inevitable fact that both cannot run away from their geographical and neighbouring factual reality, and that both realise that if one is in trouble or faces renewed threat settings, it will in actual fact cause direct and indirect effects on the other, whether in economic or security threats. As such, as much as both will want to prioritise each national interests and advantages, both realise that one's future resilience, interests and security capacity and wellbeing also predominantly depend on the other, and naturally will not want the other to suffer instability, chaos or facing security threats that will have interlinked domino effects.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWdb7qD8VV9geCsAGWefyARB	2025-01-12T16:44:19-08:00	
Removing Zero From Iran’s National Currency: Economic Stability O...	Under the corrupt rule of the mullahs, Iran’s economy is facing deep, complex, and worsening challenges, including chronic inflation and the sharp devaluation of the rial to the rising growth of liquidity. These factors have severely weakened the national currency and reduced the purchasing power of the people. In such circumstances, the government’s proposal to remove zeros from the national currency, which is celebrated by the administration, raises this question: Can this policy be an effective solution to the economic crisis, or is it merely a superficial, hollow action and deceptive propaganda? The Importance of National Currency in the Economy In the complex world of modern economies, currency is recognized as a symbol of stability and trust in financial systems. When the value of a national currency declines due to overwhelming inflation and economic instability, governments seek solutions to restore confidence and stability to their monetary unit. The policy of removing zeros from the national currency is one such solution that has been employed by various countries throughout history. One of the main reasons for implementing the policy of removing zeros is to control inflation and restore monetary stability. High inflation often leads to an abnormal increase in monetary figures, making their management in transactions and accounting challenging. This situation not only reduces economic efficiency but also significantly increases the costs of printing and managing banknotes. Removing zeros in such circumstances simplifies and clarifies the monetary system, thereby improving financial efficiency. Enhancing public trust and creating a positive psychological impact are also among the motivations for implementing this policy. Reducing the number of zeros in the monetary unit can foster a sense of economic improvement among the public. This policy is often perceived as a symbolic act demonstrating the government’s commitment to economic reform. Another advantage of this policy is the enhancement of the international credibility of the national currency. In countries experiencing severe devaluation of their currency and extreme exchange rate volatility, removing zeros can improve the standing of the national currency in international trade and foreign investment. This action portrays a positive image of the economic system and facilitates commercial processes. In countries where continuous inflation has severely reduced the value of the national currency, the increase in the number of zeros on banknotes not only complicates daily transactions but also undermines public trust in the currency. In such situations, removing zeros can be an effective measure to restore stability and simplify the monetary system. The experiences of countries such as Turkey, Brazil, Russia, and Argentina show that the removal of zeros will only succeed if accompanied by structural reforms and sustainable economic policies. In cases where high inflation and currency volatility remain uncontrolled, this policy can quickly become ineffective and even create new problems. The State of Iran’s Economy and Its Challenges Ahead Morteza Afaghah, a monetary and banking expert, states about the removal of zeros from the national currency:'With such superficial and legal measures, inflation cannot be controlled. Iran’s inflation stems from economic, social, and cultural structures, and it is so deep that even economic measures, such as reducing liquidity levels in recent years, have not managed to control it.' On January 4, Kabna News website wrote: 'The most important precondition for the success of removing zeros is the stable control of the inflation rate. In circumstances where prices are constantly rising, the removal of zeros will only have a short-term effect.' What is certain is that Iran’s economy is facing high inflation rates, continuous liquidity growth, and a lack of economic stability. The excessive printing of unsupported banknotes is a betrayal of the national currency’s strength and a systematic theft of people’s assets by the regime. In such circumstances, the removal of zeros from the national currency might have a psychological and temporary soothing effect in the short term, supported by regime propaganda and deceptive policies, but it will not have real and lasting impacts. As mentioned, controlling inflation, reducing liquidity growth, and making fundamental budgetary changes are among the essential prerequisites for the success of this policy—conditions that seem unachievable in an occupied Iran under a repressive and warmongering government. Ironically, removing zeros from Iran’s national currency could lead to new problems for the Iranian people, further emptying their pockets for the regime’s looting purposes.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWdb7qD8VV9geD2wDmXW19XJ	2025-01-12T16:41:24-08:00	
India, Positioned To Manage A Trump World – OpEd	2024 was billed as the year of elections, and voters in India — the world’s largest democracy — and the United States — the world’s richest — certainly made their feelings clear. Dissatisfaction over jobs and inequality weakened Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s electoral mandate, and disillusionment with inflation and the state of politics saw the United States turn back to Donald Trump. Indian officials are now getting their playbook ready to deal with Trump 2.0, drawing confidence from the two leaders’ round one bonhomie. The place to start will be to draw out the lessons from the electoral shock. Prime Minister Modi and his Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) were widely expected to romp to a commanding majority of 400 seats, granting him an even bigger mandate for his vision of India as a majoritarian Hindu state. Instead, the electorate bowled a googly and sent the BJP backwards. With the loss of 63 seats and his majority in the Lok Sabha parliament, Modi was forced into coalition government for the first time in his prime ministerial career. As Robin Jeffrey writes in this week’s lead article, the key reason for the surprise result was that India’s ‘enviable economy story … has not produced the millions of new jobs that young voters are desperately searching for’ — those offering ‘predictable wages in profitable activities’. While ‘service industries (especially IT), domestic construction, real estate and finance’ are flourishing, these sectors employ only a tiny fraction of India’s workers. Most of the population remains stuck in low-productivity agricultural work, if they have jobs at all. The government has signalled that it understands the frustration of disenchanted workers. Notably, it has introduced ‘employment-linked incentives’, targeted at new entrants into the workforce and the manufacturing sector, and created the ‘Prime Minister’s Internship Scheme’ for young people not in full-time study or employment. But ad-hoc schemes such as these will not address the deeper structural issues in the Indian economy. Those advocating for a focus on high-skilled services and technology to propel India’s growth overlook the fact that unemployment has become as much a social issue as an economic one. The imperative is for India to devise an economic strategy that makes use of its comparative advantage of a vast, young workforce. The government has ambitions to build a ‘self-reliant India’, but India’s economy is and will continue to be dependent on external trade, chiefly with China and the United States. As Jeffrey points out, ‘[m]ost Indian exports are US-bound’ and ‘[m]ost of its imports — manufactured goods, components, chemicals and pharmaceutical ingredients — come from China’. The question now is what consequences Trump’s return will have for India’s strategic environment. Trump appears determined to continue his ‘America First’ policy, prioritising bilateral agreements over multilateral institutions and taking a deals-based approach to international relationships. For India, there is some appeal in Trump’s transactionalism. Both governments define China as their principal strategic threat and see a convergence of interests in countering Beijing’s rise. Under Trump and Biden, India’s role as a counterweight to China grew. The two countries deepened military ties by signing interoperability agreements such as the Communications Compatibility and Security Agreement and the Security of Supply Arrangement. With the US likely to strengthen this security-led deals-based framework under Trump 2.0, India will become an even more important partner. As Pratnashree Basu wrote earlier in East Asia Forum, ‘India has become central to US defence and strategic thinking in the Indo-Pacific’ due to its ‘geographic position in the Indian Ocean and growing military and economic capabilities’. And there’s a political element, too. Jeffrey notes that the BJP ‘accused the Biden administration of carrying out 'a deep state agenda' to undermine India’s success story’. Such accusations are less likely under a Trump administration that many expect will go easier on democratic backsliding than a Harris administration might have done. Yet navigating the relationship will not be plain sailing. Any benefits that Trump might provide for Indian domestic politics and security ties is likely to be undermined by the threat he poses to the international economic environment. India’s population is large but not wealthy, meaning that capital investments and demand for its products and services must come at least in part from foreign markets. Maintaining a stable rules-based trading system is still a core interest for India so that it can accelerate its growth trajectory by playing a bigger role in global value and production chains. Trump has already promised 60 per cent tariffs on China and 10 per cent on imports from the rest of the world. His policies threaten to destabilise the international trading regime and depress global incomes — the last thing India needs at this stage of its economic development. What’s more, with the US running a sizable trade deficit against India and Trump having labelled the country as a ‘very big abuser’ of tariffs, India may well find itself in the firing line. The temptation will be to seek a bilateral deal. Jeffrey contends that the ‘Modi government hopes Trump will make problems go away by granting waivers where needed’. This is a temptation that it would be wise to resist. Trump is likely to demand India to commit to a stronger Western-aligned security posture, which risks overextension of India’s capacity and would undermine its prized foreign policy philosophy of strategic autonomy and non-alignment. The fact that US-India strategic convergence is founded on mutual concerns about China is also a risk. In his first term, Trump sought a managed trade deal with China. Though it failed to deliver on his aims, he may again seek a bilateral ‘G2’ style agreement. Washington and Beijing finding a way to manage their conflict would diminish the need for New Delhi as a counterweight, undermining the main ballast of US-India alignment. Countries in Asia have shown that middle powers can come together to advance their interests independently of the United States, most notably through their initiatives in negotiating RCEP (despite India’s in the end walking away from the agreement) and finalising the CPTPP after Trump pulled out of the TPP in 2017. A framework now exists in East Asia to coordinate on Trump through RCEP, the world’s largest free-trade agreement — which membership of and participation in remains open to India. RCEP is an avenue for India to engage in the defence of the rules-based trading order, consistent with the pursuit of its urgent economic agenda. In an increasingly economically fragmented world, swing powers like India have the sway to play a more influential role. It may not have the clout to determine global issues by itself, but no global issue can be easily solved without India’s heft. With the advent of a second Trump presidency, India is well positioned to use its growing leverage to defend the global order that made the Asia–Pacific a stable and prosperous region and realise its ambition for a genuinely multipolar order.

The Politics Of The Fourteenth Amendment – OpEd	By Wanjiru Njoya In the run-up to the inauguration of Donald J. Trump as 47th president of the United States, political activists, frustrated by the fact that Kamala Harris lost the election, have attempted to revive the argument that the Fourteenth Amendment precludes Trump from taking office. They rely on a decision of the Colorado Supreme Court concerning the events of January 6, 2021, where the court stated that, 'the [Colorado District] court found by clear and convincing evidence that President Trump engaged in insurrection as those terms are used in Section Three [of the Fourteenth Amendment].' The Colorado Supreme Court ruled that: The district court did not abuse its discretion in admitting portions of Congress’s January 6 Report into evidence at trial. The district court did not err in concluding that the events at the US Capitol on January 6, 2021, constituted an 'insurrection.' The district court did not err in concluding that President Trump 'engaged in' that insurrection through his personal actions. President Trump’s speech inciting the crowd that breached the US Capitol on January 6, 2021, was not protected by the First Amendment. Despite the Colorado decision having been subsequently reversed by a unanimous United States Supreme Court in Trump v. Anderson, 601 U.S. 100 (2024), the lawfare activists still feel they have an arrow left in their Fourteenth Amendment quiver. They depict Trump’s Supreme Court victory as largely dicta with no legal force. They clutch at the straws thrown by the Court’s liberal members, who suggested that the majority had gone too far in expressing a view on the role of Congress in upholding the Fourteenth Amendment (that is, activists argue that the Supreme Court dicta on this point should not be read as part of its binding decision). In this vein, the New York Times reported that, 'The court’s three liberal members — Justices Sonia Sotomayor, Elena Kagan and Ketanji Brown Jackson — expressed frustration at what they said was the majority’s needless overreach in a joint concurring opinion.' The liberal members said that the majority had needlessly chosen to 'decide novel constitutional questions to insulate this Court and petitioner from future controversy,' and that, 'In a case involving no federal action whatsoever, the Court opines on how federal enforcement of Section 3 must proceed.' The liberal judges went on to add that: Today, the majority goes beyond the necessities of this case to limit how Section 3 can bar an oath breaking insurrectionist from becoming President. Although we agree that Colorado cannot enforce Section 3, we protest the majority’s effort to use this case to define the limits of federal enforcement of that provision. Because we would decide only the issue before us, we concur only in the judgment. Trump’s political opponents derive some comfort, however tenuous, from those barbed words. Paradoxically, the liberal members of the Supreme Court, who usually favor an activist judicial role, in this case called for judicial restraint—an approach that potentially creates scope for further scheming by Trump’s political enemies seeking to relitigate the events of January 6 as many times as possible. In a further paradox, the longer-term constitutional implications of the majority opinion were overshadowed by widespread relief that the Supreme Court had averted an election crisis, and that the liberal justices had somehow managed to refrain from dissenting even though they disagreed with the majority on key issues. Justice Barrett said: The Court has settled a politically charged issue in the volatile season of a Presidential election. Particularly in this circumstance, writings on the Court should turn the national temperature down, not up. For present purposes, our differences are far less important than our unanimity: All nine Justices agree on the outcome of this case. That is the message Americans should take home. The longer-term implications for the balance of power between federal and state authority merit closer consideration, as the majority emphasized that the Fourteenth Amendment vests power in the federal court rather than in the state courts. As Ilya Somin observes, The per curiam opinion emphasizes the need for uniformity in determining eligibility for federal office and argues that states lack the power to make such determinations… This argument ignores the long-standing role of states in enforcing and adjudicating other constitutional qualifications for candidates for federal office. This constraint on state power may have had the advantage of avoiding inconsistent state decisions about Trump being excluded from the ballot, but, as Somin points out, 'Concerns about a potential 'patchwork' of conflicting state rulings are ultimately policy objections to the Constitution’s decentralized state-by-state scheme of election administration.' This undermines the constitutional tradition of decentralized government power. As Donald Livingston has argued, decentralized government was the original vision of America: America began as a highly decentralized regime of independent moral and political communities jealous of their liberty. These political societies created a central government as their agent and endowed it with enumerated powers. This government was only a speck on the political landscape and its presence was scarcely felt in everyday life. From 1865 to 1965 it underwent a transformation, emerging as the most consolidated and centralized military and financial power in history. From its inception, the Fourteenth Amendment was instrumental in that consolidation of centralized power, and the decision of the Supreme Court in Trump v. Anderson further entrenches that trend. Roots of the Fourteenth Amendment The NYT commentary on Trump v. Anderson noted the context in which the Fourteenth Amendment arose: 'to deal with the problem of former Confederates holding positions of government power.' However, there is much more to the political origins of this amendment. While its legislative history cannot be covered in this brief article, a key point to note is that the amendment was not simply about keeping Confederates out of office—the more ambitious goal was to consolidate power in the federal government. According to William A. Dunning in his book Reconstruction, Political and Economic 1865-1877, the Fourteenth Amendment was seen by Radical Republicans as a prerequisite to reconfiguring the balance of power between state and federal governments. One of the challenges the radicals faced, as Dunning explains, was President Johnson’s respect for the 'old-time Constitution.' Johnson did not think Congress had power 'to exclude states from representation' as the radicals proposed in an attempt to force the Southern states to accept the diminished scope of state power. Radicals feared that any legislative reform would be bypassed by Southern legislators or vetoed by President Johnson, who indeed vetoed the Freedmen’s Bureau Bill of 1866 and the Civil Rights Act of 1866. President Johnson objected to these radical bills on grounds that they amounted to unconstitutional federal encroachment on states’ jurisdiction. As explained by Dunning, Johnson’s view was: ...that the [Civil Rights] bill embodied an unheard-of intrusion of the Federal government within the sphere of the states, and was a stride towards centralization. He stood stiffly on his belief that the situation in the South involved no conditions which required for their treatment a break with the ancient political system. Constitutional amendments served as a vehicle through which, as Dunning puts it, 'the majority in Congress proposed to appeal to the people against the policy of the president.' This concern with the constitutional balance of power is also reflected in various Supreme Court decisions cited in Trump v. Anderson: Proposed by Congress in 1866 and ratified by the States in 1868, the Fourteenth Amendment 'expand[ed] federal power at the expense of state autonomy' and thus 'fundamentally altered the balance of state and federal power struck by the Constitution.' Seminole Tribe of Fla. v. Florida, 517 U. S. 44, 59 (1996). Similarly, Forrest McDonald observes that, Whatever else the Radicals had in mind in pushing through the Reconstruction Amendments—their motives were diverse and conflicting—it is clear that some of them, at least, intended that the Fourteenth should greatly increase the powers of Congress at the expense of the states. As Dunning explains, the plan behind the Fourteenth Amendment was, …in essence, to deny the privileges of statehood to the southern communities until the guarantee of certain results of the war, as the North conceived them, should be incorporated in the Constitution, and should be formally consented to by the southerners themselves. Dunning argues that in pursuit of this goal, the Reconstruction Committee paid scant regard to the constitutional debates and instead emphasized the need to quell the rebellious spirit of the South. The Supreme Court in Trump v. Anderson mentions an example of this, the 'statement of Rep. Stevens, warning that without appropriate constitutional reforms ‘yelling secessionists and hissing copperheads’ would take seats in the House.' By spinning the case for constitutional revolution in that way, it was hoped to secure popular support for excluding both the President and the Southern states in pushing through plans for the expansion of federal authority. Dunning explains: The majority report evaded any thoroughgoing discussion of the constitutional questions of state status, in which the strength of the president’s case lay, but put the chief stress on the right of Congress to say the final word as to the restoration of the insurgent communities, and on the evidence that the white people of the South were still rebellious and impenitent in spirit, bent on oppressing the freedmen and white Unionists, and eager for representation in Congress only in the hope of regaining thus the power and influence which they had lost by the resort to arms. Although the radicals depicted their reconstruction proposals as a corollary of their victory in the war, President Johnson correctly understood that these proposals amounted to nothing short of a constitutional revolution. Allen Mendenhall observes in his analysis of the Fourteenth Amendment that, Few issues divide libertarians the way the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution does…. On the one side are those who praise the amendment for circumventing the power of the states to prejudice, police, regulate, or otherwise use force to impose discriminatory laws on their citizens. On the other side are those who, while acknowledging the problematic nature of state misconduct and wrongdoing, are not willing to condone the transfer of power from states to the federal government, and in particular to the federal judiciary. This controversy illustrates the extent to which political activists drive a coach and horses through the Constitution if it stands in the way of their goals—precisely as President Johnson, in his failed attempt to defend the 'old-time Constitution,' had feared, and precisely as attempted by the Democrats in their recent attacks on Donald Trump.

Zelenskyy Says Ready To Swap Captured North Korean Soldiers For U...	(RFE/RL) -- Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said he is prepared to hand over captured North Korean soldiers to Pyongyang if reclusive leader Kim Jong Un can arrange a prisoner swap for Ukrainians held in Russia. 'Ukraine is ready to hand over his people to Kim Jong Un if he can organize their exchange for our soldiers who are in captivity in Russia,' Zelenskiy wrote on social media on January 12. He also offered 'some other paths' for any North Korean soldiers who did not want to return to their authoritarian home country. 'In particular, those Koreans who express a desire to bring peace closer by spreading the truth about this war [back] in Korea will have such an opportunity,' he added. The Ukrainian president’s comments came as South Korea said Kyiv had captured two North Korean soldiers, confirming remarks made a day earlier by Zelenskiy and other Ukrainian officials. 'Through real-time cooperation with Ukraine's intelligence agency...[South Korea's National Intelligence Service] has confirmed that the Ukrainian military captured two North Korean soldiers on January 9 in the Kursk battlefield in Russia,' Seoul said in a statement. Neither North Korea nor Moscow has commented on the reports. Ukraine’s SBU intelligence on January 11 released a video showing two men in hospital bunks, one with bandaged hands and the other with a bandaged jaw. Ukrainian officials said the prisoners were talking through interpreters working with South Korea's National Intelligence Service (NIS). The SBU said one prisoner, who said he was born in 2005, claimed he believed he was 'going for training, not to fight a war against Ukraine.' The other man was forced to write his answers because of an injured jaw, the SBU said. That soldier said he was born in 1999 and was a sniper in the North Korean Army. In separate televised comments, Zelenskiy said one to the two captured soldiers had 'expressed a desire to stay in Ukraine, the other to return to Korea.' The NIS also said one of the captured soldiers had claimed he received training from the Russian military after he arrived in the country in November. 'He initially believed he was being sent for training, realizing upon arrival in Russia that he had been deployed,' South Korea’s intelligence agency said. It added that one of the prisoners 'went without food or water for four to five days before being captured' by Ukrainian forces. Ukraine has launched new attacks in Kursk to prevent Russia from snatching back territory. A lightning Ukrainian offensive first captured large swaths of the Kursk region in August 2024. It was the largest incursion onto Russian soil since World War II. Last fall, North Korea sent some 11,000 troops to the Kursk region to support Russian forces. Moscow has reclaimed some 40 percent of the territory, but Ukrainian troops still control more than 500 square kilometers in Kursk, and Pyongyang's troops have reportedly been experiencing mass casualties. Zelenskiy on December 23 said more than 3,000 troops, or about a quarter of the North Korean special forces sent to Russia, had been killed or injured, though he did not provide evidence. White House spokesman John Kirby on December 27 told reporters that North Korean forces were suffering heavy casualties on the front lines, adding that some 1,000 of their troops had been killed or wounded in the Kursk region over a one-week period. 'It is clear that Russian and North Korean military leaders are treating these troops as expendable and ordering them on hopeless assaults against Ukrainian defenses,' Kirby said.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWdb7qD8VV9geMjel6Krgg44	2025-01-12T16:30:59-08:00	
Malala Yousafzai Asks Muslim Leaders To Reject Taliban’s Treatmen...	By Ayaz Gul Nobel Peace Prize laurate Malala Yousafzai urged Muslim leaders Sunday not to 'legitimize' Afghanistan’s ruling Taliban, accusing them of being the 'perpetrators of gender apartheid' and calling for accountability. Yousafzai spoke at the closing session of a Pakistan-hosted international summit on girls’ education in Muslim communities around the world, sharply criticizing the hardline Taliban government for imposing sweeping curbs on Afghan women’s access to education and employment. 'For the past three-and-a-half years, the Taliban have ripped away the right to learn from every Afghan girl. They have weaponized our faith to justify it,' the education activist stated. 'The Taliban are explicit about their mission. They want to eliminate women and girls from every aspect of public life and erase them from society,' she said. 'Simply put, the Taliban do not see women as human beings. They cloak their crimes in cultural and religious justification.' The Taliban swept back to power in Afghanistan in August 2021, imposing their strict interpretation of Islamic law, known as Sharia, that the United Nations has labeled as 'gender apartheid.' Afghan girls are entirely banned from attending school beyond the sixth grade. Women are prohibited from public and private workplaces except for a few departments, such as health, immigration, and police. The Muslim World League, or MWL, co-hosted the two-day conference in the Pakistani capital, Islamabad, bringing together ministers, education officials, and scholars from nearly 50 Muslim-majority countries and representatives from the United Nations and non-governmental organizations. 'I have a message for everyone in this room,' Yousafzai said. 'As Muslim leaders, now is the time to raise your voice and use your power. You can show true leadership; you can show true Islam,' she told the gathering. 'Afghan women and girls must be free to shape their own future. The very loudest champions of their cause must be fellow Muslims, leaders such as yourselves,' she added. Yousafzai sought a united voice from Muslim scholars to openly challenge and denounce the Taliban’s 'oppressive laws.' Taliban officials did not immediately comment on the criticism. They vehemently defend their governance, saying it is aligned with Sharia and culture in Afghanistan. A conference declaration issued Sunday condemned 'extremist ideologies' and religious edicts, known as fatwas, that are rooted in cultural norms obstructing girls' education as a 'grave misuse of religious principles to legitimize policies of deprivation and exclusion.' The declaration noted that anyone who rejects or opposes Islamic principles mandating equal education for men and women 'is considered outside the framework of the Islamic Ummah’s (Islamic world’s) concepts and cannot be regarded as part of it. 'It is essential to disavow their ideology, whether they are an individual, an institution, or an entity—public or private,' the statement said. The multi-page declaration did not mention Afghanistan, the only country where girls are banned from seeking secondary school education and beyond. Pakistani officials said that the Taliban government in Kabul had been formally invited to attend the global summit, but Islamabad did not receive a response. Speaking at the opening session on Saturday, Mohammad bin Abdulkarim Al-Issa, the MWL secretary-general, stressed that men and women must acquire education as mandated by Islam. 'The Islamic world is united in its belief that those who oppose women’s education are misguided and do not represent true Islam,' Al-Issa responded when asked if the outcome of the summit could encourage the Taliban to relax restrictions on Afghan women and girls. Nonetheless, the Saudi scholar clarified that the gathering in Islamabad was not directed at any specific community or country. 'We have simply tried to address the concerns of those who oppose women’s education and conveyed our message that there are no restrictions in Islam regarding education for girls,' Al-Issa stated, without naming the Taliban. Roza Otunbayeva, the head of the U.N. Assistance Mission in Afghanistan, attended the summit, telling a panel that leaders of Islamic countries need to support Afghan girls. 'I really call on all these ministers ... who came from all over the world, to offer scholarships, to have online education, to have all sorts of education for them. This is the task of the day,' she said. No country has recognized the Taliban government primarily over its curbs on Afghan women and girls. While the United States and the West at large have refused to engage with the de facto Afghan leaders diplomatically and relocated their embassies from the country, neighboring and regional countries, including China, Iran, Pakistan, and Russia, have retained their diplomatic missions in Kabul and maintain close contacts with the Taliban.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWdb7qD8VV9geDFdhqVCIq6J	2025-01-12T16:23:59-08:00	
Ukrainian Special Forces Capture Two North Korean Soldiers In Kur...	(EurActiv) -- Ukraine has captured two North Korean soldiers in Russia's Kursk region, President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said on Saturday (11 January), the first time Ukraine has announced the capture of North Korean soldiers alive since their entry into the war last autumn. North Korean regular troops entered the war on Russia's side in October, according to Kyiv and its western allies, who initially estimated their numbers at 10,000 or more. In a post on X, Zelenskyy said that the soldiers had been brought to Kyiv and were communicating with the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU), the country's domestic intelligence agency. 'As with all prisoners of war, these two North Korean soldiers are receiving the necessary medical assistance,' Zelenskiy said. He said that journalists would be given access to speak to them. Kyiv says that North Korean troops are fighting in the Kursk region, where Ukraine launched an incursion in August. Kyiv says it still controls several hundred square kilometres of territory there. Pyongyang has also been supplying Russia with vast quantities of artillery shells, according to Kyiv and its western allies. Russia has neither confirmed nor denied the presence of North Korean troops in Kursk, and there was no immediate reaction from Moscow or Pyongyang to the latest report. Ukraine had previously said it captured North Korean soldiers in combat, but that they had been badly wounded and died shortly afterwards. Special forces operation Zelenskyy said in a later video address that the troops had been captured by Ukraine's special forces working alongside paratroopers. The special forces posted a video filmed from a drone claiming to show part of the operation. It showed five men in ghillie suits in a forested area, although other details were hard to make out. A video posted by the SBU appeared to show the two captured men. One had his jaw bandaged due to an apparent wound, while the other was drinking through a straw. A doctor interviewed for the SBU’s video, who was not named and had his face blurred, said one of the soldiers had a facial wound and would be treated by a dentist, while the other soldier had an open wound and a lower leg fracture. The SBU said the North Koreans had been transferred to Kyiv for questioning, and that because they could not speak Ukrainian, Russian or English, their questioning was being done in Korean with the help of South Korea's NIS intelligence agency. The SBU said one of the soldiers had been captured with a Russian military document with the name of another person registered in Russia, while the other did not have any documents. The agency said the soldiers had been born in 2005 and 1999, and had been serving in the North Korean armed forces since 2021 and 2016 respectively. The SBU said the two prisoners were being held in conditions that were in accordance with international law, and that a criminal investigation was being conducted to see if the men broke Ukraine's law against planning or conducting a war.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWdb7qD8VV9geMAZVkIU6lMJ	2025-01-12T16:22:21-08:00	
Bangladesh: Despite Yunus Govt Promises On Press Freedom, Journal...	By Kamran Reza Chowdhury Five months after the repressive Awami League government fell, with an interim administration preaching freedom of the press, some Bangladeshi media are producing critical coverage but others are censoring themselves, saying there is 'an atmosphere of fear.' Media leaders and observers said those committing self-censorship are afraid of reprisals, including facing false murder complaints, losing their jobs, being defamed on social media or being accused as supporters of the old government. Z.E. Mamun, a former chief executive of private TV station ATN Bangla, said some media outlets came under attack on Aug. 3, 2024, two days before the government of Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina collapsed amid massive student-led protests. 'False murder cases were filed against a huge number of journalists after the downfall of the government,' Mamun told BenarNews, adding, 'they have been tagged as collaborators of Sheikh Hasina.' Mamun said he was named in a case linked to a killing in Dhaka on Aug. 5, the day Hasina left Bangladesh and fled to India. The complaint filed by citizens was lodged at the International Crimes Tribunal, which was established by Hasina’s Awami League to try people accused of war crimes during Bangladesh’s war of independence from Pakistan in 1971. Mamun said fears arise from the interim government led by Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus 'parroting' statements of the Students’ Movement against Discrimination – the group that spearheaded pro-democracy protests that led to Hasina’s downfall. Shafiqul Alam, the press secretary for the interim government, rejected allegations by Mamun and others. Along with being named in a murder complaint filed in August, Mamun lost his job two months later. He said he understood why many of those in the same boat as him had gone quiet – at least 140 journalists identified as being supporters of Hasina’s Awami League government, face murder complaints filed by citizens, according to official figures. 'They cannot discharge their professional responsibilities. They have been practicing self-censorship,' he said. 'If they had been collaborators, the government should investigate and find out what crimes they have committed. If proved beyond doubt, the authorities can take legal action against them,' Mamun said. Instead, the interim government has cancelled journalists’ accreditations, sought information about their finances and frozen bank accounts, he alleged. The Press Information Department cancelled accreditation cards, which facilitate access to the government offices, of 169 journalists since the fall of Hasina’s government. A ‘prevailing’ fear Sohel Haider Chowdhury, president of the Dhaka Union of Journalists, said almost all media outlets had terminated or sidelined journalists who were branded as 'enablers of fascist Hasina,' while another group of journalists opposing the Awami League took over the key posts. 'The consequences are – one group is silent while another group is spreading negative activities of the previous government and hailing the interim government and the students by hiding the critical stories,' said Chowdhury, who like Mamun, faces murder complaints. 'I would say there is no direct intervention from the government, but an atmosphere of fear has been created. The journalists have been working in constant fear,' Chowdhury told BenarNews, adding that his and other journalism trade offices had been locked by the government. 'We cannot work,' he said. Chowdhury said he has been named in four murder complaints filed by survivors of protesters who were killed in anti-Hasina protests in July and early August. While he said he had no details about the complaints, they all named Hasina as the top suspect. Nazrul Islam Mithu, president of Overseas Correspondents Association Bangladesh, said there was no atmosphere for good journalism during Hasina’s regime, and this has carried over under the interim government. 'The government urges journalists to criticize them. But they are not ensuring conditions conducive to healthy journalism. An atmosphere of fear is prevailing,' Mithu told BenarNews. 'Anyone criticizing the government faces physical assault and harassment in public places, their houses are attacked. But no action from the government to prevent such recurrence is visible,' he said. Government response Press secretary Alam pushed back against such assertions and said journalists were enjoying new freedoms under the Yunus administration. 'The interim government has not slapped any repressive laws or passed any administrative orders to muzzle the press as practiced by Hasina government. No legal actions were taken against the journalists,' he told BenarNews. 'The DGFI, the prime minister’s press wing of the information ministry, has not issued any order to dictate the media,' Alam said, adding no journalists have lost jobs because of directives from the government. DFGI is the military’s intelligence wing. 'Rather we have decided to scrap the repressive Cyber Security Act and the government has decided to withdraw all cases relating to freedom of the press and the freedom of expression filed under it,' he said. Regarding the murder cases, Alam said, 'Can you find a single instance where the government filed a case against the journalists? The cases were filed by aggrieved individuals who seek justice for the murder of their children during the July and August protests.' 'If an individual files a case, the government cannot stop it,' he said. Alam noted that Yunus had invited journalists to criticize his government. 'What else can we at the government do if the journalists practice self-censorship?' he said. M. Abdullah, a former president of the pro-Bangladesh Nationalist Party and Jamaat-e-Islami faction of the Bangladesh Federal Union of Journalists, offered support for the interim government’s efforts. BNP and Jamaat were the major opposition parties under Awami League-rule. 'I do not think the journalists have been facing problems for doing journalism. No government agency has been issuing any directives to the media outlets,' he told BenarNews. He said those journalists who are censoring themselves are doing so because of their 'previous controversial roles and personal weaknesses.' 'For instance, the financial statements of some of the journalists show they transacted crores (millions) of Taka, which is unusual,' he said. Robaet Ferdous, a journalism professor at Dhaka University, said the owners of media outlets and the journalists had colluded with the government led by Hasina – but much remained the same. 'People thought the situation would change after Aug. 5. But the situation has not changed. Now, the students have replaced the government agencies deciding who would go to TV talk shows or not,' he told BenarNews, adding 'political parties aspiring to get power have already started placing their favored journalists in key positions in media.' 'Theoretically, an atmosphere of free journalism exists, but not in practice,' he said.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWdb7qD8VV9geLzpO9v2uIrM	2025-01-12T16:16:58-08:00	
Switzerland Ready To Serve As Host For Putin-Trump Meeting On Ukr...	Switzerland is ready to serve as a host to a possible meeting between Russian President Vladimir Putin and US President-elect Donald Trump on the settlement of the Ukrainian conflict, if such request emerges, Swiss daily Le Temps reported on Sunday. 'Following the Burgenstock summit, Ukraine, Russia and the United States were regularly informed of our readiness to support any diplomatic efforts regarding the peace settlement,' the Swiss daily stated citing Nicolas Bideau, a spokesman for the Swiss Foreign Ministry, as saying, TASS reported. The daily added that the Swiss authorities would not be taking the initiative regarding this issue. According to Le Temps, the confederation is just one the countries on the list that are ready to host the meeting of the Russian and US leaders. On January 10, US President-elect Donald Trump announced that preparations for a meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin were underway. According to Trump, it was necessary to put an end to the Ukrainian conflict. Russian Presidential Spokesman Dmitry Peskov said later that the Russian president was ready to meet with Trump without any preconditions. The Kiev-initiated forum on Ukraine was held in Burgenstock, Switzerland on June 15-16, 2024, Armenia, Bahrain, Brazil, Colombia, the Holy See, India, Indonesia, Iraq, Jordan, Libya, Mexico, Rwanda, Saudi Arabia, South Africa, Thailand, and the United Arab Emirates did not sign the summit communique. Russia was not invited. Most UN delegates did not attend either. Russian Foreign Ministry Spokeswoman Maria Zakharova dismissed the conference as a total failure as she argued that 'get-togethers' like this do nothing to bring a lasting peace.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWdb7qD8VV9geBf-aUZ48IFw	2025-01-12T16:12:49-08:00	
President Biden Awards Pope Francis Presidential Medal Of Freedom...	By Tina Dennelly U.S. President Joe Biden spoke with Pope Francis on Saturday and named him a recipient of the Presidential Medal of Freedom with distinction, the White House said in a statement. As the nation’s highest honor, the medal is 'presented to individuals who have made exemplary contributions to the prosperity, values, or security of the United States, world peace, or other significant societal, public, or private endeavors,' the statement said. This is the first time Biden has awarded the medal 'with distinction,' according to the statement. 'The first pope from the Southern Hemisphere, Pope Francis is unlike any who came before,' the statement continued. 'Above all, he is the People’s Pope — a light of faith, hope, and love that shines brightly across the world.' 'For decades, [Jorge Bergoglio] served the voiceless and vulnerable across Argentina,' the White House statement said. 'As Pope Francis, his mission of serving the poor has never ceased. A loving pastor, he joyfully answers children’s questions about God. A challenging teacher, he commands us to fight for peace and protect the planet. A welcoming leader, he reaches out to different faiths.' Earlier this week, Biden canceled his planned trip to Rome and a visit with Pope Francis in order to address the ongoing deadly wildfires in California. Biden was set to travel to Rome from Jan. 9–12 at Pope Francis’ invitation. His audience with the Holy Father was set for Jan. 10. The president’s meeting with the pope was set to focus on efforts to advance peace around the world. Biden was also scheduled to meet with Italian President Sergio Mattarella and Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni. Biden last met with Pope Francis in June of last year where the two discussed foreign policy in Israel, Gaza, and the Ukraine as well as climate change. During a private audience at the G7 Summit in Apulia, Italy, the two leaders 'emphasized the urgent need for an immediate ceasefire and a hostage deal' in Gaza and the need to 'address the critical humanitarian crisis,' according to the White House. CNA senior editor Daniel Payne contributed to this report.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWdb7qD8VV9geNIcX2pXeT8Q	2025-01-12T16:09:56-08:00	
Switzerland’s Most Renowned Trans Person No Longer Wants To Be A ...	When Chris Brönimann became Nadia just before the turn of the millennium, the whole of Switzerland watched in fascination. Now, the country’s most famous transgender figure is publicly grappling with regret over that choice. This is not a story of redemption, but a post-woke plea. By Marc Leutenegger The text message confirming our meeting is signed Chris/Nadia. It’s a late summer’s day, the air is crisp and clean over Lake Zurich in the small town of Lachen. The café on the promenade where Chris/Nadia Brönimann works part-time is quiet, just like the life of the one-time most famous transgender woman in Switzerland. It’s quiet, at least for now. It has been only a few days since Brönimann renounced her transition, a decision that was splashed across Swiss media and flooded Instagram with messages of both hate and support. In Switzerland, transsexuality is as polarising as it is in other Western societies. It is often referred to as 'gender dysphoria', when a person does not identify with the gender they were assigned at birth. The number of young people diagnosed with gender dysphoria has risen drastically, with Canada, the United States and many countries in Europe recording a tenfold increase since the turn of the millennium. It is mostly women who feel they were born in the wrong body. While societies have become more tolerant, hormone therapies and gender-affirming surgeries remain controversial. Traditionally progressive countries such as Sweden, Norway and the United Kingdom have banned the prescription of puberty blockers to minors or limited their use to medical research. Many key questions surrounding sexual transition remain unanswered. A fierce debate over who holds the authority on the subject and how to interpret it has unfolded, even among medical professionals. At the same time, the transgender issue is being politicised, as was seen in the recent US presidential elections. Gender tags During our chat at the café, the political dimension does not seem an issue, at least not initially. The conversation focusses on the personal situation and the reasons behind Brönimann’s latest coming-out, a move that has once again touched a taboo topic and put her in the spotlight. Over the past three years, Brönimann has increasingly distanced herself from Nadia. Maintaining her image had become almost a chore or a daily performance. 'The pressure on transgender people to fully take over the role of a man or a woman is huge,' says Brönimann. 'You are constantly asking yourself: Am I good enough? Am I female enough?' Here lie constraints, shame and a self-image that is solely dominated by gender. Brönimann wanted to break free from all of this. 'This is exactly what many people didn’t understand. My latest coming-out is not just a return to ‘Christian’. It is impossible to fully go back, neither physically nor as a person. Both Christian and Nadia are a part of me. Since my latest coming-out, I have been able to rediscover my identity.' Of course, Brönimann adds, there are also uncertainties and fears and the question: 'Have I turned into a freak?' Brönimann has been bombarded with emails and messages asking questions like: 'Are you non-binary now?' Such questions, Brönimann says, are exactly the problem today. 'We open up all opportunities, but we also tend to compartmentalise. For now, I don’t want a tag. I want to explore where my individual soul lies, my inner home, beyond being a man, a woman or a non-binary person.' This statement bears a hint of criticism of gender identity politics. But there’s more to it. Woke and anti-woke A few weeks after our interview at Lake Zurich, Brönimann appeared before the human rights committee of the Geneva cantonal parliament, which is looking into the issue of gender transition. In Lausanne, she spoke to the media alongside a man opposed to his underage daughter undergoing a gender transition. For a few years now, Brönimann has taken a conservative stance on gender transition for young people. The former icon of the Swiss trans scene rejects surgical interventions for anyone younger than 18 and opposes puberty blockers and hormone therapies. Before the media stint in Lausanne, Brönimann had already expressed doubts in an interview with the German-speaking Sonntagsblick newspaper, criticising Switzerland’s liberal practice. She argued this approach to gender relied too heavily on the self-diagnosis of young people and enabled premature medical treatment – a phenomenon exacerbated by social media platforms like TikTok and Instagram. 'Gender transitions are turning into a woke lifestyle,' says Brönimann. Although controversial, the theory that gender transitions are socially contagious still prevails in conservative circles, which has led to the coining of the phrase 'rapid onset gender dysphoria' (ROGD). It suggests that vulnerable teenagers believe they were born in the wrong body because they are repeatedly exposed to this idea on social media. A few days after the interview, the Sonntagsblick published an article featuring a doctor associated with the Transgender Network Switzerland (TGNS) who rejected Brönimann’s criticism. He emphasised that transgender cases in Switzerland were thoroughly assessed. The doctor’s statement reflects the official stance of the TGNS, a national advocacy group for transgender people in Switzerland. 'The reasons behind the rising numbers of gender transitions or therapeutic measures often lack an in-depth analysis, or they are simplified in favour of populist buzzwords such as ‘woke-mania’,' the TGNS states in a press release. The fact that more transgender people today are receiving 'adequate treatment at an earlier stage', according to the TGNS, is due to improved access to care and greater awareness among medical staff. The press release also takes quotes from a study published in the American Journal of Surgery in August 2024, which found that the regret rate was below 1%. However, this figure, which has been used in earlier studies, is controversial. Knowledge gap The TGNS failed to respond to a list of questions surrounding Brönimann’s latest coming-out, stating they could not handle the 'high volume of media inquiries'. Switzerland’s most famous transgender person and the Transgender Network do not see eye-to-eye. However, Brönimann is not alone in criticising the trans-affirmative treatment practices that prioritise the wishes of patients. Medical professionals have also raised concerns about current approaches. In mid-2024, the Swiss Society for Child and Adolescent Psychiatry called for a revision of the new treatment guidelines for children and adolescents who suffer from gender dysphoria. In making this appeal, the Swiss society follows the European Society for Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, which has criticised the scientific evidence of the so-called Dutch Protocols, a key reference for affirmative treatment practices, as too weak. It also pointed out that puberty blockers and hormone treatment may cause health complications. Claims about the benefits or risks of gender transitions often lack sufficient scientific evidence. This research gap became evident three years ago when the UK Department of Health commissioned the Nice Report, which aimed to assess the clinical benefits of puberty blockers using data from existing studies. Of 525 papers, only nine met the criteria for the evaluation. Critics often use cases such as Brönimann’s to point out the risks associated with trans-affirmative treatment. However, this perspective often lacks nuance. The American short film Detrans features young adults describing how they were misguided and found liberation through detransitioning but does not offer opposing viewpoints. The film was a Christian-conservative production. Brönimann does not entirely agree with this. 'Of course, I am not categorically against all gender transitions. On the contrary, I am happy for every single trans person who has successfully undergone a sex change and found happiness. I just want each case to be thoroughly assessed by a differential diagnosis that explores other potential causes of psychological distress. I want the greatest possible precaution when it comes to irreversible procedures and an open society where trans people have their secure and equal place, but one that also allows for critical discussions.' Chaos or rainbow When Christian became Nadia just before the turn of the millennium, Brönimann was in their late twenties. Swiss television captured the journey in a detailed documentary. For eight years, filmmaker Alain Godet followed Brönimann, creating a film that portrayed a transformation, but not a liberation. At the end of the film, Godet asks Nadia: 'If you look back now, would you do it again?' Brönimann reflects and responds: 'Just imagine the chaos that would erupt if I said ‘No’. Then I would be really stuck.' The person having a chat in a café by Lake Zurich gives a different, more composed impression. During the research for this story, many emails were exchanged that Brönimann usually signed with a rainbow and the phrase: 'Colourful regards to you, Chris/Nadia.'	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWdb7qD8VV9geFZOs_3uJ9_Q	2025-01-12T16:07:50-08:00	
Dr. Martin Luther King’s Prophetic Warning, Denouncing The Mercha...	Over the past three years, a collective of volunteer researchers, lawyers, and commentators created The Merchants of Death War Crimes Tribunal, dedicated to holding accountable four weapon manufacturing corporations based in the U.S. Their tribunal amassed copious evidence to prove that Boeing, Lockheed Martin, RTX (formerly Raytheon) and General Atomics (a company which manufactures weaponized drones) are guilty of committing war crimes. On January 15, 2025, as the world marks the birth of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King, a press conference will announce the Tribunal's verdicts and release the report of ten international jurors who have weighed the evidence submitted to them. Of necessity, the evidence was culled from examining a limited range of devastatingly criminal U.S. 'forever wars,' of brutal and needless wars of choice. The Tribunal focused on specific U.S. war crimes and crimes against humanity in the invasions, occupations and aerial assaults which followed the '9/11' attacks in 2001. What if we could enlarge the Tribunal, bringing before it war crimes occurring right now, the U.S.-assisted massacres we watch in real time on our phone and computer screens? Certainly, one witness we would beg to appear for testimony would be Dr. Hussam Abu Safiya, who was the director of Gaza's Kamal Adwan Hospital when such a place existed. The Tribunal would wish to amplify his testimony on the harrowing weeks of siege during which Israel subjected his hospital to artillery and aerial bombardment. They would help to record his story of witnessing assassinations targeting medical staff, field executions of people clutching white flags in an attempt to surrender, the hospital's forced evacuation with at-gunpoint humiliation stripping of women and girls. The initial attacks disabled the hospital's operational capacities by targeting power generators and oxygen production equipment, but now an iconic photo shows Dr. Abu Safiya walking towards an Israeli tank through collapsed buildings and rubble. The Tribunal would like to interview him, but he is being held without charge by Israel's military. Dr. Hussam Abu Safiya, director of Gaza's Kamal Adwan Hospital, walking through the rubble in his white coat before being kidnapped by Israeli forces. Photo via Kathy Kelly Our tribunal would surely turn to three of the world's most crucial international human rights groups for testimony. On December 5, 2024, Amnesty International concluded that Israel is committing genocide against Palestinians in Gaza. Its research documents how, during its military offensive launched in the wake of the deadly Hamas-led attacks in southern Israel on 7 October 2023, 'Israel has unleashed hell and destruction on Palestinians in Gaza brazenly, continuously and with total impunity.' On December 19, 2024 Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF, Doctors Without Borders) stated that 'repeated Israeli military attacks on Palestinian civilians over the last 14 months, the dismantling of the health care system and other essential infrastructure, the suffocating siege, and the systematic denial of humanitarian assistance are destroying the conditions of life in Gaza.' The report says there are 'clear signs of ethnic cleansing' by Israel as it wages war in Gaza. Also issued on December 19, 2024 was a report from Human Rights Watch, entitled'Extermination and Acts of Genocide,' stating that Israel has killed thousands of Palestinians in Gaza by denying them clean water which it says legally amounts to acts of genocide and extermination. Corroborating the testimony of health care workers and human rights advocates in Gaza would be Pope Francis's January 9, 2025, message to international diplomats. Pope Francis denounced Israel's ongoing war in Gaza, calling the humanitarian situation in the Palestinian enclave 'very serious and shameful.' Pope Francis referenced the deaths of children who froze to death because of Israel's destruction of infrastructure: 'We cannot in any way accept the bombing of civilians. We cannot accept that children are freezing to death because hospitals have been destroyed or a country's energy network has been hit.' Recommendations made by jurors in the Merchants of Death War Crimes Tribunal call for major weapon makers to pay reparations for suffering caused. They echo the words of Pope Francis, whose message to the assemblage of diplomats made this appeal: 'With the money spent on weapons and other military expenditures, let us establish a global fund that can finally put an end to hunger and favor development in the most impoverished countries, so that their citizens will not resort to violent or illusory solutions, or have to leave their countries in order to seek a more dignified life'. Considering such testimony from so many diverse sources, one might expect that U.S. lawmakers would re-evaluate their murderous, unwavering support of Israel. Instead, on January 9th, 2025, the U.S. House of Representatives voted to sanction the International Criminal Court in protest of its arrest warrants for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his former defense minister. Who are the criminals? U.S. news coverage of five former or current presidents gathered for the funeral of President Jimmy Carter never hinted that hideous wars of choice along with massive increases in weapon sales had marked the administration of each of the five. There was no mention of President Biden's order to send eight billion dollars of weapons to Gaza. This gathering of U.S. presidents is referred to as 'The World's Most Exclusive Club.' Exclusive indeed. What other club of so few has caused so much suffering to so many? On April 7, 1967, Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. gave his famously insightful, prophetic speech about another illegal U.S. war of choice – 'Beyond Viet Nam: A Time to Break the Silence' – in which Dr. King said: 'Increasingly, by choice or by accident, this is the role our nation has taken: the role of those who make peaceful resolution impossible by refusing to give up the privileges and the pleasures that come from the immense profits of overseas investments.' Dr. King's verdict, in this speech, on the momentous first anniversary of which he was taken from us, was that 'This business of burning human beings with napalm, of filling our nation's homes with orphans and widows, of injecting poisonous drugs of hate into the veins of peoples normally humane, of sending men home from dark and bloody battlefields physically handicapped and psychologically deranged, cannot be reconciled with wisdom, justice, and love. A nation that continues year after year to spend more money on military defense than on programs of social uplift is approaching spiritual death.' The four defendants before our Tribunal certainly did their part to pressure these five other criminals toward their varied crimes, but we all have a choice to hold ourselves accountable in the face of Dr. King's warning that we are approaching spiritual death. One step toward reconciling with wisdom, justice and love would be to demand the release of Dr. Hussam Abu Safiya from an Israeli prison so that we could humbly learn from him about war crimes and reparations.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWdb7qD8VV9geI0eumd5xfMx	2025-01-12T16:05:12-08:00	
The Horn Of Africa States: Implications Of Visit Of Somalia’s Pre...	It is a long journey from the accusation of President Hassan Sheikh Mahmoud in February 2024 during the Ordinary Session of the Executive Council of the African Union, when he alleged that he was prevented from entering the Headquarters of the AU in Addis Ababa by Ethiopian security forces, and that he was rescued by President Ismael Omar Guelleh of Djibouti, to yesterday, January 11th, 2025, when the President of Somalia was extended a warm welcome to Addis Ababa. Abiy Ahmed’s message on 'X' which read 'I warmly welcome President Hassan Sheikh Mahmoud of the Federal Republic of Somalia, on his working visit to Ethiopia.' Speaks out loudly on the event. The two countries have been at logger heads on the matter of the Somali sea and Ethiopia’s continuous and constant complaint of its need for access to a sea. The illegal MoU it signed with one of the regions of Somalia was considered by the latter as a transgression on its sovereignty, unity and territorial integrity. Despite the 'Ankara Declaration' pressured and worked on by Türkiye, Ethiopia does not appear to have reversed its quest for taking part of Somalia’s territory and/or sea through a lease process, much like the Guantanamo Bay in Cuba, which was leased to the USA for a specific period and which still remains in its hands. Many Somalis are accordingly wary of the visit of the President Mahmoud to the country which, in their minds, is working hard to dismantle it and balkanize it. During the long and continuing civil war of Somalia, Ethiopia played a nefarious role encouraging many regions to pull away from the center, which weakens Somalia. A country of one people, one language, one faith and one culture, has been turned into a bad lands region and according to many Somalis, Ethiopia played, despite its claims of helping the country, a bad hand in the process. Many read the visit as an attempt to weaken the relationship between Somalia and Asmara and Cairo who recently signed a tripartite arrangement along with Mogadishu to look after each other in the boiling geopolitical situation and location of the region and in particular with the quest of Ethiopia to have access to Somalia’s sea. Others read the visit as a game engineered by the President of Djibouti to weaken Asmara only and still others view the visit as Hassan selling out his country just to preserve his political career through a military, political and social support of Ethiopia as it maintains substantial presence in the country. However, the Horn of Africa States region has been a volatile region for many years now, where alliances shift. A number of years ago, there was a tripartite arrangement between the countries of Somalia, Ethiopia and Eritrea. Today, the tripartite arrangements still exist but with Ethiopia being replaced by Egypt, a far-off country, mainly interested in the Nile waters and unmindful of the fate of the people of the region. In all these arrangements, Dibouti was always and still is the missing link in the potential Horn of Africa States region of the SEED countries (Somalia, Ethiopia, Eritrea and Djibouti). Some major countries such as those which have failed in their relations with Africa are also reported to be pushing a wrong agenda for the region, including selling naval vessels to and training naval forces for Ethiopia, a country which is geographically landlocked and which does not have a sea. This appears to have been the major cause of the recent volatility in the region, which does not need hostilities of this nature. Other regional powers have also used their resources to interfere in the region and more particularly Somalia, which they see as the weak link of the region. Their involvement appears to be aimed at controlling the ports of Somalia, the seas of Somalia and especially the very Horn of Africa, which separates the waters of the Gulf of Aden and the Somali Sea (the northern Indian Ocean) and link it with the Yemeni-held islands off the coast of Somalia. These activities pose major implications for the region. It is reported that President Guelleh of Djibouti may have played a role in arranging the visit of the President of Somalia to Addis Ababa, which if true, could pose well for the region to coming closer together. President Hassan Sheikh Mahmoud of Somalia has also been reported to be working on creating peace between Eritrea and Djibouti, two countries which have had disputes over a tiny space of ground in the border between the two countries. Should such a closer relationship among the countries of the region materialize, it would have major implications not only for the region but also for others who have interest in the region from major powers to regional powers and seafaring nations. Note the region would be in control of some 4,700 km of a coastal belt and over a million square kilometers of marine space in the form of Exclusive Economic Zones (EEZ) and hence a sizeable blue economy. The region overlooks the Indian Ocean/ Suez Canal waterway, which is reported to handle some 12 per cent of global trade and is the source of the Blue Nile which provides fresh water to millions of people in the countries of Sudan and Egypt. The effect of the Houthi disruption would then be toned down, as it would have to face a major unified region on the other side of the sea, which disrupts its economic systems. Currently all the countries of the region only mind their individual interests irrespective to the damage that a disruption of the waterway brings to the development of the region. The possibilities of port, rail and road developments from the region to the rest of Africa is pushed back to the distant future, as each country of the region only works to manage its own external affairs both politically and economically. A cooperation among the countries of the region, designed more like the European Union, with each country maintaining its sovereign and territorial integrity and working with others for the common good of the region, in terms of economic and political issues, and facing other regions of the world collectively and not on individual basis, would be good for the region. Note that tiny states like Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia, and others in the European Union have the same rights as the giants like Germany and France and Spain. Why shouldn’t the countries of the region work on the same basis? Many of the major, middle and regional powers who are currently involved in the region would be better off should the region be peaceful, stable and settled instead of being volatile, disruptive and warring with each other and others. It is where President Hassan Sheikh Mahmoud’s visit to Ethiopia, appears to change the equation, adding a fresh formula for the region where they can work together and settle issues on a common platform. Ethiopia does not need to be enticed by foreign forces to seek Somalia’s waters and seas or for that matter any other country’s waters. A Horn African States platform would probably attend to the Hobbesian fear of each country of the other (s).	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWdb7qD8VV9geB4siBZRnR3H	2025-01-12T16:03:20-08:00	
Bangladesh: Fracas Over Reforms Or Elections – OpEd	Bangladesh's interim government headed by Nobel Laureate Mohammed Yunus is facing a growing challenge by leading political parties who have opposed his plans to delay parliament polls. Backed by student agitators and radical Islamist parties who installed Yunus after ousting the Awami League government, the Nobel laureate has said he needs time to push through reforms he considers ' esserntial for the future of democracy ' in Bangladesh. But both the Awami League and the Bangladesh Nationalist Party ( BNP) have said reforms is best left to an elected government. Sensing a clear chance of winning the parliament elections if it is held soon, the BNP leadership is now at loggerheads with Yunus, the students leaders and the Islamist parties backing him. The BNP clearly want elections within the next few months and are uncomfortable with Yunus pitching for polls in mid-2026 after completing the reforms. The BNP , like the Awami League, has raised a basic question over Yunus' locus standi to pursue an agenda for reforms. Its leaders argue that any comprehensive reforms should be carried out by an elected parliament and not an interim government which has a tenuous constitutional basis. On the other hand, radical parties like the Jamaat-e-Islami with a unconcealed agenda to turn Bangladesh into an Islamic state have backed Yunus on his plans for reforms before elections. The Jamaat, which is yet to apologise for supporting the Pakistani genocide during the 1971 Bangladesh Liberation War, has gone all out to push the Yunus administration to restore bilateral relations with Pakistan after the ouster of the Hasina-led Awami League government in August. It sees in the current political climate a huge opportunity to undo the secular-linguistic edifice of Bengali nationalism and supplant it with a radical Islamist ideology clearly aimed at undermining minority and gender rights . The student leaders, mostly educated in religious seminaries, have unhesistatingly jumped into the Islamist bandwagon with calls to replace the 1972 secular constitution with one driven by Shariat laws. One of them, Sargis Alam, described the Jamaat-e-Islami student front , Islamic Chatra Shibir, as 'comrades' in the oust-Hasina campaign while another student leader Hasnat Abdullah has openly challenged the BNP's push for early elections. 'So many young people have not died to see one fascist dispensation replaced by another,' Hasnat told mediapersons in response to the BNP's call for early elections. Bangladesh's leading constitutional expert Barrister Tania Amir says the student leaders , with Jamaat-e-Islami backing, have definite plans to undo the key features of the 1972 constitution with those emanating from hardline Islamist ideology. 'That is why they want much time because they want a new Constitution in place before any election is held,' Amir told the Federal in an interview. 'The West is yet to see through the plans to hijack the democracy movement to create an Islamist state in Bangladesh.' 'The liberal facade of Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus is smartly used by the Islamic parties, so long marginal players in post-independence Bangladesh, to fool the West about their real mission. The reforms they plan are to create a theocracy and not a democracy,' said Selim Mahmud, a law professor in Dhaka university heading the Awami League's Information Office. The BNP, which backed the student agitation to get rid of its bete noise Awami League, seems to have now seen through these plans. Their leaders have firmly opposed dumping the 1972 Constitution and challenging the legacy of the Liberation War. They are downplaying their past alliance with Jamaat-e-Islami as 'merely for political convenience and not one based on ideological compatibility.' The BNP is a centrist party founded by military dictator Gen Ziaur Rahman who had fought in the 1971 Liberation War. It realises any surge in religiosity will help Islamic parties like Jamaat . On the other hand, with the Awami League on the backfoot, the BNP clearly fancies usurping the Liberation War legacy by highlighting Zia's declaration of independence on 27 March 1971. The US , which strongly backed the oust-Hasina movement and the Yunus-led interim government, may change course. Outgoing US ambassdor in India, Eric Garcetti, called for early elections in Bangladesh to 'restore the democratic process' during a press conference in Kolkata. Garcetti called on India to work closely with US to 'strengthen democracy in Bangladesh' in what many feel is a subtle appeal to Delhi to cooperate with the Yunus administration. India has not only sheltered ousted PM Sheikh Hasina but recently extended her residential permit after the Yunus administration called for her extradition to stand trial in dozens of cases filed against her. Delhi is clearly worried over the Yunus government releasing convicted Islamist terrorists like Ansarullah Bangla Team (ABT) chief Jashimuddin Rahmani. So if the BNP raises the ante over early elections and the Awami League echoes the same, Delhi may not only support it but try influencing the incoming Trump administration to push for early elections.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWdb7qD8VV9geIuDkM6vvIW0	2025-01-12T16:01:01-08:00	
HIV Drug Access Crisis Persists Despite Trial Success – Interview	Promising new drugs to prevent and treat HIV have the potential to transform the response to the disease. But getting these drugs to those who need it most will be critical, says Beatriz Grinsztejn, president of the International AIDS Society. Grinsztejn is the first Latin American to head the IAS, which has been advocating since the 1980s for science-based HIV policies, free from stigma. Leading research at the Evandro Chagas National Institute of Infectious Diseases in Rio de Janeiro, Grinsztejn has a long history as a pioneer in the field and says prioritising poorer countries is her central focus. She spoke to SciDev.Net about addressing inequities, combating stigma and criminalisation, and advocating for key populations to ensure a robust HIV response that is truly universal. How has your tenure as IAS president been so far? Honestly, it has been an incredible opportunity. I am learning a lot and dealing with different regions and stakeholders and regions, which has been both enriching and challenging. It’s the first time someone from my region has got to this position. So, it means a lot for me as a woman from Latin America to have the opportunity to be IAS president. And it’s a lot of work. What are your priorities as IAS president? Being someone from the global South, my major priority is to put the global South at the centre. We have a lot to say and we are very diverse. I am not an expert in Africa, but my perspective is rooted in the global South. My objective is to make us visible and to bring our needs to the centre of the table for discussion. This means prioritising access to new technologies [for low- and middle-income countries]. Above all, it’s about addressing stigma, discrimination, and criminalisation. In the different regions, we face different challenges regarding human rights. With the advance of right-wing ideologies in several countries, these challenges have grown significantly. Another focus is on key populations—different groups depending on the region—but the goal is to put these hidden people at the centre of the discussion, because we need to work for them. What challenges do regions such as Africa and Latin America face around access to HIV medicines? We have recently seen impressive results from the Purpose 1 and 2 studies, which evaluated the efficacy of [the drug] lenacapavir for prevention of HIV. In the Purpose 1 study, conducted among young women in Africa and presented by Linda-Gail Bekker at the AIDS 2024 conference in Munich last July, we saw impressive results: no HIV infections among the group of women who use lenacapavir. Since then, we have seen the results from Purpose 2, first presented in Lima at the 5th HIV Research for Prevention conference, also showing very impressive results. Gilead [the US pharmaceutical company which developed lenacapavir] has positioned itself to work on the licensing for generic versions of the drug. They have contracted six different factories that will produce the generics, but it will take years until we have these products. This license only covers 120 countries, and countries in Latin America, who contributed massively to the study for Purpose 2, are out of the agreement. Access is a major topic for us at the IAS. We really aim to bring this topic to discussion with stakeholders, with advocates, and use our voice to promote access. That needs to go much beyond this licensing that was already signed. We also have long-acting cabotegravir [a drug used for the treatment of HIV/AIDS], which … has been available for four years now. Generic production was only agreed upon two years ago. The agreement was signed with the Medicines Patent Pool, and of course, there is very limited access to cabotegravir. How do these issues specifically affect key populations? In Latin America, we’re seeing rising HIV infections among young men who have sex with men and transgender women. These groups are disproportionately affected, yet interventions like pre-exposure prophylaxis [PrEP, a medicine that can reduce the risk of getting HIV] are not scaling up fast enough. While countries like Brazil have made progress, many other nations in the region lag behind. Similarly, in Africa, key populations face unique challenges tied to criminalisation and stigma. These barriers lead to lower rates of viral suppression among these groups compared to the general population. It’s crucial to tailor our interventions to meet their specific needs. Criminalisation is a big point for us, and we want to bring the conversation on human rights and criminalisation as a central topic for us at the IAS. Criminalisation of LGBT people in Africa, homophobia and transphobia in Latin America are major issues. What are the sticking points preventing progress? One major issue is the lack of strong health systems. Many low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) struggle to absorb and scale up new technologies. Stigma and discrimination—both within health systems and society—also play a significant role. Legal reforms are needed to address criminalisation, but funding for such initiatives is often inadequate.What about treatment options in low- and middle-income countries? We also need to make progress in regard to treatment. People have issues in regard to using oral PrEP and many people also have issues in keeping adherence to antiretroviral therapy. We now see a gap between the richer countries and us, the LMICs, in regard to what kind of antiretroviral treatment is available. In guidelines of almost all rich countries you have long-acting antiretrovirals as an important option and it’s completely out of any guideline that serves LMICs. I believe we are moving slower than needed, but we are moving. At this point … we need to stay more united than ever so that we can guarantee that we don’t lose the rights that were already achieved. And guarantee that we have enough funding as well. Keeping HIV, the financing of the HIV response, as a major topic for us, is critical at this point where we need to discuss the replenishment of the Global Fund [to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria]. So we need to be together, unite our voices so that we can keep the AIDS response in the centre. How positive do you feel about progress in tackling HIV? While progress is slower than we’d like, there have been significant advancements in HIV prevention and treatment technologies. Innovations like lenacapavir and long-acting cabotegravir have the potential to transform HIV care—if made accessible. However, the real work begins with ensuring these technologies reach the people who need them most.

The New Drones Boosting Russia’s Advances On The Battlefield In U...	By RFE/RL's Ukrainian Service and Reid Standish (RFE/RL) -- As Russian forces have intensified their advances in eastern Ukraine in recent weeks, they're being helped by a new tool on the battlefield: drones that fly with the use of fiber-optic cables. 'The use of fiber-optic FPV drones definitely creates new challenges on the battlefield,' said a border guard with the Pomsta Brigade who goes by the call sign 'Phoenix.' RFE/RL agreed to identify him and other soldiers by their call signs or first names for this story, according to rules set by the Ukrainian military. Unlike standard FPV (first-person view) drones -- the term used for drones piloted through a video feed wirelessly transmitted to a pilot's headset, mobile device, or other displays -- the use of fiber-optic cables allows drones to operate without radio signals. This makes them less vulnerable to electronic jamming as they stay directly connected to their operators through up to 15 kilometers of thin coils of fiber-optic cable that resembles a fishing line. While Ukrainian forces are grappling with declining Western arms support and Russia's manpower advantage, the modified drones represent a shift in battlefield tactics in Ukraine. Both Kyiv and Moscow are ramping up fighting as they enter a pivotal stage of the war ahead of U.S. President-elect Donald Trump -- who has vowed to quickly end the war -- returning to office on January 20. The new drones have reportedly been in use since the summer, but Ukrainian soldiers stationed across the country tell RFE/RL they are becoming a staple of Moscow's battlefield strategy as it pushes for more territory in Ukraine's east. 'A Very Dangerous Weapon' Many said that, in addition to being used for reconnaissance, they are being increasingly used by Russian troops as self-destructing drones with a small payload attached to target Ukrainian positions and vehicles. 'This is a very dangerous weapon. It's like a brick with a propeller flying at you, and there is little you can do about it,' said 'Varan,' an officer in the 148th Artillery Brigade. Faced with changing tactics, soldiers say they've been forced to adapt quickly -- with mixed results. Kostyantyn, a commander of the battalion of the National Guard's Bureviy Brigade, says the ineffectiveness of electronic jamming against the new drones allows them to push farther into Ukrainian lines and fly or reach targets with more accuracy compared to traditional FPV drones. 'This allows them to see our positions better, strike more accurately, and fly longer distances. This makes the situation a little more complicated,' he said. These complications led Kyrylo Budanov, head of the Main Intelligence Agency of Ukraine's Defense Ministry, to call the new drones 'a huge problem for us' during a December 31 broadcast by Ukrainian media. On January 8, the Institute for the Study of War (ISW) noted that Russia is increasingly deploying fiber-optic drones as part of its current offensive and said the drones have carried out a series of new strikes along the front lines. 'Shvayka,' a drone pilot and platoon commander stationed near Soledar in eastern Ukraine, says the long fiber-optic cables can make the drones more difficult to detect. While soldiers can often spot antennas used to allow standard FPV drones to be piloted from a distance and disable them, the Russian drones have only a long, thin line with an easy-to-hide coil that feeds it. 'There is only a small box where the fiber-optic cable from the drone itself is placed, and it's very easy to miss this because it's the size of a pack of cigarettes,' he said. Another advantage is that they are less likely to lose their signal than standard FPV drones and can pursue targets more easily. 'If the pilot is professionally trained, using a fiber-optic drone allows them to fly very low, even skimming the ground in vegetation, without losing the video signal,' said 'Lyutiy,' the commander of an FPV unit in Ukraine's Third Separate Assault Brigade. '[This allows] them to conduct reconnaissance and reach otherwise inaccessible targets [better] than a regular drone.' Not Without Drawbacks 'Medoid,' a Ukrainian border guard, says the biggest lesson he's learned from dealing with the drones is the need to take extra precautions and better camouflage potential targets and personnel. The fiber-optic drones are not without their drawbacks, he adds, saying they struggle in terrain and spaces that aren't open and that he's seen several caught up in tree branches. The drones are also limited in the distances they can cover and where they can strike based on the cable's range. Given these obstacles, soldiers say the easiest way to take out the tethered drones is with small arms fire. Others say they've deployed large nets -- even fishing nets — to take them out. The cables can be manually severed, but doing so risks exposing soldiers to incoming fire. But in a war where every advance could prove crucial, the new drones are having an impact on the battlefield. Russia is reportedly ramping up production of the fiber-optic drones and Ukraine is also looking to develop its own versions, including a model showcased by the Ukrainian Defense Ministry earlier this month. 'For now, we are still in the testing phase,' Lyutiy said. 'We all see these flashy ads with promises, but in practice, we are only beginning to develop in this direction.'

Thailand Lets Autocratic Neighbors Hunt Down Opponents On Its Soi...	By Zachary Abuza Even by Cambodian standards, it was a brazen attack on an opposition figure. Lim Kimya, a 73-year old member of the banned Cambodia National Rescue Party, or CNRP, was gunned down by an assassin in Bangkok on Jan. 7. The hit was the latest in a growing pattern in which governments in Southeast Asia are complicit in the killing or rendition of opposition figures from neighboring countries –- or at least turn a blind eye to extralegal operations of their security forces within their borders. This has been going on for years, but with little official accountability, the security forces appear to be acting with more impunity, and often in violation of the international legal norm of non-refoulement. At the heart of this is Thailand, a magnet for migrants or refugees from its poorer neighbors whose government is increasingly willing to work with its authoritarian neighbors, or is unable to prevent other security services from conducting operations on its soil. Chinese security forces have long targeted dissidents in Thailand, such as Gui Minhai, who was snatched from his holiday home in Pattaya in 2015, or Li Xin, who went missing in the country a year later. In both cases, it’s unclear the degree of Thai government complicity, but Bangkok’s decisions reflect the vast asymmetry in power between China and Thailand. There’s no such power imbalance among Southeast Asian states, though. In a recent report, Human Rights Watch has described the traffic in targeted dissidents as a 'swap mart.' There is no evidence that there are formal agreements between and among the countries, but there’s clearly a lot of informal cooperation. Lao authorities, for example, notoriously disappeared rural development expert Sombath Somphone in December 2012 after taking him into police custody, and attempted to kill Anousa Luangsouphom in April 2023. Quid pro quo But less well known is their targeting of Free Lao activists on Thai soil. In August 2019, a 34-year old Thai-based Lao activist, Od Sayavong, and his housemate went missing from his home in Bangkok. Thai authorities pled ignorance in the case and their investigation has stalled. In May 2023, Kitiyano Bounsuan, a 56-year-old Thai-based Lao democracy activist who had received UNHCR refugee status, was gunned down in bordering Ubon Ratchathani province. These incidents may represent a quid pro quo between Bangkok and Vientiane. Following the Thai military’s May 2014 seizure of power, a number of democracy activists fled to Laos. During an April 2018 visit to Bangkok, Lt. Gen. Souvone Leuangbounmy, the chief-of-staff of the Lao People’s Armed Forces, pledged assistance to Gen.Prayuth Chanocha in tracking down Thai activists. Disappearing activists That help was already ongoing. In June 2016, the Thai anti-monarchy activists Ittapon Sukpaen disappeared; in 2017, Wuthipong Kachathamakul was abducted and never seen again. In January 2019, the bodies of two other anti-monarchy activists, Chatcharn Buppawan, 56, and Kraidej Luelert, 46, washed up on the Thai bank of the Mekong River. The two bodies were handcuffed and their feet bound, and they had been disemboweled, with their stomachs filled with concrete in order to sink the corpses. One other activist, Surachai Danwattananusorn, 78, went missing at the same time, but his body has never been found. In 2020, a Thai activist, Wanchalearm Satsaksit, was snatched from the streets of Phnom Penh. Just last November, Thailand deported six members of the CNRP -- four women and two men, along with a child -- back to Cambodia. The six had escaped Cambodia in 2022, and were immediately charged with treasonupon their return. There is less cooperation between Kuala Lumpur and Bangkok. Malaysian security forces have become displeased with the human rights abuses, extrajudicial killings, and overall lack of accountability of Thai security forces in Thailand’s deep south, where ethnic Malay separatists have been waging a low-level insurgency for 21 years. Nonetheless, sometimes there is a bit of Thai-Malaysian cooperation. In September 2021, Thai authorities arrested and returned Nur Sajat, a Malaysian transgender entrepreneur, who was wanted by authorities for failing to appear before a sharia court on charges of insulting Islam. This is all the more surprising given Thailand’s very progressive attitudes and laws on LGBTQ issues, and Malaysia’s draconian policies, including forced conversion therapy. Helping Hanoi No country has benefitted more from Thai cooperation or a blind eye in recent years than Vietnam. In January 2019, Thai authorities detained Radio Free Asia blogger Truong Duy Nhat, who was in the process of applying for refugee status, and turned him over to Vietnamese police, who spirited him across the border to Laos and then Vietnam. Thai authorities have denied involvement. In March 2020, a Vietnamese court sentenced Nhat to 10 years for fraud, dating back to a nearly two-decade old investigation into the purchase of land for the newspaper’s office when he was editor at Dai Doan Ket, a state-owned paper in Danang. Nhat had fled to Thailand in 2016 after serving a two-year prison term for 'abusing democratic freedoms,' after writing blog posts that were critical of the Communist Party. In April 2023, Vietnamese security forces allegedly abducted an exiled journalist, Duong Van Thai, 41, from outside of his house in northern Bangkok. Security cameras captured his shrieks. Thai had fled to Thailand in 2019 fearing persecution, and like Nhat, was in the process of applying for refugee status. Thailand’s ostensible democracy While Vietnamese authorities may be chastened about trying more snatch-and-grabs from the streets of Germany, they clearly feel they can act with impunity or tacit approval in Southeast Asia. Vietnamese authorities have also pursued legal extraditions. In mid-2024, Thailand returned an ethnic minority Montagnard activist to Vietnam. Y Quynh Bdap, 32, had been living in Thailand since 2018 and had received UN refugee status. Last October, a Thai court authorized his extradition, despite the fact that he faced a 10-year sentence after being tried and convicted in absentia of 'terrorism' charges. Even more alarming, last March, a group of police from the Central Highland provinces of Dan Lak and Gia Lai were in Thailand conducting interviews in Montagnard refugee communities, trying to learn of Bdap’s whereabouts and to pressure the asylum seekers to return to Vietnam. It is unlikely that Vietnamese police could have operated so overtly without the approval and support of Thai security forces. In January 2024, nearly 100 Montagnard suspects were put on trial and convicted for riots that killed nine people, including four policemen, and resulted in the burning of commune offices. Some 53 of them were convicted on charges of 'terrorism against the people’s government.' While we should not be surprised by the actions of Lao, Cambodian or Vietnamese security forces, Thailand is ostensibly a democracy. Since the 2014 military coup in Bangkok, however, Thai authorities have either been complicit or turned a blind eye to the actions of the security forces of neighboring authoritarian countries. The elected Thai government of Paetongtarn Shinawatra is already on its back feet after the courts ousted her predecessor Srettha Thavsin. Under military pressure, no Thai government can afford to be seen as anti-monarchy in any way. To ensure access to exiled Thai anti-monarchists, Thailand has chosen to remain at the center of this informal compact to target neighboring dissidents.

Pakistan Struggles To Bring Trade To China-Built Port – Analysis	By Sarah Zaman Pakistan is struggling to attract commercial activity to a Chinese-funded deep-sea port in the southwest that experts say is hampered by local insecurity, a lack of basic services and the absence of plans to make the port prosper. A press release issued Wednesday after a meeting chaired by Pakistani Minister for Planning and Development Ahsan Iqbal indicated that authorities do not have a plan to attract trade to the port, nearly a decade after the first container ships traveled through it in 2016. 'The minister noted the lack of commercial analysis and a comprehensive operational plan for Gwadar Port, calling for immediate efforts to unlock its potential,' the statement said. Iqbal has ordered a plan to be drawn up within six months to generate trade traffic, according to the statement. Constructed in 2007 at a cost of nearly $250 million and operated by the China Overseas Ports Holding Company since 2013, Gwadar port is situated in the warm waters of the Arabian Sea in Pakistan’s Balochistan province. Although built before the 2015 launch of the roughly $60 billion China-Pakistan Economic Corridor, the port is billed as the 'crown jewel' of the energy, infrastructure and investment project launched as part of Beijing’s Belt and Road Initiative. Despite nearly a billion dollars of additional infrastructure development in and around Gwadar city, a report by Pakistan’s Ministry of Maritime Affairs has noted that during the fiscal year 2022-23, Gwadar, the smallest of the country’s three ports, handled less than 1% of Pakistan’s seaborne trade at its three berths. 'All this is symptomatic of absence of long-term planning in Pakistan's governance system,' said Muhammad Faisal, an expert in Pakistan’s foreign policy at the Sydney-based University of Technology. 'From the beginning, Gwadar was more of a ‘geopolitical’ venture than a pure commercial case,' Faisal said in a written statement. In a bid to ramp up shipping activity in Gwadar, Prime Minister Shahbaz Sharif told a cabinet meeting Tuesday that 60% of public sector imports and exports should pass through the port. This came after Sharif ordered at least 50% of public cargo to go through the port in a Cabinet meeting last August. Former Prime Minister Shahid Khaqan Abbasi told VOA that the port lacks the infrastructure and manpower to handle massive cargo. 'Unless you spend another 3 billion to 4 billion dollars there and make a world-class port, you really can’t call it a port,' Abbasi said, criticizing what he called the Sharif government’s unrealistic approach. According to reports, the Chinese firm operating the Gwadar port plans to build a total of 100 berths by 2045. Pakistan’s largest airport by area, which was built near Gwardar port, also remains largely unused. Aviation website Skyscanner shows three weekly domestic flights to Karachi and one international flight to Oman from the massive new facility. Constructed with a $230 million Chinese grant, the opening of New Gwadar International Airport suffered several delays prior to its soft launch last month. Wednesday’s statement from the planning ministry said Iqbal directed the preparation of marketing templates and packages showcasing Gwadar’s cost-effective trade routes and potential incentives for international businesses. Insecurity, lack of services a hurdle Abbasi, who is also an aviation expert, told VOA that while the new Gwadar airport is a necessary accompaniment to the deep-sea port in the long term, the lack of basic facilities such as water, electricity and security in the city make it an unattractive destination for airlines. 'Airlines have a basic requirement that there must be passengers. No passenger wants to come to Gwadar or leave from Gwadar,' Abbasi said. Balochistan province, home to Gwadar, has been in the throes of a separatist insurgency for two decades, and violence has escalated in recent months. At least six people, mostly security personnel, and eight militants were killed recently as Pakistani forces thwarted an attack on the Gwadar Port Authority complex near the port. The port gives China a shorter route for trade with the Middle East and Central Asia. Despite Pakistan’s failure to market Gwadar port and airport to international businesses, Sydney-based expert Faisal said the project may not become a liability like Sri Lanka’s Hambantota port, which Beijing took control of in 2017 after Colombo failed to pay off debt linked with it. 'Since Pakistan fundamentally viewed Gwadar port in ‘geostrategic’ terms and contrasts it with India's cooperation with Iran in neighboring Chahbahar port, Gwadar will remain useful for Pakistan,' Faisal told VOA. Mustafa Hyder Sayed, executive director of the Islamabad-based Pakistan-China Institute, said the slow pace of business in Gwadar is not a problem for bilateral ties. 'State-to-state relations are deep-rooted in long-term strategic interests and not any [one] event; not any project or single instance can harm any state-to-state relations,' Sayed told VOA.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWeOk1RnKHsv5fJU5R20hQpX	2025-01-11T16:49:38-08:00	
Global South Solidarity Sparks A Multipolar Evolution – Analysis	The geopolitical dynamics of 2024 underscored a world in flux. From the relentless Russia-Ukraine war to mounting tensions in the South China Sea, external provocations have fueled global uncertainty. Yet, amidst the turbulence, China has maintained a steady hand, leveraging its resilience to foster an environment conducive to high-quality development. By projecting stability in a fragmented world, Beijing has reinforced its role as a crucial pillar for global equilibrium. China's growing influence within the Global South signals a shift in the global balance of power. Once a marginalized bloc, the Global South is now ascending, with Beijing at its forefront. Through initiatives promoting peace and sustainable development, China has amplified its leadership in shaping a multipolar world. This rise has not gone unnoticed in Washington, where a waning unipolar dominance faces unprecedented challenges. For decades, the United States wielded unparalleled global power, but China's ascent has forced a recalibration of this dynamic. Determined to maintain its primacy, the U.S. appears intent on curbing China's ambitions, a strategy that reflects an entrenched resistance to relinquishing its status as the world’s preeminent power. In the days of the Cold War, the world was divided into two camps, and the Non-Aligned Movement emerged as a third force. Back then, it was about politics - an assertion by the Global South that it wouldn’t be co-opted by either side. The South had its own priorities, its own problems, and a fierce desire for independence. But today, the conversation has shifted. The battleground isn’t ideology anymore; it’s economics. Take the ripple effects of sanctions on China, for example. When trade routes are obstructed, it’s the South that often pays the price. For countries striving to grow, these economic pressures are more than inconvenient - they’re devastating. This is why the idea of a united Global South is gaining traction again, but with a modern twist. It’s not just about saying 'no' to the North; it’s about building enough economic strength to chart an independent path. The South, after all, shouldn’t have to bear the brunt of decisions made elsewhere. To balance the scales, it must come together, leveraging collective power to reject unilateral impositions. In this era, solidarity isn’t just a lofty ideal; it’s an economic necessity for a fairer, more resilient world order. The West must recognize that constant pressure on the Global South is neither sustainable nor fair. The Global South, with its unique challenges and aspirations, seeks a balanced approach - not alignment with either the East or the West. For these nations, trade and access to both spheres are vital for fostering growth and development. Losing economic ties with either bloc would ripple through their economies, stalling progress and destabilizing futures. However, the Global South is still in the process of coalescing into a unified voice. As this collective takes shape, there’s a pressing need for structured collaboration to evaluate and respond to the North’s actions. This would empower these nations to manage the complexities of global power struggles while protecting their own interests. The path forward for the Global South lies in building strength through unity, ensuring their economic and developmental priorities cannot be overlooked. Globalization, with its promises of borderless trade and free markets, remains an distant dream. The world is still divided into three distinct factions - the East, West, and South - each navigating its own interests under the guise of shared ideals. Western powers, while championing free trade in rhetoric, routinely contradict this principle. Sanctions, often wielded as tools of economic dominance, are the antithesis of open markets. They stifle competition and undermine the very foundations of globalization. Take the United States, for instance. Its advocacy for free trade rings hollow when selective tariffs are applied to imports from rival nations. True free trade demands fair competition, yet the U.S. finds it challenging to match China’s economic dynamism. With its 1.4 billion consumers and vast manufacturing capabilities, China thrives in global trade, exposing the inefficiencies and higher costs entrenched in the U.S. economy. In response, Washington resorts to punitive measures - sanctions and heightened tariffs - designed to curb China’s rise. Such actions reveal the fragility of the free trade narrative. A genuine commitment to globalization requires multilateral engagement through institutions like the United Nations and the World Trade Organization. These platforms, devoid of superpower dominance, could establish equitable trade policies, including fair tax levels, to address disparities. Only through cooperation can the global community dismantle the barriers of protectionism and foster a truly competitive, inclusive market. Until then, globalization remains more myth than reality, a vision clouded by the self-interest of its loudest proponents. The rise of the Global South is exemplified by the increasing influence of BRICS, a once modest economic alliance that has grown into a formidable platform for political and security cooperation. In many ways, BRICS represents a challenge to the dominance of Western-led institutions like the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank. With its emphasis on reshaping global governance, BRICS signals a shift toward a multipolar world where power is shared more equitably among emerging and established nations. At the heart of this transformation is China, whose leadership within BRICS has been both ambitious and strategic. Beijing has championed efforts to establish alternatives to Western frameworks, notably through the New Development Bank. This institution focuses on providing infrastructure financing and supporting sustainable development projects—crucially, without the stringent conditionalities that have long been a hallmark of Western lenders. What makes this evolution particularly striking is its timing, occurring at a moment when traditional global powers appear divided and uncertain in their strategies. For BRICS nations, this is an opportunity to assert their vision of a fairer, more inclusive international system. Yet, whether this vision can fully materialize depends on whether these nations can maintain unity in their shared push for a rebalanced world order.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWeOk1RnKHsv5YjwOP08pqdw	2025-01-11T16:47:41-08:00	
Protecting Buddhist Shared Heritage: Exploring India’s Quest With...	The cultural heritage of a country is a fundamental factor in forming and shaping the identity of a nation. It becomes more significant in the context of a war-torn nation like Afghanistan. Afghanistan has been experiencing a war-like condition for the last four decades that proved disastrous for its centuries-old historical heritage. The first phase of the Taliban government in Afghanistan was a dark period for Afghan cultural heritage. However, it has been observed that Taliban 2.0 presents a different approach towards Afghanistan’s cultural heritage and its preservation. It seems that Taliban 2.0 is comparatively different towards heritage and is ready to allow preservation activities in the country. This approach of the new Taliban regime could be seen as a turning point for protecting and preserving the country’s cultural heritage. Recently, the meeting of India’s foreign secretary with the Acting Foreign Minister of Afghanistan in Dubai seems to have opened a new arena in the policy of interaction with the Taliban Government in Afghanistan. Maybe the comparative difference in the Taliban 2.0’s approach, India has decided to give preference to realpolitik policy. Here, the global community have an opportunity to save the cultural treasures of humanity and provide the people of Afghanistan with better economic opportunities. Such a change in approach is significant for India, too, as in addition to its humanitarian assistance, it can provide immediate financial and technical support to save Afghanistan's and India's shared cultural heritage. The perception of Afghanistan among the general global audience is affected by political turmoil, violence, terrorism and ethnic conflict. The takeover of political power by the Taliban administration in August 2021 further strengthened the image of the country. Afghanistan has been famous as a 'crossroad of cultures and civilisations' that shaped its society of multicultural and syncretic identities. This 'crossroad of cultures' has evolved because of its geographical location and accompanying interactions with nearby cultures. Communities from West Asia (the Persian Empire), Central Asia (Bactrian cities of the Bronze Age), South Asia (Colonies of Alexander and his Indo-Greek successors, the Kushan Empire, the Islamic Empires of Ghaznavids, Timurid Empire and Mughal Empire) and China (cultures along the Silk Route) have met in this region and communicated with each other over centuries via multiple means such as trade, commerce, migration, religious missionaries and periodic conflicts between the regional powers. Centuries of multifaceted interactions of hugely diverse cultures have led to the creation of significant and exciting treasures such as art pieces, architectural and literary developments, and archaeological sites. These heritages are of both national and international importance. Whether it is a statue of Buddha found in the Afghan land or the remains of architectural geniuses of Timurid styles, cultural symbols like these form an identity of Afghanistan. The cultural heritage of Afghanistan's pre-Islamic is present before us as a living example of its rich and glorious past. Taliban 1.0 regime’s destructive approach towards Cultural Heritage However, there must be caution in moving forward, keeping in mind that the Taliban is an ultraconservative religious and political group that emerged in the mid-1990s after the withdrawal of the Soviet forces in 1989 from Afghanistan. It literally means 'students' in the Persian language, which is generally referred to denote this political group. The Taliban were former fighters from the mujahideen groups organised to resist the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan in 1979. The withdrawal of the Soviet forces in 1989 led to political instability, resulting in the Civil war between the mujahideen factions. One such faction was organised as the Taliban in 1994, which later took control of the Afghan administration. The Taliban regime was led by Mullah Muhammad Umar, whose power base was in Qandahar. Taliban had applied the extreme interpretation of Islamic laws in the name of bringing peace and stability to the region. The guerrilla wars of the 1980s by the Mujahedin groups against the Soviets, the Civil war of the 1990s and the fundamentalist and extremist regime of the Taliban till 2001 have contributed to the destruction of the country’s age-old cultural heritage, which became the soft targets to gain finance and to give political messages to the global and domestic audiences. The rise of the Taliban government in 1996-2001 CE was the worst period for the Afghan cultural heritage, at least in the last century. Afghanistan witnessed the regime of the Taliban, which promoted the monoculture idea of Afghanistan primarily guided by their agenda of radical Islamist understanding. The excesses of the fundamentalist regime were evident when the Taliban proceeded with the destruction of the colossal statues of the Buddhas of the Bamiyan valley that had been standing there since the 2nd-4th century CE. This was despite massive opposition at the global level. The Taliban had attacked and destroyed artefacts kept in National Museum at Kabul, and several archaeological remains of the Buddhist Monastery sites such as Hadda, where the statue of Kushan emperor Kanishka reigned in this region during the 1st century CE, was destroyed. The first phase of the Taliban regime was primarily guided by its mono-cultural understanding of Afghan culture and considered the pre-Islamic Buddhist artefacts do not belong to Afghanistan’s cultural heritage. Taliban 2.0 and its pragmatic Approach The experience of the first phase of the Taliban policies towards cultural heritage brought a general belief among the people globally that the re-emergence of the Taliban regime in Afghanistan could further destroy its cultural heritage monuments. However, the approach of Taliban 2.0 since 2021 should be perceived differently. Taliban 2.0 is comparatively more prepared, more inclusive of the different ethnic tribal groups, etc., than the previous regime. Taliban 2.0 has recently started negotiations with UNESCO regarding restoring and protecting historical monuments and providing security to the state Museums and archaeological sites like Bamiyan (Bakhtar News Agency, 2023). Taliban 2.0 transcend its fundamentalist mono-cultural idea about cultural heritage and shows a comparatively inclusive approach, particularly towards the pre-Islamic Buddhist heritage of the country. It is argued that the major objective guiding the Taliban state towards this protective approach about the cultural monuments is to gain a sense of acceptance among the global community. Such an image of inclusive Afghanistan could provide them with much-needed international political and financial assistance, which was stopped in August 2021 because the Taliban regime is not yet recognised by any nation and United Nations Organisation (UNO). Global Response Despite the opening of limited diplomatic channels with Pakistan, Russia, Qatar etc., Taliban 2.0 is generally facing international isolation. The Taliban Administration in Afghanistan is continuously trying to get recognition as a legitimate government from the other nations and on the international forums. It is noteworthy that the economy of Afghanistan, even before the Taliban, was primarily based on international assistance, and due to the Taliban's control since August 2021, all such aid/assistance was stopped. Such a condition has broken down Afghanistan's economy. Since then, UNESCO (United Nations Educational Scientific and Cultural Organisation) has had to work under its planning document for the Transitional Engagement Framework (TEF). This assistance is limited to providing humanitarian support and technical support to the preservation activities due to the non-recognition of the Taliban regime in Afghanistan. It is observed that the cultural heritage is again under severe threat of destruction because of negligence and lack of scientific preservation due to halted international financial and technical support. This time, it is not the policy of the Taliban regime but the inaction of the global community responsible for the negligence. The global community must understand that the heritage of Afghanistan is a heritage of humanity whose diverse cultures interacted with each other in the past to develop such art marvels. The policies of Taliban 2.0 should be seen in the larger context as present Afghanistan is not the same as the last Taliban regime (1996-2001). Society and the economy have changed in comparison to the first Taliban regime. People are now more educated, capable, and conscious of their identity. It is also true that the Taliban compromised the democratic principles of the Western world due to its conservative and fundamental understanding of culture. However, the global community should also understand and utilise the changed approach of Taliban 2.0 towards their cultural heritage and be ready to provide security and support to international organisations in the process of preservation of cultural monuments. The cultural heritage monuments can’t wait for long as they are facing not just natural degradation but also illegal exploitation. Such degradation and exploitation would lead to the vanishing of the centuries-old heritage of humanity. International organisations should act proactively and catch the low-hanging fruits by providing financial and technical support despite the non-recognition of the Taliban regime, which Taliban 2.0 is already welcoming. An Opportunity for India India is a growing power not just in the region but globally. India’s policy towards Afghanistan had been guided by soft power and mutual friendship. The re-emergence of the Taliban regime in 2021 brought a break in their friendly relations. The current relationship between India and Afghanistan may be considered a complex one. This is because India has not yet recognised the Taliban regime as a legitimate government of Afghanistan. Still, simultaneously, the diplomatic channels between them are continuous and limited, and the recent meeting of India’s foreign secretary with Afghanistan’s acting foreign minister is a positive sign. Interestingly, the cultural heritage of Afghanistan could be understood as the shared heritage of India, too. The ancient past and history of both these countries are common because both belong to one cultural geography: the Indic civilisation zone, the Sapt Saindhava-Saraswati civilisation, and the Gandhara Buddhism in South Asia. The remains of this shared Buddhist culture of both these countries are spread in Afghanistan, facing the threat of destruction. Therefore, if India decides to support Afghanistan in preserving its cultural heritage, India is indirectly saving its own heritage. India should grab this opportunity to help the people of Afghanistan by providing financial and technical support in the field of cultural heritage preservation in addition to its humanitarian assistance, which India is currently providing to Afghanistan.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWeOk1RnKHsv5f_IMdCVDzTh	2025-01-11T16:45:49-08:00	
Government Spending Will Cause The Next Financial Crisis – OpEd	By Daniel Lacalle Crises are never caused by building excessive exposure to high-risk assets. Crises can only happen when investors, government bodies, and households accumulate risk in assets where most believe there is little to no risk. The 2008 crisis did not occur due to subprime mortgages. Those were the tips of the iceberg. Moreover, Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae, state-owned entities, guaranteed the subprime mortgage packages, which prompted numerous investors and banks to invest in them. Nobody can anticipate a crisis stemming from the potential decline in the Nvidia share price or the value of Bitcoin. In fact, if the 2008 crisis had been created by subprime mortgages, it would have been absorbed and offset in less than two weeks. The only asset that can really create a crisis is the part of banks’ balance sheets that is considered 'no risk' and, as such, requires no capital to finance their holdings: government bonds. When the price of sovereign bonds swiftly declines, the banks’ balance sheet rapidly shrinks. Even if central banks conduct quantitative easing, the spillover effect on other assets leads to the abrupt destruction of the money base and lending. The collapse in the price of the allegedly safest asset, government bonds, comes when investors must sell their existing holdings and fail to purchase the new supply issued by the states. Persistent inflation consumes the real returns of previously purchased bonds, leading to the emergence of evident solvency problems. In summary, a financial crisis serves as evidence of the state’s insolvency. When the lowest-risk asset abruptly loses value, the entire asset base of commercial banks dissolves and falls faster than the ability to issue shares or bank bonds. In fact, banks are unable to increase capital or add debt due to the declining demand for sovereign bonds, as banks are perceived as a leveraged bet on government debt. Banks do not cause financial crises. What creates a crisis is regulation, which always considers lending to governments a 'no-risk,' 'no capital required' investment even when solvency ratios are poor. Because the currency and government debt are inextricably linked, the financial crisis first manifests in the currency, which loses its purchasing power and leads to elevated inflation, and then in sovereign bonds. Keynesianism and the MMT fallacy have driven global public debt to record levels. Furthermore, the burden of unfunded liabilities is even larger than the trillions of dollars of government debt issued. The United States’ unfunded liabilities exceed 600% of GDP, according to the Financial Report of the United States Government, February 2024. In the European Union, according to Eurostat, France and Germany each accumulate unfunded liabilities that exceed 350% of GDP. According to Claudio Borio of the Bank for International Settlements, a government debt glut may cause a bond market correction that could spill over into other assets. Reuters reports that large government budget deficits suggest that sovereign debt could rise by a third by 2028 to approach $130 trillion, according to the Institute of International Finance (IIF) financial services trade group. Keynesians always say that public debt does not matter because the government can issue all it needs and has unlimited taxation power. It is simply false. Governments cannot issue all the debt they need to finance their deficit spending. They have three clear limits: The economic limit: Rising public deficits and debt cease to function as purported tools to stimulate economic growth, instead becoming a hindrance to productivity and economic development. Despite this completely false theory, most governments continue to portray themselves as engines of growth. Today, this is more evident than ever before. In the United States, every new dollar of debt brings less than 60 cents of nominal GDP growth. In France, the situation is particularly alarming, as a 6% GDP deficit results in a stagnant economy. The fiscal limit: Rising taxes generate lower-than-expected receipts, and debt continues to rise. Keynesianism believes in government as an engine of growth when it is a burden that does not create wealth and only consumes what has been created by the private sector. When taxes become confiscatory, tax receipts fail to rise, and debt soars regardless. The inflationary limit: more currency printing and government spending creates persistent annualised inflation, making citizens poorer and the real economy weaker. In most developed nations, the three limits have been clearly exceeded, but it seems that no government is willing to reduce its spending, and without spending cuts, there is no debt reduction. Irresponsible governments, forgetting that their role is to administer scarce resources rather than create debt, will trigger the next crisis. Countries like Brazil and India are seeing their currencies plummet due to concerns about the sustainability of public finances and the risk of borrowing more while inflation remains high. The euro has plummeted due to the combination of France’s fiscal woes and bureaucrats’ demands for Germany to increase its deficit spending. As always, the next crisis will be attributed to the final drop that causes the dam to collapse, but it will also be caused—as always—by government debt. Politicians’ lack of concern stems from the fact that taxpayers, families, and businesses will bear the brunt of all the adverse consequences. When the debt crisis arises, Keynesians and astute politicians will argue that the solution demands increased public spending and debt. You and I will pay.

Thirty Years Of The World Trade Organization – OpEd	By Katrina Gulliver This month marks the 30th anniversary of the beginning of the World Trade Organization. The WTO was created as a successor to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), which had been in place since 1947. GATT was formed as a method of stabilizing and restoring trade after the Second World War. But the global trade landscape had changed dramatically over the succeeding fifty years (not least the development of containerization for international shipping of goods). International trade had expanded massively, and developing nations were becoming manufacturing hubs, keen to export. The WTO was the culmination of years of talks and preparation, reflecting the ambitions of politicians to expand international trade, but also to make sure their own nations got the best deal possible. Its arrival was, however, not welcomed by all. The rounds of talks and summits for the organization’s early years were contentious, both within the discussion rooms and outside the buildings. The third round of discussions in December 1999 in Seattle saw unprecedented protests. Rather than a routine international event, with diplomatic limousines and photo opportunities, there were scenes of chaos outside. These raucous protests would become known in the press as the 'Battle of Seattle'—hardly the image President Bill Clinton had hoped to present to a global audience. Passions were running high inside the meeting too. As the Wall Street Journal reported at the time: Inside the WTO meeting, delegates from developing nations, including Pakistan, India and Brazil, threatened to block a new round of trade talks, refusing to sign any agreement to launch negotiations unless the U.S. and Europe agreed to their demands. Outside the meeting, Seattle police SWAT teams used tear gas, pepper spray, rubber pellets and billy clubs against protesters who blocked access to the WTO meeting, forcing the trade organization to cancel its opening ceremony. Later in the day, about 30,000 labor-union members marched in a display of anti-WTO fervor. Horrified, Seattle Mayor Paul Schell instituted a curfew and called in the National Guard. The protesters had support too: the International Longshore and Warehouse Union held work stoppages at the ports of Seattle, Tacoma, and Oakland. In Seattle, the protesters were supported by a number of NGOs, particularly labor rights and environmental groups, who had planned the protests for months. The American Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial Organizations (AFL-CIO) also held a rally. In London, simultaneous action by anti-WTO activists included attacking police, and a train station was shut down. In retrospect, the WTO planners should have seen it coming. Anti-globalist feelings had been building up steam in the 1990s. Two years before the Seattle talks, there had been similar protests at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) meeting in Vancouver. Anti-WTO sentiment brought together disparate groups, from workers’ rights campaigners and right-wing nationalists to environmentalists (and any number of other hangers-on). It’s a fascinating artifact of that moment in political shifts to see anti-WTO protesters waving the Gadsden Flag. But the WTO was the result of years of working towards liberalizing trade, spurred on further by the collapse of the Soviet Bloc. Of course it did not create 'free trade' everywhere (if it had, there would be no need for such an organization to exist). It was there to promote free-er trade, while also allowing members to push for particular national protections. (In a world of truly free trade, there would also be no 'trade talks.') We can be cynical that it is just another talking-shop of rent-seekers, as so many other international agencies seem to be. But it has brought more countries into networks of international markets. In 2001, China would join the WTO, probably the biggest shift in global trade for decades, as Asia became the world’s manufacturing center—a fact that is still causing economic ripples throughout the West. Today, the WTO has 166 members, accounting for 98 percent of world trade. It hasn’t removed the issue of national tariffs, protectionism, or concern about globalization (from all political angles). An ongoing sticking point, for example, has been agricultural subsidies in the EU and the USA. But it marks a step in the long road of international trade that started when the first ships headed out in the Classical world, to trade goods around the Mediterranean. Today all of us can buy things produced across the globe: and our daily life is based on this level of access and cooperation. Happy Birthday, WTO.

Wildfires And The Hoary Hoax Of A Burning Planet – OpEd	Here they go again, blaming the wildfire catastrophe in Los Angeles on Climate Change when the actual culprits are the very politicians who never stop howling about what is a monumental hoax. In the first place, of course, the current raging California fires, like those which have periodically gone before, are largely a function of misguided government policies. Officials have essentially curtailed the supply of water available to LA firefighters, even as they have drastically increased the supply of combustible kindling and vegetation which feeds these wildfires. The latter, in turn, are being amplified by the seasonal Santa Ana winds, which have visited the California coast since time immemorial. The kindling at issue stems from forest management policies that prevent the removal of excess fuel via controlled burns, which are fires intentionally set by forest managers to reduce the buildup of hazardous fuels. As we amplify below, red tape and bureaucratic obstacles have frequently delayed or prevented these controlled burns, allowing brush, dead trees, and other flammable materials to accumulate excessively. In this case, state and Federal politicians have simultaneously curtailed the supply of water available to Los Angeles firefighters in order to protect so-called endangered species. Specifically, southern California is being held hostage by sharp curtailment of the water pumping rates from the Sacramento-San Joaquin River Delta in order to protect the Delta Smelt and Chinook Salmon. These former are shiny but tiny little buggers, as suggested by the handful of Smelt in the first picture below. But apparently, if they are protected, fished, and then fried up, they make for a certain kind of delicacy. Needless to say, California is entitled to stew in the foolishness of its own policies—if that’s what its voters really want. But its self-imposed misery should not be an occasion for more howling in favor of Washington policies to fight climate change. At least with respect to the latter, the Donald has his head screwed on right. And he does not hesitate to opine on the matter, which is all to the good of balancing what has otherwise been a wholly one-sided and utterly misleading Climate Crisis narrative. Naturally, the latter has been promulgated and peddled by statists because it provides yet one more big, scary, and urgent reason for an 'all of government' campaign of more spending, borrowing, regulating, and the curtailing of free market enterprise and personal liberty. So let us once again review the bogus case for AGW or what is known as Anthropogenic Global Warming. And perforce it must start with the geological and paleontological evidence, which overwhelmingly says that today’s average global temperature of about 15 degrees C and CO2 concentrations of 420 ppm are nothing to fret about. And even if they rise to about 17-18 degrees C and 500-600 ppms, respectively, by the end of the century owing mainly to a natural warming cycle that has been underway since the end of the Little Ice Age (LIA) in 1850, it may well on balance improve the lot of mankind. After all, bursts of civilization during the last 10,000 years uniformly occurred during the warmer red portion of the graph below. The great civilizations of the Yellow, Indus, Nile, and Tigris/Euphrates river valleys, the Minoan era, the Greco-Roman civilization, the Medieval flowering, and the industrial and technological revolutions of the present era all were enabled by periods of elevated temperatures. At the same time, the several lapses into 'dark ages' happened when the climate turned colder (blue). And that’s only logical. When it’s warmer and wetter, growing seasons are longer and crop yields are better—regardless of the agricultural technology and practices of the moment. And it’s better for human and community health, too—most of the deadly plagues of history have occurred under colder climes, such as the Black Death of 1344-1350. Yet the Climate Crisis narrative deep-sixes this massive body of 'the science' by means of two deceptive devices. Without them, the entire AGW story doesn’t have much of a leg to stand on. First, it ignores the entirety of the planet’s pre-Holocene (last 10,000 years) history, even though the science shows that more than 90% of the time in the last 600 million years global temperatures (blue line) and CO2 levels (black line) have been higher than at present; and that 50% of the time they were much higher—with temperatures in the range of 22 degrees C or 50% higher than current levels. That’s far beyond anything projected by the most unhinged climate models today. But, crucially, the planetary climate systems did not go into a doomsday loop of ever increasing temperatures ending in a scorching meltdown. To the contrary, warming epochs were always checked and reversed by powerful countervailing forces. Even the history the alarmists do acknowledge has been grotesquely falsified. As we have demonstrated elsewhere, the so-called 'hockey stick' of the most recent 1,000 years in which temperatures were allegedly flat until 1850 and are now rising to supposedly dangerous levels is a complete crock. It was fraudulently manufactured by the IPCC (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change) to 'cancel' the fact that temperatures in the pre-industrial world of the Medieval Warm Period (1000-1200 AD) were actually significantly higher than at present. Secondly, it is falsely claimed that global warming is a one-way street in which rising concentrations of greenhouse gases (GHGs) and especially CO2 is causing the earth’s heat balance to continuously increase. The truth, however, is that higher CO2 concentrations are a consequence and byproduct, not a driver and cause, of the current naturally rising (and falling) global temperature cycles. Again, the now 'canceled' history of Planet Earth knocks the CO2-forcing proposition into a cocked hat. During the Cretaceous Period between 145 and 66 million years (third orange panel) ago a natural experiment provided complete absolution for the vilified CO2 molecule. During that period, global temperatures rose dramatically from 17 degrees C to 25 degrees C—a level far above anything today’s Climate Howlers have ever projected. Alas, CO2 wasn’t the culprit. According to the science, ambient CO2 concentrations actually tumbled during the 80 million years expanse of the Cretaceous, dropping from 2,000 ppm to 900 ppm on the eve of the Extinction Event 66 million years ago. So temperature and CO2 concentrations actually moved in the opposite directions. Big time. You would think that this powerful countervailing fact would give the CO2 witch-hunters pause, but that would be to ignore what the whole climate change brouhaha is actually about. That is, it’s not about science, human health, and well-being, or the survival of Planet Earth; it’s about politics and the ceaseless search of politicians and statists for control of modern economic and social life. The resulting aggrandizement of state power, in turn, is mightily assisted by the Beltway political class and the apparatchiks and racketeers who gain power and pelf from the anti-fossil fuels campaign. Indeed, the Climate Crisis narrative is the kind of ritualized policy mantra that has been concocted over and again by the political class and the permanent nomenklatura of the modern state—professors, think-tankers, lobbyists, career apparatchiks, officialdom—in order to gather and exercise state power. To paraphrase the great Randolph Bourne, inventing purported failings of capitalism—such as a propensity to burn too much hydrocarbon—is the health of the state. Indeed, fabrication of false problems and threats that purportedly can only be solved by heavy-handed state intervention has become the modus operandi of a political class that has usurped near complete control of modern democracy. So doing, however, the career political class and associated ruling elites have gotten used to such unimpeded success that they have become sloppy, superficial, careless, and dishonest. For instance, the minute we get a summer heat wave or an event like the current LA fires these natural weather events are jammed into the global warming narrative with nary a second thought by the lip-syncing journalists of the MSM. Yet there is absolutely no scientific basis for all this tom-tom beating. For instance, on the related issue of heat waves and dry period wildfires, NOAA publishes a heat wave index. The latter is based on extended temperature spikes which last more than 4 days and which would be expected to occur only once every ten years based on the historical data. As is evident from the chart below, the only true heat wave spikes we have had in the last 125 years were during the Dust Bowl heat waves of the 1930s. The frequency of mini-heat wave spikes since 1960 is actually no greater than it was during the 1895-1935 period. Likewise, all it takes is a good Cat 3 hurricane and they are off to the races, gumming loudly about AGW. Of course, this ignores entirely NOAA’s own data as summarized in what is known as the ACE (accumulated cyclone energy) index. This index was first developed by the renowned hurricane expert and Colorado State University professor, William Gray. It uses a calculation of a tropical cyclone’s maximum sustained winds every six hours. The latter is then multiplied by itself to get the index value and accumulated for all storms for all regions to get an index value for the entire year. That’s shown below for the past 170 years (the blue line is the seven-year rolling average). Your editor has an especially high regard for Professor Gray—not the least because he was roundly vilified by the very inexpert, Al Gore. But back in our private equity days, we invested in a Property-Cat company, which was in the super-hazardous business of insuring against the extreme layers of damage caused by very bad hurricanes and earthquakes. So setting the premiums correctly was no trifling business and it was the analytics, long-term databases, and current-year forecasts of Professor Gray upon which our underwriters crucially depended. That is to say, hundreds of billions of insurance cover was then and still is being written with the ACE index as a crucial input. Yet if you examine the 7-year rolling average (blue line) in the chart, it is evident that ACE was as high (or higher) in the 1950s and 1960s as it is today, and that the same was true of the late 1930s and the 1880-1900 periods. To be sure, the blue line is not flat as a board because there are natural short-term cycles, as amplified below, which drive the fluctuations shown in the chart. But there is no 'science' extractable from the chart that supports the alleged linkage between the current natural warming cycle and worsening hurricanes. The above is an aggregate index of all storms and is therefore as comprehensive a measure as exists. But for want of doubt, the next three panels look at hurricane data at the individual storm count level. The pink portion of the bars represent the number of big, dangerous Cat 3-5 storms, while the red portion reflects the number of lesser Cat 1-2 storms and the blue area the number of tropical storms that did not reach Cat 1 intensity. The bars accumulate the number of storms in 5-year intervals and reflect recorded activity back to 1851. The reason we present three panels—for the Eastern Caribbean, Western Caribbean, and Bahamas/Turks and Caicos, respectively, is that the trends in these three sub-regions clearly diverge. And that’s actually the smoking gun. If global warming was generating more hurricanes as the MSM constantly maintains, the increase would be uniform across all of these sub-regions, but it’s clearly not. Since the year 2000, for example, The Eastern Caribbean has had a modest increase in both tropical storms and higher rated Cats relative to most of the past 170 years; The Western Caribbean has not been unusual at all, and, in fact, has been well below the higher counts during the 1880-1920 period; The Bahamas/Turks and Caicos region since 2000 has actually been well weaker than during 1930-1960 and 1880-1900. The actual truth of the matter is that Atlantic hurricane activity is generated by atmospheric and ocean temperature conditions in the eastern Atlantic and North Africa. Those forces, in turn, are heavily influenced by the presence of an El Nino or La Nina in the Pacific Ocean. El Niño events increase the wind shear over the Atlantic, producing a less favorable environment for hurricane formation and decreasing tropical storm activity in the Atlantic basin. Conversely, La Niña causes an increase in hurricane activity due to a decrease in wind shear. These Pacific Ocean events, of course, have never been correlated with the low level of natural global warming now underway. The number and strength of Atlantic hurricanes may also undergo a 50–70-year cycle known as the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation. Again, these cycles are unrelated to global warming trends since 1850. Still, scientists have reconstructed Atlantic major hurricane activity back to the early 18th century (@1700) and found five periods with elevated hurricane activity averaging 3–5 major hurricanes per year and lasting 40–60 years each; and six other more quiescent periods averaging 1.5–2.5 major hurricanes per year and lasting 10–20 years each. These periods are associated with a decadal oscillation related to solar irradiance, which is responsible for enhancing/dampening the number of major hurricanes by 1–2 per year, and clearly not a product of AGW. Moreover, like in so many other cases the very long-term records of storm activity also rule out AGW because there was none for most of the time during the last 3,000 years, for instance. Yet according to a proxy record for that period from coastal lake sediments on Cape Cod, hurricane activity has increased significantly during the last 500-1,000 years versus earlier periods–but even that increase happened long before temperatures and carbon concentrations reached 20th-century levels. In short, there is no reason to believe that these well understood precursor conditions and longer-term hurricane trends have been impacted by the modest increase in average global temperatures since the LIA ended in 1850. As it happens, the same story is true with respect to wildfires like the current LA inferno. This has been the third category of natural disaster that the Climate Howlers have glommed onto. But in this case it’s the aforementioned bad forestry management, not man-made global warming, which has turned much of California into a dry wood fuel dump. And don’t take our word for it. This quotation below comes from the George Soros-funded Pro Publica, which is not exactly a right-wing tin foil hat outfit. It points out that environmentalists have so shackled Federal and state forest management agencies that today’s tiny 'controlled burns' are but an infinitesimal fraction of what Mother Nature herself accomplished before the helping hand of today’s purportedly enlightened political authorities arrived on the scene: Academics believe that between 4.4 million and 11.8 million acres burned each year in prehistoric California. Between 1982 and 1998, California’s agency land managers burned, on average, about 30,000 acres a year. Between 1999 and 2017, that number dropped to an annual 13,000 acres. The state passed a few new laws in 2018 designed to facilitate more intentional burning. But few are optimistic this, alone, will lead to significant change. We live with a deathly backlog. In February 2020, Nature Sustainability published this terrifying conclusion: California would need to burn 20 million acres — an area about the size of Maine — to restabilize in terms of fire. In short, if you don’t clear and burn out the deadwood, you build up nature-defying tinderboxes that then require only a lightning strike, a spark from an unrepaired power line, or human carelessness to ignite into a raging inferno. As one 40-year conservationist and expert summarized, …There’s only one solution, the one we know yet still avoid. 'We need to get good fire on the ground and whittle down some of that fuel load.' The failure to do just such controlled burns is exactly what is behind the LA wildfire today. That is, a dramatically larger human footprint in the fire-prone shrublands and chaparral (dwarf trees) areas along the coasts has increased the risk residents will start fires, accidentally or otherwise. California’s population doubled from 1970 to 2020, from about 20 million people to nearly 40 million people, and nearly all of the gain was in the coastal areas. Under those conditions, California’s strong, naturally-occurring winds, which crest periodically, as is occurring at the moment, are the main culprit which fuels and spreads the human-set blazes in the shrublands. The Diablo winds in the north of the state and the Santa Ana winds in the south can actually reach hurricane force, as has also been the case this week. As the winds move West over California mountains and down toward the coast, they compress, warm, and intensify. These winds, in turn, blow flames and carry embers, spreading the fires quickly before they can be contained. And on top of that, the Santa Ana winds also function as Mother Nature’s blow dryer. As they come down the mountains toward the sea, the hot winds dry the surface vegetation and deadwood rapidly and powerfully, paving the way for the blowing embers to fuel the spread of wildfires down the slopes. Among other proofs that industrialization and fossil fuels aren’t the culprit is the fact that researchers have shown that when California was occupied by indigenous communities, wildfires would burn up some 4.5 million acres a year. That’s nearly 6X the level experienced during the 2010-2019 period, when wildfires burned an average of just 775,000 acres annually in California. Beyond the untoward clash of all of these natural forces of climate and ecology with misguided government forest and shrubland husbandry policies, there is actually an even more dispositive smoking gun, as it were. To wit, the Climate Howlers have at least not yet embraced the patent absurdity that the planet’s purportedly rising temperatures have targeted the Blue State of California for special punishment. Yet when we look at the data for forest fires we find, alas, that unlike California and Oregon, the US as a whole experienced the weakest fire years in 2020 since 2010. That’s right. As of August 24 each year, the 10-year average burn had been 5.114 million acres across the US, but in 2020 it was 28% lower at 3.714 million acres. National fire data year to date: Indeed, what the above chart shows is that on a national basis there has been no worsening trend at all during the decade ending in 2020, just huge oscillations year-to-year driven not by some grand planetary heat vector but by changing local weather and ecological conditions. You just can’t go from 2.7 million burned acres in 2010 to 7.2 million acres in 2012, back to 2.7 million acres in 2014, then to 6.7 million acres in 2017, followed by just 3.7 million acres in 2020—and still argue along with the Climate Howlers that the planet is angry. To the contrary, the only real trend evident is that on a decadal basis during recent times there is just one place where the average forest fire acreage has been slowly rising—California! But that’s owing to the above described dismal failure of government forest management policies. Even then, California’s mildly rising average fire acreage trend since 1950 is a rounding error compared to the annual averages from prehistoric times, which were nearly 6X greater than during the most recent decade. Furthermore, the gently rising trend since 1950, as shown below, should not be confused with the Climate Howlers’ bogus claim that California’s fires have 'grown more apocalyptic every year,' as the New York Times reported. In fact, the NYT was comparing the above average burn during 2020 versus that of 2019, which saw an unusually small amount of acreage burned. That is, just 280,000 acres in 2019 compared to 1.3 million and 1.6 million in 2017 and 2018, respectively, and 775,000 on average over the last decade. Nor is this lack of correlation with global warming just a California and US phenomena. As shown in the chart below, the global extent of fire-causing drought, measured by five levels of severity with dark brown being the most extreme, has shown no worsening trend at all during the past 40 years. This brings us to the gravamen of the case. To wit, there is no angry weather signal of impending climate crisis whatsoever. But the AGW hoax has so thoroughly contaminated the mainstream narrative and the policy apparatus in Washington and capitals all around the world that contemporary society was fixing to commit economic Hara Kari—well, until Donald Trump came along vowing to pull the entire Team America off the playing field of global green nonsense. And for damn good reason. In contradistinction to the phony case that the rise of fossil fuel use after 1850 has caused the planetary climate system to become unglued, there has been a sharp acceleration of global economic growth and human well-being. And one essential element behind that salutary development has been the massive increase in the use of cheap fossil fuels to power economic life. The chart below could not be more dispositive. During the pre-industrial era between 1500 and 1870, global real GDP crawled along at just 0.41% per annum. By contrast, during the past 150 years of the fossil fuel age global GDP growth accelerated to 2.82% per annum–or nearly 7 times faster. This higher growth, of course, in part resulted from a larger and far healthier global population made possible by rising living standards. Yet it wasn’t human muscle alone that caused the GDP level to go parabolic as per the chart below. It was also due to the fantastic mobilization of intellectual capital and technology. And one of the most important vectors of the latter was the ingenuity of the fossil fuel industry in unlocking the massive trove of stored work that Mother Nature extracted, condensed, and salted away from the incoming solar energy over the long warmer and wetter eons of the past 600 million years. Needless to say, the curve of world energy consumption tightly matches the rise of global GDP shown above. Thus, in 1860 global energy consumption amounted to 30 exajoules per year and virtually 100% of that was represented by the blue layer labeled 'bio-fuels,' which is just a polite name for firewood and the decimation of the forests which it entailed. Since then, annual energy consumption has increased 18-fold to 550 exajoules (@100 billion barrels of oil equivalent), but 90% of that gain was due to natural gas, coal, and petroleum. The modern world and today’s prosperous global economy would simply not exist absent the massive increase in the use of these efficient fuels, meaning that per capita income and living standards would otherwise be only a small fraction of current levels. Yes, that dramatic increase in prosperity-generating fossil fuel consumption has given rise to a commensurate increase in CO2 emissions. But as we have indicated, and contrary to the Climate Crisis narrative, CO2 is not a pollutant! As we have seen, the correlated increase in CO2 concentrations—from about 290 ppm to 415 ppm since 1850—amounts to a rounding error in both the long trend of history and in terms of atmospheric loadings from natural sources. As to the former, CO2 concentrations of less than 1000 ppm are only recent developments of the last ice age, while during prior geologic ages concentrations reached as high as 2400 ppm. Likewise, the oceans contain an estimated 37,400 billion tons of suspended carbon, land biomass has 2,000-3,000 billion tons, and the atmosphere contains 720 billion tons of CO2 or 20X more than current fossil emissions shown below. Of course, the opposite side of the equation is that oceans, land, and atmosphere exchange CO2 continuously so the incremental loadings from human sources is very small. More importantly, even a small shift in the balance between oceans and the atmosphere would cause a much more severe rise/fall in CO2 concentrations than anything attributable to human activity. But since the Climate Howlers falsely postulate that the pre-industrial level of 290 parts per million was extant since the Big Bang and that the modest rise since 1850 is a one-way ticket to boiling the planet alive, they obsess over the 'sources versus sinks' balance in the carbon cycle for no valid reason whatsoever. Actually, the continuously shifting carbon balance of the planet over any reasonable period of time is a big, so what!

Reimagining State Structures In Bangladesh: A Critical Examinatio...	This article examines Bangladesh Nationalist Party's '31-Point Outline for Structural Reforms' through a critical analysis of its proposed democratic transformation agenda. Through systematic examination of the reform proposals, the study explores how these recommendations seek to reconstruct state-society relations, strengthen democratic institutions, and address deep-rooted governance challenges in Bangladesh. The analysis reveals that whilst the Outline presents an ambitious vision for institutional reorganisation—encompassing electoral reforms, judicial autonomy, economic justice, and minority rights—its efficacy ultimately depends on navigating entrenched power structures and institutional inertia. Drawing upon democratic theory and institutional analysis, this research demonstrates that successful implementation requires more than legislative amendments; it necessitates fundamental shifts in political culture, robust accountability mechanisms, and sustained civic engagement. The findings suggest that bridging the gap between reformist aspirations and practical implementation demands careful attention to resource allocation, cross-party consensus building, and the empowerment of historically marginalised groups. This study contributes to scholarly discussions on democratic transformation in developing nations by highlighting the complex interplay between formal institutional reforms and informal power dynamics that shape their implementation. Bangladesh's political landscape has long been shaped by the tension between top-down authority, recurrent electoral disputes, and a populace calling for more democratic accountability. In this context, a document referred to as the '31-Point Outline for Structural Reforms in Bangladesh,' purportedly issued by a major political party, maps a broad agenda for reconfiguring governance, upholding human rights, promoting socio-economic equity, and nurturing a more participatory public sphere. By addressing varied domains—from the consolidation of caretaker governance and constitutional checks to environmental stewardship and economic reorientation—the proposals collectively aim to reset the relationship between the state and its citizens, symbolically transferring the 'lost ownership' of the country back to the people. Yet no reform blueprint can be analysed solely at the level of policy prescriptions. The dynamics of institutional inertia, political culture, economic inequalities, and local power structures profoundly influence whether proclaimed reforms translate into substantive transformations. An in-depth reading of these proposals, therefore, benefits from an array of conceptual perspectives, each illuminating certain dimensions of power, discourse, social justice, or capacity-building. This article critically scrutinises each cluster of recommendations in the Outline—exploring how they might reconfigure the balance of authority, the mechanisms of accountability, and the possibilities for public autonomy. It also highlights structural constraints that might undermine or distort these measures, emphasising the challenges of bridging ideals and entrenched practices. The Context and Ambitions of Reform The Outline was formulated against a background of polarised competition, controversies over voting processes, allegations of widespread corruption, and prevalent concerns about the accountability of state agencies. It enumerates a vision for robust democratic institutions, from caretaker election bodies (Points 3, 8) to stricter limitations on prime ministerial terms (Point 5), a reformed judiciary (Points 9, 10), and local governments free of central overreach (Point 21). The document's impetus for a 'public-welfare government of national consensus' underscores a rhetorical commitment to pluralism and dialogue. However, the structural depth of these proposals varies. Some points focus on constitutional mechanics—such as the reintroduction of referendums or the creation of a second legislative chamber (Point 6)—while others advocate socio-economic reforms, including fair wages for workers (Point 17), universal healthcare (Point 26), and an equitable approach to agricultural markets (Point 27). Additional priorities encompass media freedom (Point 12), respect for minority rights (Point 16), and the eradication of extrajudicial violence (Point 14). By weaving these strands together, the Outline signals a comprehensive attempt to redefine both the architecture of the state and the ethos underpinning its relationship to society. The critical question is whether these intentions can overcome historical tendencies: the concentration of power in a dominant executive, the partisan capture of institutions, deep-rooted hierarchies, and a tradition in which opposing factions often equate governance with partisan consolidation. Any thorough critique requires attention to the tension between rhetorical declarations of radical change and the pragmatic complexities of real politics. Public Dialogue, Communicative Spaces, and Unity A key dimension in democratic theory highlights the importance of an open public sphere that fosters transparent debates and inclusive discourse. Various points in the Outline recognise that social and political polarisation in Bangladesh has compromised open dialogue. The impetus for media liberalisation and the establishment of an independent commission (Point 12) attests to an understanding that free expression and investigative journalism can serve as bulwarks against authoritarian or oligarchic impulses. However, dismantling prior constraints on freedom of expression necessitates more than simply repealing oppressive laws; it demands a systematic cultural shift whereby critical commentary—by journalists, civil society, or opposition figures—is protected both in law and practice. Without robust legal remedies, accountability measures, and the consistent removal of intimidation or violence from the media realm, commissions risk becoming merely ornamental. Equally, references to forging a 'Rainbow Nation' (Point 2) exemplify an ambition to unite diverse ideological, cultural, and religious communities under a reconciliatory ethos. While symbolically appealing, ensuring that different segments of society truly feel recognised and secure in sharing their perspectives demands explicit institutional frameworks—inter-party dialogues, community-based deliberative councils, and impartial adjudication bodies—to replace zero-sum partisanship with a culture of trustful engagement. Thus, if the goal is to reconstitute an environment in which wide-ranging debate flourishes, the success of these measures depends on thorough, practical safeguards. A society historically burdened by repressive or polarised governance structures will not spontaneously shift towards authentic communication. Instead, new policies must root themselves in deeper public education, the introduction of transparent licensing regimes or ownership regulations that prevent monopolistic control of media, and reliable protection against targeted harassment. Power Dynamics, Law Enforcement, and Administrative Reform Another interpretive lens focuses on the hidden interplay of power within institutions, especially in contexts where undisclosed or coercive practices permeate the state's dealings with citizens. Indeed, the Outline directly addresses forced disappearances, extrajudicial killings, and alleged partisan manipulation of law enforcement agencies (Points 14, 8, 11). It calls for a reorientation that eschews such brutality, expands merit-based recruitment, and establishes impartial oversight commissions. But rhetorical condemnations of state violence are insufficient unless states undertake a fundamental reorganisation of security forces, intelligence units, and paramilitary powers. Institutional cultures that normalise intimidation or extra-legal operations can remain entrenched even if certain laws or directives are rescinded. Achieving meaningful progress means codifying strict procedures, requiring transparent reporting, penalising wrongdoing with seriousness, and ensuring that officials or military personnel implicated in prior abuses face judicial scrutiny. Only with credible accountability will the structural reliance on fear-based control begin to ebb. Administrative reforms, similarly, may remove direct political appointments, as the Outline proposes (Point 21), but if local functionaries, bureaucrats, or military leaders remain embedded within influential networks, the distribution of appointments and promotions could still follow patterns of patronage. Internal reorganisation that fosters a genuine ethic of public service, governed by competence and monitored through independent review, is pivotal. Such transformations often entail protracted battles with factional or personal interests for whom existing structures deliver power and resource benefits. Socio-Economic Capacity and Equitable Outcomes A broader perspective on development underscores that viable democracy and the exercise of public freedoms depend on underlying socio-economic conditions. The text's pledges to empower workers, create unemployment allowances, expand healthcare, and invest in agricultural livelihoods (Points 17, 23, 26, 27) reflect an understanding that political participation and personal dignity are undermined by extreme inequality, impoverishment, and precarious labour arrangements. By emphasising fair wages, child labour elimination, and robust healthcare, the Outline hints at bridging the gap between rhetorical emphasis on democratic ideals and the tangible means by which citizens can engage public life. However, implementing universal coverage in health or comprehensive worker safeguards requires sustainable financing, legislative backing, and cultural acceptance of reformed labour standards. Without an effective administrative apparatus for distribution—unbiased, transparent, and immune to patronage—these socio-economic promises might result in sporadic or politicised allocations. Political elites may resist channelling resources toward large-scale social spending that does not align with immediate electoral incentives. Additionally, the breadth of reforms demanded—covering health, agriculture, energy, and more—calls for long-term strategic planning, cross-party consensus, and institutional stability that can survive electoral cycles. Revisiting Identity, Minorities, and Inclusion While broad statements about reconciling divisions appear in multiple sections, two aspects stand out: the vow to protect minority communities and the focus on women's empowerment. The document commits to upholding the rights of ethnic and religious groups, protecting their assets from seizure or forced occupation (Point 16), and ensuring that women gain stronger representation in governance and national building (Point 24). These measures align with a perspective that any legitimate democratic transformation requires substantive recognition of historical injustices and the inclusion of marginalised groups in policy decisions. Yet rhetorical support for minority or female participation only gains traction if anchored in well-defined statutory frameworks and budgetary commitments. For minority protections to transcend tokenism, legal processes must be transparent, swift, and accessible, enabling redress whenever discrimination arises. Women's political representation, likewise, must go beyond seat reservations or rhetorical commitments; parties need to integrate women systematically into leadership structures, candidate selection, and the broader workings of policymaking committees. Without persistent vigilance—through dedicated commissions, civil society networks, and the empowerment of local communities—dominant groups might revert to established patterns of exclusion and paternalistic control. Constitutional and Electoral Architecture A central thrust of the Outline is restructuring how Bangladesh governs itself at the highest levels. The caretaker government approach to elections, the call for an independent Election Commission, the creation of a second legislative chamber, and constraints on the prime minister's tenure (Points 3, 4, 5, 6, 8) collectively underscore an ambition to prevent hyper-centralised authority and to foster balanced power-sharing. Historically, in contexts where a single party dominates or where the executive exerts overwhelming control, elections often fall under suspicion of partiality, and legislative independence remains symbolic at best. Revising these architectural pillars may indeed mitigate the risks of electoral manipulations or indefinite power accumulation. Still, merely codifying caretaker mechanisms or legislative bicameralism does not guarantee impartial practice. Powerful individuals might continue to sway caretaker arrangements, or legislatures could remain gridlocked along partisan lines. In many countries, second chambers have struggled to deliver the intended benefits of expertise and balanced representation, sometimes turning into elite clubs unresponsive to grassroots voices. The measure's success depends on how membership is chosen, how jurisdiction is assigned, and whether processes are transparent, with broad civic engagement. If these structural changes proceed in a vacuum, divorced from a deeper reformation of party culture or grassroots empowerment, they could replicate the same patterns of centralised, partisan politics in new institutional forms. Transforming Public Expression and Media Freedoms Another prominent motif in the Outline calls for robust press liberties, a repeal of draconian laws controlling expression, and the creation of an independent body to oversee media standards (Point 12). This emphasis acknowledges that any democracy reliant solely on cyclical elections, without sustained public scrutiny and critique, risks sliding into majoritarian or authoritarian habits. By guaranteeing open avenues for critique, investigative reporting, and editorial independence, the proposals gesture towards a more dynamic public sphere. However, reconfiguring the legislative environment around free speech does not alone ensure that journalists, authors, or opposition activists will feel safe. Media owners and corporate interests often coalesce with political actors, shaping editorial lines. Legislative changes must therefore be accompanied by cultural acceptance that invests in the principle of media neutrality, fosters training for journalists, and penalises intimidation from powerful elites. Equally, a commission formed to champion press freedom must be shielded from infiltration by those whose tacit interest is to preserve manipulative or hegemonic media narratives. Law, Accountability, and Judicial Autonomy The Outline frequently stresses the importance of establishing an independent judiciary, reintroducing a mechanism for judicial oversight, and guaranteeing that appointments are free from partisan manipulation (Points 9, 10). It also proposes new disciplinary frameworks for sub-ordinate courts, emphasising that legal independence is constitutionally mandated. Cultivating a strong, impartial judiciary is fundamental to enforcing the broad array of reforms described—otherwise, the entire enterprise of caretaker governance, anti-corruption drives, and human rights protection could dissolve into rhetorical posturing. Even so, forging autonomy for the bench typically contends with tradition-laden practices of clientelistic judicial appointments and a reluctance to investigate alleged misconduct among judges. A reformed judicial system necessitates a broader cultural transformation in which legal professionals themselves, along with political actors, internalise the principle that justice must not be a function of patronage or intimidation. Absent a holistic approach—one linking legislative changes with professional codes, an ethics commission, and transparent procedures for selection, promotion, and discipline—the proposed independence can be undermined by intangible yet powerful influences. Economic Reforms, Environmental Stewardship, and National Resources Large sections of the Outline go beyond governance or electoral matters, delving into economic restructuring: bridging wealth divides, boosting investment, supporting local agriculture and industry, and halting questionable energy sector deals (Points 15, 17, 18, 27). The approach suggests that democracy cannot thrive unless socio-economic disparities are tackled at scale, be that through fair commodity pricing, strong labour laws, or integrated 'Economic Reforms Commissions.' The Outline also references the environment, climate challenges, and resource management (Points 29, 18), acknowledging that ecological well-being intersects intimately with human development. While this broad scope is laudable, its success depends on addressing longstanding complexities. Eliminating corruption in power purchase arrangements or awarding transparent investment incentives means confronting entrenched ties between business elites and government officials. Similarly, bridging regional infrastructure gaps or fostering agro-processing industries requires multi-year investment plans, with consistent policy even through electoral transitions—something difficult to sustain where partisan competition frequently leads to abrupt policy reversals. The proposed shift to 'renewable and mixed energy-based power generation' also calls for capital, technology transfers, and capacity-building for energy governance agencies. Rhetorically, it might be straightforward to declare the termination of 'anti-people quick rental power plants,' but actual implementation involves negotiations with foreign investors, potential legal disputes, and recalibrated national budgets. State-Society Engagement and Local Empowerment Another dimension of the Outline addresses decentralisation (Points 21, 22), the strengthening of local bodies, and new ways of recognising the contributions of diverse societal groups, including participants in the liberation war (Point 22). By devolving power from the centre and providing local councils with budgetary authority and legislative autonomy, the proposals seek to make governance more responsive and less prone to top-down dictates. However, effectively transferring these competencies means reconfiguring intergovernmental relations so that local units can raise revenue, manage service delivery, and maintain accountability to citizens, free from intrusive influence by national or administrative officials. Achieving such a shift also depends on local capacity—do these councils have technically skilled staff, robust accounting, and a measure of independence in policy decisions? If national authorities reserve the right to remove local representatives or appoint administrators in any vaguely defined 'emergency,' the stated principle of local empowerment might be hollow. Additionally, the success of local government reforms depends on bridging the gap between the declared principle of non-partisanship and the reality that local elections in Bangladesh, as in many contexts, can be heavily shaped by national-level party allegiances. Intersections of Justice and Representation Provisions concerning transitional justice (Point 14), anti-corruption measures (Point 13), or widespread structural changes in the judicial, administrative, and security spheres converge around a broader question: how do these proposals address the deep-seated injustices that have accumulated over decades? While the Outline frequently cites removing draconian laws and punishing those who misused power, the continuum from violations to institutional complicity is not straightforwardly undone by prospective statutes. Genuine accountability demands official truth-gathering, transparent legal proceedings, an opportunity for public testimonies, and a shift in the social norms that legitimated or tolerated abuses. The mention of a 'white paper' on corruption or an 'Ombudsman' under the constitution indicates a recognition of the severity of wrongdoing. Implementation, however, could be stifled if the political elites, facing allegations themselves, stifle or sabotage these processes. Without an overarching supportive context, including independent prosecutors and non-partisan investigative agencies, the impetus for accountability can collapse into partial or selective prosecutions used against political foes. Meanwhile, the Outline's endeavour to incorporate women more deeply in national building (Point 24) and protect religious or ethnic minorities (Point 16) resonates with the concept of justice that emphasises redistribution, recognition of difference, and inclusive representation. Yet ensuring that historically excluded groups have a consistent voice in shaping, monitoring, and revising reforms is essential if these points are to transcend rhetorical solidarity. For example, nominal seats allocated to women in local councils might not suffice if patriarchal norms remain embedded in the operational culture. Similarly, rhetorical condemnation of attacks on minorities means little if local law enforcement or judicial structures fail to proactively prevent harassment or land dispossession. Routes to Legitimate and Sustainable Change After evaluating these proposals through various conceptual vantage points, a consistent thread emerges: structural reforms can only thrive if they incorporate enforceable mechanisms that involve the wider society, uproot underlying power asymmetries, and garner a cross-party consensus that outlives electoral cycles. Each domain—the caretaker government, media freedom, judicial independence, economic distribution, local government empowerment—requires stable processes and well-defined accountability structures. Equally, each reform calls for a shift in the political culture, so that the impetus for openness and fairness is institutionalised rather than fleetingly invoked. A second crucial element is resource allocation. Significant expansions in welfare (healthcare, education, or unemployment allowances), infrastructure (roads, ports), or environmental protection (climate resilience, pollution control) demand robust state capacities and consistent fiscal commitments. The Outline references the reallocation of budget percentages to these sectors, but these must be tied to frameworks that reduce corruption, streamline public procurement, and ensure that distribution is needs-based rather than patronage-based. Lastly, real empowerment requires that these processes remain transparent and inclusive. Partnerships with civil society, labour movements, grassroots activists, minority associations, and women's networks can anchor the proposed commissions and oversight bodies in local realities. By embedding strong channels for grievance redress and civic engagement, the reformed structures might stand a greater chance of fulfilling the promise of returning 'lost ownership' to citizens. Absent robust participation and institutional design, top-down reforms risk replicating the paternalistic power they seek to replace. Conclusion The 31-Point Outline for Structural Reforms in Bangladesh articulates an extensive project that spans political, legal, economic, and social arenas, ostensibly aiming to rectify longstanding imbalances and rebuild trust between the government and its people. By explicitly championing caretaker governance, credible elections, accountability for extrajudicial abuses, a freer media environment, and more equitable socio-economic measures, the document reveals a vision for an overhauled system that invests new impetus into rights, transparency, and shared prosperity. However, bridging grand declarations and entrenched political conditions is never straightforward. On the one hand, the Outline's holistic approach—combining institutional reorganisation, human rights provisions, social investment, and anti-corruption commitments—holds the potential to address the multifaceted nature of democratic decline. On the other hand, each proposal stands vulnerable to resistance from vested interests, historical bureaucratic inertia, local power elites, or ingrained partisan antagonisms. The rhetoric of transformation thus demands scrupulous policy frameworks that detail how these commissions, committees, and new laws will be staffed, how they will secure independence, and how they will be protected from co-optation or intimidation. One of the Outline's strengths lies in its repeated mention of participation: from local government empowerment to media freedom, from caretaker elections to new legislative structures, it repeatedly asserts that the people's voices and welfare are central. The transformative potential of such a blueprint will hinge on whether these commitments translate into genuine, democratically governed institutions and transparent, rule-bound processes. If so, Bangladesh might indeed advance towards a reimagined state architecture that fosters participation, confronts privileges, and broadens socio-economic opportunities. If not, the pages of this Outline may join the historical record of ambitious but unrealised reform agendas. It is precisely this juncture—between aspiration and feasibility—that necessitates the forging of consensus across political divides, long-term financial planning, and serious cultural shifts in governance norms. The finishing point to 'hand over the lost ownership of the country back to the people' becomes more than a slogan only if the intricacies of policy, enforcement, and civic engagement genuinely amplify the public's ability to shape their destiny. The next steps thus involve translating these proposals into binding legislation, codifying them in institutional charters, and subjecting them to ongoing democratic oversight. Only through such thorough and sustained follow-up might the vision of structural change achieve its stated mission, inaugurating a future of inclusive democracy and accountable governance in Bangladesh.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWeOk1RnKHsv5TXUzSm7OO-v	2025-01-11T16:01:06-08:00	
Downsized DOGE – OpEd	Elon Musk stirred up much hope among many small government advocates when he spoke on stage at Donald Trump’s October 27 presidential campaign rally at Madison Square Garden in New York City. Musk declared then his expectation that the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), which Musk would go on to run with Vivek Ramaswamy, would reduce yearly United States government spending by 'at least two trillion dollars.' This week, Musk let those small government advocates down, reducing by more than half the spending cuts he predicts DOGE will accomplish. On Wednesday, Musk stated in an interview with host Mark Penn at X that cuts reaching two trillion dollars is now 'like the best-case outcome' and that there is just a 'good shot' at achieving a one trillion dollars reduction in yearly spending. That’s how much expectations have been lowered before Trump is even sworn in as president later this month. A year from now, will Musk have downsized the expected achievement of DOGE so much that he will have given up on projecting any spending reduction? Will he then be talking about how DOGE can limit the increasing of US government spending?

Mercurial Trump’s Gamble In Term 2.0 – Analysis	President-elect Donald Trump is already making news even before assuming the presidency. This is not surprising because he is known for his mercurial and unpredictable stances on many global as well as bilateral issues. Trump has already indicated that he would revisit many of the international agreements that are not serving America’s interests. He has also threatened to increase tariffs in imports from many countries that are against America’s economic interests. Such tough decisions could damage America’s relations with its trading partners. But that is Trump for the world to understand and learn to deal with. Even before taking office on January 20, Trump has threatened to seize the Panama Canal, revived calls to buy Greenland and even joked about annexing Canada, leaving the world guessing once again whether he is serious or not. Experts opine that Trump’s rhetoric could be a ‘message’ for China, which has increased its influence in Latin America and the Arctic. By such pronouncements, Trump even before returning to the Oval office has challenged the sovereignty of some of America’s closest allies, thereby underscoring his credentials as global disrupter-in-chief. Analysts have begun to interpret that Trump would be harsher on US friends than on the adversaries like Russia and China. Greenland issue Trump has floated the idea of the US buying the vast strategic island Greenland, a Danish territory, which he also had stated during his first term in office. Now he repeated the idea when naming PayPal co-founder Ken Howery as his ambassador to the Kingdom of Denmark and said 'ownership and control of Greenland is an absolute necessity' for US national security. Even when Howery said he would work to deepen the bonds between the US, Denmark and Greenland, Trump was rebuffed when Greenland Prime Minister Mute Egede answered that the resource-rich island was 'not for sale'. Howery was an ambassador to Sweden from 2019 to 2021, under Trump’s first administration. Trump’s proposal to buy Greenland in 2019 had triggered tensions between the US and Denmark. That time Denmark Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen too had described Trump’s proposal as absurd and made it clear Greenland was not for sale. There are other considerations behind Trump’s temptation to grab Greenland. Like other resources, such as copper of which Greenland has plenty, countries should be able to transact land, and Trump reasons his stance based on international norms on free and fair terms. In any such land transaction, the consent of the peoples is a must. With a positive intent, such transactions could make the world more peaceable, prosperous and habitable for more of humanity. There are several critical raw materials Europe needs for its industries and the green transition can be found in Greenland. In 2023, EU signed an MoU with Greenland to develop sustainable raw materials value chains. Greenland also has large deposits of rare earth metals key to the production of energy transition tech and batteries. Trump is clearly eyeing on these. At this point Denmark is not willing to make a sale. But it is not like Greenland had been theirs from time immemorial. European invaders occupied many parts of the world and claimed as their own over time. Likewise, when Tsar Alexander II sold Alaska to the US, the uncivilized tribes were too handed over as objects. Similarly when Napoleon sold Louisiana, he was not concerned about the local population either. But things are perceived and seen differently in the present times. Trump can have his ways if the majority of the Greenland population of which 96 per cent are Inuit endorse such an idea. A transaction in such a way shall be perfectly legitimate in international law. Here, there are some similarity in what Chinese President Xi Jinping has been pursuing and what Trump intends to do. In principle, both are expansionists. While Xi has been doing in total disregard of international law and under duress of threat of use of force, Trump has just floated his ideas which he wants to pursue through diplomacy. Even before assuming the presidency, Trump sent his son to Greenland to sell the idea of Greenland being a part of the US. But the people of Greenland scoffed at the proposal 'Greenland is not for sale and will never be for sale'. While Xi’s long term goal is to restore China’s status of what it was once the Middle Kingdom, Trump seeks a ‘Greater America’ in his pursuit of ‘Make America Great Again’ (MAGA) goal. The MAGA is a geographical and cartographic entity that began to take shape after Trump urged Canada to merge with the US and renewed the idea of buying Greenland from Denmark. Panama Canal Issue But what grabbed the headline was Trump’s remarks on Panama when he slammed what he called unfair fees for US ships passing through and threatened to demand control of the Panama Canal be returned to Washington. Trump was categorical that if Panama did not agree to hike the fees, the US can have the right to demand that the Panama Canal be returned to the US 'in full, quickly and without question'. When Jimmy Carter was the US President, he and the leader of Panama Omar Torrijos had signed treaties obliging the US to surrender control of the Panama Canal by 1999, settling a longstanding point of friction between the two countries. Carter saw the move as an overdue show of American resolve to deal with the developing nations of the world, the small nations of the world, on the basis of mutual respect and partnership. Conservatives denounced the treaties as a giveaway. Gallup found that 78 per cent of Americans opposed the treaties. Canal was built by the United States in 1914 to link the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans. It was returned to Panama under a 1977 deal. Adding more to this threat, Trump threatened new anti-drug tariffs on ‘day 1’ for China, Canada, Mexico and hinted at China’s growing influence around the canal. Trump also teased neighbouring Canada that it would be a great idea to become the 51st US state – but against a dark backdrop of threatened tariffs. Trump complains that Canada makes almost $100 billion in trade with the US. Trump is also harsh in his comments and treatments of US allies in stark contrast to his repeated praise for the leaders of US foes, including Russia’s Vladimir Putin, despite his invasion of Ukraine created international opprobrium. The big question that puzzles is if Trump’s comments on buying Greenland were a subtle message to China, presently America’s biggest adversary. This is because Trump feels that Beijing has been incrementally spreading its influence in Panama. Trump is equally concerned about China’s growing presence in the Arctic and is worried about China’s growing ties with Russia. Trump may be sending a message to Denmark not to be too cosy with China. However, any US plan to 'buy' Greenland would be unfeasible not just in international law but more broadly in the global order that the US has been trying to uphold. The biggest talking point is Trump has not ruled out military or economic action as part of his avowed desire to have the US take back control of the Panama Canal and acquire the Danish territory of Greenland. Canada, America’s 51st state What was most galling about Trump’s statement on Canada becoming as America’s 51st state caught world’s attention. By floating the idea of what could be a ‘Greater America’ by asking Canada to join his country as the 51st state, Trump reasoned that Canadians would ‘save massively on taxes and military protection’ if their country becomes a part of the US. Trump reasoned that the US can no longer suffer the massive trade deficits and subsidies that Canada needs to stay afloat. Trump’s taunt was a shocker to Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau as he was in the midst of a crisis sparked by the sudden departure of a minister who was a bulwark against Trump’s plan to start trade wars with his neighbours. Trump’s comments could be light-hearted but Trudeau must be losing his sleep on Trump’s comments. This could have been another trigger, besides others, for him to step down from office. Renaming Gulf of Mexico another MAGA pitch As mentioned before, Trump’s expansionist pitch does not stop with Greenland and Panama Canal. Now his MAGA pitch covers the Gulf of Mexico, which he wants to rename as Gulf of America. Trump forgets that naming of the sea as the Gulf of Mexico predates the formation of the US. The Times of India rightly editorialised thus: 'Grandstanding that borders on the comic has been a part of Trump’s disruptive style aimed at unsettling political rivals.' The editorial further explained: 'This seemingly isolationist policy now seems to be making way for American exceptionalism and expansionism that threatens to redraw boundaries.' It transpires therefore that Trump in his second term will be disruptive for the world in many ways. Future of Ties with India During the Joe Biden administration, India-US relationship grew strong in many fronts, including strategic, defence and economy. There are fears that some of these will be undermined during the Trump 2.0 presidency as Trump has threatened reciprocal tariffs with many countries, including India, with which the US enjoys trade disadvantage. Trump has called India’s tariffs ‘very high’ on the US imports. Broadly, Trump has hinted that US policy during his second term would be isolationistic. Optimists however opine that the India-US relationship built over the past 25 years is now a cornerstone of both nations’ foreign policy agenda. The breadth of cooperation spans defence, trade, energy, technology, education, and counterterrorism. This is not to say that trade and tariffs could pose an immediate challenge under Trump’s renewed leadership. Trump has been critical of what he perceives as imbalances in trade with India, particularly India’s high tariffs and the trade deficit. This was a priority during Trump’s first term and will likely dominate the agenda in the early days of the second term. For Trump, addressing the tariff issue not only with India but with other trading partners with which the US has an imbalance of trade is a priority. He seeks a level of reciprocity. Trump is likely to focus on sectors like energy, where US exports could meet India’s rising demand, and services, where greater collaboration could enhance trade relations. It would be a challenge to India’s policy makers how to deal with Trump and his negotiators so that mutual economic growth remains sustained and mutual understanding on global issues are not hampered.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWeOk1RnKHsv5SM1cUzeEsby	2025-01-11T15:53:27-08:00	
North Korean Launch Of ‘New’ Missile Fires Up Guam Security Debat...	By Mar-Vic Cagurangan North Korea’s launch of a 'new' intermediate range ballistic missile earlier this week that 'will reliably contain any rivals in the Pacific' has fired up debate about the U.S. military’s ability to defend Guam from potential attack. The Asian country’s first major test launch of the year was a 'new' weapon with a hypersonic warhead that flew about 1,000 miles [1,500 kilometers], North Korean state media reported. Last year China launched its first long-range missile in 40-years into the Pacific and the U.S. has conducted several, including its first successful test missile intercept from Guam last month. 'I have full confidence in the readiness and capabilities of our armed forces and the strategic defenses of our island and the region,' local Republican Sen. Jesse Lujan told BenarNews. While acknowledging that Pyongyang’s 'threat is concerning,' Lujan dismissed it as a 'sideshow.' North Korea’s leader Kim Jong Un oversaw Monday’s launch. He was quoted by the state-run Korean Central News Agency as hailing the test for putting the 'country's nuclear war deterrent on an advanced basis' with a 'weapon system to which no one can respond.' 'The hypersonic missile system will reliably contain any rivals in the Pacific region that can affect the security of our state.' The U.S. and its allies denounced North Korea at a U.N. Security Council meeting on Wednesday. North Korea responded that it has the right to self-defence against 'nuclear-based' enemies. In 2017, when then U.S. president Donald Trump threatened to bring 'fire and fury' down on North Korea, Pyongyang responded that it was 'carefully examining the operational plan for making an enveloping fire at the areas around Guam.' The U.S. Department of Defense is proposing to build a US$1.8 billion missile defense system on Guam to counter threats from China and North Korea. 'The real focus must remain on preparing for China’s growing influence and capabilities,' Lujan said. 'By strengthening our defenses and alliances to address that challenge, we will inherently be prepared for anything North Korea does.' Located closer to Beijing than Hawaii, the U.S. territory serves as a key strategic asset and is known as the 'tip of the spear' with 10,000 military personnel on the island, a base for F-35 fighters and B-2 bombers and home port for Virginia-class nuclear submarines. Another 5,000 Marines are due to relocate to Guam from Okinawa in Japan starting this year. A local think tank has warned the arms race in the region exposes Guam to the perils of war, but the civilian sector has been left out of security and survival planning. 'The Missile Defense Agency’s proposal for an [Enhanced integrated Air Missile Defense System] in Guam is overstated in its effectiveness and understated in the real and potential damaging repercussions to the Guam community,' Robert Underwood, chair of the Pacific Center for Island Security, said in a statement. On Wednesday, public submissions closed on the MDA’s draft environmental impact statement for the proposed missile defense architecture. The PCIS submission said 'there remained significant questions about the ability of the system to function as proposed.' It pointed out that the defense department has marked areas in the Pacific region that would serve as 'alternative operating locations' if Guam became incapacitated. 'This indicates that even DoD planners do not anticipate the EIAMDS will defend the entirety of Guam,’' the group said. Residents expressed mixed feelings about the North Korean test. Rubyjane Buhain-Redila told BenarNews she wasn’t scared and it is the 'same old, I’m desensitized already.' Others like Kyle Mandapat are concerned and want the civilian population to be better informed 'in the event of an attack, much like we prepare for tsunamis, typhoons and earthquakes.' Fellow resident Debbie Quinata was critical of elected officials for providing 'no bunkers for the public, we’re sitting ducks.' Guam’s Chamber of Commerce supports the enhancement of the island’s defensive capabilities, which will potentially bring billions of dollars in new investments and economic opportunities. 'We must rely on our military partners ensuring that we have the necessary measures in place to protect our island and the nation’s home front,' Ernie Galito, chair of the GCC board of directors, told BenarNews. China in September test fired an ICBM that flew over Guam to land on the high seas near Kiribati’s territorial waters. Last October, North Korea launched what it claimed was its most advanced and powerful solid-fuel intercontinental ballistic missile - called the Hwasong-19 - with an estimated range of over 9,000 miles and capable of striking the U.S. mainland. Last November, the U.S. fired an unarmed ICBM from its Vandenberg Air Force Base in California that splashed down 4,200 miles away at Republic of Marshall Islands’ Kwajalein Atoll. More than 300 similar U.S. tests have been conducted.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWeOk1RnKHsv5Rp5-jD1IEj0	2025-01-11T15:50:33-08:00	
US Hits Russian Oil With Toughest Sanctions Yet In Bid To Give Uk...	(EurActiv) -- US President Joe Biden's administration imposed its broadest package of sanctions so far targeting Russia's oil and gas revenues on 10 January, in an effort to give Kyiv and Donald Trump's incoming team leverage to reach a deal for peace in Ukraine. The move is meant to cut Russia's revenues for continuing the war in Ukraine that has killed more than 12,300 civilians and reduced cities to rubble since Moscow invaded in February, 2022. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said in a post on X that the measures announced on Friday will 'deliver a significant blow' to Moscow. 'The less revenue Russia earns from oil ... the sooner peace will be restored,' Zelenskyy added. Daleep Singh, a top White House economic and national security adviser, said in a statement that the measures were the 'most significant sanctions yet on Russia’s energy sector, by far the largest source of revenue for (President Vladimir) Putin’s war'. The US Treasury imposed sanctions on Gazprom Neft and Surgutneftegas, which explore for, produce and sell oil as well as 183 vessels that have shipped Russian oil, many of which are in the so-called shadow fleet of aging tankers operated by non-Western companies. The sanctions also include networks that trade the petroleum. Many of those tankers have been used to ship oil to India and China as a price cap imposed by the Group of Seven countries in 2022 has shifted trade in Russian oil from Europe to Asia. Some tankers have shipped both Russian and Iranian oil. The sanctions include the Gazprom subsidiaries in various countries. This includes NIS Novi Sad, the Serbian oil and gas company a pillar of the country's energy system. Its revenues increased to €3.3 billion last year, equivalent to 4.5% of Serbia's GDP. The Treasury also rescinded a provision that had exempted the intermediation of energy payments from sanctions on Russian banks. The sanctions should cost Russia billions of dollars per month if sufficiently enforced, another US official told reporters in a call. 'There is not a step in the production and distribution chain that's untouched and that gives us greater confidence that evasion is going to be even more costly for Russia,' the official said. Gazprom Neft said the sanctions were unjustified and illegitimate and it will continue to operate. US 'no longer constrained’ by tight oil supply The measures allow a wind-down period until 12 March for sanctioned entities to finish energy transactions. Still, sources in Russian oil trade and Indian refining said the sanctions will cause severe disruption of Russian oil exports to its major buyers India and China. Global oil prices jumped more than 3% ahead of the Treasury announcement, with Brent crude nearing $80 a barrel, as a document mapping out the sanctions circulated among traders in Europe and Asia. Geoffrey Pyatt, the US assistant secretary for energy resources at the State Department, said there were new volumes of oil expected to come online this year from the US, Guyana, Canada and Brazil and possibly out of the Middle East will fill in for any lost Russian supply. 'We see ourselves as no longer constrained by tight supply in global markets the way we were when the price cap mechanism was unveiled,' Pyatt told Reuters. The sanctions are part of a broader effort, as the Biden administration has furnished Ukraine with $64 billion in military aid since the invasion, including $500 million this week for air defense missiles and support equipment for fighter jets. Friday's move followed US sanctions in November on banks including Gazprombank, Russia's largest conduit to the global energy business, and earlier last year on dozens of tankers carrying Russian oil. The Biden administration believes that November's sanctions helped drive Russia's rouble to its weakest level since the beginning of the invasion and pushed the Russian central bank to raise its policy rate to a record level of over 20%. 'We expect our direct targeting of the energy sector will aggravate these pressures on the Russian economy that have already pushed up inflation to almost 10% and reinforce a bleak economic outlook for 2025 and beyond,' one of the officials said. Reversal would involve congress One of the Biden officials said it was 'entirely' up to the President-elect Trump, a Republican, who takes office on 20 January, when and on what terms he might lift sanctions imposed during the Biden era. But to do so he would have to notify Congress and give it the ability to take a vote of disapproval, he said. Many Republican members of Congress had urged Biden to impose Friday's sanctions. 'Trump's people can't just come in and quietly lift everything that Biden just did. Congress would have to be involved,' said Jeremy Paner, a partner at the law firm Hughes Hubbard & Reed. The return of Trump has sparked hope of a diplomatic resolution to end Moscow's invasion but also fears in Kyiv that a quick peace could come at a high price for Ukraine. Advisers to Trump have floated proposals that would effectively cede large parts of Ukraine to Russia for the foreseeable future. The Trump transition team did not immediately respond to a request for comment about the new sanctions. The military aid and oil sanctions 'provide the next administration a considerable boost to their and Ukraine's leverage in brokering a just and durable peace,' one of the officials said.

Robert Reich: How Trump Seeks To Destroy The Four Major Pillars O...	Trump and his MAGA allies are already targeting the four major pillars of resistance to Trump during his first term. As we prepare for Trump’s second regime — which promises to be far worse than the first — it’s important to do what we can to protect and fortify these four centers of opposition. 1. Universities University faculties are dedicated to finding and exposing the truth — which has often meant calling out Trump’s lies. But Trump has warned that he’ll change the criteria for university accrediting in order to force university faculties into line. In a campaign video, he said, 'Our secret weapon will be the college accreditation system … When I return to the White House, I will fire the radical left accreditors that have allowed our colleges to become dominated by Marxist Maniacs.' Authorized by the federal government, these accreditors are essential to college operations. If a college isn’t accredited, it can’t get federal funds. Trump’s Project 2025 calls for replacing the current system of independent, nonpartisan accreditors with more politically pliable state accreditors. This would have disastrous effects. Many of the worst educational gag orders at the state level, along with DEI bans and faculty tenure bans, have been voted down or toned down because state legislators realized they were putting their schools’ accreditation status in jeopardy. If Project 2025’s recommendations are adopted, that guardrail disappears. Trump has also threatened to increase taxes on university endowments. Republicans in Congress believe they were instrumental in getting the presidents of Columbia, the University of Pennsylvania, and Harvard to resign over their alleged failures to stop protests against Israel’s bloodbath in Gaza. Some are eager to resume their attacks on major universities. 2. Nonprofits America’s nonprofits have been at the forefront of efforts to protect the environment, voting rights, and immigrants’ rights. Trump and his allies are seeking to stop nonprofit activism. The Republican House has already passed a bill that would empower the Treasury to eliminate the tax-exempt status of any nonprofit it deems to be supporting terrorism. An identical or similar bill could come across Trump’s desk after being reintroduced in the next Congress. The legislation doesn’t distinguish between foreign and domestic terrorism — whether real or imagined — thereby making it easier for Trump’s authorities to intimidate nonprofit personnel and donors. We’ve already seen something like this at the state level. In Texas, state authorities have attempted to shut down charities that assist immigrants. Indiana Attorney General Todd Rokita has launched a probe of nonprofits, including the God Is Good Foundation, that have allegedly conspired to bring noncitizens to the state. 3. The media I’ve been a critic of the mainstream media’s tendency to give 'both sides' credence even when one side is clearly in the wrong and to 'sanewash' some of Trump’s and his enablers’ rants. But journalists are an important bulwark against tyranny — which is why Trump and his allies are seeking to intimidate news outlets that have criticized or questioned Trump. The flurry of defamation lawsuits — such as Trump launched against ABC (and ABC caved to) and the Des Moines Register — is the latest sign. Trump and his allies have also discussed revoking networks’ broadcast licenses and eliminating funding for public radio and television. Kash Patel, Trump’s nominee to head the FBI, has threatened to 'take on the most powerful enemy that the United States has ever seen, and no it’s not Washington, D.C., it’s the mainstream media and these people out there in the fake news. That is our mission!' Already social media platforms such as Musk’s X and Meta’s Facebook and Instagram have caved to Trump, allowing vicious authoritarian lies to be magnified unimpeded. 4. Organized labor In the 1950s and 1960s, labor unions were viewed as a source of countervailing power because of their activism on behalf of the working class and their significant political clout. In those days, a third of workers in the private sector were union members. But today, only 6 percent of private-sector workers are union members, and it’s far from clear that organized labor will be an active source of resistance to Trump. (If government workers are included, the percentage of American workers who are members of unions is around 10 percent.) Trump has warned organized labor that he will oppose their efforts to organize. The president of the Teamsters Union even appeared at the National Republican Convention in support of Trump. *** Each of these centers of resistance to Trump has been a powerful source of truth-telling in America. It’s no surprise that all have been targeted by Trump and his allies. We need to be vigilant and do what we can to protect and fortify them. Remember: We lose only if we stop fighting.

India: Christians Face Fresh Onslaught In Northeast – OpEd	By John Dayal (UCA News) -- India’s bishops, as much as its civil society, possibly missed an ominous warning in a report in the Kathmandu-based portal Himal Southasian about the growing support within tribal communities in the northeastern states of Assam and Arunachal Pradesh for stripping those among them who converted to Christianity of their Scheduled Tribe status. In India, indigenous people are classed as scheduled tribes, which comes with special protections and quotas in educational institutions, legislative bodies, and employment in state-run institutions. The report becomes important with the news that the government of Arunachal Pradesh — once called the NEFA (North-East Frontier Agency) as it borders Bhutan, Myanmar and China through Tibet — will soon enforce the anti-conversion law it passed in 1978 to stop the growth of Christianity in the state. Also likely to be raised is the political demand that those already converted to Christianity be stripped of all privileges given to the members of the scores of big and small tribes inhabiting this Himalayan redoubt. Stripping tribal people, also called Adivasis in North and Central India, of their scheduled status is an important national project of India’s ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and its parent body, the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), to contain the growth of Christianity among tribal people and Dalits. The Presidential Order of 1950 became the biggest anti-conversion law of the newly independent India, with converts penalized by being denied reservations in government jobs, legislatures, and educational institutions. Tribal people, till now, could retain such rights even if they became Christians, and very rarely, Muslims. These rights were the fuse that lit the conflagration in Kandhamal in eastern Orissa state in 2008, which saw 56,000 people displaced from their homes and seeking safety, first in the nearby forests, and then in government refugee camps for up to a year. Many women, including a Catholic nun, were raped, more than 400 churches and 4,000 houses were burnt, while 400 villages were cleansed of a Christian presence. The subtext was that converts to Christianity should not be given Scheduled Tribe benefits. This was also one of the subtexts of the violence in Manipur which began on May 7, 2023, and continues with the toll mounting every day. Over 70,000 people, mostly tribal people of the Kuki-Zo group, are now homeless. They have also forced Meitei Christians to return to the older Sanamahi faith by making them sign conversion affidavits and burning their bibles in what they described as acts of ghar wapsi, or homecoming — the preferred BJP term for the re-conversion to Hinduism of Indian Christians and Muslims. As in Kandhamal, over 400 churches are reported destroyed. The majority Meitei, who are not tribal people, want the same scheduled status. This would in effect make everyone in the state equal and give the Meitei egress into the hill districts which have mineral deposits, and allegedly now grow contraband poppy, from which many opiate derivatives find their way to the billion-dollar international drug trade in which reportedly politicians are also complicit. Arunachal Pradesh is home to 26 major tribes and over 100 sub-tribes, collectively 68.78 percent of the 1.3 million population per the 2011 national census. The first church in Arunachal was set up in 1957 in Rayang village in the present-day district of East Siang, close to the Assam border. Christians now constitute just over 30 percent, with Hindus close behind at 29.0 percent, the Donyi-Polo at 26.2 percent, and Buddhism, both Theravada and Mahayana, at 11.8 percent. The many indigenous tribal religions, many nature or ancestor worshiping communities, total some 3 percent. The strength of the Hindu population may be significantly more as the Donyi Polo often also so identify themselves. Many of their social, political and religious leaders are also members of the RSS. In such a mixed population, English is a link language, but also Hindi, which many people in the state speak fluently as it was taught in Vivekanand schools, run by an RSS affiliate organization. Hindi also makes it easy for Hindutva activists to emphasize its connectedness with the Hindu-majority Indian mainland. The other tribal states of the northeast region use English as their link language. Over the last three decades which saw Christian evangelization, the RSS was working with equal zeal radicalizing Hindu tribal groups, and ones following various indigenous faiths. The RSS and its affiliates view the state’s indigenous faiths as part of Sanatana Dharma, or Hindu religion. This has now effectively pitted them against the proselytized Christians. The RSS, not working exactly under the radar, set up an education network that parallels the one by Christian missionaries, matching it in expanse and facilities. These Ekal Vidyalayas, or single-teacher schools, are similar to the ones that impart Hindu nationalist philosophy to tribal children from Orissa in the south and Rajasthan in the west. Demonizing Christians is part of the extra-curricular activity. The anti-conversion law was not passed by a BJP government in the state or New Delhi. It was enacted in 1978 when Arunachal was not even a state but a Union Territory administered directly by the federal government. It remained in cold storage till 2024 when a series of steps became harbingers of a toughening of stance against the Church. As with other similar laws in a dozen central and north Indian states, it too does not name Christianity or Islam, while prohibiting conversion 'by use of force or inducement or by fraudulent means.' Many states have now weaponized this law and punishment can range up to 10 years for the pastor engaged in proselytizing, or a Muslim man marrying a Hindu woman and converting her to Islam. Every act of conversion is to be reported to the deputy commissioner of the district concerned. The law was contested even before it received presidential assent. The Christian community formed the Arunachal Christian Forum to ensure the law remained in abeyance all these decades. Forum president Tarh Miri calls it an 'anti-Christian law' and continues to lead the push against it. 'If the law is enforced, there are chances of it being misused by the district administration or police,' Miri said. The number of Christians in the state has grown rapidly over the years, making Christianity the largest religion in the state, even if by a whisker. In 2018, Chief Minister Pema Khandu told a meeting of the Arunachal Pradesh Catholic Association that the state government was considering repealing the Act. But, as in Manipur, the call to stop conversions was routed through a public interest litigation in 2022 by a lawyer, Tambo Tamin, who appealed for judicial intervention over the 'failure' of the state government to frame rules for the Act. On Sept. 30, 2024, the state government told the court that draft rules had been framed and would be finalized in six months. That would mean the law could be enforced by March-end or early April. Preparations apparently had begun last year when the government strengthened the existing Inner Line Permit system that makes it mandatory for non-residents, including foreigners, to apply for a permit to enter the state. Such permits are also required for some other northeastern states, including Manipur. The entry permit system gives the state powers through its police to check any evangelist entering the state. However, the Church in Arunachal no longer needs people from outer areas to reach out to various remote areas to preach. Unlike in the northern Indian states, or even in Rajasthan and Gujarat in the west of the country, where the Christian population is small, Arunachal Pradesh now has a sizeable community that can take care of itself if the state itself does not turn on the people. And so, the RSS-BJP may possibly have met its match in this state. *The views expressed in this article are those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the official editorial position of UCA News.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWeOk1RnKHsv5WTUo6Khsq2P	2025-01-11T15:43:03-08:00	
The Horn Of Africa States: The Pains Of The Afar People – OpEd	They say Africa is splitting along the Great East African Rift valley. The ongoing volcanic activities in the Afar region of Ethiopia is said to be but a precursor of more to come, and this may perhaps create the sea for which Ethiopia has recently been bothering all the neighbouring coastal countries. Ethiopia’s continuing talk of access to a sea appears to have been putting a Hobbesian fear in all the countries around it, not that it will be able to achieve, but that it will cause more damage to the region, economically, politically, and even socially, without achieving any of the illusive goals of the current Ethiopian administration. But worse will be how far it makes the people of the region drift from each other apart and hate each other for no other reason other than the grandiose madness of a leader, who knows no peace and appears to have no intention of creating peace despite being a Nobel Laureate. Perhaps this is God’s design to keep the imperial pretenders of current day Ethiopia from the rest of the Horn of Africa States people, putting in between actual Abyssinia and hence Ethiopia and the Somali country including the part in Ethiopia, a major sea barrier. Who knows? God’s works manifest themselves in many ways! The process of the Somali plate drifting away from the Nubian plate and the Arabian plate has been going for many millions of years and the completion may also probably take many millions more, should the world still continue to exist or maybe shorter, in our current lifetime. A great part of the Afar region of Ethiopia, known as the Danakil Depression, is already below sea level and this may be submerged by floods from the Red sea to create a sea barrier between Somalia and Ethiopia, two countries that could have been friends but where such friendship is always made impossible by the desire of Ethiopia to take over Somali lands. Abyssinia has already taken a large portion of the Somali lands in the Horn of Africa, with the connivance of European colonial powers towards the end of the nineteenth century, when the small king of Shoa, Menelik II, rose to become an emperor of Abyssinia through forceful acquisition of many nations into his empire. This was further consolidated through a change of name to Ethiopia in 1932 by the then Emperor Haile Selassie, Ex- Ras Tafari, son of Ras Makonnen, a Chief Advisor to Emperor Menelik II. With a sea barrier separating the two countries, Abyssinia and Somalia may then become friends after all! However, one thing most pundits ignore, is the fact that there are people who live in the region affected by the volcanic activity today - the Afar people. One does not see many discussing the difficulties these people face, including their own government, which is busy threatening not only its own other nationalities (the Amhara, the Tigrayans, the Benishangul, the Somalis, and others), but also its neighbors. The Afar population is some three million souls, and they would need to move on to other parts of Ethiopia. The Afar State is one of the driest and hottest regions of Ethiopia and continues to affect the lives of many of the population of the region, and the current flare up of the volcanic activity would only cause more problems and difficulties for the population. It is where solidarity among the people of the Horn of Africa States is important and needed beyond the unnecessary antagonistic competition of the governments of the region, where each one is working hard to undermine the other. It is, indeed, one area they could all work together to ease the pains of the Afar people, who face a great disaster, even well-equipped countries would find difficulties managing them. The current fires in the Unites States is but an example where natural disasters can devastate large territories where people lived in peace. It is high time, perhaps, the governments of the Horn of Africa States region dealt with this Hobbesian fear of each other and worked together when natural disasters strike in any part of the region. This would have brought people of the region closer together in the place of worrying that each country is out to get the other, as is going on today between Ethiopia and Somalia. There is a need for a new social contract in the region, just as the United Nations Organization was founded, to address fear of another great war. A Horn of Africa States platform organized as a regional economic block would have addressed many of the contention issues including sovereignty, integrity and unity of each country, without one country taking over or threatening to take over the territory of another. A regional platform would have allowed economic cooperation, development of rail and road connections, airports and seaports to attend the needs of the region both in terms of internal trade and external trade and in investments and attracting more capital to the region from other parts of the world. This would have also allowed the exploitation of the resources of the region in terms of both sub-soil and above soil wealth. The location of the region alone would have attracted many millions of mobile populations to add on to the already bulging population of the region of some 170 million people – a sizeable market and a source of youthful labor force. A concerted effort from the countries and nations of the region to extend help to the Afar people, in their hour of need today, would be a great opener for such closer relations among the countries of the region.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWeOk1RnKHsv5V62ZFRs2unL	2025-01-11T15:40:49-08:00	
The Trump Doctrine: How Expansionist Dreams Are Redefining US For...	In a world where geopolitical boundaries are increasingly fluid, Donald Trump's recent assertions about 'taking over' Canada, Greenland, and the Panama Canal have sparked both intrigue and alarm. These claims, while seemingly audacious, reflect a broader strategic vision that blends economic nationalism with a reassertion of U.S. global influence. Trump's territorial ambitions are rooted in a complex interplay of strategic, economic, and political factors, which are integral to his broader foreign policy framework and hold significant implications for international relations. The Historical Context: U.S. Expansionism Revisited The United States has a storied history of territorial expansion, from the Louisiana Purchase to the annexation of Hawaii. Trump's current proposals, though unprecedented in their scope, draw on this legacy. However, they are also distinctively modern, reflecting a world where economic power and strategic resources are as crucial as land itself. Trump's 'America First' agenda seeks to reposition the U.S. as a dominant global player, leveraging its economic and military might to secure favorable trade terms and strategic assets. Canada: A Complex Dance of Trade and Territory Trump's suggestion that Canada could become the 51st U.S. state is more symbolic than serious, but it highlights the complex interplay between trade and territory in U.S.-Canada relations. The U.S. and Canada share one of the world's largest bilateral trade relationships, with Canada being a critical supplier of energy and natural resources. Trump's push for renegotiating trade agreements, such as the US-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA), reflects a desire to secure more favorable terms for U.S. industries, particularly in sectors like agriculture and manufacturing. However, this economic integration is also intertwined with territorial politics. Trump's border policies, including the construction of physical barriers and stricter immigration controls, underscore a broader effort to redefine the U.S.-Canada border as a zone of economic and security control. While Canada is unlikely to become part of the U.S., Trump's rhetoric may aim to leverage Canada's economic dependence on the U.S. to achieve strategic trade concessions. Greenland: The Arctic Frontier and Strategic Resources Greenland, with its vast ice sheets and strategic location in the Arctic, represents a unique combination of natural resources and geopolitical significance. Trump's interest in acquiring Greenland reflects a broader U.S. strategy to secure its interests in the Arctic, a region increasingly important due to climate change and the opening of new shipping lanes. Greenland's potential for resource extraction, including rare earth minerals and hydrocarbons, aligns with Trump's emphasis on energy independence and economic self-sufficiency. Moreover, Greenland's strategic position allows for enhanced military surveillance and defense capabilities, crucial in a region where China and Russia are expanding their presence. The Panama Canal: A Critical Chokepoint in Global Trade The Panama Canal, one of the world's most critical shipping routes, has been a focal point of U.S. foreign policy since its construction. Trump's criticism of the current toll structure and his suggestion that the U.S. should reclaim control reflect concerns about economic fairness and strategic security. The Panama Canal is not just an economic asset but a geopolitical chokepoint. Trump's threats to intervene are driven by fears that China could gain undue influence over this critical trade artery, potentially undermining U.S. economic and strategic interests. This concern highlights the ongoing competition between the U.S. and China for global influence, with infrastructure and trade routes becoming key battlegrounds. The Role of Economic and Military Pressure Trump's foreign policy often employs a mix of economic coercion and military deterrence to achieve its objectives. In the case of Canada, Greenland, and the Panama Canal, economic pressure is likely to be the primary tool. This could involve tariffs, trade restrictions, or other forms of economic leverage designed to influence the decisions of these territories. However, the use of military force remains a backdrop to these negotiations. Trump has not ruled out military action in extreme scenarios, though this is more a rhetorical device than a practical policy option. The real challenge lies in balancing assertive diplomacy with the need to maintain alliances and avoid destabilizing global relations. International Reactions and the Future of Territorial Politics The international community has responded to Trump's proposals with a mix of skepticism and alarm. Denmark has firmly stated that Greenland is not for sale, while Canada has dismissed any notion of becoming part of the U.S.. Panama has also resisted Trump's claims, emphasizing its sovereignty over the canal. These reactions underscore the challenges facing Trump's territorial ambitions. While they may serve as negotiating tools or rhetorical flourishes, they also risk straining U.S. relations with key allies and undermining international cooperation. In a world where territorial boundaries are increasingly fluid, Trump's actions could set a dangerous precedent, encouraging other nations to pursue similar territorial claims. The Trump Doctrine and the Future of Global Politics Donald Trump's territorial ambitions, though controversial, reflect a broader shift in U.S. foreign policy towards a more assertive and nationalist stance. As the world navigates the complexities of globalization and rising competition between major powers, Trump's proposals highlight the ongoing evolution of international relations. Whether these ambitions result in significant territorial changes or merely serve as negotiating tools, they underscore the importance of strategic resources, economic leverage, and military power in shaping global politics. As the international community watches these developments unfold, one thing is clear: Trump's territorial ambitions will remain a focal point of global attention and debate in the years to come.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWeOk1RnKHsv5Q7v6L8moPO_	2025-01-11T15:38:31-08:00	
Bangladesh Foreign Policy In Context Of The India-China-US Comple...	Ever since the people of the world learnt the need for homogeneity –be it cultural, linguistic, religion, tribal of for the necessity to band together and felt the need to acknowledge the existence of a world beyond their own diplomacy has been playing a role either as a friend or foe. I would argue that regardless of the size or the economic strength of a country practice of democracy remains the pillar of cohesion. Throughout history the definition has changed in line with the existing situation.Plato argued that democracy was inferior to various forms of monarchy, aristocracy and even oligarchy on the grounds that democracy tends to undermine the expertise necessary to properly governed societies. In a democracy, he argues, those who are expert at winning elections and nothing else will eventually dominate democratic politics. Democracy tends to emphasize this expertise at the expense of the expertise that is necessary to properly governed societies. The reason for this is that most people do not have the kinds of talents that enable (STANFORD ENCYCLOPADIA OF PHILOSOPHY). Modern practice of diplomacy puts emphasis on democracy as the binding force of diplomacy. John Stuart Mill argued that a democratic method of making legislation is better than non-democratic methods in three ways: strategically, epistemically and via the improvement of the characters of democratic citizens. Strategically, democracy has an advantage because it forces decision-makers to take into account the interests, rights and opinions of most people in society. Since democracy gives some political power to each, more people are taken into account than under aristocracy or monarchy. The most forceful contemporary statement of this instrumental argument is provided by Amartya Sen, who argued, for example, that 'no substantial famine has ever occurred in any independent country with a democratic form of government and a relatively free press' . The basis of this argument is that politicians in a multiparty democracy with free elections and a free press have incentives to respond to the expressions of needs of the poor. A contrary argument is given by China’s XI Jin Ping who argues that totalitarian system is better able to deliver goods to the people than a democratic system is. The foreign debt of China, by June 2015, stood at around US$ 1.68 trillion. China’s debt has grown dramatically over the past decade and is one of the biggest economic challenges confronting the ruling Chinese Communist Party, which turns 100 this week. Beijing identified the ballooning debt pile as a potential threat to economic stability, and in recent years tried to reduce the country’s reliance on debt for growth. But that deleveraging effort came to a pause for much of last year due to Covid-199 (JUNE 2021). This foray into Chinese economy is for two reasons: firstly is because of Bangladesh’s position in South Asia has only 145 kilometers boundary with Myanmar (bedeviled with the Rohynga crisis) and the Bay of Bengal. On all sides Bangladesh is dependent on India. Bangladesh is India’s biggest trade partner in South Asia. Bilateral trade between India and Bangladesh has grown steadily over the last decade. India’s exports to Bangladesh in FY 2018-19 stood at $9.21 billion and imports during the same period was at $1.04 billion. The Indian economy expanded 4.1% year-on-year in the first three months of 2022, slightly higher than market forecasts of 4%, but due to rising Omicron infections, elevated energy prices, and ongoing supply chain constraints. On the consumption side, household spending slowed sharply and both exports and imports growth also eased. In contrast, government spending increased more and gross fixed capital formation accelerated. Considering the fiscal year ended in March 2022, the economy advanced 8.7%. Reserve Bank of India estimates the GDP growth rate for FY 2023 at 7.2%. Exports to Bangladesh in China decreased. Bangladesh is world’s second-biggest apparel exporter after China. Garments including knit wear and hosiery account for 80% of exports revenue; others include: jute goods, home textile, footwear and frozen shrimps and fish. The bilateral trade between Bangladesh and China has increased significantly in recent years. Bangladesh has been suffering from historic trade imbalances with China since its economic relationship after 1974. This trade deficit makes Bangladesh dependent on China and raises serious concerns about the economic and financial impact. For increasing exports to China could lead to a decrease in trade deficits. Bangladesh needs ensured access to the Chinese market. . This step of sincere and active cooperation between the two countries is considered significant enough to reduce the trade deficit. An Indian foreign policy expert Brahamy Chellany (China’s Debt-Trap Diplomacy Jan 23, 2017 and no less Donald Trump’s Vice President Mike Pence) warned the emerging econimes of Chinese debt trap policy. Through its $1 trillion 'one belt, one road' initiative, China is supporting infrastructure projects in strategically located developing countries, often by extending huge loans to their governments. As a result, some of these countries are becoming saddled with debt, leaving them even more firmly under China's thumb. Some contrary opinions have been sounded in favor of Chinese loans due to unemployment in those countries and the rising cost of essentials. The people in those countries are pressing their governments to accept Chinese loans that would provide employment and fund infrastructure for which the host country lacks money. Bangladesh is no exception. Sheikh Hasina’s official visit to China ( July 2019) seemingly succeeded in bolstering ties between the countries. During the trip, both sides inked a host of agreements, including two deals to provide loans to the Bangladeshi power sector. The countries also expressed interest in accelerating the work related to the Bangladesh-China-India-Myanmar Economic Corridor (BCIM EC) project, an initiative aimed at expanding the economic ties of the four countries that together are home to nearly 3 billion people. Bangladesh and China turned their relationship into a strategic partnership in 2016, and, in recent years, Chinese investment in the South Asian country has risen rapidly. As part of Chinese President Xi Jinping's Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), Beijing and Dhaka signed deals worth $21.5 billion covering a raft of power and infrastructure projects. To date, pledged BRI-related investment in Bangladesh stands at around $38 billion. China has pumped more money into Bangladesh than any other country over the past couple of years. China alone accounts for almost a third of this investment, worth over $1 billion. The Padma Bridge, a major road-rail project across the Padma river, is being built by the China Major Bridge Engineering Company. And China's Exim Bank is providing $3 billion for the construction of the rail link accompanying the bridge. It prompts countries like Japan and India to also come forward and invest. Bangladesh has announced an ambitious plan to set up 100 special economic zones by 2030. Many Chinese companies appear interested in investing in these zones. The question, apart from Indian discomfiture, Bangladesh has to take into consideration whether democracy as a way of life should be abandoned because of XI-Ji-Ping’s promise of quick delivery as he and CCP are able to deliver the goods needed by the people. Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy states that unless equality is shared among citizens in law and policy there may be substantial and conscientious disagreement among them. The basic facts are that individuals are very diverse in terms of their interests. People's interests are diverse because of their different natural talents, because they are raised in different sectors of society and because they are raised in societies where there is a diversity of cultural backgrounds. Partly as a consequence of the fact that people are raised in different sectors of society and in distinct cultural milieus, they are likely to have deep cognitive biases when they attempt to understand other people's interests and how they are compared to their own interests. The question that has to be answered is whether the West now allied with the European Union and other freedom loving countries are to be jettisoned in favor of authoritarian system which promises quick results but no dissention in policy making. Apart from ideological differences Bangladesh risks to be isolated from the West whose assistance is needed at every step of the way. In can, be argued that close relations with China does not have to be at the cost of relations with the West. Throughout history minorities have faced discriminations, of different forms, based on language, clans, tribes, and most importantly religion. Intra-religion conflicts have been known throughout history. Famous are the conflicts among the Christians-the Protestants and the Catholics. Intra-Christians, the most famous one, is the revolt against the Pope by Martin Luther giving rise to Catholics and non-Catholic division. Other factors emerged to divide the Christianity like the annulments sought by King Henry the Eighth from the Pope revolting in the separation of the English branch of Christianity. Linguistic differences also not only led to dissension among the people of the same region but also led to the creation of a new state. Bangladesh was created mainly because Urdu and Bengali were separate languages and had separate script. The languages were so different that one could not the read or write the other. But then politico-economic reasons were there too. Bangladesh felt that this part of the country was being milked for the benefit of the other. Then again linguistic differences are not uncommon in different countries of the world. There are 22 major languages in India, written in 13 different scripts, with over 720 dialects. The official Indian languages are Hindi (with approximately 420 million speakers) and English, which is also widely spoken. In addition, several states in India have their own official languages, which are usually only spoken particular areas. As per 2011 Census of India languages by highest number of speakers are as follows: Hindi, Bengali, Marathi, Telugu, Tamil, Gujarati, Urdu, Kannada, Odia, and Malayalam. 22 languages are accepted by Indian Constitution. In Belgium spoken languages are—French and Dutch. In short differences in languages do not constitute a government or a state. Nor does ethnicity. What makes a nation then? Britannica defines a nation state as a territorially bounded sovereign polity—i.e., a state —that is ruled in the name of a community of citizens who identify themselves as a nation. The legitimacy of a nation-state’s rule over a territory and over the population inhabiting it stems from the right of a core national group within the state (which may include all or only some of its citizens) to self-determination. So why was religion the main determinant in the Partition of British ruled Indian sub-continent? What caused was the predominance of Hindus over Muslim population in India? Was the political ambition of the leaders of Indian Congress Party and the Muslim League? Govt of India made first Census in 1951 when India’s population was 361,088,090 an increase of 13.31% in Ten years or an average increase of 1.33126 % per year or 2.986 % between 1941 and 1947. Muslim population was considerably less than the Hindu population leading to a conclusion that Muslims would always be under the rule of Hindus. Congress Party leader Man Shankar Ayar (It was not Nehru who cut Jinnah’s chances of becoming PM—August 17 2020) opined that 'since almost the morrow of Muslim League’s resolution of March 23 1940 the Congress had been attempting to persuade Jinnah and his League not to press for Pakistan. Instead, Mohammed Ali Jinnah told the press, 'Mr. Gandhi's conception of 'Independent India' is basically different from ours'. Given this background of two divisions-Muslim League and Congress- ha d already been created defacto it is pointless to bring about the Hindu-Muslim divide after decades of majority-minority rule practiced throughout the world despite the unfairness it entails. Neil Ferguson (Senior Fellow at the Hoover Institution at Stanford University and a Senior Faculty Fellow at the Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs at Harvard University) used the words 'historical evidence of technological innovation, religious effects, and economic differences, among other factors, to explain why the West, and Western Europe especially, was the dominant force in the world for centuries' He added that The West used to be hugely powerful. That was not because of chance. It was because of distinct traits that made the West more innovative and intrepid than the rest of the world'. It is debatable: what factors led to the Narendra Modi’s Victory in the elections: is it his muscularity vis-à-vis China and Pakistan or the benefits the common people got from his domestic reforms or was it his Hindutva philosophy which he has been preaching as a ' pracharak' from his young age or the amalgamation of all these factors. Sashi Tharor Congress Party leader, explains that Hinduism is a rich religion brimming with multifariousness. As opposed to the Semitic religions – Judaism, Christianity and Islam, the most well-known faiths in the Western world have some beliefs in common: every one of the three, for instance, accept that there’s just a single God and that he’s an existent and immaterial being. A genuine devotee must acknowledge that basic tenet. Hinduism, with regards to the mentioned tenet, is a totally contrasting religion. In opposition to their monotheistic partners, Hindus affirm the existence of several divine beings. That makes Hinduism a profoundly individual-specific faith that differs from one adherent to another'. The shift in India’s attitude towards Muslims has been there for centuries ever since the Muslims started invading India. This is the first time that Hindu population have voted BJP as a single majority political party with a group of people capable and willing to implement an anti-Muslim agenda. Such activities are in violation on the Constitution contrary to the oath taken by the Council of Ministers, and harmful to the image of India carved out by the predecessors are of little importance when President Trump at Allahabad meeting termed it as the internal affairs of India. Indian Congress Party leader Sashi Tharoor in his book Why I am a Hindu writes 'In 1989, the BJP adopted Hindutva as its official ideology. The BJP or Indian People’s Party has been ruling since 2014. From the beginning of their assuming of power, the nation has seen a flare-up of insularity which would’ve been incomprehensible to its Hindu ancestors. The BJP is focused on Hindutva, signifying 'Hinduness.'' Tharoor traced the thought to a previously developed one of the mid-twentieth century by Vinayak Savarkar, a government official, and essayist who promoted the idea of Hinduness with his 1923 book Essentials of Hindutva. Conclusion Recently President Joe Biden addressing the troops spoke of the threats posed globally but he assured them of the superiority of the US military strength through out the world. Such assurance sidelines the age of multi-polarity that has already arrived. US suzerainty since the end of the World War II does not exist anymore. One may recall President Biden’s statement of November 2020, 'We need to be aligned with the other democracies so that we can set the rules of the road instead of having China and others dictate outcomes because they are the only game in town.' The problem may arise like Thucydides Trap due to inexperience of Xi-Jin Ping in dealing with the likes of Cold War of the US-Soviet era when both parties knew when and how to deal with adversary. One can only hope that the extinction of humanity would be avoided at any cost.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWeOk1RnKHsv5Sms0NF0o9qz	2025-01-11T15:36:16-08:00	
African Union’s Summit Leaves Little Hope To Advance Agricultural...	Perhaps it was the most crucial summit held on January 9th to 11th in 2025 with a focus to raise agricultural productivity, increase public investment in agriculture, and stimulate economic growth through agriculture-led development, and ultimately seeks pathways to support African countries eliminate continent-wide hunger and reduce growing poverty. During these past several years, African governments have taken delight in increasing imports of basic agricultural produce which could be cultivated locally. Import substitution policy is seemingly not part of any discussions during their ministerial meetings, instead devoted time on how to approve huge budgets for agricultural products from foreign sources. It has also taken the African Union (AU) years to initiate an agricultural programme directed at ensuring food security and cutting poverty in the continent. This cutting-edge initiative forms an integral part of the broad AU Agenda 2063. Considered as the most ambitious and comprehensive agricultural reform effort ever undertaken in Africa, it was first launched in 2003 following the Maputo Declaration and reaffirmed in 2014 in Equatorial Guinea with the Malabo Declaration. It has emerged as the cornerstone framework for driving agricultural transformation across Africa and represents a fundamental shift toward development that is supposed to be fully owned and directed by various African governments. That however, the early January Kampala summit, attended by Ministers of Agriculture from the AU's 55-member states, throughly deliberated on implementing aspects of the 10-year programme, primarily to be pursued, in different stages, by stimulating investment, fostering partnerships, and empowering vulnerable smallholder farmers. Notably, the programme is set to run from 2026- 2035. Without a single doubt, the drafting the programme which underwent a rigorous review process, took a full decade to complete. From 2014, in Equatorial Guinea with the Malabo Declaration to Kampala, Uganda, in 2025. And that what is appropriately referred to as an effective continental organization - the African Union. The drafting of the strategy was undertaken by a broad spectrum of stakeholders including the Regional Economic Communities, African experts and researchers, farmers' cooperatives and organizations, development partners, parliamentarians, private sector groups, women in agriculture and youth groups. According to the official release indicated that Africa's food security remains a pressing challenge, exacerbated by climate change, conflicts, rapid population growth, and economic disruptions. Currently, over 280 million Africans suffer from chronic hunger while food systems struggle to meet rising demands. Therefore, the 10-year programme is planned to address these issues by promoting climate-resilient agriculture, improving infrastructure, reducing food waste, and enhancing regional trade in agricultural goods. This is in a bid to equip Africa to feed itself sustainably. At the Kampala ministerial meeting, Prime Minister of the Republic of Uganda, Robinah Nabbanja, while recalling important statistics that point to the richness of African soils, abundance of arable land and fresh water, and a 60% population engaged in agriculture, expressed the highest shame that the continent's food imports cost up to US$100 billion. 'This summit should come up with concrete proposals on how Africa can come out of such an undesirable situation. For us to guarantee our future as Africans, we must feed ourselves,' she told the gathering in a tectonic language. The Commissioner for Agriculture, Rural Development, Blue Economy and Sustainable Environment at the African Union Commission, Ambassador Josefa Sacko, commented on the importance of the strategy, saying it 'aims to boost food production, expand value addition, boost intra-Africa trade, create millions of jobs for the youth and women, build inclusive agrifood value chains, and build resilient and sustainable agrifood systems that will withstand shocks and stressors now and in the future. Furthermore, we are dedicated to strengthening governance through evidence-based decision-making and enhancing accountability among all stakeholders. Inclusivity is a fundamental aspect of our approach; we will ensure that women, youth, and marginalized groups have access to resources, thereby facilitating their equitable participation in the agrifood sector.' Dr. Girma Amente, Minister of Agriculture of the Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia, whose Prime Minister Dr. Abiy Ahmed, is the Champion of the Comprehensive Africa Agriculture Development Programme (CAADP) Strategy and Action Plan 2026- 2035, highlighted how Ethiopia has cascaded CAADP into the national agricultural investment plan (NAIP). 'The plan emphasizes the importance of increasing public investment in agriculture, which is crucial for achieving the CAADP target. Ethiopia has significantly increased its agricultural budget allocation and has demonstrated its commitment by meeting the 6 % annual growth target of CAADP. The implementation of the National Agricultural Investment Plan (NAIP) has contributed to consistent improvements in annual agricultural production, elevating both crop yields and overall food and livestock production, and also performed better in addressing the resilience targets of the CAADP,' explained Girma Amente. In his turn, Uganda's Minister of Agriculture, Animal Industry and Fisheries, Frank Tumwebaze, who led the drafting of the CAADP Strategy and Action Plan in his capacity as the Chair of the Specialised Technical Committee of the AU on Agriculture, Rural Development, Water and Environment, stressed the need to move into implementation of the strategy, as soon as the summit ends. 'The planning phase of the Kampala CAADP Agenda ends during this Summit. We must, therefore, move into implementation and execution mode. It is by focusing on execution that we can make a meaningful impact to the continent and its people. We must move, not with the times, but ahead of times. This calls for advances in technological research and practices, building agricultural systems that are resilient to climate change and other shocks, agro-industrialization, and the like,' according to Frank Tumwebaze. The three-day Extraordinary Summit in Kampala was organized to adopt the 10-Year CAADP Strategy and Action Plan to advance agricultural transformation and food systems in Africa. But that was dominated by high-level speeches, with little hope of concretely addressing key questions relating to ensuring food security in the continent. Majority of African countries holds steadfastly to maintain the status quo, ready to allocate large part of their annual budgets to increase imports. There was little hope for any significant results and remarkable change in driving agricultural transformation across Africa after second day of the summit, dedicated to deliberations by Ministers of Foreign Affairs, and the 11th January meeting by Heads of State and Government.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWeOk1RnKHsv5RJBvza5r3Ie	2025-01-11T15:33:43-08:00	
Joseph Aoun To Visit Saudi Arabia On First Official Trip	By Najia Houssari New Lebanese President Joseph Aoun’s first official overseas trip will be to Saudi Arabia, he said on Saturday. It came during during a phone call with Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, the president’s office said. The crown prince called to congratulate Aoun and invited him to visit the Kingdom, the Lebanese presidency and Saudi Press Agency said. Aoun said that Saudi Arabia would be his first destination 'in recognition of the Kingdom’s historical role in supporting Lebanon and standing in solidarity with it, and as an affirmation of Lebanon’s deep Arab identity as the foundation of its relations with its regional surroundings,' his office said. During the call, the crown prince conveyed King Salman’s and his congratulations on Aoun’s election and his swearing-in as president. The crown prince wished 'success to Aoun and the brotherly Lebanese people, as well as further progress and prosperity.' Aoun thanked the crown prince for Saudi Arabia’s stances toward Lebanon and its people. In his first statement after assuming office, Aoun told visitors on Saturday that he 'did not come to engage in politics but to build a state that can only be established on justice and equality among all its components, which share one identity.' Speaking to a delegation from Dar Al-Fatwa headed by Grand Mufti Sheikh Abdel Latif Derian, Aoun said: 'The responsibility does not lie solely on me, and this is not just my term; it is the term of every Lebanese, regardless of their position or sect. 'We have great and numerous opportunities, and the world has begun discussing conferences in support of Lebanon, but it depends on us to demonstrate to these countries the extent of our credibility in building the state. 'We are not building a state for sects; Lebanon as a state protects everyone; the state of sects does not ensure protection.' Aoun added: 'There are no winners or losers; rather, we have a great opportunity that we either seize or lose. 'We have seen what has happened recently, and everyone has been affected. This country, its people and future generations have suffered enough.' Aoun expressed his hope that the new government would be formed as quickly as possible, 'allowing us to begin building bridges of trust with the outside world.' He said: 'We must seek the assistance of the outside world, not use it to gain strength against our people. No sect or individual is superior to another.' In his speech, Grand Mufti Derian thanked the Arab and friendly states that helped Lebanon 'emerge from the dark tunnel and end the presidential vacancy.' He said: 'We are an essential component of the state, and what we seek is to achieve a balance between the components of Lebanese society. 'We want to feel that we live in a state governed by justice, law, the constitution and the Taif Agreement,' he added. In Damascus, Caretaker Prime Minister Najib Mikati held talks on his first official visit to Syria following the fall of Bashar Assad’s regime. He held an extensive meeting with the leader of the new administration, Ahmad Al-Sharaa. Al-Sharaa told a press conference at the People’s Palace: 'We are giving ourselves an opportunity to build positive relations in the upcoming stages based on the sovereignty of Lebanon and Syria. 'We will maintain neutrality toward all parties in Lebanon and will try to resolve issues. 'The priority for Syria at this time is to ensure the security of the nation and to confine weapons to the hands of the Syrian state.' He said: 'Our objective is to establish positive relations between the Syrian and Lebanese peoples based on mutual respect, and the sovereignty of both countries, and Syria will strive to address all issues through dialogue.' Al-Sharaa’s meeting with Mikati focused on smuggling and Syrian deposits in Lebanese banks, he added. 'We also raised the issue of demarcating the borders between the two countries.' Mikati called for 'activating the relations between the two countries based on the national sovereignty of each and working to prevent anything that could harm the relationship. 'Syria represents Lebanon’s natural gateway to the Arab world, and as long as it is well, Lebanon will also be well,' he added. The caretaker prime minister also addressed the issue of Syrian refugees in Lebanon, describing it as an 'urgent matter.' Lebanon must 'promptly and facilitate their return to Syria, as this matter exerts significant pressure on Lebanon, and I have sensed an understanding of this situation,' Mikati said. Meanwhile, Parliament Speaker Nabih Berri received a phone call from French President Emmanuel Macron, who congratulated him on the election of the president. Macron highlighted France’s commitment to 'continuing its support for Lebanon in all fields, especially the Lebanese army, and to implementing the ceasefire agreement in southern Lebanon.' He said that he would visit Lebanon 'very soon.' President Aoun received congratulatory messages on his election from Kuwait’s Emir Sheikh Meshal Al-Ahmad Al-Jaber Al-Sabah, who highlighted his 'keenness to strengthen the historic and distinguished relations between the two countries,' as well as UAE President Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed Al-Nahyan; UAE Vice President and Prime Minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al-Maktoum; UAE Vice President Sheikh Mansour bin Zayed Al-Nahyan; and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan. In southern Lebanon, the Lebanese army began redeploying in the towns of Al-Qaouzah, the outskirts of Ramyeh, Tayr Harfa, Wadi Ain Al-Zarqa and Al-Batishiyeh in Tyre district after the Israeli army withdrew as part of the ceasefire agreement with Hezbollah. The army is expected to complete its deployment in the towns of Yaroun, Maroun Al-Ras, Aitaroun, Blida, Mays Al-Jabal, Houla, Markaba and Odaisseh this week. Israeli forces that had infiltrated the area carried out an operation involving the demolition of several houses in the town of Aita Al-Shaab in the Bint Jbeil district.	https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWeOk1RnKHsv5Zl7ON-xCkAw	2025-01-11T15:31:51-08:00
